At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Stanton Dodge, Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nStanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical facts constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility for updating forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties, and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. During the call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in our annual report on Form 10-K filed today with the SEC and in our earnings presentation which is available on our Web site at investors.draftkings.com. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open up the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I would like to let everyone know that we published our first ESG report on Monday, February 22. The purpose of this report is to share with our stakeholders how we think about different environmental, social and governance factors, and highlight those that are most relevant to our business. We are committed to creating a long-term positive impact for our stakeholders and ensuring that we are aligned with our shareholders. Our Board and management team are also committed to further integrating ESG considerations into how we set and reach our goals.  The report discusses the key ESG topics that impact our operations and stakeholders. These topics include, among others, human capital management and responsible gaming. Our business success is driven by our highly skilled workforce. We believe it is very important to create and foster a culture of inclusion and belonging that makes each of our employees feel engaged, empowered and safe.  In addition, DraftKings became a flagship brand by providing a responsible way for gaming and sports enthusiasts to interact with our products, and we continue to lead and innovate in all areas of responsible gaming. Our ESG report is posted on our Investor Relations site. This is the first step of our ESG journey. We look forward to working together to achieve meaningful environmental, social and governance progress.  On today's call, we will cover the following topics. First, I will share some insights into our accomplishments for the full-year and fourth quarter. Next, I will provide an update on our recent state launches. Third, I will provide an update on the migration to our in-house proprietary sports betting engine as well as updates on some other important marketing and product-related initiatives.  2020 was a remarkable year for DraftKings. I couldn't be more proud of our employees for all their hard work and contributions to our success. The excitement and pride we have for our company\u2019s success over the last year is balanced with the recognition of how fortunate we are to be able to make such statements.  Our priority continues to be the health and safety of our global workforce and their families. The successes achieved by DraftKings in 2020 would not have been possible without our employees, all of whom were impacted by COVID, including some who lost family members. Each and every one of our employees played incredible fortitude and flexibility.  Our list of accomplishments in 2020 is impressive. We completed the business combination with SBTech and became a publicly traded company in April. We are well on our way to completing the integration of the two companies from a team organization and business standpoint, and are progressing with the migration to our own in-house sports betting engine, which we expect will be complete by the end of the third quarter in 2021.  We also completed capital raises in June and October, raising net proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion. We launched mobile sports betting in Iowa, Colorado, Illinois and Tennessee and iGaming in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. With the Match II in May, we engaged with our customers in new ways to broadcast integrations that showcase live odds for event winners and other in-game markets.  We continued this innovative approach to the content integration we did with other events such as the Match III and the Mike Tyson vs. Roy Jones Jr. boxing match in November. We built relationships with major media companies, including ESPN and Turner Sports, as well as with professional sports teams, including the Chicago Cubs, the New York Giants, the Philadelphia Eagles, the Nashville Predators, the Detroit Pistons, and most recently the Charlotte Hornets.  We also expanded our relationships with major sports leagues and organizations in 2020, including Major League Baseball and the PGA Tour. We strengthened and diversified our Board by welcoming Jocelyn Moore and Valerie Mosley as Board members and Michael Jordan as a special advisor to the Board. And yesterday, we announced the appointment of baseball legend and entrepreneur, Cal Ripken, Jr. as an additional special advisor to the Board of Directors.  Earlier this month, we promoted Jennifer Aguiar to be our Chief Compliance Officer reporting directly to me. Jennifer joined DraftKings in 2016 as Head of Compliance and Risk and led the development of our internal compliance program. As our Chief Compliance Officer, she will be responsible for overseeing corporate compliance and enterprise risk management and will continue to play a pivotal role in our growth. Turning to our financial performance. We exceeded our expectations in 2020. Pro forma revenue grew nearly 50% to $644 million versus $432 million last year. Both MUPs and ARPMUP grew 29% in 2020. We had a strong close to the year with Q4 revenue growing almost 100% year-over-year, and MUPs and ARPMUP growing 44% and 55%, respectively, in the quarter. Revenue for the year was almost $95 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance. These results were due to overperformance in our core business as well as multiple assumptions on external factors that broke our way, such as the sports calendar, the extension of mobile registration, Illinois and better-than-expected whole percentage in online sports book.  Looking ahead, I remain very confident in the continued growth of the online sports betting and iGaming markets in the U.S. Even in a market like New Jersey where we've been live for two-and-a-half years, substantial growth continues. Our handle in New Jersey grew over 100% in 2020, and we are profitable in the state despite the impact of the COVID pandemic. We are raising our revenue outlook for 2021 due to our expectation for continued growth, the outperformance of our core business and newly launched states that were not included in the guidance we shared in November. Jason Park will provide more details in a few minutes.  Turning to new U.S. states for DraftKings and legalization trends. In the fourth quarter, we launched sports betting in Tennessee. In January, Iowans were able to register via our mobile app, rather than in person at a retail casino. We also launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in Michigan and we launched mobile sports betting in Virginia.  As you can see from the Tennessee Lottery\u2019s monthly sports gaming report, the state has gotten off to a very strong start. The state of Tennessee had the best two-month launch in U.S. sports betting history with over $300 million in handle on its first two months of operation, including 38% month-over-month growth in December. As a result, sports betting has also generated several million dollars in tax revenue for the state. As you can tell, Tennessee is off to a great start and we are pleased with our position in the state.  While we've been live in Iowa for more than a year now, the state began to allow mobile registration on January 1, 2021. This change had a significant positive impact. In fact, more customers registered on our app on their mobile devices by 3 PM on January 5 than we registered through the entirety of 2020.  In January, we launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in Michigan and sports betting in Virginia. We continue to be live with mobile sports betting in more states than any other operator. Our launch in Michigan is going very well. Early results are consistent with our goal to always maximize overall user engagement and monetization across our product offerings.  DraftKings achieved 25% share of mobile sports betting handle and GGR and 24% share of iGaming GGR in the first 10 days of a highly competitive market. Our iGaming handle per capita in Michigan on Super Bowl Sunday was 1.9x the average of our iGaming handle per capita in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia on their first Super Bowl. Important to note, these other three states were live in average of 179 days before their first Super Bowl, while Michigan was live for 17 days.  In addition, games created in-house by DraftKings have generated over 75% of our iGaming handle in Michigan. Our sports betting handle per capita in Michigan on Super Bowl Sunday was 1.1x the average of our sports betting handle per capita in 2018 and 2019 launch dates on their first Super Bowl.  These states, which include New Jersey, Indiana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, were live for an average of 118 days before their first Super Bowl. In addition, our cross-selling efforts are really working with 70% of Michigan sports book players also engaging with our iGaming product offering. In Virginia, our sports betting handle per capita on Super Bowl Sunday was 90% of the average of our sports betting handle per capita in our 2018 and 2019 launch dates on their first Super Bowl, despite Virginia being live for only 15 days. As a reminder, those states were live for 118 days on average prior to their first Super Bowl. We are proud to have been one of the first five operators who have launched in Virginia, and we expect it to be a great state for us.  We are now approaching three years since PASPA was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. 23 jurisdictions, representing 41% of the population, have legalized sports betting and 15 jurisdictions, representing 27% of the population, have legalized mobile sports betting, all of which are currently live. DraftKings is now live with online sports betting in 12 states, which is more than any other operator. These 12 states collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population. Six states representing approximately 11% of the U.S. population have legalized some form of iGaming. DraftKings is live in four of these states, representing approximately 10% of the U.S. population. The outlook for further legalization is also very promising.  So far in 2021, 19 state legislators have introduced legislation to legalize online sports betting, five state legislators have introduced legislation to expand their existing sports wagering framework, and one state legislature has introduced legislation to legalize sports betting limited to retail locations. In addition, four states have introduced iGaming legislation and two states have introduced online poker legislation.  I'd now like to comment on our progress with the integration and migration to our own in-house bet engine technology and discuss our new products and content initiatives as well as some of the recent business relationships we have established. I continue to be pleased with the progress we are making with our organizational integration and the migration to our proprietary in-house back-end and trading technology.  Our technology migration is on track to be complete by the end of the third quarter of 2021. Owning our own technology is important. It will help with innovation, speed to market, site stability and availability of markets. We will also realize gross margin synergies associated with the migration, starting in the fourth quarter of this year. We look forward to discussing the migration further at our Investor Day.  In December, we announced an agreement with InComm Payments to launch an industry-first retail gift card. The launch expands DraftKings presence in convenience stores and also enables consumers to gift the DraftKings experience to others in $25 and $50 denominations. It gives our customers another way to fund their accounts and engage with our products, while at the same time expanding our brand across retail locations nationwide.  In January, we furthered our relationship with Turner Sports after the successful broadcast integrations with the Match II and Match III. DraftKings collaborated with Turner to create a first of its kind show which streamed on the Bleacher Report mobile app, YouTube channel and Twitter feeds. Customer engagement was tremendous and shows the strong demand that is developing for sports betting content and device.  In the first 24 hours of streaming, the DraftKings Prop Reveal show received over 1 million views across the app and social handles. 16,000 people made comments on the video during the live stream, placing it second in terms of engagement for videos in this app\u2019s history.  We also reached an agreement with the NFL to expand our daily fantasy sports and content partnership to Canada. Previously, this marketing and content deal was limited to the United States. Our announcement earlier this month of an expanded deal further deepens our relationship with the NFL.  Turning to the Super Bowl. DraftKings offer fans a FREE-to-play fourth quarter prop pool called the $55 million Prediction Challenge, which was featured during our in-game Super Bowl commercials. This promotion, which is our biggest free pool ever with over 1 million entrants, gave the Super Bowl audience a fun free way to get in on the excitement of the Super Bowl.  We have more people engaged with our apps on Super Bowl Sunday by entering the free pool or DFS contests or placing a sports bet or casino wager than on any day in DraftKings history. We also acquired more new paying players on Super Bowl Sunday than any previous day in our history.  Our investments in developing mobile apps that offer a consistent and engaging user experience continue to pay off. I am pleased to report that we have maintained the highest DFS App Store ratings for both iOS and Android, as well as the highest iOS rating for casino and sports book.  As sports betting and iGaming continue to expand across the United States, we are excited that DraftKings sports book and casino apps will soon be available to download for Android users via the Google Play Store. Starting March 1, Google is expanding the number of countries where developers can publish licensed real money gaming apps to include the United States.  I will now turn the call over to DraftKings CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our fourth quarter results and how we are currently thinking about 2021.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we will be discussing our results on a combined company pro forma basis to improve comparability as if the business combination had closed on January 1, 2019. Pro forma means that we are including B2B for the year ended December 31 for both 2019 and 2020, rather than just from April 24 through December 31, 2020.  We are pleased to announce that we generated 644 million in revenue for the full-year, representing a 49% increase versus fiscal year 2019 revenue of 432 million. Q4 revenue was 322 million, representing a 98% increase versus Q4 2019 revenue of 163 million. These incredible results were despite the impact that COVID-19 had on our business in 2020, in particular in Q2.  Our B2C business, which includes our core product offerings of daily fantasy sports, online sports book and iGaming performed extremely well this year as we launched OSB in four new states in iGaming in two new states. In addition, as Jason mentioned, we are continuing to see triple digit year-over-year growth in New Jersey handle, even though we have been live for two and a half years, which really speak to the continued adoption of these exciting product offerings.  Our B2C business generated $539 million for the full-year, representing a 67% increase versus prior year and Q4 revenue of 291 million, representing 122% growth. B2C monthly unique payers in the quarter increased 44% year-over-year to 1.5 million. The increase reflects strong unique payer retention and acquisitions across DFS, OSB and iGaming.  For the full-year of 2020, MUPs increased 29% which includes the impact of COVID-19 on our MUPs for sports book and DFS primarily during the second quarter and early in the third quarter. Average revenue per monthly unique payer or ARPMUP up was $65 in Q4, representing a 55% increase versus the same period in 2019.  Our ARPMUP was positively impacted by increased engagement with our iGaming and online sports book product offerings and our excellent cross-selling capabilities. For the full-year of 2020, ARPMUP also increased 29%.  Our B2B business generated $105 million for the full-year, down just 3 million versus prior year and was flat in Q4 versus prior year. Our B2B business in 2020 was heavily impacted by COVID, as revenue declined 7 million in Q2. And once sports resumed in Q3, we experienced 5% growth in the second half of the year.  Our revenue exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance by almost $95 million. Roughly 50 million of the beat was due to assumptions about market factors that broke our way. Of this 50 million, around 20 million was due to a more favorable than anticipated sports calendar, particularly for the NBA and college sports and the extension of mobile registration in Illinois.  Roughly 30 million was due to our OSB hold percentage being higher than we forecast. The remaining 45 million of the beat was due to over performance in our core business as a result of uniquely productive customer acquisitions, great customer engagement and cross-selling, our Q3 marketing spend paying back more than expected and a strong launch in Tennessee.  We generated $359 million of gross profit dollars on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the entire business in the full-year, representing a 15% increase versus fiscal year 2019. We generated 188 million of gross profit dollars in Q4, a 59% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2019.  Gross margin rate for the business declined as expected. As we have noted in the past, our gross margin rate has been impacted and will continue to be impacted by a mix shift out of our more mature and thus higher margin DFS product offering and into our higher growth rate and currently lower margin OSB and iGaming product offerings. In addition, gross margin rate within a period is impacted by promotional intensity, typically most intense when a new state launches and at the beginning of a major sports season as we aim to acquire customers.  Gross margin rates will be positively impacted by the conversion to our own bet engine in the back half of 2021. GAAP gross margin rates declined more than our adjusted gross margin rate. This is due to the amortization of acquired intangibles related to the business combination. Our general and administrative and product and technology costs on an adjusted EBITDA basis were 154 million and 125 million, respectively, as we invested to achieve scale in our back office functions such as finance and accounting, legal and human resources, as well as continuing to invest in our products.  For the quarter, we spent 52 million and 39 million, respectively, which includes bonus accrual and payroll taxes on LTIP vesting. Our 2020 sales and marketing expenses were 475 million, which include our external marketing. External marketing was higher than prior year as we launched mobile sports betting in Iowa, Colorado, Illinois, and Tennessee and iGaming in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  Additionally, we continue to see accretive LTV to CAC opportunities, which allowed us to invest deeper in marketing, in part due to the stay at home nature of COVID and the unique sports calendar in the third quarter in particular.  For Q4, we invested 184 million on sales and marketing versus 63 million in Q4 2019. A key driver of the $121 million increase was our external marketing investment in states that were live for their first full Q4, including Pennsylvania, Iowa, Illinois, Colorado, as well as our launch in Tennessee.  Adjusted EBITDA for the year was a negative 396 million. Adjusted EBITDA does not include one-time and non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation and transaction-related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a negative 88 million as we rolled out our new state playbook in multiple jurisdictions, and continued to invest in our product technology and G&A functions.  In the quarter, we expensed $180 million in items that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA but are included in GAAP net income, notably 149 million for stock-based compensation and 31 million for amortization of acquired intangibles, depreciation and other amortization, and transaction-related expenses. Our stock-based compensation expense reflects the vesting of RSUs as a result of our strong stock performance in 2020.  Moving on to our balance sheet and liquidity. We are well capitalized to execute our multi-year plan and address our key priorities of taking advantage of this unique time for customer acquisition, entering new states as they legalize, continuing to lead the market on product innovation, and exploring opportunistic and creative M&A. We ended the year with $1.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet and no debt.  Looking forward to 2021, on our third quarter earnings call in November, we introduced a range for our 2021 revenue of $750 million to $850 million. Given our strong finish to 2020 and the underlying acquisition, engagement and retention of our players, as well as our recent launches in Michigan and Virginia, we are increasing our guidance to 900 million to 1 billion of revenue for 2021, which equates to year-over-year growth of 40% to 55% and a 19% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance.  The increase reflects strong performance in Q4, which has continued in Q1 2021, substantial user activation due to our 2020 marketing spend and the launch of mobile sports betting in Michigan and Virginia and iGaming in Michigan. We assume that all professional and college sports calendars that have been announced come to fruition and that we continue to operate in the states in which we are alive today.  These states collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population for mobile sports betting and 10% of the U.S. population for iGaming. The range also assumes that the Governor of Illinois does not extend the suspension of the in-person registration requirement. Future revenues and marketing spend will be higher for each month Illinois chooses to extend the suspension.  We expect both MUPs and ARPMUP to grow in 2021, with MUPs increasing at a higher rate than ARPMUP. Regarding our 2021 quarterly revenue cadence, all things being equal, which means no new states launch beyond Michigan and Virginia, we expect Q1 and Q2 to be about equal as a percentage of full-year revenue in the lower 20% range with Q1 slightly higher than Q2. Q3 is expected to be close to 20% of full-year revenue. We currently expect the fourth quarter to account for slightly more than 35% of our revenue for the year. While we are not providing guidance for 2021 adjusted EBITDA, sales and marketing expense is the key input. Sales and marketing in older vintage states will begin to moderate, but 2020 and 2021 vintage states will have increased sales and marketing as we execute our new states playbook and lap partial years in 2020. The net effect is that we expect to spend more on marketing in 2021 compared to 2020.  From a quarterly perspective, we expect our adjusted EBITDA loss to be widest in Q3 followed by Q1. The first quarter will be impacted by our launches in Michigan and Virginia in the third quarter by the start of the NFL season.  We expect our second quarter loss to be better than Q1 and our fourth quarter loss will be the smallest as we benefit from higher seasonal revenue. As a reminder, our marketing spend is impacted by the launch of new states. Our spend is also highly flexible and can be reduced or paused altogether if this sports calendar shifts.  That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line up for questions.\nStanton Dodge: Operator, you can open the line up for questions, please. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Sigdahl from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.\nRyan Sigdahl: Great. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the strong results and business trends.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nRyan Sigdahl: Very helpful commentary on guidance for 2021. Just high level thinking EBITDA on a dollar basis directionally flattish, better, worse, anything you can comment there? And then we'll kind of back in to all the other details between there.\nJason Robins: We're not providing guidance for EBITDA in 2021, just top line guidance. The reason we're not providing guidance is it's hard to predict what new states will open up. And also we generally are flexible in terms of how we flex up or down our customer acquisition investment, depending on how results are coming in. So it's really tough for us to guide to that at this point. For that reason, we are choosing not to.\nRyan Sigdahl: Gotcha. Gotcha. Then I appreciate the color on New Jersey. I believe I caught right that state level contribution margin is positive, just to confirm that? And then secondly, how are you seeing other states ramp? Similar path, better, worse in Michigan, Tennessee, Virginia, some of these newer ones expect better than kind of the New Jersey cadence?\nJason Robins: You're correct. New Jersey was contribution positive in 2020, and that was despite no sports or no traditional sports that we saw for a few months in Q2 and late Q1. I think it would have been even better have we had a full sports calendar for the year, although we did make some of that back up in the back half of the year with strong performance in some additional sports games on NBA and NHL that wouldn't have otherwise been played at that time of the year. As far as the other states, it's definitely been a variety. I think if you look at sort of the average, it's quite similar to what we're seeing in New Jersey on a per capita basis. But certainly, there's variation state to state. Michigan, in particular, was very strong on both sports betting and iGaming. Tennessee was pretty strong. Virginia was close to New Jersey, but not quite. But I think Virginia also, it's a bit of a different setup, because it launched around the same time with Michigan. It didn't have iGaming, but certainly did contribute in Virginia. And unlike Tennessee, it launched for us at least the day of the Conference Championship Game. So we only got a little bit at the tail end of the NFL in there whereas Tennessee launched in Q4. So we have quite a bit of ramp to be able to acquire customers and generate revenue during NFL.\nRyan Sigdahl: Great. One more quick one for me and then I'll hop back in the queue. Just on the SBTech and tech integration. Are you planning to do a partial conversion in state by state or are you planning to go all live? And then have you started this process where you have anything to point to? Thanks and good luck. Congrats on the results again.\nJason Robins: Thank you. So what we have been doing is we've done a pilot in Ireland. That was not necessarily, for any reason, other than just to get our team accustomed to the new interface and be able to use the tools and all those sorts of things. And the next step we'll be doing is we're going to choose a state in the U.S. to do a launch and make sure everything's working and work out any kinks. And at that point, we'll be comfortable rolling it out to the rest of the country.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nJed Kelly: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Two if I may. Just Jason, one on product. I mean, some of your competitors are offering same game parlays and another one has thought around lightning bet. So how do you think about product differentiation? And then just on the guidance, if you look back in 2019, New Jersey had a pretty significant March around the NCAA tournament. So how should we be factoring in the NCAA tournament around the cadence between 1Q and 2Q? Thank you.\nJason Robins: The question you asked on product, this underscores exactly why we thought it was so important to have our own in-house technology and trading platform, which we acquired along with the business combination back in April of last year. I think this is like, you mentioned same game parlays, that's something that we look to add hopefully shortly after migrating this NFL season, maybe at the migration, depending on the timing of it, but we want to have that ready for this NFL season at the point of migration. And I think one of the reasons that we feel like we've been doing so well on iGaming is we have been actually innovating on products, launching our own games, as we mentioned, more than three quarters of our games in Michigan \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, more than three quarters of our revenue in Michigan were generated off of DraftKings in-house created game. And we haven't migrated yet. So while we've been very pleased and have only positive things to say about Kambi, our current partner, we do think that there's just no substitute for a company like ours. It\u2019s a great product and technology-driven between having a reliance on a third-party versus having full control over your own product. And I think what we'll see is, first, a couple of things with the migration, but really it's going to be about what we do over the next year or two or three. Like this is an area I feel very confident that we will generate meaningful progress in over the next few years. It's what we do and really core to our DNA. So I'm excited about it. And I think it's going to be something that we'll really start to be able to talk more about in the back half of the year.\nJed Kelly: Is that on the NCAA tournament?\nJason Robins: Sorry. Can you ask the question one more time?\nJed Kelly: Just if you look back in 2019, New Jersey had a pretty solid month around March Madness and the NCAA tournament. Just how are you figure-factoring in the NCAA tournament in 1Q relative to 2Q?\nJason Robins: I\u2019m going to let Jason Park answer any more granularity. But I will say at a high-level, this is one of the real key times for betters, it's a very popular thing to bet on. It's actually quite different than fantasy. For fantasy, college basketball, college sports, in general, while certainly there's some activity that spikes during the NCAA tournament, it's nothing like we see in betting. So with so many new states, I think, you'll see a lot more there. Jason, I don't know if you want to add anything specific beyond that. But I think that that's the high level how I would describe it.\nJason Park: Yes. And hey, Jed, great to hear your voice. I agree. I mean, we've certainly thought a lot about March Madness. A, part of the tournament will be in Q1, part of it will be in Q2. We've thought about that. And when we look back, we've only had one state with OSB live for March Madness, given the canceled event last year. So we've incorporated that all into the guidance that we provided today.\nJed Kelly: Thank you, and congrats on the results.\nJason Robins: Thank you, Jed.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Chaiken from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nBen Chaiken: Hey. How\u2019s it going?\nJason Robins: Hi, Ben.\nBen Chaiken: I know you mentioned on March \u2013 hey, how\u2019s it going? I know you mentioned on March 1, there's a unique opportunity, right, with Google Play allowing iGaming and OSB apps -- sorry, not OSB apps, but iGaming and OSB apps. I guess with the understanding that maybe 40% of U.S. smartphones or Androids, is there any way to specifically target those customers? Or do you think that they were already using some workaround? Just any thought there?\nJason Robins: Sure. So there's a couple of things. First, Google Play does have an advertising product that if you don't have an app in Google Play, obviously it doesn't make sense to use. So just like we spent on iAds and the App Store, we expect to acquire customers via that channel once we're able to launch. Secondly, we do have people that side load the app now. It's a little bit of a clunky experience. You get like a message saying something along the lines of this is not safe or not approved. And so there's a -- it's a little bit of a clunky experience. It's not the easiest UI. So I think that should improve in terms of more people having Android -- that have Android phones, having the app on their phone, and even amongst the existing customers. Although I would say, probably the majority of customers now have figured out how to side load the app through some of the UIs that we built. A couple more points I'd make. One is, we talked a lot about our highest rated products in both iOS and Android on VFS and for iOS in the App Store on online sports book and iGaming. The reason we don't mention it on Android is it's not in the Google Play Store. So very important to us is to deliver a quality product. We think we have one and we look forward to getting feedback and ratings on that, which will hopefully help solidify our reputation as having a strong product. Secondly, there will be I think two states, I want to say Michigan and Virginia, that weren't added initially, we're hopeful that they'll get added later. But that does create a bit of a clunky experience as well, because users in those states will still have to side load the app, and it's actually really hard to create a UI that's very state specific on that front. So we're working hard to do it so that we can get live in the states that were approved from March 1, but hopeful that Google will approve those additional states. And what we'd like to ideally see is they just kind of set policy where any state that has legal, regulated sports betting and iGaming is automatically included in the policy.\nBen Chaiken: Got you. That's super helpful. And then one more, if I may. I guess just talk about what you're doing to prepare for Canada. That's hopefully the next major catalyst or addition to the business. I know you mentioned an NFL DFS partnership. Not sure if there's anything else to share or expand on there. Just curious, how you plan to hit the ground running or if there's any stats you can share around penetration and traction in that market?\nJason Robins: Well, you're absolutely right. Canada is going to present a really exciting opportunity should it open up. We see really good progress there, both the federal and province level in Ontario legislatively. Ontario, as you probably know, is the largest province. I believe it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 45% of the population of Canada. So to get any province, that was the one to get first so very excited about that. We're hoping additional provinces follow suit, but haven't really seen whether that is the case yet. I think that first and foremost the legislation had to move along and we're seeing that. There's a lot left up to the regulator. It's a little bit different than U.S. legislation where there's a lot of detail in the legislation in Ontario. It's really kind of a line or two, maybe not quite that little but very much left up to the regulator on what the rules of the road are. So we are waiting for regulations. I know those are being worked on by the Ontario government. So once we get that, we'll have a better sense of what timing could be, what sort of product could look like and things like that. And as far as preparing, you mentioned the NFL -- expansion of our NFL deal in Canada, we're very excited about that. We have been doing marketing in Canada for quite some time. We have a very large daily fantasy sports customer base. Ontario, obviously being our biggest province in terms of customer base, so we feel very well prepared both to convert our existing daily fantasy customer base as well as to expand what we're doing with the existing marketing channels that we utilize in Canada.\nBen Chaiken: Cool. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Graham from Canaccord. Your line is now open.\nMichael Graham: Thanks and congrats on great numbers. I have two questions, the first just on ARPMUP expansion. You mentioned engagement and cross selling. Just wondering, is that really just between your OSB and iGaming products or just what can you tell us about what really drove that? And sort of you mentioned it, you expected ARPMUP to expand but more slowly than players in 2021, but just maybe touch on that. And then I have a follow up. Thanks.\nJason Robins: Thank you. So a few things going to ARPMUP. One is the cross selling and it's really across all of our products, certainly sports book to iGaming is one but we cross sell between all of them. We cross sell DFS. Certainly the sports book and iGaming we cross sell back to DFS from people who get acquired on sports book or iGaming and we cross sell people who get acquired on iGaming to sports book. So I think that it's really -- the way we think about it is we have a platform. We try to target segments of customers to bring them on -- potential customers to bring them on in the most efficient manner possible. And then once they're on the platform, we try to get them to engage with all of our products. And it's really about optimizing across all things that we offer. The other factor in ARPMUP which enables what I just described is just more states opening up. And one of the reasons that we have said that we expect users to expand more than ARPMUP is in our guidance, we have not included any new states that we\u2019re not already in. So last year, obviously, there were several states that launched. And I think if you were to see new states launch in 2021, we would expect faster growth in ARPMUP. But right now, we don't have any line of sight to that. There's obviously a lot of exciting things happening on the legislative front with almost 20 states considering new sports betting legislation to open up and I think four or five -- four I think considering iGaming legislation. So hopefully, we'll get see some of those get done. I don't know, even if they do get done if they\u2019ll launch this year or next year. So once we get more line of sight to that, then we'll be able to have more of a view on how that might impact ARPMUP throughout the year. But right now, in all of our guidance, including your question on ARPMUP, we're not including any of these states.\nMichael Graham: Okay, thanks. And then I just wanted to ask a quick one on college sports. Just what impact do you think college sports had on your performance in Q3, Q4 and sort of how important is that relative to professional sports?\nJason Robins: College sports in sports book are big. They're not that big in daily fantasy sports, but they are really important on sports book. So it certainly was something that we didn't know would happen. We were a little bit conservative in our last couple of quarters\u2019 guidance and thinking through, would we have full college sports calendars? Would we have all conferences playing? At the time, for example, we guided in our Q3 call, at least two of the conferences had basically said they were shutting down the season. They ended up starting, which is great. So it certainly was a boost to see that. And I wouldn't say it was the number one thing, but it was a material factor, sure.\nMichael Graham: Okay. Thank you, Jason.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nThomas Allen: Hi. Good morning.\nJason Robins: Good morning.\nThomas Allen: So when I look at the fourth quarter revenue results, they beat your guidance. But I think some of us expected that to happen, given the strength of the state reported data. But revenue beat the Street by a considerable amount. Do you think we were not appreciating the strength of the DFS business, the Colorado and Tennessee business where data is not, like your market share is not disclosed or the decline in promos? Can you talk about kind of what the strength of those things were?\nJason Robins: So about half of the beat came from things that were assumptions we made that literally all broke our way. Obviously that's not going to happen all the time. And that includes things like full sports calendar being played with no rescheduling into next year of NFL games. We thought there was a possibility that certain games might get moved from Q4 into Q1. It didn't happen. We also saw that, as was mentioned earlier, all college sports were played. The biggest one was hold, came in higher. That's obviously something that can swing either way. And Q3, as you may recall, hold was really bad to start the NFL season and we just barely beat our numbers. So that was a pretty big factor. I think the biggest factor with hold came in higher than expected. And that's just based on sport games outcomes, but not anything we were doing in particular, and I think it was higher across the board for the whole industry. Another one was we did not make the assumption that the Illinois executive order that allowed for mobile registration would get continued. Obviously, that's something that's not within our control and we don't know, so we weren't counting on it. That ended up getting continued not just through the end of the year, but through the Super Bowl and we're hopeful it gets extended again. There's a lot of things that really broke our way. And then the rest of it was business over performance. And as far as your question, Tennessee was definitely a big factor. Tennessee, we didn't know before it launched, but ended up being one of the strongest starts of any state. So that was really great to see. And then I think -- which is why we've been a bit cautious about where we sort of pegged our numbers thinking through the back half of next year. There was a lot of boost I believe. It's impossible to quantify how much. But when I look at our marketing performance in 2020 versus Q4, Q3 of 2019, it was just like off the charts better. And I think it was due to this whole stay at home and people cutting back on other leisure spend and entertainment spend, and having a larger share of the overall entertainment and leisure spent wallet. And I think all of those things may or may not continue. We haven't assumed that they will as things get back to whatever normal it is in the back half hopefully of this year. So we're being a bit cautious there. I think that, in all likelihood, if there was a benefit, it won't last forever. So it's probably not just being cautious, it\u2019s probably being realistic. And I think it was hard \u2013 the thing is I\u2019m saying it's hard to say what's going to happen at the end of this year, the back half of this year, or whenever people kind of start going out to concerts and traveling and all those sorts of things again. I think it\u2019s also hard for us to have known and even hard now to quantify what the impact exactly was of that on Q4 as well as Q3 of last year. So I can't give you an exact number. But what I can tell you is, I'm personally very convinced that there is certainly a lot of things the team did well. We had a lot of great optimizations and things that we figured out on the product and marketing front that led to over performance. So it wasn't entirely that. But I'm sure a good chunk of it was this sort of moment in time. And that's why we were so aggressive on the customer acquisition front. Once you get the data and then you see it's working, we're very flexible and press the gas quickly. And if it's not, we'll go the other way. We're very much driven by what the results in the data are. So, we literally could not, even if we wanted to, hit our cap target on \u2013 I think we were below our cap target on Q3 and Q4. I just kept telling the team trying to find more places to acquire customers. And it was just such great results that we were trying to max out volume as much as we could, but we really couldn't even go any deeper. And we're still well below our cap target. And I don't know if that will be the case this year, at the end of the year, but we'll have to see it. There probably will be some factor or some impact, but really hard to quantify it.\nThomas Allen: Thanks, Jason. You answered my first follow up question, which was it did look like 4Q '21 revenue guidance was conservative, about flattish but I think you gave good color there. So have you seen \u2013 on free play, right? So when we think about the kind of promotional side, have you seen some rationalization on free play? We can see what you're spending on marketing, but it's harder to read into free play.\nJason Robins: Yes. I think that what we're seeing \u2013 you\u2019re talking about like promotional spend or specifically for --\nThomas Allen: Yes, promotional spending. \nJason Robins: So similar to external marketing, advertising spend, we're very much data driven on that and it's seasonal. We're more aggressive on promos in periods where we're more heavily acquiring new customers. And if you look at sort of the breakdown between where promo spend goes, a much higher percentage of new customer gross revenue goes to promos than existing customer. The most aggressive offers are the new customer offers. So what you will see, and you started to see this a little bit in Q4, is as the mix of customers shifts from more new customers to more existing customers, then you will see a natural decline in the rate of promo.\nThomas Allen: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nKevin Rippey: Hi. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Really just two. If you could give any more color about the contribution of iGaming relative to OSB specifically in the states where both are legal in terms of how many -- what percentage of players play both, those kind of things, that'd be really helpful? And then maybe just a little bit more to on the gross margin benefits of iGaming or I guess gross margin differentials between iGaming and sports betting and how we should think about that as we think about the longer-term model. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nJason Robins: So we are cross selling over 50% of our sports betting customers into iGaming. And it's a very important product. I believe it's probably a larger market if there were -- on a state level, it's a larger market, certainly we saw that in Michigan. We're seeing that albeit it\u2019s on a different lifecycle timeline in New Jersey. And I think it's probably safe to say that it's a larger market. We're going to have more color on that. We have an Investor Day coming up in early March that we will talk more about how we view the size of each of the relative market. As far as gross margin impact, it's really hard to say. We don't really allocate promotional dollars by product, because people can use them across the platform. So it's in thinking on like things like payment processing fees. People may deposit and play one particular product first and then play another. So it's hard to say, this deposit should have been allocated to this product or that product. So it's not really something where we see a distinction. We view both iGaming and sports betting as having very similar gross margins, if you kind of don't distinguish, and as I said, it\u2019s sort of impossible to distinguish, where deposit payment processing fees and promotional dollars and things like that are coming in on. They're actually remarkably similar in terms of their margin profile.\nKevin Rippey: All right, great. And maybe just one more. One thing I hear a lot about is on iOS, like the iOS 14 IDFA changes, certainly impact as it relates to that with respect to your app install campaigns or anything on the marketing front that we\u2019re still thinking about that you guys might have to navigate in like the first half of the year?\nJason Robins: I actually don't exactly know the detail on that. But what I can say to you is that we knew about this. We've been preparing for it. We, generally speaking, don't view it as having a massive impact, but it will have some impact. But I think most of what we've done has not really changed based on those regulations.\nKevin Rippey: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nStephen Grambling: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just thinking about the engagement in the app, I guess first, what is the average number of bets your typical customer makes a year? And how long is the average time on device per better login? And then second, as you look across more mature versus new states, how are those two trends, frequency and time spent on device evolving?\nJason Robins: We haven't disclosed anything around average bets or time. We certainly can consider adding some of that material to our Investor Day. But I would be lying to you if I told you I actually knew the answer right off my hand anyway. So beyond not disclosing it, I couldn't tell you but something we can look into and consider talking about on Investor Day. As far as new versus existing states, we\u2019re seeing very similar median and average performance. There is obviously some variation state to state, but virtually across all the metrics we look at, whether it\u2019d be revenue, active players, retention rates, engagement in time and app, average bet, average bet size, it\u2019s actually quite similar if you look at sort of the averages. But there is certainly some variation state to state. Some of it is dependent on which types of products and games are more popular. In Michigan, for example, we saw a much wider gap between the amounts of engagement in iGaming versus OSB versus some of the other states that have both of those products. There is also differences in what sports people bet. College betting is much more popular in West Virginia relative to professional. Still professional is more popular, but the relative gap is quite narrower than you see in certain other states like New Jersey. So it\u2019s definitely variable state to state. But if you kind of look at the averages, it\u2019s quite similar to New Jersey.\nStephen Grambling: That\u2019s helpful. And perhaps as a follow up, you referenced some of the things you\u2019re doing on the content side with Bleacher. More, I guess, broadly would you generally -- how do you evaluate potentially advertising on the app or monetizing user data another way?\nJason Robins: We do take advertising on free to play games. We are not doing that for pay to play games. We think that if you\u2019re paying for a product, you should not have to see ads and we feel more comfortable doing it on free to play games. There is some Web site advertising on the DFS products with the one exception, but the vast majority of it is in free to play games. So that\u2019s the sort of approach that we\u2019ve taken. And right now we are actually turning down ad dollars. We have less inventory between our free to play games and the content that we\u2019re producing than we have demand for advertising. So one of the things we are looking to do is to figure out ways to expand our content footprint and have both more inventory to take ad dollars but also content is a very effective way of acquiring and engaging and monetizing our user base as well. So one of the nice things about it is it has that great synergy as you can make money on the advertising side, but you can also make money by using content to acquire players and activate players and introduce new products and new forms of betting to them.\nStephen Grambling: Makes sense. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the promotional allowances. When we kind of try and triangulate into this, it seems to us that there was a pretty big spread between some of the state reported GGR and what you guys ultimately reported in net revenues for the quarter. So I\u2019m just curious. Did we see or did you see a meaningful sequential change in promotional allowances just -- and some of this may be reporting related, but between what you reported in Q3 and what you actually reported in Q4?\nJason Robins: We definitely had a decline in promotional spend, largely driven by the new customer versus existing customer mix. So Q3 was a huge quarter for a customer acquisition for us with the start of NFL and with NBA, NHL completing their season and going into the Playoffs. So between those things, it was a really great time. There\u2019s also a lot of pent-up demand for online sports betting, given that there is a real lack of traditional sports in Q2. So that certainly was a big factor, just the mix shift between new and existing customers shifting more towards existing customers in Q4, which as we said is going to have a natural downward impact on promotional rate. Also, you mentioned this too. There are definitely differences in state reporting around how promotional dollars are factored into or not factored into the taxable basis. And what we try to do internally is really work at the individual state level to be able to grow the state in a way that is both tax efficient and makes sense from a customer and data perspective in terms of the impact of the promotions we\u2019re running. And sometimes the reporting does sort of -- it is a little bit hard to follow exactly what the promotional spend was from that.\nShaun Kelley: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe like big picture, Jason, just longer term, if we\u2019ve got some volatility and when you do have one of these quarters where you\u2019ve got big new user acquisition or new state launches and then things kind of level out. Just over the long term, is there anything in the data or anything you\u2019re seeing right now that would suggest there is any difference in sort of what your estimated long-term kind of promotional allowance would be? I think we see that number kind of tend to stabilize in like the mid 20s in Europe and some other markets, but just kind of \u2013 long term, is there any difference here really to the model, or is it, look, we\u2019re just in a lot of volatility given where we are in our growth curve?\nJason Robins: I think it\u2019s definitely the latter. We\u2019re going to talk more about this at our upcoming Investor Day in early March. But the punch line is we don\u2019t see any difference in the long-term projection there from what we said in the past. There is going to be a lot of optimization, but by far the largest impact will come from just the natural mix shift from new customers to existing customers as business matures and the rates of promotional spending are most aggressive with the customers. We do, do promotions for existing customers, but they\u2019re far more aggressive with new customers. And simply if we didn\u2019t change a thing, you\u2019d see a significant decline as the business matures. Now what will be interesting is new states will launch and then as we enter those new states and acquire customers, you\u2019re going to see an increase at the state level, which, of course, depending on the quantum of states, in which states, and how big the population base is, it could create fluctuations. But if you just sort of look at it in an existing state as a unit -- at an existing state as a unit, that natural decline will occur simply from the statement sharing in the mix of new customers to existing customer shifting towards existing.\nShaun Kelley: Very helpful. Thank you.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research. Your line is now open.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask you to sort of rank the customer acquisition channels in terms of cost, customer acquisition costs, so from like high to low or low to high. Just wanted to see how -- and also if you could comment on how different those costs are in each channels. That would be super helpful. Thank you. And what drives also the difference, the competitive action. I understand that the life cycle in a particular state is a driver, but also the rest of them would be helpful. Thank you.\nJason Robins: Yes, a good question. We are pretty cautious about how we disclose anything around this, because as you can imagine, this is a real competitive area. Being able to optimize across a number of different marketing channels at scale is something we believe we\u2019re really good at. We\u2019re a very data driven company and we\u2019ve been doing this a long time. So we have a lot of great historical data to rely on. So we\u2019re a little cautious. I think what I can probably answer at a high level, and this will come as no surprise, is television is definitely typically the most expensive channel, but also the highest reach channel. And certainly from a creative standpoint, television ads can -- you can say a lot more in a 30 or 60 over even 15-second ad than you can in a display ad. We\u2019ll typically try to max out digital first since that\u2019s the most efficient and also the easiest to measure. And then to gain additional reach and scale, we go to television and other sorts of offline channels.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jason Robins for any closing remarks.\nJason Robins: Thank you all for joining us on today\u2019s call. We appreciate your insightful questions and look forward to continuing our conversations with you. 2020 was an outstanding year for DraftKings still with many impressive accomplishments. But we also recognized the suffering and challenges that many in our communities have experienced and continue to face.  We\u2019re excited for the future. DraftKings is well positioned with over $1.8 billion in cash to enter new states as soon as practicable, to drive our continued product innovation, acquire customers and explore opportunistic M&A. Matt, Paul, Jason and I are excited to share more insight and information with you at our Investor Day on March 9. We will explore our latest outlook on TAM, sources of competitive differentiation, unit economics and EBITDA at maturity. I hope all of you stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I would like to let everyone know that we published our first ESG report on Monday, February 22. The purpose of this report is to share with our stakeholders how we think about different environmental, social and governance factors, and highlight those that are most relevant to our business. We are committed to creating a long-term positive impact for our stakeholders and ensuring that we are aligned with our shareholders. Our Board and management team are also committed to further integrating ESG considerations into how we set and reach our goals.  The report discusses the key ESG topics that impact our operations and stakeholders. These topics include, among others, human capital management and responsible gaming. Our business success is driven by our highly skilled workforce. We believe it is very important to create and foster a culture of inclusion and belonging that makes each of our employees feel engaged, empowered and safe.  In addition, DraftKings became a flagship brand by providing a responsible way for gaming and sports enthusiasts to interact with our products, and we continue to lead and innovate in all areas of responsible gaming. Our ESG report is posted on our Investor Relations site. This is the first step of our ESG journey. We look forward to working together to achieve meaningful environmental, social and governance progress.  On today's call, we will cover the following topics. First, I will share some insights into our accomplishments for the full-year and fourth quarter. Next, I will provide an update on our recent state launches. Third, I will provide an update on the migration to our in-house proprietary sports betting engine as well as updates on some other important marketing and product-related initiatives.  2020 was a remarkable year for DraftKings. I couldn't be more proud of our employees for all their hard work and contributions to our success. The excitement and pride we have for our company's success over the last year is balanced with the recognition of how fortunate we are to be able to make such statements.  Our priority continues to be the health and safety of our global workforce and their families. The successes achieved by DraftKings in 2020 would not have been possible without our employees, all of whom were impacted by COVID, including some who lost family members. Each and every one of our employees played incredible fortitude and flexibility.  Our list of accomplishments in 2020 is impressive. We completed the business combination with SBTech and became a publicly traded company in April. We are well on our way to completing the integration of the two companies from a team organization and business standpoint, and are progressing with the migration to our own in-house sports betting engine, which we expect will be complete by the end of the third quarter in 2021.  We also completed capital raises in June and October, raising net proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion. We launched mobile sports betting in Iowa, Colorado, Illinois and Tennessee and iGaming in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. With the Match II in May, we engaged with our customers in new ways to broadcast integrations that showcase live odds for event winners and other in-game markets.  We continued this innovative approach to the content integration we did with other events such as the Match III and the Mike Tyson vs. Roy Jones Jr. boxing match in November. We built relationships with major media companies, including ESPN and Turner Sports, as well as with professional sports teams, including the Chicago Cubs, the New York Giants, the Philadelphia Eagles, the Nashville Predators, the Detroit Pistons, and most recently the Charlotte Hornets.  We also expanded our relationships with major sports leagues and organizations in 2020, including Major League Baseball and the PGA Tour. We strengthened and diversified our Board by welcoming Jocelyn Moore and Valerie Mosley as Board members and Michael Jordan as a special advisor to the Board. And yesterday, we announced the appointment of baseball legend and entrepreneur, Cal Ripken, Jr. as an additional special advisor to the Board of Directors.  Earlier this month, we promoted Jennifer Aguiar to be our Chief Compliance Officer reporting directly to me. Jennifer joined DraftKings in 2016 as Head of Compliance and Risk and led the development of our internal compliance program. As our Chief Compliance Officer, she will be responsible for overseeing corporate compliance and enterprise risk management and will continue to play a pivotal role in our growth. Turning to our financial performance. We exceeded our expectations in 2020. Pro forma revenue grew nearly 50% to $644 million versus $432 million last year. Both MUPs and ARPMUP grew 29% in 2020. We had a strong close to the year with Q4 revenue growing almost 100% year-over-year, and MUPs and ARPMUP growing 44% and 55%, respectively, in the quarter. Revenue for the year was almost $95 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance. These results were due to overperformance in our core business as well as multiple assumptions on external factors that broke our way, such as the sports calendar, the extension of mobile registration, Illinois and better-than-expected whole percentage in online sports book.  Looking ahead, I remain very confident in the continued growth of the online sports betting and iGaming markets in the U.S. Even in a market like New Jersey where we've been live for two-and-a-half years, substantial growth continues. Our handle in New Jersey grew over 100% in 2020, and we are profitable in the state despite the impact of the COVID pandemic. We are raising our revenue outlook for 2021 due to our expectation for continued growth, the outperformance of our core business and newly launched states that were not included in the guidance we shared in November. Jason Park will provide more details in a few minutes.  Turning to new U.S. states for DraftKings and legalization trends. In the fourth quarter, we launched sports betting in Tennessee. In January, Iowans were able to register via our mobile app, rather than in person at a retail casino. We also launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in Michigan and we launched mobile sports betting in Virginia.  As you can see from the Tennessee Lottery's monthly sports gaming report, the state has gotten off to a very strong start. The state of Tennessee had the best two-month launch in U.S. sports betting history with over $300 million in handle on its first two months of operation, including 38% month-over-month growth in December. As a result, sports betting has also generated several million dollars in tax revenue for the state. As you can tell, Tennessee is off to a great start and we are pleased with our position in the state.  While we've been live in Iowa for more than a year now, the state began to allow mobile registration on January 1, 2021. This change had a significant positive impact. In fact, more customers registered on our app on their mobile devices by 3 PM on January 5 than we registered through the entirety of 2020.  In January, we launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in Michigan and sports betting in Virginia. We continue to be live with mobile sports betting in more states than any other operator. Our launch in Michigan is going very well. Early results are consistent with our goal to always maximize overall user engagement and monetization across our product offerings.  DraftKings achieved 25% share of mobile sports betting handle and GGR and 24% share of iGaming GGR in the first 10 days of a highly competitive market. Our iGaming handle per capita in Michigan on Super Bowl Sunday was 1.9x the average of our iGaming handle per capita in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia on their first Super Bowl. Important to note, these other three states were live in average of 179 days before their first Super Bowl, while Michigan was live for 17 days.  In addition, games created in-house by DraftKings have generated over 75% of our iGaming handle in Michigan. Our sports betting handle per capita in Michigan on Super Bowl Sunday was 1.1x the average of our sports betting handle per capita in 2018 and 2019 launch dates on their first Super Bowl.  These states, which include New Jersey, Indiana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, were live for an average of 118 days before their first Super Bowl. In addition, our cross-selling efforts are really working with 70% of Michigan sports book players also engaging with our iGaming product offering. In Virginia, our sports betting handle per capita on Super Bowl Sunday was 90% of the average of our sports betting handle per capita in our 2018 and 2019 launch dates on their first Super Bowl, despite Virginia being live for only 15 days. As a reminder, those states were live for 118 days on average prior to their first Super Bowl. We are proud to have been one of the first five operators who have launched in Virginia, and we expect it to be a great state for us.  We are now approaching three years since PASPA was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. 23 jurisdictions, representing 41% of the population, have legalized sports betting and 15 jurisdictions, representing 27% of the population, have legalized mobile sports betting, all of which are currently live. DraftKings is now live with online sports betting in 12 states, which is more than any other operator. These 12 states collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population. Six states representing approximately 11% of the U.S. population have legalized some form of iGaming. DraftKings is live in four of these states, representing approximately 10% of the U.S. population. The outlook for further legalization is also very promising.  So far in 2021, 19 state legislators have introduced legislation to legalize online sports betting, five state legislators have introduced legislation to expand their existing sports wagering framework, and one state legislature has introduced legislation to legalize sports betting limited to retail locations. In addition, four states have introduced iGaming legislation and two states have introduced online poker legislation.  I'd now like to comment on our progress with the integration and migration to our own in-house bet engine technology and discuss our new products and content initiatives as well as some of the recent business relationships we have established. I continue to be pleased with the progress we are making with our organizational integration and the migration to our proprietary in-house back-end and trading technology.  Our technology migration is on track to be complete by the end of the third quarter of 2021. Owning our own technology is important. It will help with innovation, speed to market, site stability and availability of markets. We will also realize gross margin synergies associated with the migration, starting in the fourth quarter of this year. We look forward to discussing the migration further at our Investor Day.  In December, we announced an agreement with InComm Payments to launch an industry-first retail gift card. The launch expands DraftKings presence in convenience stores and also enables consumers to gift the DraftKings experience to others in $25 and $50 denominations. It gives our customers another way to fund their accounts and engage with our products, while at the same time expanding our brand across retail locations nationwide.  In January, we furthered our relationship with Turner Sports after the successful broadcast integrations with the Match II and Match III. DraftKings collaborated with Turner to create a first of its kind show which streamed on the Bleacher Report mobile app, YouTube channel and Twitter feeds. Customer engagement was tremendous and shows the strong demand that is developing for sports betting content and device.  In the first 24 hours of streaming, the DraftKings Prop Reveal show received over 1 million views across the app and social handles. 16,000 people made comments on the video during the live stream, placing it second in terms of engagement for videos in this app's history.  We also reached an agreement with the NFL to expand our daily fantasy sports and content partnership to Canada. Previously, this marketing and content deal was limited to the United States. Our announcement earlier this month of an expanded deal further deepens our relationship with the NFL.  Turning to the Super Bowl. DraftKings offer fans a FREE-to-play fourth quarter prop pool called the $55 million Prediction Challenge, which was featured during our in-game Super Bowl commercials. This promotion, which is our biggest free pool ever with over 1 million entrants, gave the Super Bowl audience a fun free way to get in on the excitement of the Super Bowl.  We have more people engaged with our apps on Super Bowl Sunday by entering the free pool or DFS contests or placing a sports bet or casino wager than on any day in DraftKings history. We also acquired more new paying players on Super Bowl Sunday than any previous day in our history.  Our investments in developing mobile apps that offer a consistent and engaging user experience continue to pay off. I am pleased to report that we have maintained the highest DFS App Store ratings for both iOS and Android, as well as the highest iOS rating for casino and sports book.  As sports betting and iGaming continue to expand across the United States, we are excited that DraftKings sports book and casino apps will soon be available to download for Android users via the Google Play Store. Starting March 1, Google is expanding the number of countries where developers can publish licensed real money gaming apps to include the United States.  I will now turn the call over to DraftKings CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our fourth quarter results and how we are currently thinking about 2021. Thank you. We're not providing guidance for EBITDA in 2021, just top line guidance. The reason we're not providing guidance is it's hard to predict what new states will open up. And also we generally are flexible in terms of how we flex up or down our customer acquisition investment, depending on how results are coming in. So it's really tough for us to guide to that at this point. For that reason, we are choosing not to. You're correct. New Jersey was contribution positive in 2020, and that was despite no sports or no traditional sports that we saw for a few months in Q2 and late Q1. I think it would have been even better have we had a full sports calendar for the year, although we did make some of that back up in the back half of the year with strong performance in some additional sports games on NBA and NHL that wouldn't have otherwise been played at that time of the year. As far as the other states, it's definitely been a variety. I think if you look at sort of the average, it's quite similar to what we're seeing in New Jersey on a per capita basis. But certainly, there's variation state to state. Michigan, in particular, was very strong on both sports betting and iGaming. Tennessee was pretty strong. Virginia was close to New Jersey, but not quite. But I think Virginia also, it's a bit of a different setup, because it launched around the same time with Michigan. It didn't have iGaming, but certainly did contribute in Virginia. And unlike Tennessee, it launched for us at least the day of the Conference Championship Game. So we only got a little bit at the tail end of the NFL in there whereas Tennessee launched in Q4. So we have quite a bit of ramp to be able to acquire customers and generate revenue during NFL. Thank you. So what we have been doing is we've done a pilot in Ireland. That was not necessarily, for any reason, other than just to get our team accustomed to the new interface and be able to use the tools and all those sorts of things. And the next step we'll be doing is we're going to choose a state in the U.S. to do a launch and make sure everything's working and work out any kinks. And at that point, we'll be comfortable rolling it out to the rest of the country. The question you asked on product, this underscores exactly why we thought it was so important to have our own in-house technology and trading platform, which we acquired along with the business combination back in April of last year. I think this is like, you mentioned same game parlays, that's something that we look to add hopefully shortly after migrating this NFL season, maybe at the migration, depending on the timing of it, but we want to have that ready for this NFL season at the point of migration. And I think one of the reasons that we feel like we've been doing so well on iGaming is we have been actually innovating on products, launching our own games, as we mentioned, more than three quarters of our games in Michigan \u2013 I'm sorry, more than three quarters of our revenue in Michigan were generated off of DraftKings in-house created game. And we haven't migrated yet. So while we've been very pleased and have only positive things to say about Kambi, our current partner, we do think that there's just no substitute for a company like ours. It's a great product and technology-driven between having a reliance on a third-party versus having full control over your own product. And I think what we'll see is, first, a couple of things with the migration, but really it's going to be about what we do over the next year or two or three. Like this is an area I feel very confident that we will generate meaningful progress in over the next few years. It's what we do and really core to our DNA. So I'm excited about it. And I think it's going to be something that we'll really start to be able to talk more about in the back half of the year. Sorry. Can you ask the question one more time? I'm going to let Jason Park answer any more granularity. But I will say at a high-level, this is one of the real key times for betters, it's a very popular thing to bet on. It's actually quite different than fantasy. For fantasy, college basketball, college sports, in general, while certainly there's some activity that spikes during the NCAA tournament, it's nothing like we see in betting. So with so many new states, I think, you'll see a lot more there. Jason, I don't know if you want to add anything specific beyond that. But I think that that's the high level how I would describe it. Thank you, Jed. Hi, Ben. Sure. So there's a couple of things. First, Google Play does have an advertising product that if you don't have an app in Google Play, obviously it doesn't make sense to use. So just like we spent on iAds and the App Store, we expect to acquire customers via that channel once we're able to launch. Secondly, we do have people that side load the app now. It's a little bit of a clunky experience. You get like a message saying something along the lines of this is not safe or not approved. And so there's a -- it's a little bit of a clunky experience. It's not the easiest UI. So I think that should improve in terms of more people having Android -- that have Android phones, having the app on their phone, and even amongst the existing customers. Although I would say, probably the majority of customers now have figured out how to side load the app through some of the UIs that we built. A couple more points I'd make. One is, we talked a lot about our highest rated products in both iOS and Android on VFS and for iOS in the App Store on online sports book and iGaming. The reason we don't mention it on Android is it's not in the Google Play Store. So very important to us is to deliver a quality product. We think we have one and we look forward to getting feedback and ratings on that, which will hopefully help solidify our reputation as having a strong product. Secondly, there will be I think two states, I want to say Michigan and Virginia, that weren't added initially, we're hopeful that they'll get added later. But that does create a bit of a clunky experience as well, because users in those states will still have to side load the app, and it's actually really hard to create a UI that's very state specific on that front. So we're working hard to do it so that we can get live in the states that were approved from March 1, but hopeful that Google will approve those additional states. And what we'd like to ideally see is they just kind of set policy where any state that has legal, regulated sports betting and iGaming is automatically included in the policy. Well, you're absolutely right. Canada is going to present a really exciting opportunity should it open up. We see really good progress there, both the federal and province level in Ontario legislatively. Ontario, as you probably know, is the largest province. I believe it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 45% of the population of Canada. So to get any province, that was the one to get first so very excited about that. We're hoping additional provinces follow suit, but haven't really seen whether that is the case yet. I think that first and foremost the legislation had to move along and we're seeing that. There's a lot left up to the regulator. It's a little bit different than U.S. legislation where there's a lot of detail in the legislation in Ontario. It's really kind of a line or two, maybe not quite that little but very much left up to the regulator on what the rules of the road are. So we are waiting for regulations. I know those are being worked on by the Ontario government. So once we get that, we'll have a better sense of what timing could be, what sort of product could look like and things like that. And as far as preparing, you mentioned the NFL -- expansion of our NFL deal in Canada, we're very excited about that. We have been doing marketing in Canada for quite some time. We have a very large daily fantasy sports customer base. Ontario, obviously being our biggest province in terms of customer base, so we feel very well prepared both to convert our existing daily fantasy customer base as well as to expand what we're doing with the existing marketing channels that we utilize in Canada. Thank you. Thank you. So a few things going to ARPMUP. One is the cross selling and it's really across all of our products, certainly sports book to iGaming is one but we cross sell between all of them. We cross sell DFS. Certainly the sports book and iGaming we cross sell back to DFS from people who get acquired on sports book or iGaming and we cross sell people who get acquired on iGaming to sports book. So I think that it's really -- the way we think about it is we have a platform. We try to target segments of customers to bring them on -- potential customers to bring them on in the most efficient manner possible. And then once they're on the platform, we try to get them to engage with all of our products. And it's really about optimizing across all things that we offer. The other factor in ARPMUP which enables what I just described is just more states opening up. And one of the reasons that we have said that we expect users to expand more than ARPMUP is in our guidance, we have not included any new states that we're not already in. So last year, obviously, there were several states that launched. And I think if you were to see new states launch in 2021, we would expect faster growth in ARPMUP. But right now, we don't have any line of sight to that. There's obviously a lot of exciting things happening on the legislative front with almost 20 states considering new sports betting legislation to open up and I think four or five -- four I think considering iGaming legislation. So hopefully, we'll get see some of those get done. I don't know, even if they do get done if they'll launch this year or next year. So once we get more line of sight to that, then we'll be able to have more of a view on how that might impact ARPMUP throughout the year. But right now, in all of our guidance, including your question on ARPMUP, we're not including any of these states. College sports in sports book are big. They're not that big in daily fantasy sports, but they are really important on sports book. So it certainly was something that we didn't know would happen. We were a little bit conservative in our last couple of quarters' guidance and thinking through, would we have full college sports calendars? Would we have all conferences playing? At the time, for example, we guided in our Q3 call, at least two of the conferences had basically said they were shutting down the season. They ended up starting, which is great. So it certainly was a boost to see that. And I wouldn't say it was the number one thing, but it was a material factor, sure. Thank you. Good morning. So about half of the beat came from things that were assumptions we made that literally all broke our way. Obviously that's not going to happen all the time. And that includes things like full sports calendar being played with no rescheduling into next year of NFL games. We thought there was a possibility that certain games might get moved from Q4 into Q1. It didn't happen. We also saw that, as was mentioned earlier, all college sports were played. The biggest one was hold, came in higher. That's obviously something that can swing either way. And Q3, as you may recall, hold was really bad to start the NFL season and we just barely beat our numbers. So that was a pretty big factor. I think the biggest factor with hold came in higher than expected. And that's just based on sport games outcomes, but not anything we were doing in particular, and I think it was higher across the board for the whole industry. Another one was we did not make the assumption that the Illinois executive order that allowed for mobile registration would get continued. Obviously, that's something that's not within our control and we don't know, so we weren't counting on it. That ended up getting continued not just through the end of the year, but through the Super Bowl and we're hopeful it gets extended again. There's a lot of things that really broke our way. And then the rest of it was business over performance. And as far as your question, Tennessee was definitely a big factor. Tennessee, we didn't know before it launched, but ended up being one of the strongest starts of any state. So that was really great to see. And then I think -- which is why we've been a bit cautious about where we sort of pegged our numbers thinking through the back half of next year. There was a lot of boost I believe. It's impossible to quantify how much. But when I look at our marketing performance in 2020 versus Q4, Q3 of 2019, it was just like off the charts better. And I think it was due to this whole stay at home and people cutting back on other leisure spend and entertainment spend, and having a larger share of the overall entertainment and leisure spent wallet. And I think all of those things may or may not continue. We haven't assumed that they will as things get back to whatever normal it is in the back half hopefully of this year. So we're being a bit cautious there. I think that, in all likelihood, if there was a benefit, it won't last forever. So it's probably not just being cautious, it's probably being realistic. And I think it was hard \u2013 the thing is I'm saying it's hard to say what's going to happen at the end of this year, the back half of this year, or whenever people kind of start going out to concerts and traveling and all those sorts of things again. I think it's also hard for us to have known and even hard now to quantify what the impact exactly was of that on Q4 as well as Q3 of last year. So I can't give you an exact number. But what I can tell you is, I'm personally very convinced that there is certainly a lot of things the team did well. We had a lot of great optimizations and things that we figured out on the product and marketing front that led to over performance. So it wasn't entirely that. But I'm sure a good chunk of it was this sort of moment in time. And that's why we were so aggressive on the customer acquisition front. Once you get the data and then you see it's working, we're very flexible and press the gas quickly. And if it's not, we'll go the other way. We're very much driven by what the results in the data are. So, we literally could not, even if we wanted to, hit our cap target on \u2013 I think we were below our cap target on Q3 and Q4. I just kept telling the team trying to find more places to acquire customers. And it was just such great results that we were trying to max out volume as much as we could, but we really couldn't even go any deeper. And we're still well below our cap target. And I don't know if that will be the case this year, at the end of the year, but we'll have to see it. There probably will be some factor or some impact, but really hard to quantify it. Yes. I think that what we're seeing \u2013 you're talking about like promotional spend or specifically for -- So similar to external marketing, advertising spend, we're very much data driven on that and it's seasonal. We're more aggressive on promos in periods where we're more heavily acquiring new customers. And if you look at sort of the breakdown between where promo spend goes, a much higher percentage of new customer gross revenue goes to promos than existing customer. The most aggressive offers are the new customer offers. So what you will see, and you started to see this a little bit in Q4, is as the mix of customers shifts from more new customers to more existing customers, then you will see a natural decline in the rate of promo. So we are cross selling over 50% of our sports betting customers into iGaming. And it's a very important product. I believe it's probably a larger market if there were -- on a state level, it's a larger market, certainly we saw that in Michigan. We're seeing that albeit it's on a different lifecycle timeline in New Jersey. And I think it's probably safe to say that it's a larger market. We're going to have more color on that. We have an Investor Day coming up in early March that we will talk more about how we view the size of each of the relative market. As far as gross margin impact, it's really hard to say. We don't really allocate promotional dollars by product, because people can use them across the platform. So it's in thinking on like things like payment processing fees. People may deposit and play one particular product first and then play another. So it's hard to say, this deposit should have been allocated to this product or that product. So it's not really something where we see a distinction. We view both iGaming and sports betting as having very similar gross margins, if you kind of don't distinguish, and as I said, it's sort of impossible to distinguish, where deposit payment processing fees and promotional dollars and things like that are coming in on. They're actually remarkably similar in terms of their margin profile. I actually don't exactly know the detail on that. But what I can say to you is that we knew about this. We've been preparing for it. We, generally speaking, don't view it as having a massive impact, but it will have some impact. But I think most of what we've done has not really changed based on those regulations. We haven't disclosed anything around average bets or time. We certainly can consider adding some of that material to our Investor Day. But I would be lying to you if I told you I actually knew the answer right off my hand anyway. So beyond not disclosing it, I couldn't tell you but something we can look into and consider talking about on Investor Day. As far as new versus existing states, we're seeing very similar median and average performance. There is obviously some variation state to state, but virtually across all the metrics we look at, whether it'd be revenue, active players, retention rates, engagement in time and app, average bet, average bet size, it's actually quite similar if you look at sort of the averages. But there is certainly some variation state to state. Some of it is dependent on which types of products and games are more popular. In Michigan, for example, we saw a much wider gap between the amounts of engagement in iGaming versus OSB versus some of the other states that have both of those products. There is also differences in what sports people bet. College betting is much more popular in West Virginia relative to professional. Still professional is more popular, but the relative gap is quite narrower than you see in certain other states like New Jersey. So it's definitely variable state to state. But if you kind of look at the averages, it's quite similar to New Jersey. We do take advertising on free to play games. We are not doing that for pay to play games. We think that if you're paying for a product, you should not have to see ads and we feel more comfortable doing it on free to play games. There is some Web site advertising on the DFS products with the one exception, but the vast majority of it is in free to play games. So that's the sort of approach that we've taken. And right now we are actually turning down ad dollars. We have less inventory between our free to play games and the content that we're producing than we have demand for advertising. So one of the things we are looking to do is to figure out ways to expand our content footprint and have both more inventory to take ad dollars but also content is a very effective way of acquiring and engaging and monetizing our user base as well. So one of the nice things about it is it has that great synergy as you can make money on the advertising side, but you can also make money by using content to acquire players and activate players and introduce new products and new forms of betting to them. Thank you. We definitely had a decline in promotional spend, largely driven by the new customer versus existing customer mix. So Q3 was a huge quarter for a customer acquisition for us with the start of NFL and with NBA, NHL completing their season and going into the Playoffs. So between those things, it was a really great time. There's also a lot of pent-up demand for online sports betting, given that there is a real lack of traditional sports in Q2. So that certainly was a big factor, just the mix shift between new and existing customers shifting more towards existing customers in Q4, which as we said is going to have a natural downward impact on promotional rate. Also, you mentioned this too. There are definitely differences in state reporting around how promotional dollars are factored into or not factored into the taxable basis. And what we try to do internally is really work at the individual state level to be able to grow the state in a way that is both tax efficient and makes sense from a customer and data perspective in terms of the impact of the promotions we're running. And sometimes the reporting does sort of -- it is a little bit hard to follow exactly what the promotional spend was from that. I think it's definitely the latter. We're going to talk more about this at our upcoming Investor Day in early March. But the punch line is we don't see any difference in the long-term projection there from what we said in the past. There is going to be a lot of optimization, but by far the largest impact will come from just the natural mix shift from new customers to existing customers as business matures and the rates of promotional spending are most aggressive with the customers. We do, do promotions for existing customers, but they're far more aggressive with new customers. And simply if we didn't change a thing, you'd see a significant decline as the business matures. Now what will be interesting is new states will launch and then as we enter those new states and acquire customers, you're going to see an increase at the state level, which, of course, depending on the quantum of states, in which states, and how big the population base is, it could create fluctuations. But if you just sort of look at it in an existing state as a unit -- at an existing state as a unit, that natural decline will occur simply from the statement sharing in the mix of new customers to existing customer shifting towards existing. Thank you. Yes, a good question. We are pretty cautious about how we disclose anything around this, because as you can imagine, this is a real competitive area. Being able to optimize across a number of different marketing channels at scale is something we believe we're really good at. We're a very data driven company and we've been doing this a long time. So we have a lot of great historical data to rely on. So we're a little cautious. I think what I can probably answer at a high level, and this will come as no surprise, is television is definitely typically the most expensive channel, but also the highest reach channel. And certainly from a creative standpoint, television ads can -- you can say a lot more in a 30 or 60 over even 15-second ad than you can in a display ad. We'll typically try to max out digital first since that's the most efficient and also the easiest to measure. And then to gain additional reach and scale, we go to television and other sorts of offline channels. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We appreciate your insightful questions and look forward to continuing our conversations with you. 2020 was an outstanding year for DraftKings still with many impressive accomplishments. But we also recognized the suffering and challenges that many in our communities have experienced and continue to face.  We're excited for the future. DraftKings is well positioned with over $1.8 billion in cash to enter new states as soon as practicable, to drive our continued product innovation, acquire customers and explore opportunistic M&A. Matt, Paul, Jason and I are excited to share more insight and information with you at our Investor Day on March 9. We will explore our latest outlook on TAM, sources of competitive differentiation, unit economics and EBITDA at maturity. I hope all of you stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we will be discussing our results on a combined company pro forma basis to improve comparability as if the business combination had closed on January 1, 2019. Pro forma means that we are including B2B for the year ended December 31 for both 2019 and 2020, rather than just from April 24 through December 31, 2020.  We are pleased to announce that we generated 644 million in revenue for the full-year, representing a 49% increase versus fiscal year 2019 revenue of 432 million. Q4 revenue was 322 million, representing a 98% increase versus Q4 2019 revenue of 163 million. These incredible results were despite the impact that COVID-19 had on our business in 2020, in particular in Q2.  Our B2C business, which includes our core product offerings of daily fantasy sports, online sports book and iGaming performed extremely well this year as we launched OSB in four new states in iGaming in two new states. In addition, as Jason mentioned, we are continuing to see triple digit year-over-year growth in New Jersey handle, even though we have been live for two and a half years, which really speak to the continued adoption of these exciting product offerings.  Our B2C business generated $539 million for the full-year, representing a 67% increase versus prior year and Q4 revenue of 291 million, representing 122% growth. B2C monthly unique payers in the quarter increased 44% year-over-year to 1.5 million. The increase reflects strong unique payer retention and acquisitions across DFS, OSB and iGaming.  For the full-year of 2020, MUPs increased 29% which includes the impact of COVID-19 on our MUPs for sports book and DFS primarily during the second quarter and early in the third quarter. Average revenue per monthly unique payer or ARPMUP up was $65 in Q4, representing a 55% increase versus the same period in 2019.  Our ARPMUP was positively impacted by increased engagement with our iGaming and online sports book product offerings and our excellent cross-selling capabilities. For the full-year of 2020, ARPMUP also increased 29%.  Our B2B business generated $105 million for the full-year, down just 3 million versus prior year and was flat in Q4 versus prior year. Our B2B business in 2020 was heavily impacted by COVID, as revenue declined 7 million in Q2. And once sports resumed in Q3, we experienced 5% growth in the second half of the year.  Our revenue exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance by almost $95 million. Roughly 50 million of the beat was due to assumptions about market factors that broke our way. Of this 50 million, around 20 million was due to a more favorable than anticipated sports calendar, particularly for the NBA and college sports and the extension of mobile registration in Illinois.  Roughly 30 million was due to our OSB hold percentage being higher than we forecast. The remaining 45 million of the beat was due to over performance in our core business as a result of uniquely productive customer acquisitions, great customer engagement and cross-selling, our Q3 marketing spend paying back more than expected and a strong launch in Tennessee.  We generated $359 million of gross profit dollars on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the entire business in the full-year, representing a 15% increase versus fiscal year 2019. We generated 188 million of gross profit dollars in Q4, a 59% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2019.  Gross margin rate for the business declined as expected. As we have noted in the past, our gross margin rate has been impacted and will continue to be impacted by a mix shift out of our more mature and thus higher margin DFS product offering and into our higher growth rate and currently lower margin OSB and iGaming product offerings. In addition, gross margin rate within a period is impacted by promotional intensity, typically most intense when a new state launches and at the beginning of a major sports season as we aim to acquire customers.  Gross margin rates will be positively impacted by the conversion to our own bet engine in the back half of 2021. GAAP gross margin rates declined more than our adjusted gross margin rate. This is due to the amortization of acquired intangibles related to the business combination. Our general and administrative and product and technology costs on an adjusted EBITDA basis were 154 million and 125 million, respectively, as we invested to achieve scale in our back office functions such as finance and accounting, legal and human resources, as well as continuing to invest in our products.  For the quarter, we spent 52 million and 39 million, respectively, which includes bonus accrual and payroll taxes on LTIP vesting. Our 2020 sales and marketing expenses were 475 million, which include our external marketing. External marketing was higher than prior year as we launched mobile sports betting in Iowa, Colorado, Illinois, and Tennessee and iGaming in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  Additionally, we continue to see accretive LTV to CAC opportunities, which allowed us to invest deeper in marketing, in part due to the stay at home nature of COVID and the unique sports calendar in the third quarter in particular.  For Q4, we invested 184 million on sales and marketing versus 63 million in Q4 2019. A key driver of the $121 million increase was our external marketing investment in states that were live for their first full Q4, including Pennsylvania, Iowa, Illinois, Colorado, as well as our launch in Tennessee.  Adjusted EBITDA for the year was a negative 396 million. Adjusted EBITDA does not include one-time and non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation and transaction-related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a negative 88 million as we rolled out our new state playbook in multiple jurisdictions, and continued to invest in our product technology and G&A functions.  In the quarter, we expensed $180 million in items that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA but are included in GAAP net income, notably 149 million for stock-based compensation and 31 million for amortization of acquired intangibles, depreciation and other amortization, and transaction-related expenses. Our stock-based compensation expense reflects the vesting of RSUs as a result of our strong stock performance in 2020.  Moving on to our balance sheet and liquidity. We are well capitalized to execute our multi-year plan and address our key priorities of taking advantage of this unique time for customer acquisition, entering new states as they legalize, continuing to lead the market on product innovation, and exploring opportunistic and creative M&A. We ended the year with $1.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet and no debt.  Looking forward to 2021, on our third quarter earnings call in November, we introduced a range for our 2021 revenue of $750 million to $850 million. Given our strong finish to 2020 and the underlying acquisition, engagement and retention of our players, as well as our recent launches in Michigan and Virginia, we are increasing our guidance to 900 million to 1 billion of revenue for 2021, which equates to year-over-year growth of 40% to 55% and a 19% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance.  The increase reflects strong performance in Q4, which has continued in Q1 2021, substantial user activation due to our 2020 marketing spend and the launch of mobile sports betting in Michigan and Virginia and iGaming in Michigan. We assume that all professional and college sports calendars that have been announced come to fruition and that we continue to operate in the states in which we are alive today.  These states collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population for mobile sports betting and 10% of the U.S. population for iGaming. The range also assumes that the Governor of Illinois does not extend the suspension of the in-person registration requirement. Future revenues and marketing spend will be higher for each month Illinois chooses to extend the suspension.  We expect both MUPs and ARPMUP to grow in 2021, with MUPs increasing at a higher rate than ARPMUP. Regarding our 2021 quarterly revenue cadence, all things being equal, which means no new states launch beyond Michigan and Virginia, we expect Q1 and Q2 to be about equal as a percentage of full-year revenue in the lower 20% range with Q1 slightly higher than Q2. Q3 is expected to be close to 20% of full-year revenue. We currently expect the fourth quarter to account for slightly more than 35% of our revenue for the year. While we are not providing guidance for 2021 adjusted EBITDA, sales and marketing expense is the key input. Sales and marketing in older vintage states will begin to moderate, but 2020 and 2021 vintage states will have increased sales and marketing as we execute our new states playbook and lap partial years in 2020. The net effect is that we expect to spend more on marketing in 2021 compared to 2020.  From a quarterly perspective, we expect our adjusted EBITDA loss to be widest in Q3 followed by Q1. The first quarter will be impacted by our launches in Michigan and Virginia in the third quarter by the start of the NFL season.  We expect our second quarter loss to be better than Q1 and our fourth quarter loss will be the smallest as we benefit from higher seasonal revenue. As a reminder, our marketing spend is impacted by the launch of new states. Our spend is also highly flexible and can be reduced or paused altogether if this sports calendar shifts.  That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line up for questions. Yes. And hey, Jed, great to hear your voice. I agree. I mean, we've certainly thought a lot about March Madness. A, part of the tournament will be in Q1, part of it will be in Q2. We've thought about that. And when we look back, we've only had one state with OSB live for March Madness, given the canceled event last year. So we've incorporated that all into the guidance that we provided today."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like introduce your host for this conference call Mr. Stanton Dodge. You may begin.\nStanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical facts constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility for updating forward-looking statements.  For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties, and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. During the call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed today with the SEC and in our earnings presentation which is available on our website at investors.draftkings.com. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open up the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings\u2019 Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, in recognition of Veteran\u2019s Day this week, I would like to thank our country's veterans for their sacrifices and service. In order to more directly support our veterans and their families, DraftKings has launched Tech for Heroes in 2018, a companywide initiative that provides veterans and military spouses with free comprehensive high-tech job skills training and connects veterans to DraftKings' employees who provide mentoring. Since launching the Tech for Heroes program, we have invested over a $1 million in providing three accredited training to veterans and their spouses across the country. I'm proud to announce that in 2021 we will be expanding the reach of our Tech for Heroes program and are committed to training approximately 250 veterans in 2021, double the number we trained this year. We want to give veterans and their spouses the tools they need to start a new career in tech or advance in their current position. Everyone at DraftKings is proud to do our part to thank veterans and their families for the sacrifices they make on our behalf. I would also like to thank our investors for their continued support and welcome those investors who joined us with our follow-on equity offering in October.  On today's call, we will cover the following topics:  First, I want to share some insight into our third quarter accomplishments. Next, I will provide an update on our recent state launches in the pipeline of new states. Third, I will discuss our product and technology investments as well as the migration to our in-house proprietary sports betting technology. Then before turning it over to Jason Park, I will share some insights into our sales and marketing approach and our recent equity offering.  DraftKings had a very productive third quarter on a number of different fronts. First, our Q3 performance confirms what we foreshadowed on our previous earnings call. The return on major sports has generated tremendous customer engagement. Third quarter revenue of $133 million was at the high end of the range we outlined in our recent S-1 and grew 42% year-over-year. In Q3, we also had more than 1 million monthly unique payers, which means the average for the month of July, August and September was greater than 1 million. Given the impact COVID had in July, monthly unique payers in August and September were higher than in July. We expect these positive trends to continue as shown by the very encouraging outlook for the fourth quarter that our 2020 guidance suggests.  As noted last quarter, there have been and may continue to disruptions in the sports calendar due to COVID. We are optimistic that sport will continue to be played and believe any disruptions will be short-term in nature and not impact the long-term prospects of the sports gaming industry or our competitive positioning. Looking ahead to 2021, we are likely to see another unique sports calendar with the NBA and NHL expected to kick off their season either later this year or early next year as compared to their typical start dates in October.  Second, we continue to build smart and effective relationships with media companies, including ESPN and Turner Sports, as well as professional sports teams, including the Chicago Cubs, the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles. These commercial and strategic agreements provide us with access to unique and valuable content, intellectual property, and marketing assets, as well as highly relevant target audiences in markets where sports betting has recently been legalized. We evaluate these opportunities with the same data driven approach we used to guide other areas of our business. We also strengthened our corporate foundation by appointing two new Board members, Jocelyn Moore and Valerie Mosley and we also added Michael Jordan to our team as a special advisor on our Board. I am excited to welcome Jocelyn and Valerie to our Board as they each bring unique skills, experiences and ideas, and they will each play an important role in shaping the future of DraftKings and helping us achieve our long-term goals.  Jacelyn\u2019s former roles, which includes serving as Executive Vice President of Communications and Public Affairs for the National Football League, equipped her with valuable insights into our customers as well as with respect to government and regulatory affairs. Valerie's experience in the investment management industry, which includes 20 years plus at Wellington provides us with an important voice on the capital markets front. The addition of Michael Jordan to the DraftKings team is also a great fit. Both Michael and DraftKings live and love to compete. Michael will provide input on a variety of dimensions including our focus on brand strategy, product development, inclusion, equity and belonging, marketing activities and other key initiatives. Turning to new U.S. states for DraftKings and legalization trends. In the third quarter we launched iGaming in West Virginia and sports betting in Illinois. Illinois, given its size and passionate sports fan base is a large and important market. The state was a focus of our Q3 marketing efforts and a key reason for the increase in third quarter sales and marketing expense. The governor's suspension of the state in-person registration requirement has enabled us to acquire players directly onto our mobile product. Our investments in technology, regulatory affairs and compliance put us in a great position to market to customers and launch mobile registration quickly. We are pleased to have launched mobile sports betting in Tennessee on November 1st. We are excited about entering another state with passionate sports fans and highly competitive teams both at collegiate and professional level. With our launch in Tennessee, DraftKings is now live in 10 states for mobile sports betting and live in three states for iGaming. As you also know, Virginia has legalized sports betting and Michigan has legalized both sports betting and iGaming. Those two states accounted for approximately 6% of the U.S. population. We are working together with state officials in Virginia and Michigan on regulations and licensing are hopeful that we will launch in each state at the earliest practicable opportunity. Last week, on Election Day, Maryland, South Dakota and the majority of parishes in Louisiana passed referendums in favor of sports betting. These three states in total account for approximately 3.5% of the U.S. population. The margins approving the referendums were decisive, showing the public support for sports betting is strong, and we are hopeful that this will help the momentum continue across the U.S.  As a reminder, launching in a new state is a multistep process. Legislators need to pass bills, regulations need to be written and licenses need to be granted. Last night's votes were certainly a good first step, though it is probable that these states will not have a material impact on our financials in 2021 and may not even launch until 2022.  In addition, Ontario's government recently presented its annual budget, which included language that would modify the longstanding statutory Internet gaming framework to allow private operators offering sports betting and iGaming products to operate in the province. This is exciting because Ontario is a large market for us. If there were a UFC, it would rank as fifth largest state by population. And we have offered our DFS product in Canada since 2012.  We are now two and a half years since PASPA was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. 21 states representing about 40% of the population have legalized sports betting. 14 states representing 26% of the population have legalized mobile sports betting. 12 of which representing 21% of the population currently have operators live. DraftKings is now live with mobile sports betting in 10 of those states, which is more than any other operator. These 10 states collectively represent about 20% of the U.S. population.  We continue to be very excited with the products and technology investments we're making as well as with our progress on the technology migration and business integration of SBTech. We anticipate completing the technology migration by the third quarter of 2021. And once we do so, our vertically integrated proprietary sports betting technology will create a sustainable and differentiated advantage for DraftKings. We also expect to benefit from a long-term improvement in our gross margin percentage once the migration is complete.  As a reminder, with the acquisition of SBTech, we now have almost 1,100 engineers worldwide dedicated to creating best-in-class technology and games and experiences for our users. During the third quarter, we launched our standalone casino app for iGaming in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We also launched Best Ball, which is our first season-long product for DFS. In addition, we introduced several new DraftKings created games for online casino including new versions of blackjack, roulette and baccarat.  Beyond our customer-facing investments, we continue to prioritize our internal capabilities around data science which drive our cross-sell and LTV to CAC metrics. With our technology, talent and resources as well as with our proprietary betting engine, we will be able to clearly differentiate our offering in the United States from any other gaming provider and create a sustainable advantage for DraftKings both as a B2C and B2B company.  Regarding B2B, we continue to obtain new business in international markets. In October, we announced the launch of PalaceBet, a mobile and online sportsbook powered by DraftKings B2B technology through our relationship with Peermont in South Africa. We also announced the renewal and expansion of our relationship with MansionBet, the Gibraltar based sports betting brand of Mansion Group, which is the leading provider of online gaming with a portfolio of well-known online casino brands and a sportsbook.  In the third quarter, we saw a significant increase in customer activity, as evidenced by our 64% year-over-year increase in MUPs for the quarter. On average more than 1 million monthly unique paying customers engaged with DraftKings each month during Q3.  A number of the factors we have discussed including the unique Q3 sports calendar, pent up demand, the earlier than expected mobile registration opportunity in Illinois, and the stay at home nature of COVID that made this a unique and valuable time for customer acquisition and our CAC came in better than our expectation.  We have confidence that our CAC levels are appropriate given our insight into our customers and revenue retention, which are the bedrock of our LTV calculation. Our sales and marketing approach is data driven. We base our decisions on the return on ad spend we are seeing, not on what our competitors are doing and leverage our data to optimize customer acquisition spending based on player profiles and preferences. This approach means that we'll spend more if the data indicates that we should, as was the case in Q3. We will take the same data driven approach always to our commercial and strategic agreements. For example, states with sports betting and iGaming generate higher customer LTVs, which informed our agreement with the Philadelphia Eagles. And our agreement with the Chicago Cubs, we considered the value associated with the potential to open a world class DraftKings sportsbook at Wrigley Field. Our agreements with sports media organizations like ESPN and Turner allow us to integrate our content, programming and collaborate on new content, which we believe will improve our overall marketing performance while advancing mainstream adoption of sports betting. Finally, our relationship with Bryson DeChambeau, the world's sixth ranked Golfer in 2020 U.S. Open Champion underscores the significance of golf within the gaming industry. Golf remains DraftKings fourth most popular daily fantasy sport. While our golf sportsbook handle has grown over 10 times year-over-year. I would also like to talk about our recent equity offering, which is the second one we've completed since going public including the rationale behind it and how I see things going forward. We conducted the October offering for two primary reasons. First, the process we are going through is part of the reality of transitioning from a VC-backed company to a publicly traded company. It is only natural for early private investors to exit their investment and realize the returns for their investors. The offering allowed us to smooth this process out by facilitating and organize an orderly process in anticipation for lockup restrictions on many shareholders that were set to come up on October 20th. In fact, now 80% of our common shares are unlocked at this point, and all of our shares will be unlocked at the beginning of January, after January 5th. We have provided more specific information regarding the unlocking of our shares in the earnings presentation which can be found on our Investor website.  Secondly, DraftKings has always been proactive with ensuring we are well-financed to pursue our growth objectives. We see a number of attractive avenues to deploy the capital we raise in ways that will create long-term value for our shareholders. This may include continued investment in customer acquisition, especially while the CAC remains very efficient, as well as positioning the business for the hopeful acceleration of state legalization.  In addition, while we have no specific M&A targets at this time, we are always considering companies that may help us fuel our growth and bring more excitement to the skin-in-the-game fans. As I look to the future, I am very confident in the continued growth of the online sports betting and iGaming market in the U.S. Though not a proxy for revenue, the handle growth figures we disclosed in our S-1 supports our OSB and iGaming TAM estimates as do the number of new users we are adding and the data that the states are reporting. DraftKings is well positioned to capitalize on the U.S. market growth as we expand our leadership position with live operations in more states than any competitor.  I will now turn the call over to DraftKings\u2019 CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our third quarter results and how we are currently thinking about the rest of 2020 and 2021.\nJason Park : Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we will be discussing our results on a combined company pro forma basis to improve comparability as if the business combination had closed on January 1, 2019. Pro forma means that we are including B2B for the 9 months ended September 30th for both 2019 and 2020 rather than just from April 24th through September 30 in 2020.  In Q3 2020, we delivered $133 million of revenue, a 42% year-over-year increase. These results were fantastic and would have been roughly $15 million stronger, were if not for the unusually low hold for NFL gains during the first 3 weeks of the season. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $321 million of pro forma revenue, representing 19% year-over-year growth, which obviously includes several months that were deeply impacted by COVID. Our B2C segment, which represents our U.S. product offerings of Daily Fantasy Sports, Sportsbook and iGaming generated $104 million of revenue in Q3, up 55% compared to the same period in 2019. We launched iGaming in West Virginia and online sports betting in Illinois during the third quarter, and we were live in 7 new states for NFL week 1 versus Q3 2019. These factors, combined with the packed sports calendar were the major drivers of our growth.  On a year-to-date basis, our B2C segment has grown 29%. B2C monthly unique payers in the quarter increased 64% year-over-year to $1.02 million. The increase reflects strong unique payer retention and acquisition across DFS, OSB and iGaming. On a year-to-date basis, MUPs have increased 20%. MUPs also grew at an impressive year-over-year rate in October as we continue to realize the positive impact of our external marketing spend. Average revenue per monthly unique payer, or ARPMUP, was $34 in Q3, representing a 6% decrease versus the same period in 2019. Our ARPMUP was impacted by the aforementioned low NFL hold and promotional activity, offset by increased engagement with our iGaming and online sportsbook product offerings. On a year-to-date basis, ARPMUP has increased 7% versus 2019. Turning to our B2B results. Our B2B business generated $29 million of revenue in the quarter, a very solid 11% growth rate compared to the same period in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter widened to negative $197 million as we rolled out our new state playbook in multiple jurisdictions and continue to invest in our product, technology and G&A functions. Gross margin rate for the business declined as we shifted our business away from higher-margin DFS as well as increased promotional activity. GAAP gross margin rate declined more due to the amortization of acquired intangibles related to the business combination.  Our sales and marketing spend was $203 million on a GAAP basis and $191 million after excluding stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization. The year-over-year increase in marketing investment had a positive impact, as you can see from the increase in our MUPs. The majority of the $191 million in Q3 sales and marketing spend was for external marketing. The primary driver for our year-over-year increase in external marketing is that we had 7 states where we were live for the first time for NFL week 1, including Illinois. In addition, the pent-up demand and unique sports calendar combined for strong engagement and return on advertising spend.  Products and technology and general and administrative expenses were $54 million and $127 million on a GAAP basis, respectively, and $31 million and $36 million, respectively, after excluding stock-based compensation, transaction expenses and other non-cash and non-recurring charges. The year-over-year growth in these cost categories was primarily from headcount increases, including the annualization of hires we made in 2019.  Moving on to our balance sheet and liquidity. We are well capitalized to execute our multi-year plan and address our key priorities of taking advantage of this unique time for customer acquisition, entering new states as they legalize, continuing to lead the market on product innovation and exploring opportunistic and accretive M&A. We ended the third quarter with $1.1 billion of cash on our balance sheet and no debt. Taking into account our follow-on equity offering in October as well as a $295 million use of cash to net settle restricted stock units, we expect our cash balance to be approximately $1.7 billion at year-end.  Regarding the net share settlement, the RSUs that vested on October 20th resulted in a requirement for the company to withhold taxes. The company held back shares to satisfy the withholding obligation, delivered only the net shares to the participants and pay the taxes. As a result, we reduced our diluted share count by about 2%. I want to reiterate that no shares of Class A common stock were transferred or sold by our officers in connection with the vesting of these RSUs or the October offering, other than the shares withheld by the company, which are reported as a disposition of shares.  Having now generated $321 million of pro forma revenue in the first 9 months of 2020, we are increasing our guidance from $500 million to 540 million, to $540 million to $560 million of pro forma revenue for the full year, which equates to year-over-year growth of 25% to 30%. This increase reflects strong performance in October and substantial user activation due largely to our Q3 marketing spend. We assume that all sports calendars will continue as announced and that we continue to operate in states in which we are live today. The range also assumes that the Governor of Illinois does not extend the suspension of the in-person registration requirement. Future revenues and marketing spend will be higher for each month, Illinois chooses to extend the suspension.  In terms of MUPs and ARPMUP, we expect MUP growth for the full year 2020 to exceed 2019's growth rate, while ARPMUP growth for 2020 is expected to be below 2019's growth rate but slightly higher than our year-to-date growth rate.  Turning to pro forma adjusted EBITDA. We are continuing to invest in marketing, given the strong marketing spend efficacy we are seeing as well as our investment in the launch of sports betting in Tennessee. As a result, we expect our adjusted EBITDA loss in Q4 to be a little more than half of the loss recorded in Q3, again, based on the states in which we are live today.  As a reminder, our marketing spend is highly flexible and it can be reduced or paused altogether if the sports calendar shifts. In the future, we expect to provide full year guidance only once annually, on our year-end call. However, since we provided a 2021 revenue outlook of $700 million during the de-SPAC process and because we are seeing strong results from recent marketing investments, we want to provide an update on our 2021 revenue outlook on this call. Though we are still in the process of finalizing our 2021 plans, we believe that our 2021 revenues will likely be in the range from $750 million to $850 million. This range is based on the same assumptions we used for our 2020 guidance, in particular for all professional and college sports calendars that have been announced come to fruition, including the commencement of their 2020 to 2021 seasons, and that we continue to operate in states in which we are live today, which collectively represent 20% of the U.S. population for mobile sports betting and 7% of the U.S. population for iGaming.  We will continue to refine and update our internal budgets as we move through Q4, and we'll issue formal 2021 revenue guidance on our Q4 and full year earnings call.  That concludes our remarks. And we will now open the line up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Graham with Cannacord.\nMichael Graham : Can you just please talk about your 2021 guidance for a second, and thanks for giving us that? And just maybe at a high level, talk about the relative contribution from MUPs and ARPMUP? And then Jason, did you say that, that only includes state where you're live today. So should we expect that as you can add more states potentially, that could drift higher?\nJason Robins : Thanks for the great question. So yes, this only includes -- we have continued to follow a philosophy of only including states where we are either live or have a certain launch date and while we are hopeful that we will be able to add states like Michigan and Virginia next year, we don't know yet. So that's not included. Those states are not included in those numbers. The results were really driven by -- or excuse me, the increased guidance is really driven by the results we've seen in the last quarter. Particularly on the customer acquisition side, which is going to give us more revenue and hopefully continue to have more MUPs as well into next year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Chaiken for Credit Suisse.\nBen Chaiken : Ontario seems like a great opportunity. I don't know if you have any color on steps or timing? And then with regard to OSB versus iGaming, not sure if either segment has momentum or if it's an all or nothing dynamic? \nJason Robins: So Ontario, for those who are not familiar, added to their budget, a basically allowance for private operators to offer both sports betting and iGaming in the province. Ontario previously had only had a single operator, the province lottery that was operating sportsbook and iGaming, although some have been operating in the grey there for quite some time as well. Ontario is a very large province, it\u2019s Canada's largest province. If it were U.S. state, it would be a top 5 state. DraftKings has been present in Canada, including, of course, Ontario for almost a decade now. So we have a very nice sized user base there. And we think it could be a really great opportunity. As far as timing, I think, similar to some of the other processes you see with U.S. states, it's always not -- not always very clear exactly what the timing of process will be. But we think it was a great step to see Ontario put forth what they did, and we're very hopeful that we'll be able to add both sports betting and iGaming in Ontario sometime next year.\nBen Chaiken : Got you. And just a quick one. Is that something you anticipate needing a partner like most states in the U.S.? Or is it just going to be more similar to maybe how Tennessee is structured [or UK]?\nJason Robins : The indications we've been given is it will be a direct license. Obviously, anything could change, but that's what we've been so far told. So that's our expectation that we'd be able to, like Tennessee, obtain our own license.  I will say, though, that a lot has been left to the regulator. It was a very sort of brief change in terms of the budget and the law. So a lot is still left up to the discretion of the regulator, including questions like that.\nOperator: Next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.\nChad Beynon : From a product standpoint, on your sports wagers in the quarter, can you kind of help us think about what you\u2019ve learned about your database, meaning are your customers skewing more towards football than what you were originally thinking just because of the DFS or were there any surprises just in terms of kind of how the proportions split out with different sports?\nJason Robins : Great question. One of the challenges in even answering that is the sports schedule itself has been so strange this year. So looking at things like year-over-year comparisons or even comparing sport to sport has been challenging to draw conclusions from. From what we can see, the balance of sports is quite similar to what we've seen in the past and less in sports betting skewed towards NFL than in daily fantasy sports. However, NFL is definitely the largest sport both in daily fantasy sports and sports betting. It's just the gap is a little bit smaller. In part because things like college sports make up a little bit more of the room on sports betting, and they're not as popular on the daily fantasy sports side. But really tough to tell if anything has kind of changed this year as more states have done sports betting from what we can tell happened, but that's what the caveat there. Typically when we look at things, we look at year-over-year comparison to control for seasonality, and that obviously was not very possible this year. \nChad Beynon : Okay. Great. And then can you elaborate a little bit more on the ESPN sportsbook link-out, the timing of that and when the full integration will be in place?\nJason Robins: Yes, we're very excited about that. We have a great relationship with ESPN, Disney continues to be one of our largest shareholders. So, we think there's a great long-term relationship that we hope to build upon there. As far as timing of any individual features, we plan to announce anything that we do want to announce, in sort of our normal course as things roll out. So we don't have at this time anything that we\u2019re publicly saying about timing of any sort of direct integrations or other things, but teams are working very hard on it. So we hopefully will start to see some of the things very soon. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Rippey with Evercore ISI.\nKevin Rippey: I just had one on sort of marketing spend and the efficiencies you're seeing there. Looks like, marketing spend per MUP addition came down quite a bit. I am wondering if you could help us parse out how much of that comes by way of pent-up demand, given the unique sports calendar and how much of it is coming by way of internal efficiencies that you're driving? Thanks. \nJason Robins: That's a great question. That is a million dollar question that I don't know that I do have an answer for you. It's hard to quantify how much pent up demand is driving increased response, how much the stay at home nature of COVID is driving increased response, how much the overlap in fourth calendar is affecting thing. All those are new data points for us. So very tough to compare to other periods.  Overall, we're seeing great performance, the efficiency, the CAC is actually better than what we expected. And we were able to spend deeper at a lower CAC. So while it's hard to pinpoint exactly how much is sort of [relic] -- or not [relic] but a function of the current environment versus just better optimization. While that's tough to tell, we do know it's better. And I'm certain it's some combination that\u2019s just hard to kind of parse apart how much of each.  But the team is always optimizing the marketing. So I would always expect continued improvement. And then also, we're getting close. We're not quite there yet. But we're getting close to that 30% plus level of population having -- of U.S. population having sports betting, which then will allow those national marketing efficiencies to start to kick in. And I think that's part of why you're seeing us start to do some of these more national media deals. \nOperator: Next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. \nStephen Grambling: Hey, this is Stephen Grambling. I guess one just following up on the ESPN deal. And maybe I missed this. But are there any potential implications as you think about the impact to customer acquisition costs. And then also, if you can just touch on more broadly how you think about content and media as a future area of growth? \nJason Robins: So, our expectation, when we do any strategic deal is that it will have a positive effect on our customer acquisition costs. And the true win-win is when you're able to actually spend more at better efficiencies that benefits both the media company that's on the other side of the deal, as well as us. And I think the ESPN deal is a perfect example of that where they're allowing us access to inventory like link-outs and integrations that normally you can't buy on the open market. And those are very high performing from past experience that we've had in similar deals, as well as deals we've done on the daily fantasy side with ESPN in the past.  So we have a high degree of confidence that this is a win-win deal that should improve our customer acquisition efficiency over time. And certainly we're excited about partnering with ESPN as well as other great media partners like Turner that we form relationships with over the last quarter. \nStephen Grambling: Great. Maybe one quick follow-up on marketing and promotion, can you remind us of where you're kind of targeting the win rate? And does your flexible marketing approach try to manage around that? \nJason Robins: Sorry, can you repeat the question one more time? \nStephen Grambling: It's a question on marketing and promotions and where you kind of target win rate. And does your flexible marketing and promotion approach effectively enable you to manage around that. So should we be generally thinking that the win rate if it's higher, maybe you promote a little more? And if lower, promote a little bit less? \nJason Robins: It's a great question. I think, in effect, it sort of works that way. It's not exactly how we manage it. We look at promotion much like external marketing, based on an LTV analysis and the cost on the other side. And we look at whether we think that whatever value we're generating on an MPV basis exceeds whatever costs the promotion has, and that's quite very similarly, like our external media to new customer promotions, as well as promotions designed to reactivate or generate new sport play and things like that.  I think the effect though, just, practically is similar probably to what you're saying, because promotions will certainly work better in times where maybe the company is holding more and players are seeing less wins come forth versus in times where they're winning a lot. But that's not really the driving force behind how we manage it. That's just more of kind of a correlated output. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Kelly with Oppenheimer. \nJack Kelly: Just a couple. Can you sort of share how October is trending right now relative to your overall guidance? And then just with Illinois, you immediately launched there. You put some promotions. Is that state now starting to move the needle in revenue wise, or is it still not as much with some of the promotions? And then I have a follow-up. \nJason Robins: So the first -- I got Illinois, what was the first question again? \nJack Kelly: Just how is October trending relative to your overall 4Q guidance? \nJason Robins: You know, we haven't really said much about October, but as you see, we raised our Q4 guidance. So, prior to today, we had been guiding to a midpoint that would represent 22% year-over-year growth, we're now guiding to a midpoint that will represent 40% year-over-year growth. So fairly substantial increase to the Q4 guidance. So without commenting specifically on October, I can tell you, we feel very good about the way Q4 is trending.  And as far as Illinois goes, Illinois has now become our second largest state by handle behind New Jersey. It's also our fastest growing state. So we're pretty excited about it. I think you'll start to see some contribution on the revenue side in Q4. Usually the first couple months of a new state launch, we don't see a whole lot of contribution on the revenue side. Tennessee is a great example of that, where we just launched Tennessee, but we don't actually expect it to have a ton of any impact on revenue this year. Illinois, I think, will start to have some impact on Q4. And that is part of why we think that we're going to be better than where we thought we were previously in Q4 this year. \nJack Kelly : And then just a longer term question for you, Jason. You mentioned product development, on your integration with SBTech. And as we try to get into next year, what do you think is ultimately going to drive the customer stickiness in this industry? Is it going to be more product development, where you can actually generate or drive product differentiation among live betting? Or is it going to be more CRM management where you know how to manage the customer, provide them bonuses. Just how do you see long-term stickiness with the consumer?\nJason Robins: Well, we definitely try to have best-in-class product and CRM programs. We have a great data science team. And a lot of what we do is model driven. But I think if you want to kind of simplify it, we believe that promotions drive trial and activation, product drives long-term stickiness and monetization. And I think really, we feel that it's also a stage of the industry thing, we are just starting, haven't even you know migrated yet. We are just starting to put those investments behind building out that live betting and new forms of teasers prop and other things that you're going to see us develop in the coming years. And so I also think as the industry progresses, and we have more time and more energy that we have been able to put behind that, we feel we'll be able to put more and more distance between our product and customer experience. And what else is out there and I think that will increase the effect of that on stickiness over time. Right now, it's very much so many new states opening up, it\u2019s customer acquisition mode for everybody. And that's an important part of it, too. But people we believe will ultimately stick with the best experience. And that's what we're working hard to build.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: There's a lot of investor focus on gross to net win margins and concerns that there'll be impaired long-term, because of how competitive the market is right now. Can you discuss your thoughts on the topic?\nJason Robins: Yes. I mean, we're two years into the industry. Just to put in perspective, we had exactly two states, New Jersey and West Virginia live, it started last NFL season, we're in 10 states now. So, I think the long-term margins and other aspects of the industry are going to shake out over time. And we saw this in DFS. So it doesn't surprise me that those questions are coming up in the early days of daily fantasy sports. We ran at much lower margins than what we did longer term, and it ended up, once we move to more of the harvesting stage pretty quick, being a pretty easy change.  And then the last point I make is the margins are actually pretty good right now. Even when you factor in a lot of the promotional activity and free bet, that all comes out of our net revenue and net revenue is up significantly, 42% in Q3, we\u2019re guiding to 40% growth in Q4, 45% growth next year. So, if there is any upside on the margin, it should be on top of what is already a very healthy growing net revenue number. \nThomas Allen: And just a follow up on the similar topic. Where are you in terms of profitability in the more mature markets?\nJason Robins: We are planning. So more mature markets are really New Jersey and West Virginia, those are the only two that we weren't even presence last year at the start of NFL. So, we had in the past, right, some projections, multi-year projections on New Jersey, obviously COVID, do things for a loop. But we actually think we're in a pretty similar spot to where we had hoped to be. That said, we still have another month and a half of the year. So what we're planning to do is in our next earnings call in Q1 we will provide an update on New Jersey specifically. And we'll talk about how that's tracking versus what we have previously talked about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. \nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. Jason, just to follow up on that last question about the promotional piece, just should we think about modeling this a lot like the way -- the cadence or the way that external marketing spend work? So, obviously, as you're in the early phases of launch, those numbers are going to accelerate a lot and then it comes down over time. Or will the promotional piece -- and I'm really thinking about this net versus gross, will that actually come down faster, just given that it really applies more to sort of initial bonusing, like you said activation? \nJason Robins: I think that they really wish I thought of that, that\u2019s a great way to describe it. It's very correlated to the acquisition. Certainly, some promotions are aimed at activation, or getting people to try new sports or new products, but the bulk of the promotional dollars are aimed at acquisition. So as acquisition in any given state becomes less of a focus and even if we do continue to spend there, just as kind of we build our user base, naturally, new customers will be a smaller percentage of the total user base, absolutely we would expect promotional dollars to follow a similar trend. And it's really, as you kind of alluded to a new repeat mix thing that's driving it, it's not us deliberately doing anything differently.  Obviously, if we see things in the data that suggest something is not working, or working, we will alter. But even if that doesn't happen, just the simple shift between new customers being a very high percentage of our current actives, and eventually repeat being a much higher percentage for new sportsbook states, that will obviously change the promotional dollars, as well as the external marketing spend. \nShaun Kelley: Very helpful. And then just as a follow up, into these more mature markets, really it\u2019s pretty much probably a case study around New Jersey. Are you seeing any change in retention rates one direction or another? How is this all kind of -- how is the cohort trend like working relative to the some of the guidance, ands initial changes that you laid out, call it, back in March in April? \nJason Robins: We're seeing positive news on retention across the board, virtually every state that we were present in last year, again, with the caveat that it was a small number for sportsbook, we're seeing growth, New Jersey is way up year-over-year, even just the Masters which yesterday started New Jersey had a 181% increase in handle year-over-year for the Masters. So really tremendous growth in existing states and retention has been strong.  Some of that might be due to COVID and people staying home and so many sports on the calendar. But a lot of it I think is also due to us having optimized for -- having another year to optimize our CRM efforts. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. \nVasily Karasyov : Thank you. Good morning. So back early this year at the Analyst Day, you argued that a good proxy for us to model stays that you're rolling out and as New Jersey and that the revenue and gross profit and marketing spend index to 1% of the population should be more or less similar. So I was wondering if you could give us an update of if that is holding true right now in the states for comparable period -- compared to comparable period in New Jersey. And if it's still a good assumption, on average going forward? And if not, whether it's you think driven by big sports calendar, or it's just something systemic there? \nJason Robins: I think you mentioned the sports calendar, it's hard to compare this year. This has been such an unusual year. And we had only two states, New Jersey and West Virginia live at the start of last NFL, so most of the data we have is from a COVID impacted 2020. And really tough, I think, there's a difference, obviously in New Jersey, and that it had iGaming, so some of the states that had sports betting only that fell off of cliff I Q2. Very different story in New Jersey, where iGaming was still there to carry a lot of the weight during that period.  So very hard to compare. We're planning if we can, and we're certainly working hard analytically to do so to have a more definitive viewpoint on that at our next Analyst Day, which will be in Q1 of next year. So hopefully, we'll have enough data and enough things sort of back to, I guess normal as far as you can call anything normal, to be able to do that. But right now, we don't feel that we have enough data to really be able to compare state to state effectively. And we don't want to put anything out there that we're not very confident in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Erickson with Needham & Company.\nBrad Erickson: Can you just talk about the relative profitability levels you expect between sports betting and iGaming, and if they're different? And then I guess just philosophically, when you're looking at your P&L for iGaming next to sports betting in a particular state, you run them together more or less, given the cross sell synergies that they can drive and see where it's kind of less about one or the other being more profitable or they\u2019re just looked at separately, just maybe talk about your philosophy on that? \nJason Robins: We look at everything together. So, we view it as we have a platform, the user has an account and a wallet. And we want to maximize the amount of value that we can generate over the lifetime of that user. And we direct the team to do that in whatever way the data is suggesting is going to accomplish that goal. So in doing so, we don't really view product level economics as something that's relevant to how we analyze. There are some things, that you can attribute directly to a particular product, but a lot of things like promotion dollars, marketing spend, things like that are very hard to attribute to a particular product. And we don't want to unnecessarily and falsely attribute it to one or the other and make something look misleading or different that really isn't at all representative of how we think about it internally.  If you take only the things that you can directly attribute to sports betting and iGaming and take some of those other things out, the product actually have almost identical margins. I think there could be some evidence growing that iGaming might be a larger TAM ultimately. But I don't think aside from that, there'll be a difference in profitability, at least in the things that you can directly attribute to each product, which of course is not the entire P&L. \nBrad Erickson: And then maybe just a follow up if I can. I recognize most sports betting and iGaming are huge contributors to the growth right now. Can you just talk about DFS, and just what the growth trajectory looks like there? And sort of any sort of help on magnitudes we're seeing both in the results as well as the outlook for DFS growth?\nJason Robins: Yes, DFS has had a great year. Obviously COVID impacted the sports calendar. So Q2, we didn't see as much DFS activity as we typically do. But it really came roaring back in Q3. In particular, the August and September timeframes after NBA, NHL and, of course, eventually, college football and professional football became live. Just as an example, the Masters was up way year -- way up year-over-year for DFS. And right now, the team is trying to kind of parse apart how much of that is true growth. And how much of that is the Masters came on a different -- in a different part of the calendar this year. And oftentimes, what we see is when we have more activity, everything goes up. It's interesting, because a lot of people would ask us not to deviate from your question, but it's related a lot of people would ask that, hey do you expect iGaming just really grew in Q2, because there weren't a lot of sports and is it going to go down in Q3 and it's actually been the opposite, because we've had more activity on the platform that just lift everything. So DFS, I think, similarly, when you have so much sporting event overlap, like the Masters, for example, and this part of the NFL season. I'm not surprised we saw growth. So the team is working now to try to parse apart how much of that is natural growth that we feel will continue into future years and how much of it is really a function of just a very unique sports calendar this year.\nOperator: Next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. \nDavid Katz : I wanted to ask about in-game wagering in sports. And I hope you can accept the sport references. But what inning would you say that we're in, one, in terms of educating your customer base and in terms of the breadth of offering that you're at today and where you expect to be? And are there any particular interesting learning so far with NFL season to-date?\nJason Robins: Continuing with your sports analogy, based on analogy, I think we\u2019re in spring training. I don't think we're even in the first inning yet, it is super early. We have not even rolled out a lot of what we are developing on our own platform, because we haven't migrated over to our owned and operated platform yet. So there's a lot, it's going to take years to build. And then it'll obviously, also be alongside just the customers naturally, finding in game. But the two things will work in together, as the product offering improves, more customers will adopt it. But I think even if you just froze the product offering as is, you'd see more adoption over time as well. So both those things we think will have a very positive effect on each other and create a flywheel that will increase adoption of in-game betting at a rapid pace, once we're able to migrate over to our own platform. \nDavid Katz : And if you don't mind, I'd like to follow that up which is, do you expect or do you have any intelligence about the degree to which that brings new players in or expands wallets on existing players or some combination thereof. Just I guess prevent me from getting carried away -- prevent us from getting carried away as to how big -- how it ultimately could be?\nJason Robins: I think it'll have a combination -- you'll see a combination of both of those things, and there's other parts of the ecosystem that will affect that too. Our hope is that the sports leagues become increasingly comfortable with integrating some little prospects and in-game bets into their actual sports broadcast. And it's more things like that. You see ESPN effect that makes these things mainstream. The more adoption that you'll see and more that will have an effect on new customers. I am very confident that it's an increased retention and monetization play. And I think that can have an impact on new customers as well. But a lot of that will depend on to what degree the rest of the ecosystem evolves alongside and how quickly that happens. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company.\nMike Hickey: Just I guess -- I think I was just curious if you could I guess just pull back a layer on Tennessee, they had a sort of a rather [barbaric] 10% hold mandate within their regulatory construct. So I'm just curious if how that sort of shapes your success or not in that market and sort of moving over players from that market? I'm guessing you have some workarounds there. And then related when you look at Michigan and Virginia, and you get a sense of the regulatory construct, how much cleaner is that for players and operators and what you've seen in Tennessee? And then I have follow up. Thanks. \nJason Robins : Yes. Tennessee will be an interesting one because I think our ingoing belief is that by having higher mandated hold percentage it will be harder, as you noted, to compete with the illegal market and we might not see as much adoption, therefore. And we\u2019ve factored that into our numbers next year. We are assuming Tennessee, for that reason, doesn't perform as well as it otherwise would have, as a comparison to states that don't have that. That said, it could go the other way. It could be because there is an increased hold percentage. It could be that, that enough to offset whatever drop you see in adoption and migration from the illegal market. And we just don't know. So it will be an interesting experiment and like I said, our ingoing view is that it will have a negative effect, and that's why we've assumed that in our numbers for next year. But it could go the other way, and we'll have to see and I think that's one of the interesting aspects of this industry it's going state by state, different states are going to try different models. They're going to have different mixes of products. And our belief is that, that will lead to much faster and much more obvious determination of what the optimal model is, and it will lead to other states kind of gravitating in that direction. And certainly, I think, Virginia and Michigan are more approaching it the way that other states across the U.S. have done. But I'm actually kind of excited that Tennessee is, we love to test here. We love data. So it's an opportunity that we have to see how a different model could work and use that to inform what we think is appropriate going forward.\nMike Hickey : Nice. The second one for me. Just an update, if you would, maybe on the SBTech integration. I think you launched the app, your app in Ireland in combination with SBTech is sort of a test market, if I remember that correctly. Curious sort of how that's unfolding for you? And I know your deal with Kambi, I think, is the third quarter '21, but when you look at new markets, coming live here hopefully early \u201821, Michigan, Virginia, sort of at the moment now you think you could launch in those markets with SBTech versus Kambi? \nJason Robins : So everything is on track. We have previously said that we believe we will migrate in the second half of next year. And as you noted, our Kambi contract goes through end of September. So as of now, we are still feeling good about committing to that timeline. There might be an opportunity to accelerate it, and we'd certainly look at that. And that's been kind of leading to your question on Michigan, Virginia. It really depends on the timing of those. If they launch early next year as expected, I would expect that we will utilize Kambi. If they launch much later in the year, then it might be that we go on the platform that we now own and operate the SBTech platform. So we'll just have to see what the timing is on that, but we do feel like we continue to be on track for our migration commitment through the second half of next year, and we feel very good about either being able to meet that or exceed that expectation.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli : Acknowledging there's a lot of ambiguity in the outlook, but the $750 million to $850 million revenue guidance, can you guys talk a little bit about kind of what defines the end post of that guidance and kind of what are some of the key things that were pushing towards the high end and/or towards the lower end, acknowledging that states like Michigan and Virginia are not in there at this point?\nJason Robins : Yes. So you hit an important point. It is not any assumption around any new states, that's all upside. So that isn't it. I think it's just us being generally still at an early stage of this industry. We have several states that we've only recently launched. There are things like right now, Illinois has -- the governor has temporarily suspended a requirement to register in-person casino, that is taken Illinois from barely a market that registers for us to our second largest market behind New Jersey and our fastest growing. So I think pretty big deal, whether that continues to be extended for several months, and that could have a significant impact on our customer acquisition, and therefore, on our revenue for next year. So it's really a function of just some of those types of variables. And just being so new in so many states and not having the confidence in the precision yet to be able to pinpoint a type of range.\nCarlo Santarelli : Great, Jason. If I could just ask one follow-up. As it pertains to your customer acquisition, one thing that I think has stood out with you guys relative to peers has been kin of your aggressiveness towards the higher end, more of VIP type of sports betting customers specifically. Have you seen any of your peer start to change their strategy at all around kind of seeking that type of action or those types of players, especially in some of the newer markets, like in Illinois, for example? \nJason Robins : I think right now, we're seeing a pretty competitive market overall, and that includes the VIP, higher end segment of customers. I appreciate you saying that we're doing a good job there. I think a lot of that comes from having very strong analytics and discipline around using that data to make determinations on where we invest and where we don't. And I don't necessarily think we're being that much more aggressive than any competitors. I think we're just hopefully being a little bit smarter about where we choose to push and where we don't. And as we get more data, we should get better and better at that. And we feel like time is our friend, and we should be able to widen that, much the same as we feel like we should be able to continually put distance between ourselves and the competitors on the actual experience we can give those customers once they do join the platform.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back to Jason Robins for any closing remarks.\nJason Robins : Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We really appreciate your insightful questions and look forward to continuing our conversations with you. At DraftKings, we are excited about the future. We continue to build the quintessential sports brand and align with well-known media organizations, such as ESPN and Turner Sports as well as many major professional sports leagues and iconic franchises. We are well positioned with a strong debt-free balance sheet to capitalize on unique customer acquisition opportunities, enter new states as soon as practicable, drive continued product innovation to stay ahead of the competition and explore opportunistic and accretive M&A. I hope all of you stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking with everyone again soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, in recognition of Veteran's Day this week, I would like to thank our country's veterans for their sacrifices and service. In order to more directly support our veterans and their families, DraftKings has launched Tech for Heroes in 2018, a companywide initiative that provides veterans and military spouses with free comprehensive high-tech job skills training and connects veterans to DraftKings' employees who provide mentoring. Since launching the Tech for Heroes program, we have invested over a $1 million in providing three accredited training to veterans and their spouses across the country. I'm proud to announce that in 2021 we will be expanding the reach of our Tech for Heroes program and are committed to training approximately 250 veterans in 2021, double the number we trained this year. We want to give veterans and their spouses the tools they need to start a new career in tech or advance in their current position. Everyone at DraftKings is proud to do our part to thank veterans and their families for the sacrifices they make on our behalf. I would also like to thank our investors for their continued support and welcome those investors who joined us with our follow-on equity offering in October.  On today's call, we will cover the following topics:  First, I want to share some insight into our third quarter accomplishments. Next, I will provide an update on our recent state launches in the pipeline of new states. Third, I will discuss our product and technology investments as well as the migration to our in-house proprietary sports betting technology. Then before turning it over to Jason Park, I will share some insights into our sales and marketing approach and our recent equity offering.  DraftKings had a very productive third quarter on a number of different fronts. First, our Q3 performance confirms what we foreshadowed on our previous earnings call. The return on major sports has generated tremendous customer engagement. Third quarter revenue of $133 million was at the high end of the range we outlined in our recent S-1 and grew 42% year-over-year. In Q3, we also had more than 1 million monthly unique payers, which means the average for the month of July, August and September was greater than 1 million. Given the impact COVID had in July, monthly unique payers in August and September were higher than in July. We expect these positive trends to continue as shown by the very encouraging outlook for the fourth quarter that our 2020 guidance suggests.  As noted last quarter, there have been and may continue to disruptions in the sports calendar due to COVID. We are optimistic that sport will continue to be played and believe any disruptions will be short-term in nature and not impact the long-term prospects of the sports gaming industry or our competitive positioning. Looking ahead to 2021, we are likely to see another unique sports calendar with the NBA and NHL expected to kick off their season either later this year or early next year as compared to their typical start dates in October.  Second, we continue to build smart and effective relationships with media companies, including ESPN and Turner Sports, as well as professional sports teams, including the Chicago Cubs, the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles. These commercial and strategic agreements provide us with access to unique and valuable content, intellectual property, and marketing assets, as well as highly relevant target audiences in markets where sports betting has recently been legalized. We evaluate these opportunities with the same data driven approach we used to guide other areas of our business. We also strengthened our corporate foundation by appointing two new Board members, Jocelyn Moore and Valerie Mosley and we also added Michael Jordan to our team as a special advisor on our Board. I am excited to welcome Jocelyn and Valerie to our Board as they each bring unique skills, experiences and ideas, and they will each play an important role in shaping the future of DraftKings and helping us achieve our long-term goals.  Jacelyn's former roles, which includes serving as Executive Vice President of Communications and Public Affairs for the National Football League, equipped her with valuable insights into our customers as well as with respect to government and regulatory affairs. Valerie's experience in the investment management industry, which includes 20 years plus at Wellington provides us with an important voice on the capital markets front. The addition of Michael Jordan to the DraftKings team is also a great fit. Both Michael and DraftKings live and love to compete. Michael will provide input on a variety of dimensions including our focus on brand strategy, product development, inclusion, equity and belonging, marketing activities and other key initiatives. Turning to new U.S. states for DraftKings and legalization trends. In the third quarter we launched iGaming in West Virginia and sports betting in Illinois. Illinois, given its size and passionate sports fan base is a large and important market. The state was a focus of our Q3 marketing efforts and a key reason for the increase in third quarter sales and marketing expense. The governor's suspension of the state in-person registration requirement has enabled us to acquire players directly onto our mobile product. Our investments in technology, regulatory affairs and compliance put us in a great position to market to customers and launch mobile registration quickly. We are pleased to have launched mobile sports betting in Tennessee on November 1st. We are excited about entering another state with passionate sports fans and highly competitive teams both at collegiate and professional level. With our launch in Tennessee, DraftKings is now live in 10 states for mobile sports betting and live in three states for iGaming. As you also know, Virginia has legalized sports betting and Michigan has legalized both sports betting and iGaming. Those two states accounted for approximately 6% of the U.S. population. We are working together with state officials in Virginia and Michigan on regulations and licensing are hopeful that we will launch in each state at the earliest practicable opportunity. Last week, on Election Day, Maryland, South Dakota and the majority of parishes in Louisiana passed referendums in favor of sports betting. These three states in total account for approximately 3.5% of the U.S. population. The margins approving the referendums were decisive, showing the public support for sports betting is strong, and we are hopeful that this will help the momentum continue across the U.S.  As a reminder, launching in a new state is a multistep process. Legislators need to pass bills, regulations need to be written and licenses need to be granted. Last night's votes were certainly a good first step, though it is probable that these states will not have a material impact on our financials in 2021 and may not even launch until 2022.  In addition, Ontario's government recently presented its annual budget, which included language that would modify the longstanding statutory Internet gaming framework to allow private operators offering sports betting and iGaming products to operate in the province. This is exciting because Ontario is a large market for us. If there were a UFC, it would rank as fifth largest state by population. And we have offered our DFS product in Canada since 2012.  We are now two and a half years since PASPA was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. 21 states representing about 40% of the population have legalized sports betting. 14 states representing 26% of the population have legalized mobile sports betting. 12 of which representing 21% of the population currently have operators live. DraftKings is now live with mobile sports betting in 10 of those states, which is more than any other operator. These 10 states collectively represent about 20% of the U.S. population.  We continue to be very excited with the products and technology investments we're making as well as with our progress on the technology migration and business integration of SBTech. We anticipate completing the technology migration by the third quarter of 2021. And once we do so, our vertically integrated proprietary sports betting technology will create a sustainable and differentiated advantage for DraftKings. We also expect to benefit from a long-term improvement in our gross margin percentage once the migration is complete.  As a reminder, with the acquisition of SBTech, we now have almost 1,100 engineers worldwide dedicated to creating best-in-class technology and games and experiences for our users. During the third quarter, we launched our standalone casino app for iGaming in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We also launched Best Ball, which is our first season-long product for DFS. In addition, we introduced several new DraftKings created games for online casino including new versions of blackjack, roulette and baccarat.  Beyond our customer-facing investments, we continue to prioritize our internal capabilities around data science which drive our cross-sell and LTV to CAC metrics. With our technology, talent and resources as well as with our proprietary betting engine, we will be able to clearly differentiate our offering in the United States from any other gaming provider and create a sustainable advantage for DraftKings both as a B2C and B2B company.  Regarding B2B, we continue to obtain new business in international markets. In October, we announced the launch of PalaceBet, a mobile and online sportsbook powered by DraftKings B2B technology through our relationship with Peermont in South Africa. We also announced the renewal and expansion of our relationship with MansionBet, the Gibraltar based sports betting brand of Mansion Group, which is the leading provider of online gaming with a portfolio of well-known online casino brands and a sportsbook.  In the third quarter, we saw a significant increase in customer activity, as evidenced by our 64% year-over-year increase in MUPs for the quarter. On average more than 1 million monthly unique paying customers engaged with DraftKings each month during Q3.  A number of the factors we have discussed including the unique Q3 sports calendar, pent up demand, the earlier than expected mobile registration opportunity in Illinois, and the stay at home nature of COVID that made this a unique and valuable time for customer acquisition and our CAC came in better than our expectation.  We have confidence that our CAC levels are appropriate given our insight into our customers and revenue retention, which are the bedrock of our LTV calculation. Our sales and marketing approach is data driven. We base our decisions on the return on ad spend we are seeing, not on what our competitors are doing and leverage our data to optimize customer acquisition spending based on player profiles and preferences. This approach means that we'll spend more if the data indicates that we should, as was the case in Q3. We will take the same data driven approach always to our commercial and strategic agreements. For example, states with sports betting and iGaming generate higher customer LTVs, which informed our agreement with the Philadelphia Eagles. And our agreement with the Chicago Cubs, we considered the value associated with the potential to open a world class DraftKings sportsbook at Wrigley Field. Our agreements with sports media organizations like ESPN and Turner allow us to integrate our content, programming and collaborate on new content, which we believe will improve our overall marketing performance while advancing mainstream adoption of sports betting. Finally, our relationship with Bryson DeChambeau, the world's sixth ranked Golfer in 2020 U.S. Open Champion underscores the significance of golf within the gaming industry. Golf remains DraftKings fourth most popular daily fantasy sport. While our golf sportsbook handle has grown over 10 times year-over-year. I would also like to talk about our recent equity offering, which is the second one we've completed since going public including the rationale behind it and how I see things going forward. We conducted the October offering for two primary reasons. First, the process we are going through is part of the reality of transitioning from a VC-backed company to a publicly traded company. It is only natural for early private investors to exit their investment and realize the returns for their investors. The offering allowed us to smooth this process out by facilitating and organize an orderly process in anticipation for lockup restrictions on many shareholders that were set to come up on October 20th. In fact, now 80% of our common shares are unlocked at this point, and all of our shares will be unlocked at the beginning of January, after January 5th. We have provided more specific information regarding the unlocking of our shares in the earnings presentation which can be found on our Investor website.  Secondly, DraftKings has always been proactive with ensuring we are well-financed to pursue our growth objectives. We see a number of attractive avenues to deploy the capital we raise in ways that will create long-term value for our shareholders. This may include continued investment in customer acquisition, especially while the CAC remains very efficient, as well as positioning the business for the hopeful acceleration of state legalization.  In addition, while we have no specific M&A targets at this time, we are always considering companies that may help us fuel our growth and bring more excitement to the skin-in-the-game fans. As I look to the future, I am very confident in the continued growth of the online sports betting and iGaming market in the U.S. Though not a proxy for revenue, the handle growth figures we disclosed in our S-1 supports our OSB and iGaming TAM estimates as do the number of new users we are adding and the data that the states are reporting. DraftKings is well positioned to capitalize on the U.S. market growth as we expand our leadership position with live operations in more states than any competitor.  I will now turn the call over to DraftKings' CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our third quarter results and how we are currently thinking about the rest of 2020 and 2021. Thanks for the great question. So yes, this only includes -- we have continued to follow a philosophy of only including states where we are either live or have a certain launch date and while we are hopeful that we will be able to add states like Michigan and Virginia next year, we don't know yet. So that's not included. Those states are not included in those numbers. The results were really driven by -- or excuse me, the increased guidance is really driven by the results we've seen in the last quarter. Particularly on the customer acquisition side, which is going to give us more revenue and hopefully continue to have more MUPs as well into next year. So Ontario, for those who are not familiar, added to their budget, a basically allowance for private operators to offer both sports betting and iGaming in the province. Ontario previously had only had a single operator, the province lottery that was operating sportsbook and iGaming, although some have been operating in the grey there for quite some time as well. Ontario is a very large province, it's Canada's largest province. If it were U.S. state, it would be a top 5 state. DraftKings has been present in Canada, including, of course, Ontario for almost a decade now. So we have a very nice sized user base there. And we think it could be a really great opportunity. As far as timing, I think, similar to some of the other processes you see with U.S. states, it's always not -- not always very clear exactly what the timing of process will be. But we think it was a great step to see Ontario put forth what they did, and we're very hopeful that we'll be able to add both sports betting and iGaming in Ontario sometime next year. The indications we've been given is it will be a direct license. Obviously, anything could change, but that's what we've been so far told. So that's our expectation that we'd be able to, like Tennessee, obtain our own license.  I will say, though, that a lot has been left to the regulator. It was a very sort of brief change in terms of the budget and the law. So a lot is still left up to the discretion of the regulator, including questions like that. Great question. One of the challenges in even answering that is the sports schedule itself has been so strange this year. So looking at things like year-over-year comparisons or even comparing sport to sport has been challenging to draw conclusions from. From what we can see, the balance of sports is quite similar to what we've seen in the past and less in sports betting skewed towards NFL than in daily fantasy sports. However, NFL is definitely the largest sport both in daily fantasy sports and sports betting. It's just the gap is a little bit smaller. In part because things like college sports make up a little bit more of the room on sports betting, and they're not as popular on the daily fantasy sports side. But really tough to tell if anything has kind of changed this year as more states have done sports betting from what we can tell happened, but that's what the caveat there. Typically when we look at things, we look at year-over-year comparison to control for seasonality, and that obviously was not very possible this year. Yes, we're very excited about that. We have a great relationship with ESPN, Disney continues to be one of our largest shareholders. So, we think there's a great long-term relationship that we hope to build upon there. As far as timing of any individual features, we plan to announce anything that we do want to announce, in sort of our normal course as things roll out. So we don't have at this time anything that we're publicly saying about timing of any sort of direct integrations or other things, but teams are working very hard on it. So we hopefully will start to see some of the things very soon. That's a great question. That is a million dollar question that I don't know that I do have an answer for you. It's hard to quantify how much pent up demand is driving increased response, how much the stay at home nature of COVID is driving increased response, how much the overlap in fourth calendar is affecting thing. All those are new data points for us. So very tough to compare to other periods.  Overall, we're seeing great performance, the efficiency, the CAC is actually better than what we expected. And we were able to spend deeper at a lower CAC. So while it's hard to pinpoint exactly how much is sort of [relic] -- or not [relic] but a function of the current environment versus just better optimization. While that's tough to tell, we do know it's better. And I'm certain it's some combination that's just hard to kind of parse apart how much of each.  But the team is always optimizing the marketing. So I would always expect continued improvement. And then also, we're getting close. We're not quite there yet. But we're getting close to that 30% plus level of population having -- of U.S. population having sports betting, which then will allow those national marketing efficiencies to start to kick in. And I think that's part of why you're seeing us start to do some of these more national media deals. So, our expectation, when we do any strategic deal is that it will have a positive effect on our customer acquisition costs. And the true win-win is when you're able to actually spend more at better efficiencies that benefits both the media company that's on the other side of the deal, as well as us. And I think the ESPN deal is a perfect example of that where they're allowing us access to inventory like link-outs and integrations that normally you can't buy on the open market. And those are very high performing from past experience that we've had in similar deals, as well as deals we've done on the daily fantasy side with ESPN in the past.  So we have a high degree of confidence that this is a win-win deal that should improve our customer acquisition efficiency over time. And certainly we're excited about partnering with ESPN as well as other great media partners like Turner that we form relationships with over the last quarter. Sorry, can you repeat the question one more time? It's a great question. I think, in effect, it sort of works that way. It's not exactly how we manage it. We look at promotion much like external marketing, based on an LTV analysis and the cost on the other side. And we look at whether we think that whatever value we're generating on an MPV basis exceeds whatever costs the promotion has, and that's quite very similarly, like our external media to new customer promotions, as well as promotions designed to reactivate or generate new sport play and things like that.  I think the effect though, just, practically is similar probably to what you're saying, because promotions will certainly work better in times where maybe the company is holding more and players are seeing less wins come forth versus in times where they're winning a lot. But that's not really the driving force behind how we manage it. That's just more of kind of a correlated output. So the first -- I got Illinois, what was the first question again? You know, we haven't really said much about October, but as you see, we raised our Q4 guidance. So, prior to today, we had been guiding to a midpoint that would represent 22% year-over-year growth, we're now guiding to a midpoint that will represent 40% year-over-year growth. So fairly substantial increase to the Q4 guidance. So without commenting specifically on October, I can tell you, we feel very good about the way Q4 is trending.  And as far as Illinois goes, Illinois has now become our second largest state by handle behind New Jersey. It's also our fastest growing state. So we're pretty excited about it. I think you'll start to see some contribution on the revenue side in Q4. Usually the first couple months of a new state launch, we don't see a whole lot of contribution on the revenue side. Tennessee is a great example of that, where we just launched Tennessee, but we don't actually expect it to have a ton of any impact on revenue this year. Illinois, I think, will start to have some impact on Q4. And that is part of why we think that we're going to be better than where we thought we were previously in Q4 this year. Well, we definitely try to have best-in-class product and CRM programs. We have a great data science team. And a lot of what we do is model driven. But I think if you want to kind of simplify it, we believe that promotions drive trial and activation, product drives long-term stickiness and monetization. And I think really, we feel that it's also a stage of the industry thing, we are just starting, haven't even you know migrated yet. We are just starting to put those investments behind building out that live betting and new forms of teasers prop and other things that you're going to see us develop in the coming years. And so I also think as the industry progresses, and we have more time and more energy that we have been able to put behind that, we feel we'll be able to put more and more distance between our product and customer experience. And what else is out there and I think that will increase the effect of that on stickiness over time. Right now, it's very much so many new states opening up, it's customer acquisition mode for everybody. And that's an important part of it, too. But people we believe will ultimately stick with the best experience. And that's what we're working hard to build. Yes. I mean, we're two years into the industry. Just to put in perspective, we had exactly two states, New Jersey and West Virginia live, it started last NFL season, we're in 10 states now. So, I think the long-term margins and other aspects of the industry are going to shake out over time. And we saw this in DFS. So it doesn't surprise me that those questions are coming up in the early days of daily fantasy sports. We ran at much lower margins than what we did longer term, and it ended up, once we move to more of the harvesting stage pretty quick, being a pretty easy change.  And then the last point I make is the margins are actually pretty good right now. Even when you factor in a lot of the promotional activity and free bet, that all comes out of our net revenue and net revenue is up significantly, 42% in Q3, we're guiding to 40% growth in Q4, 45% growth next year. So, if there is any upside on the margin, it should be on top of what is already a very healthy growing net revenue number. We are planning. So more mature markets are really New Jersey and West Virginia, those are the only two that we weren't even presence last year at the start of NFL. So, we had in the past, right, some projections, multi-year projections on New Jersey, obviously COVID, do things for a loop. But we actually think we're in a pretty similar spot to where we had hoped to be. That said, we still have another month and a half of the year. So what we're planning to do is in our next earnings call in Q1 we will provide an update on New Jersey specifically. And we'll talk about how that's tracking versus what we have previously talked about. I think that they really wish I thought of that, that's a great way to describe it. It's very correlated to the acquisition. Certainly, some promotions are aimed at activation, or getting people to try new sports or new products, but the bulk of the promotional dollars are aimed at acquisition. So as acquisition in any given state becomes less of a focus and even if we do continue to spend there, just as kind of we build our user base, naturally, new customers will be a smaller percentage of the total user base, absolutely we would expect promotional dollars to follow a similar trend. And it's really, as you kind of alluded to a new repeat mix thing that's driving it, it's not us deliberately doing anything differently.  Obviously, if we see things in the data that suggest something is not working, or working, we will alter. But even if that doesn't happen, just the simple shift between new customers being a very high percentage of our current actives, and eventually repeat being a much higher percentage for new sportsbook states, that will obviously change the promotional dollars, as well as the external marketing spend. We're seeing positive news on retention across the board, virtually every state that we were present in last year, again, with the caveat that it was a small number for sportsbook, we're seeing growth, New Jersey is way up year-over-year, even just the Masters which yesterday started New Jersey had a 181% increase in handle year-over-year for the Masters. So really tremendous growth in existing states and retention has been strong.  Some of that might be due to COVID and people staying home and so many sports on the calendar. But a lot of it I think is also due to us having optimized for -- having another year to optimize our CRM efforts. I think you mentioned the sports calendar, it's hard to compare this year. This has been such an unusual year. And we had only two states, New Jersey and West Virginia live at the start of last NFL, so most of the data we have is from a COVID impacted 2020. And really tough, I think, there's a difference, obviously in New Jersey, and that it had iGaming, so some of the states that had sports betting only that fell off of cliff I Q2. Very different story in New Jersey, where iGaming was still there to carry a lot of the weight during that period.  So very hard to compare. We're planning if we can, and we're certainly working hard analytically to do so to have a more definitive viewpoint on that at our next Analyst Day, which will be in Q1 of next year. So hopefully, we'll have enough data and enough things sort of back to, I guess normal as far as you can call anything normal, to be able to do that. But right now, we don't feel that we have enough data to really be able to compare state to state effectively. And we don't want to put anything out there that we're not very confident in. We look at everything together. So, we view it as we have a platform, the user has an account and a wallet. And we want to maximize the amount of value that we can generate over the lifetime of that user. And we direct the team to do that in whatever way the data is suggesting is going to accomplish that goal. So in doing so, we don't really view product level economics as something that's relevant to how we analyze. There are some things, that you can attribute directly to a particular product, but a lot of things like promotion dollars, marketing spend, things like that are very hard to attribute to a particular product. And we don't want to unnecessarily and falsely attribute it to one or the other and make something look misleading or different that really isn't at all representative of how we think about it internally.  If you take only the things that you can directly attribute to sports betting and iGaming and take some of those other things out, the product actually have almost identical margins. I think there could be some evidence growing that iGaming might be a larger TAM ultimately. But I don't think aside from that, there'll be a difference in profitability, at least in the things that you can directly attribute to each product, which of course is not the entire P&L. Yes, DFS has had a great year. Obviously COVID impacted the sports calendar. So Q2, we didn't see as much DFS activity as we typically do. But it really came roaring back in Q3. In particular, the August and September timeframes after NBA, NHL and, of course, eventually, college football and professional football became live. Just as an example, the Masters was up way year -- way up year-over-year for DFS. And right now, the team is trying to kind of parse apart how much of that is true growth. And how much of that is the Masters came on a different -- in a different part of the calendar this year. And oftentimes, what we see is when we have more activity, everything goes up. It's interesting, because a lot of people would ask us not to deviate from your question, but it's related a lot of people would ask that, hey do you expect iGaming just really grew in Q2, because there weren't a lot of sports and is it going to go down in Q3 and it's actually been the opposite, because we've had more activity on the platform that just lift everything. So DFS, I think, similarly, when you have so much sporting event overlap, like the Masters, for example, and this part of the NFL season. I'm not surprised we saw growth. So the team is working now to try to parse apart how much of that is natural growth that we feel will continue into future years and how much of it is really a function of just a very unique sports calendar this year. Continuing with your sports analogy, based on analogy, I think we're in spring training. I don't think we're even in the first inning yet, it is super early. We have not even rolled out a lot of what we are developing on our own platform, because we haven't migrated over to our owned and operated platform yet. So there's a lot, it's going to take years to build. And then it'll obviously, also be alongside just the customers naturally, finding in game. But the two things will work in together, as the product offering improves, more customers will adopt it. But I think even if you just froze the product offering as is, you'd see more adoption over time as well. So both those things we think will have a very positive effect on each other and create a flywheel that will increase adoption of in-game betting at a rapid pace, once we're able to migrate over to our own platform. I think it'll have a combination -- you'll see a combination of both of those things, and there's other parts of the ecosystem that will affect that too. Our hope is that the sports leagues become increasingly comfortable with integrating some little prospects and in-game bets into their actual sports broadcast. And it's more things like that. You see ESPN effect that makes these things mainstream. The more adoption that you'll see and more that will have an effect on new customers. I am very confident that it's an increased retention and monetization play. And I think that can have an impact on new customers as well. But a lot of that will depend on to what degree the rest of the ecosystem evolves alongside and how quickly that happens. Yes. Tennessee will be an interesting one because I think our ingoing belief is that by having higher mandated hold percentage it will be harder, as you noted, to compete with the illegal market and we might not see as much adoption, therefore. And we've factored that into our numbers next year. We are assuming Tennessee, for that reason, doesn't perform as well as it otherwise would have, as a comparison to states that don't have that. That said, it could go the other way. It could be because there is an increased hold percentage. It could be that, that enough to offset whatever drop you see in adoption and migration from the illegal market. And we just don't know. So it will be an interesting experiment and like I said, our ingoing view is that it will have a negative effect, and that's why we've assumed that in our numbers for next year. But it could go the other way, and we'll have to see and I think that's one of the interesting aspects of this industry it's going state by state, different states are going to try different models. They're going to have different mixes of products. And our belief is that, that will lead to much faster and much more obvious determination of what the optimal model is, and it will lead to other states kind of gravitating in that direction. And certainly, I think, Virginia and Michigan are more approaching it the way that other states across the U.S. have done. But I'm actually kind of excited that Tennessee is, we love to test here. We love data. So it's an opportunity that we have to see how a different model could work and use that to inform what we think is appropriate going forward. So everything is on track. We have previously said that we believe we will migrate in the second half of next year. And as you noted, our Kambi contract goes through end of September. So as of now, we are still feeling good about committing to that timeline. There might be an opportunity to accelerate it, and we'd certainly look at that. And that's been kind of leading to your question on Michigan, Virginia. It really depends on the timing of those. If they launch early next year as expected, I would expect that we will utilize Kambi. If they launch much later in the year, then it might be that we go on the platform that we now own and operate the SBTech platform. So we'll just have to see what the timing is on that, but we do feel like we continue to be on track for our migration commitment through the second half of next year, and we feel very good about either being able to meet that or exceed that expectation. Yes. So you hit an important point. It is not any assumption around any new states, that's all upside. So that isn't it. I think it's just us being generally still at an early stage of this industry. We have several states that we've only recently launched. There are things like right now, Illinois has -- the governor has temporarily suspended a requirement to register in-person casino, that is taken Illinois from barely a market that registers for us to our second largest market behind New Jersey and our fastest growing. So I think pretty big deal, whether that continues to be extended for several months, and that could have a significant impact on our customer acquisition, and therefore, on our revenue for next year. So it's really a function of just some of those types of variables. And just being so new in so many states and not having the confidence in the precision yet to be able to pinpoint a type of range. I think right now, we're seeing a pretty competitive market overall, and that includes the VIP, higher end segment of customers. I appreciate you saying that we're doing a good job there. I think a lot of that comes from having very strong analytics and discipline around using that data to make determinations on where we invest and where we don't. And I don't necessarily think we're being that much more aggressive than any competitors. I think we're just hopefully being a little bit smarter about where we choose to push and where we don't. And as we get more data, we should get better and better at that. And we feel like time is our friend, and we should be able to widen that, much the same as we feel like we should be able to continually put distance between ourselves and the competitors on the actual experience we can give those customers once they do join the platform. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We really appreciate your insightful questions and look forward to continuing our conversations with you. At DraftKings, we are excited about the future. We continue to build the quintessential sports brand and align with well-known media organizations, such as ESPN and Turner Sports as well as many major professional sports leagues and iconic franchises. We are well positioned with a strong debt-free balance sheet to capitalize on unique customer acquisition opportunities, enter new states as soon as practicable, drive continued product innovation to stay ahead of the competition and explore opportunistic and accretive M&A. I hope all of you stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking with everyone again soon. Thank you."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we will be discussing our results on a combined company pro forma basis to improve comparability as if the business combination had closed on January 1, 2019. Pro forma means that we are including B2B for the 9 months ended September 30th for both 2019 and 2020 rather than just from April 24th through September 30 in 2020.  In Q3 2020, we delivered $133 million of revenue, a 42% year-over-year increase. These results were fantastic and would have been roughly $15 million stronger, were if not for the unusually low hold for NFL gains during the first 3 weeks of the season. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $321 million of pro forma revenue, representing 19% year-over-year growth, which obviously includes several months that were deeply impacted by COVID. Our B2C segment, which represents our U.S. product offerings of Daily Fantasy Sports, Sportsbook and iGaming generated $104 million of revenue in Q3, up 55% compared to the same period in 2019. We launched iGaming in West Virginia and online sports betting in Illinois during the third quarter, and we were live in 7 new states for NFL week 1 versus Q3 2019. These factors, combined with the packed sports calendar were the major drivers of our growth.  On a year-to-date basis, our B2C segment has grown 29%. B2C monthly unique payers in the quarter increased 64% year-over-year to $1.02 million. The increase reflects strong unique payer retention and acquisition across DFS, OSB and iGaming. On a year-to-date basis, MUPs have increased 20%. MUPs also grew at an impressive year-over-year rate in October as we continue to realize the positive impact of our external marketing spend. Average revenue per monthly unique payer, or ARPMUP, was $34 in Q3, representing a 6% decrease versus the same period in 2019. Our ARPMUP was impacted by the aforementioned low NFL hold and promotional activity, offset by increased engagement with our iGaming and online sportsbook product offerings. On a year-to-date basis, ARPMUP has increased 7% versus 2019. Turning to our B2B results. Our B2B business generated $29 million of revenue in the quarter, a very solid 11% growth rate compared to the same period in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter widened to negative $197 million as we rolled out our new state playbook in multiple jurisdictions and continue to invest in our product, technology and G&A functions. Gross margin rate for the business declined as we shifted our business away from higher-margin DFS as well as increased promotional activity. GAAP gross margin rate declined more due to the amortization of acquired intangibles related to the business combination.  Our sales and marketing spend was $203 million on a GAAP basis and $191 million after excluding stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization. The year-over-year increase in marketing investment had a positive impact, as you can see from the increase in our MUPs. The majority of the $191 million in Q3 sales and marketing spend was for external marketing. The primary driver for our year-over-year increase in external marketing is that we had 7 states where we were live for the first time for NFL week 1, including Illinois. In addition, the pent-up demand and unique sports calendar combined for strong engagement and return on advertising spend.  Products and technology and general and administrative expenses were $54 million and $127 million on a GAAP basis, respectively, and $31 million and $36 million, respectively, after excluding stock-based compensation, transaction expenses and other non-cash and non-recurring charges. The year-over-year growth in these cost categories was primarily from headcount increases, including the annualization of hires we made in 2019.  Moving on to our balance sheet and liquidity. We are well capitalized to execute our multi-year plan and address our key priorities of taking advantage of this unique time for customer acquisition, entering new states as they legalize, continuing to lead the market on product innovation and exploring opportunistic and accretive M&A. We ended the third quarter with $1.1 billion of cash on our balance sheet and no debt. Taking into account our follow-on equity offering in October as well as a $295 million use of cash to net settle restricted stock units, we expect our cash balance to be approximately $1.7 billion at year-end.  Regarding the net share settlement, the RSUs that vested on October 20th resulted in a requirement for the company to withhold taxes. The company held back shares to satisfy the withholding obligation, delivered only the net shares to the participants and pay the taxes. As a result, we reduced our diluted share count by about 2%. I want to reiterate that no shares of Class A common stock were transferred or sold by our officers in connection with the vesting of these RSUs or the October offering, other than the shares withheld by the company, which are reported as a disposition of shares.  Having now generated $321 million of pro forma revenue in the first 9 months of 2020, we are increasing our guidance from $500 million to 540 million, to $540 million to $560 million of pro forma revenue for the full year, which equates to year-over-year growth of 25% to 30%. This increase reflects strong performance in October and substantial user activation due largely to our Q3 marketing spend. We assume that all sports calendars will continue as announced and that we continue to operate in states in which we are live today. The range also assumes that the Governor of Illinois does not extend the suspension of the in-person registration requirement. Future revenues and marketing spend will be higher for each month, Illinois chooses to extend the suspension.  In terms of MUPs and ARPMUP, we expect MUP growth for the full year 2020 to exceed 2019's growth rate, while ARPMUP growth for 2020 is expected to be below 2019's growth rate but slightly higher than our year-to-date growth rate.  Turning to pro forma adjusted EBITDA. We are continuing to invest in marketing, given the strong marketing spend efficacy we are seeing as well as our investment in the launch of sports betting in Tennessee. As a result, we expect our adjusted EBITDA loss in Q4 to be a little more than half of the loss recorded in Q3, again, based on the states in which we are live today.  As a reminder, our marketing spend is highly flexible and it can be reduced or paused altogether if the sports calendar shifts. In the future, we expect to provide full year guidance only once annually, on our year-end call. However, since we provided a 2021 revenue outlook of $700 million during the de-SPAC process and because we are seeing strong results from recent marketing investments, we want to provide an update on our 2021 revenue outlook on this call. Though we are still in the process of finalizing our 2021 plans, we believe that our 2021 revenues will likely be in the range from $750 million to $850 million. This range is based on the same assumptions we used for our 2020 guidance, in particular for all professional and college sports calendars that have been announced come to fruition, including the commencement of their 2020 to 2021 seasons, and that we continue to operate in states in which we are live today, which collectively represent 20% of the U.S. population for mobile sports betting and 7% of the U.S. population for iGaming.  We will continue to refine and update our internal budgets as we move through Q4, and we'll issue formal 2021 revenue guidance on our Q4 and full year earnings call.  That concludes our remarks. And we will now open the line up for questions."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stanton Dodge, Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nStanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Statements we make during the call that are not statements of historical facts constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility for updating forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties, and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. During the call management will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe, may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC and in our earnings presentation which is available on our website at investors.draftkings.com. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer, DraftKings who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open up the line for questions. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I want to thank all of the healthcare providers across the country who continue to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the essential workers who keep our lives moving forward, as well as our employees for their continued focus and dedication during this unprecedented and challenging time. I continue to be tremendously impressed with the productivity of our employees across all of our functions, especially our product and technology teams. And we're driving our priorities forward even in a work-from-home world. We at DraftKings have had many conversations with our employees, our executive team and our Board to listen, learn and reflect on how we as an organization can do better to support and foster racial equality in the fight against injustice in America. We believe that the best innovation comes from diverse perspectives, thoughts, beliefs, ideas and experiences. We work hard to foster a culture of inclusion and belonging that makes our employees feel safe, empowered, engaged, championed, and inspired to be the very best. As a first step, we hired a Head of Inclusion, Equity and Belonging just under a year-ago and together are committed to allocating at least $1 million annually to support our company's goals, the progress already being made. Some examples include ongoing inclusive leadership training at all levels of the company, including training to better understand behavioral unconscious bias, micro messages and signals, enhancing our support and fostering and diversity within the organization through more targeted efforts on college campuses and increased partnerships for non-traditional pipelines among other things such as Boot Camp. And we have established Global Business Resource Groups to ensure our employees feel supported and heard across the organization. We'll continue to grow our efforts to support our employees, our fans, and our community. I'd also like to thank our investors large and small and give a special welcome to those investors who joined to support us on our journey with our follow-on equity offering in June. On today's call, I will cover four main topics. First, I would like to share a little insight into our performance over the last few weeks since major sports have begun to return. Second, I will share an update on our recent state launches in the pipeline of new state. Third, I'll review our recent product innovations and exciting new releases. And finally, I'll provide an update on the integration of our B2B business and the migration to our in-house proprietary technology platform. We had a strong second quarter given the limited sports calendar with second quarter pro forma revenue of $75 million. As sports have started to return, we saw revenue improve sequentially each month in the quarter, with June revenue increasing 20% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. This strong overall results and improvement are due to our product innovation, our entry into new jurisdiction, and pent-up demand for sports betting as Live Sports like Golf, European Soccer, NASCAR and UFC started to return. To give you a sense of demand, in the absence of major sports, I wanted to provide a couple of highlights. Top NASCAR races, which has traditionally been a new sport for us, saw similar action to popular NBA regular season game. In Golf, prior to this year, our top event of all time was the 2019 U.S. Open. Since the restarted PGA Tour, six PGA Tour events and the Match II have topped that major. In both May and June, we more than tripled our previous best month for UFC handle. The momentum we saw in June accelerated with the return of MLB, the NBA, and the NHL in late July and early August. As a result, we're seeing continued year-over-year revenue growth in the first part of Q3. Not only did the Yankees national game on opening night set records at DraftKings, it was also ESPN's most watched opening night baseball games ever, and the most watched regular season baseball game on any television network since 2011. In the first two weeks of MLBs return, we saw three times the handle compared to the first two weeks of the 2019 MLB season. In the first week of the NHL\u2019s return, our handle is more than twice the handle of first week of 2019 NHL playoff. With the NBA Christmas Day 2019 was our highest handle day, but four of the next five highest handle days occurred in the first week of the NBA\u2019s return. All of these statistics, I provided are just to give you a sense of this unique period and are on a normalized basis and that they do not include the effect of new states that are not necessarily indicative of our future performance. As you can see from these fantastic statistics, there is clearly pent-up demand that is compounded by a truly unique sport calendar. A byproduct of this demand is that we\u2019re seeing very strong marketing response rates and return on advertising spend. And in response to these great returns, we intend to invest to expand our leadership position in the market. We're really excited that sports have begun to return, but we all realize that there have been and there continue to be hiccups in the sports calendar in the back half of the year. We think leads and associations are doing a great job ensuring the safety and health of the athletes and staff, and we're optimistic that sports will continue to be played to schedule. Even if there are short-term hiccups, we have more conviction than ever in the long-term prospects of this industry and of our competitive position. Turning to legalization trend. We're extremely excited to be one of the first to launch sports betting in Colorado. We also launched iGaming in Pennsylvania in the second quarter. More recently, we launched iGaming in West Virginia and sports betting in Illinois. With these launches, DraftKings is now live in nine states for mobile sports betting and in three states for iGaming. And as you know, Virginia and Tennessee have already legalized online sports betting and Michigan has legalized both online sports betting and iGame. These three states account for 8% of the U.S. population. Separately, we're working together with state officials on regulations and licensing and look forward to launching as soon as possible. Finally, we're seeing great momentum across multiple states and continue to work to bring legal sports betting to more Americans. In the second quarter, we continue to develop innovative content and product. This is a key component of our long-term strategy, and is been critical to keeping our existing users engaged as sporting events were suspended or postponed. With the Match II, we elevated our content to engage consumers during a time when very few sports were being played. This event broke new ground in terms of integrations and customer engagement, with the broadcast showing live odds for the event winners as well as a variety of exciting new game market. The Match II is our biggest golf betting day ever, and we believe that event just scratches the surface of potential possibilities for similar integrated content. As another example, we significantly expanded our eSports offering and have seen exponential growth in this category. We added popular Madden simulated games and began to include streaming sports within our app, which has become a very popular feature. In fact, since the return of the NHL, the NBA, and Major League Baseball, users have continued to engage with eSports, which gives us confidence in that product\u2019s future. We launched a variety of free-to-play pools that covered everything from politics to the NFL Draft as well. And more recently, we continue to align ourselves with fun moments in American culture like the 2020 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating contest that was held in July. We also launched our standalone casino app for iGaming in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. This app is geared towards the casino-first player and features the same seamless, single platform, and wallet experience that users are accustomed choosing DraftKings. As we think about the future, we know that the best product and technology combined with innovation focused on the U.S. sports fan will be the winning combination in this industry. And I'm excited about the continued innovation that we see from our team of approximately 850 engineers. Our engineers are delivering on an innovation-related product roadmap empowered by our own vertically integrated technology stack. In terms of our organizational migration, and integration of that technology stack, I could not be more pleased with our progress. We're on track with the technology migration in our business integration and are working together extremely well as one company. Our technology migration is on track to be completed by no later than end of September 2021. When the migration is complete, our vertically integrated proprietary sports betting technology will create a sustainable and differentiated advantage for DraftKings. Looking forward, with over $1.2 billion in cash on our balance sheet and zero debt, DraftKings is well-positioned to build upon the growth of the online sports betting and iGaming market in the U.S. We will continue to bring new and innovative products to the market that strengthen our engagement with customers and maintain our competitive differentiation. Our second quarter performance validates this approach and is a testament to the company's resiliency, and our ability to respond in real time to changes in the sports calendar. The U.S. market is still in the early stages with many years of growth ahead. We will continue to invest in our core competitive advantages to grow and lead the way in the digital sports entertainment and gaming industry. These competitive differentiators include our mobile first DNA and our relentless focus on user experience. Our commitment to the development of innovative products as the primary means of engaging and retaining users built on our proprietary vertically integrated technology platform. Very high brand awareness and trust in addition to a large and growing customer base that includes potential customers in states which has yet to legalize online sports betting and/or iGaming. Our proven technology that allows us to enter new jurisdictions quickly and effectively including our single wallet and scalable regulatory platform. Our strong data science and capabilities around cross-sell and our ability to operate a highly analytical and data driven marketing machine at scale. These strengths have served us well as a DFS operator and will also differentiate us as a digital sports entertainment and gaming company. From a financial perspective, our business model features compelling unit economics due to our strong LTV intact metrics which are driven by our DFS database and strong brand recognition as well as our marketing and cross-sell capabilities. Additionally, we have a state entry playbook that has proven to be both successful and supportive of long-term profitability in each jurisdiction we enter. Our focus areas for the company remain the same. We're lasered in on entering new states as soon as possible. We believe that the best product is what will ultimately win with the U.S. sports fan. As a technology first organization, we'll continue to invest in our capabilities as we look to stay ahead of the competition and truly differentiate our products. Also, we continue to work towards migrating to our own proprietary technology platform. We'll be taking advantage of unique tack opportunities in the second half of 2020, as we're seeing strong response rate signaling what could be a very productive NFL season from a customer acquisition and activation perspective. And lastly, we'll continue to explore opportunistic M&A. By executing on these focused areas, we will build the best most trusted and most customer centric destination for Skin in the Game fan, offering the most entertaining real money gaming products that will forever transform the way people experience sports. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings, CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our second quarter results and outlook for the rest of 2020.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason, and good morning everyone. Before jumping in, I wanted to remind everyone that the business combination was completed on April 23, 2020, and therefore we will be discussing results on a combined company pro forma basis to improve comparability, as if the business combination had closed on January 1, 2019. Pro forma means that we're including B2B for the entire period of Q2 rather than just from the April 24 through June 30 period. We're proud to announce that we delivered $75 million of pro forma revenue in Q2 2020. These results are very strong given the impact COVID-19 has had on the sports calendar. As sports have returned, we saw monthly revenue improve sequentially throughout the quarter with June pro forma revenue increasing 20% year-over-year. Notably, our year-to-date pro forma revenue through the first half of 2020 grew by 7% even with the impact of COVID. Our B2C segment which represents our U.S. product offerings of daily fantasy sports, sportsbooks, and iGaming generated $56 million of revenue in Q2, down just 2% versus that same period in 2019. We benefited from the product and content innovations we brought to market in DFS and OSP, such as eSports, as well as from our entries into Colorado for sports betting and Pennsylvania for iGaming both of which launched in the second quarter. In addition, our iGaming product offering was especially resilient in the second quarter, as it was not impacted by the sports calendar and perhaps even benefited from people staying at home. As you might expect, given the COVID pandemic, our B2C monthly unique payers in the quarter declined 35% year-over-year to 295,000. More than 100% of the decline was from our daily fantasy sports MUPs, which is both our largest source of monthly unique payers and the product offering that has been most impacted by the disruption in this sports calendar. MUPs improved in late May and June as some sports resumed their schedules. On the other hand, ARPMUP increased 51% in Q2 to $63 from $42 in the same period in 2019 which was predominantly driven by a mix shift into our iGaming product offering. Turning to our B2B results, our B2B business generated $19 million of pro forma revenue in the quarter, down 26% compared to the same period in 2019. COVID-related sports calendar disruptions resulted in a decline in player activity. Although the trend improved significantly in May and June, as the Bundesliga, Premier Liga, La Liga, and the English Premier League all resumed their season. On a combined company pro forma basis adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $60 million, as we were able to control our costs throughout the quarter, as sports resumed in May and June, and in anticipation of major sports resuming in July, we invested in marketing. Gross margin rate for the business declined on a pro forma and a GAAP basis as we saw an abnormal shift in users out of our highest margin DFS product offerings due to COVID. In addition, from a GAAP perspective, COGS was impacted by the amortization of acquired intangibles related to the business combination. Product and technology and general and administrative expenses grew year-over-year on a pro forma basis primarily due to headcount investments from 2019. On a GAAP basis, G&A expense grew due to a large amount of non-cash and one-time expenses such as stock-based compensation and transaction-related fees from the business combination and the follow-on equity offering. Sales and marketing spend increased year-over-year on a pro forma and GAAP basis primarily due to the six new states that became operational in Q2 of 2020 versus Q2 of 2019. We began to invest in advertising in late May and June, as sports begins to resume, and we saw very strong results in terms of advertising efficacy on user acquisition. We continue to advertise to prime the pump in anticipation of the return of major sports leagues in July and are pleased with our marketing efficacy which we believe to be a reflection of the pent-up demand as well as the unique sports calendar. Moving on to our balance sheet and liquidity, we're well capitalized with just over $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet as of June 30 and no debt. During the second quarter, we completed three significant capitalization events. First, we closed our business combination with Diamond Eagle and SPTech. Second, we called DraftKings' 16.6 million public warrants. And finally, on June 23, we issued 16 million shares in a follow-on equity offering. We're well capitalized to execute our multi-year plan and address our key priorities of entering new states that have been legalized, continuing to lead the market on product innovation, and exploring opportunistic and accretive M&A. Having now generated, $189 million of pro forma revenue in the first half of the year, we're guiding to a range of $500 million to $540 million of pro forma revenue for the full-year, which equates to year-over-year growth of 22% to 37% in the second half. This range assumes that all professional sports calendars that have been announced come to fruition through the end of the year, including the commencement of the 2020 to 2021 season, and that we operate in states in which we are live today. In light of recent cancellations by certain collegiate conferences, our guidance does not include college sports. However, we're cautiously optimistic that college sports will be played in some form. In terms of quarterly seasonality compared to the seasonality disclosure in the Analyst Day presentation that is available on our Investor Relations website, we expect to make up for half of the lower Q2 actuals on a seasonal percentage basis in Q3, and half in Q4. In terms of MUPs and ARPMUPs, we expect both MUP and ARPMUP growth rate for 2020 to be in line with 2019 growth rates for the full-year, with quarterly MUP growth in line with revenue growth and quarterly ARPMUP growth reflecting normalization of our product offering mix with the return of sports. Turning to our pro forma adjusted EBITDA, we're investing in marketing that will result in shorter-term EBITDA losses, but consistent with our strong LTV to CAC metrics will lead to performance in future periods consistent with our new state playbook. The Q3 calendar is very unique with all four major U.S. sports leagues commencing play within a seven-week period, which includes the beginning of the NFL season. Given this unique sports calendar investment to implement our new state playbook in Colorado, Illinois, and incremental investment for states in which we launched in late 2019, we expect our Q3 pro forma adjusted EBITDA loss to be wider than Q4. As long as we continue to see very attractive marketing spend efficacy like we have in recent months, we will continue to invest in advertising in a significant way during the second half of 2020. As a reminder, our marketing spend is highly flexible and can be reduced or paused all together as the sports calendar shift. Looking beyond 2020, we're beyond excited about our long-term growth expectations. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the lineup for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nThomas Allen: Hey, good morning, guys. In terms of monthly unique payers and average revenue per player, it's hard to read too much into the 2Q numbers just given COVID, can you guys talk a little bit about what trends you've seen in July and August to-date? Thanks.\nJason Robins: So we aren't disclosing specific metrics for July and August. But as you can expect with a number of major sports resuming or starting their seasons, we've seen a strong uptick in our active users. And the hope is that that continues to be a trend through the start of the NFL season.\nThomas Allen: Okay, helpful, thank you. And then, there is a lot of focus yesterday and then today on this IRS memo that came out suggesting that DFS should be subject to federal excise taxes on wagering. Can you just give us some more color on what your thoughts on there. We estimate it could be somewhere between a $20 million to $30 million annual tax. Is that a fair estimate? And then any way to estimate how much if it does go through the retroactive payment would be, if that does happen? Thank you.\nJason Robins: Yes. So first of all, we have been involved in an audit with the IRS for many years, and that's something that continues to go on. This was a memo that has no force of law, is non-binding. And our view is deeply flawed in its analysis. And our position continues to be, which we believe has been reaffirmed to state legislators and courts throughout the country that DFS is not wagering. And we believe that arguments at the federal level are incredibly strong. And that many courts and legislatures have affirmed that. So that's going to continue to be an ongoing process. I expect it could take quite some time to resolve. So at this time, we don't have any estimates of what the ultimate resolution could look like. And our belief continues to be that our position is correct one.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord. You may proceed with your question.\nMichael Graham: Hey, good morning and thank you. I just wanted to ask two things. The first is you talked about in your slide deck, and thanks for that info, a new state playbook and external marketing. And I just wonder if you could give us a little more detail about, what's new about the -- about that state playbook. And then I just wanted to ask because eSports is going so well. Could you give us an update on any progress in migrating from DFS into OSP products for eSports? Thank you.\nJason Robins: Sure. So just to clarify, I think probably we didn't phrase it as clearly as we could have. When we say new state playbook, we don't mean anything new is about the playbook, it's a playbook for new states. So, what Jason Park was referring to is we have multiple states that we have launched this year. We also have several other states that were not live going into last year's NFL season. In fact, we only have two states live going to last year's NFL season. That would be New Jersey and West Virginia. Every other state was launched either during the season or after. So we have a number of new states meaning new Sportsbook, sorry, states this year to start NFL and as you probably can guess from looking at our past years, this is the most important time for us to invest in customer acquisition and tend to have the best response rate. So we expect to see with all these states that we're not live, the beginning of next NFL really robust returns on our marketing spend, and you couple that with what we've been seeing over the last couple of months. First, in the pandemic, even as you know, very small number of sports started to trickle back with PGA Tour, NASCAR, UFC, all the way through the start of MLB and resumption of NHL and NBA. We're seeing record response rates and have continued to be able to acquire above our targets at lower [CAGs]. So if that is any indication of what this fall could look like we think that coupled with the new states that are now live at the beginning of the NFL season, could prove to be a really strong period for us to be able to invest in acquiring new customers.\nMichael Graham: Thanks. And then any thoughts on the eSports DFS to OSB possibility?\nJason Robins: Absolutely. eSports I think we've talked about this really from day -- from the first moment we announced that we are going public. We believe eSports is going to be a huge category it's when not if. And I think like many things during the pandemic, sometimes what you see is an acceleration when you get an economic and sort of world shock like that, you more than see new things, see an acceleration of trends that were already happening. And I think eSports is probably the best example of that where, I believe we fast forward years ahead over the last few months in terms of the potential growth and ultimate trajectory to the eSports market. There are still only a handful of states that allow for betting on eSports. That's something we continue to work with regulators on. And I believe, as more and more comfort gets developed, you'll be able to see more opportunities throughout the states to bet on eSports. Right now, because of that, we focused more so on fantasy, on daily fantasy, which has been incredible amount of growth, but we believe ultimately eSports betting will be if not the biggest, certainly one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long-term. It's really a question of when.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital. You may proceed with your question.\nRyan Sigdahl: So just curious what early learnings are, or what you have on the standalone online casino apps in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, really how do they compare versus the iGaming play in your combined app?\nJason Robins: Well, I think they both serve a very important purpose. For customers that prefer a sports betting first experience we still want to make it easy and convenient for them to be able to partake in other sorts of games like online blackjack, if they like. But there are customers that prefer an online gaming first experience and really don't care as much about sports betting or if they do, it's secondary for them. So we want to be able to create an experience for both customers. The reality is that there's so much crossover that we feel it's important to have integrations in both apps. But naturally there is a customer that's going to be thinking sports betting first and customer that's going to be thinking casino first. And that's both helpful in terms of experience and retention of customers but also for new customer acquisition. As you can imagine advertising online blackjack and then driving people to download a Sportsbook app doesn't convert as well as advertising online blackjack and then driving people to download an online casino app. So we also are seeing some very promising and exciting results as we've transitioned our iGaming marketing to focus more on the standalone casino app.\nRyan Sigdahl: Great. Then just on some product development, how is the in-game betting technology progressing and then what should we expect there for the upcoming football season?\nJason Robins: We're incredibly excited about the progress we're making there. We actually have a number of new things that we believe will be ready to roll-out over the next several months. That said we are still in the process of migrating to our own proprietary software that will probably take at least another year or so. So we will not necessarily be able to showcase on DraftKings, some of the new innovation in technology that we're developing in live betting until sometime next year. But I think that gives us even more time to innovate. So I really expect next NFL season is where you start to see a real meaningful difference between some of the offerings you saw in the past when it comes to NFL live betting and what you'll see in the 2021 season.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Kelly with Oppenheimer. You may proceed with your question.\nJack Kelly: Great, thanks for taking my question. Just as you start to enter new states, if you're seeing other players where it's currently offering a lot of incentives, where -- how long do you kind of see incentives being the key driver of customer acquisition channel versus your product actually creating user stickiness? And then on the iGaming you were starting to see the New Jersey iGaming revenue, it's actually bigger than sports betting even when sports were going on, you think that market opportunity is bigger than you thought it was back in March?\nJason Robins: Regarding incentives, we think of incentives much in the same way, as we think of any marketing meaning media purchase, or any other sort of marketing that we do, it's all oriented around getting a good return. And there are certainly incentives that are designed more and those are the most aggressive ones for new customer acquisitions. And then there are others that are designed more to retain. If you look at our longer-term projection, we expect the, kind of steady state incentives to be in the low 20% ish range of gross revenue. And that would be approximately 1% of handle a little bit more. So that's sort of where we see it netting out and I think that that's going to be still a mix of new customers obviously, we'll always be acquiring new customers on a platform and repeat. But really as just naturally your base transforms from most of the activity coming from repeat customers versus new, that'll come down. And then as you noted, when we combine that with some of the investments that we're making over the next year or two in product, we believe that that will even more improve our retention numbers. And the way I guess, you can view it is not to say there's no use of incentives in -- in retention, there is some but really, incentives are more designed to drive trial and product and experience is designed to retain and create the highest LTVs in loyalty. And that's really how we think about the kind of full funnel. Regarding iGaming, I think you're spot on. It is perhaps a bigger opportunity than we or others we're getting a credit for, obviously still a very important variable around how many states ultimately decide to move forward with it which we'll have to see based on some of the budget deficits, if that accelerates or doesn't. But certainly within the markets that we have iGaming, the performance has been incredible during COVID. And we don't necessarily think that it's just because of that, we think that it's just a market that could potentially be larger than anybody originally thought. So we're very excited about that. That's why we shifted so much investment into things like our standalone casino app and other product enhancements that we've put out there. We have several 100 games now that we offer, including many of our own proprietary games that we've developed in-house. We're going to continue to make those investments as long as we continue to be excited about that product.\nJack Kelly: And then just one more on Illinois, is there any way to get your products closer to the Chicago land area?\nJason Robins: Well, certainly that's something that we've had discussion about. And I think the thing to remember with Illinois and feels like a long time given how much has happened early in the market, but it really isn't. The statute calls for 18 months after the first operator goes live, they can begin to issue mobile licenses. And once one of those is issued, doesn't matter who it's issued to the requirement to register in person goes away. So our hope is that that happens, at least on that timeframe. And we also think there's potential given the possibility of a budget gap that the State of Illinois to be facing that they decided that they did a few months ago, to suspend in-person registration for a longer period of time. But really, I think, regardless of where the in-person registration would happen that alone is going to always stifle the size of the market by multiples. You don't have to look any farther than Nevada where you know in the major population centers that you certainly have many, many different casinos that you can go to and Nevada, in only the first year or so, New Jersey was surpassed as a market for online sports betting, due to the fact that you had to register in-person at a casino. And hopefully we'll see other states take notice that the states that have chosen to do it that way are suppressing the amount of tax revenue that they can generate. And we believe the long-term trend continues to be towards more of an open market with fair access for companies and consumers alike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Rosenblatt. You may proceed with your question.\nBernie McTernan: Great, thanks for taking the question. Good morning. Given the success of iGaming and sports coming back, how do you think about the trajectory of per capita growth going forward? The big question in our coverage is whether COVID is driving TAM expansion or pull-forward of demand, do you think you can reach the medium or long-term goals for per capita spend faster given the recent success?\nJason Robins: I think that that is a very good question that really the honest answer is no one knows. But the thing that makes us very excited that that feels like a real possibility is the number of customers we're acquiring. Because if you think about penetration, there's obviously two pieces, there's how many customers and then how much are they spending. And as you look at sort of population level penetration, it's really all about customer acquisition and retention. So the fact that we're seeing such huge response in record customer acquisition numbers this time of year, to me indicates that it's potentially creating a faster sort of race to that larger TAM simply because there's just more people that are joining the platform right now.\nBernie McTernan: Great. And then just also just want to hit on Colorado. Really strong start, just wanted to see if there is any color on why the state to navigate so strong?\nJason Robins: Colorado has always been a great market for us in daily fantasy sports. So it's always kind of punched above its population size. So we're not surprised. It has been very strong on the sports betting front. Colorado is a state that also has a great sports culture. So they afford professional sports teams, great college sports, so again, not surprised. And we're very excited about potential to continue to grow Colorado over the long-term. We think it's going to be a great market for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. You may proceed with your question.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a question about sales and marketing spend and external marketing spend. I hear a lot of concerns from my clients about the following two -- sort of two aspects of the same concern. Number one, you made an argument in your Analyst Day presentation that you will be achieving efficiencies and marketing spend as you roll-out nationally. So I was wondering if you could comment on if you saw any confirmations of that argument in recent months. And the second concern is sort of farther looking into the future, saying that there are so many -- so many well-funded players flooding into the space and the space seems very attractive and as competition intensifies, how should we not expect somewhat of an irrational level of spending? So I would appreciate your thoughts on this.\nJason Robins: Sure. On the first question, just to kind of remind everybody on the call, what was being referenced is that, it is, a lot, it is about three times less expensive to buy the same media on a national basis on a per impression basis, about three times less expensive than it is to buy it in local markets, you pay 3X premium typically for local markets. It varies a bit channel by channel, but that's kind of the average. So where really we're going to see a difference is when we get to the point where north of 33% of the population has online sports betting, and then we'll be able to shift into national and then as each additional state adopts sports betting from thereon now, it should just get more and more efficient. That'll be a tailwind because we'll be buying the same national media, but reaching a larger base of potential customers. So we're not quite there yet to be able to say if that trend is happening or not, but simply based on the population penetration that ultimately occurs, there will almost certainly be a tailwind there given the way the media market is structured. On the second question, why do we believe that we won't see irrational spending? We don't really concern ourselves too much with whether you do or don't, because we don't respond to irrational spending. One of the nice things about the sports media market is there are lots of places you can go to find customers. And we don't base our decisions on how much we are going to spend on what our competitors are doing. We base them on the return on ad spend that we are seeing. At least now and potentially this is due to stay-at-home probably it is. So hard to say kind of how it plays out in the long-term, but right now, we're actually seeing falling tax. And we're actually able to spend more and continue to invest deeper in marketing than we had thought with lower tax. So at least for now, that is the trend. Obviously, we understand there are other capitalized competitors. That's part of why we raised the money we gave, we have over $1.2 billion on the balance sheet. So we feel we're well equipped to play the long game here and we're just going to continue with our disciplined approach of making it -- making investments where the returns meet our hurdles and not making them, regardless of what we see our competition doing where they do not meet our hurdles.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.\nDavid Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. If you could talk just a bit about how you see the landscape evolving competitively, right. We have many discussions about how other areas of the world have great many players. And yet still some concentration of shares. That would be probably the number one topic of discussion, we have around sports betting. How does that landscape evolve compared with what we've seen elsewhere in the world?\nJason Robins: That's a good question. So I think there's a couple of things to consider here. One of which you brought up which I'll talk to you in a moment. But the second of which the regulatory framework differs in different parts of the world. And based on how we're seeing the regulatory framework shape up being both state-by-state and also in virtually every state having some level of limitation on licenses that will ultimately create a ceiling for how much competition is able to penetrate any given state and collectively the United States. Even though that is the case, and we think could create even more concentrated market share here, you correctly noted that in a market like say, the UK where there are hundreds of live operating online sportsbooks even in that market, there is fairly concentrated share amongst a handful of players. So, we think that that is just a function of the industry, there's a lot of advantage to scale. There's a lot of brand loyalty, customers are very sticky. The investment in product and technology that you need to make to compete over the long run is very high and will continue to increase as hopefully we set that bar. And the fact that you have data makes a big difference, having more data and more ability to then build the best data science models to optimize your customer acquisition engines to understand player profiles and preferences. That is a huge scale advantage to. So we think when you put all those things together, it's not surprising that there is a lot of concentration that occurs in this industry, and it's actually not too dissimilar than other online industries. Most online industries have a lot of outsized winners because of these types of advantages.\nDavid Katz: All right. And as my second question, I think you started down this road with the very end of your answer, the other topic that we often discuss is the degree to which a customer that you've included on your platform also has accounts in three to five other places and turns out to be a customer who's only as good as their last offer. What data or what depth or what comfort can you offer for that matter in that concern?\nJason Robins: Well, I think that there are certainly some customers that chase incentives, but it appears to be a very small percentage of the market. And the bet that we're making and continue to have conviction around is that product quality, breadth, depth, user experience, convenience, ease of use, all of those types of things will ultimately be the primary factors driving where people choose to concentrate their play. Even though you do you see trial of multiple apps or products in other parts of the world, you do also still tend to see a concentration of wallet on one or two. And I think that's because there is a lot of headache that comes with moving your money around different places and bouncing around in that regard. And so I think most people, if you're giving them a good experience, prefer to stick with one provider. And it doesn't mean everybody's that way. But the customers that are the most valuable are those and thankfully encompasses from what we can tell the vast majority of the market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Stauff from Susquehanna. You may proceed with your question.\nJoe Stauff: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up just on your tech stack commentary. Just to clarify, so with a backward integration on the sports module and you'll expect to be completed sometime in September of next year. So I guess my question is going forward from there and it'll include I guess an in-play product, what -- I guess what outsource services will you still have and/or pay regarding your various tech stack, as I read it, you're proprietary in the platform, then you'll be it on the sports bet module. But icasino obviously is a bit of a hybrid, so can you comment just on terms of what other outsource providers you'll be paying, post this -- nearing a sports launch?\nJason Robins: Absolutely. So first we do continue to use payment processors that we partner within various banks to process payments. Second, we partner with companies like Sportradar, IMG, FanDuel to get paid us that they're collecting. Thirdly, we partner with companies that provide security layers, geolocation, things like that. So those are some examples of things that are still outsourced pieces of the tech stack. The iGaming side is one where I think you'll continue to see us bring more and more of that in-house. Due to the nature of the industry, it is important to have a wide swath of content. So I think forever, you'll see us outsource a lot of that, but we're going to continue to work on developing our own proprietary games and increasing the amount of traffic that we get to those games, both as a way to differentiate and create unique experiences that others don't have in the market, but also as a way to continue to bring more of that margin to the bottom line. So that's something, I think you'll see us do. And we right now do not have any plans to address any sort of vertical integration of the other areas I mentioned.\nJoe Stauff: Makes sense. And Jason, can you just comment I guess about football in general, certainly NFL college football, I realize you're not putting college football within your 2020 guidance. But I guess just level set the NFL versus college football, what was the split, I guess in 2019. And how you think about if that affects different regions more than others right, Big 10 probably bet for Michigan probably bet for Indiana and so forth versus other regions of the country. Can you talk about football in general?\nJason Robins: Sure. So NFL orders of magnitude larger than college, college just to give you some context, is our fifth largest sport. That's college football, I should say is our fifth largest sport. I think you're very astute in your comment that it will probably based on potentially different approaches taken by certain conferences and also this sort of very regional support nature. I mean, that's true of any sport, or any, any type of sport, but in a college, it is potentially even the most in terms of local loyalty. I think that you will see differential impacts to certain places that maybe the Big 10 for example, does not end-up having a seat and you could see that differentially affect some of our Mid-Western markets. But what we are seeing now is that we are getting enough incremental demand for other sports that we do believe are going to play and because of that, we felt the prudent thing to do was simply not to include college in our guidance. We're hopeful, obviously that some or all conferences figure out a way to play there, in the fall or the spring. But we didn't want to, given some of the uncertainty surrounding it, we felt like the prudent thing to do was to guide without college.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gibas with Northland Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nGreg Gibas: Good morning, Jason and Jason. Thanks for taking the question and rest on the results given the typical backdrop.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nGreg Gibas: I do have to say, the promotional efforts or I guess offers that you put out has been very good at getting me to play a lot of new pools that I'd probably otherwise wouldn't. I'm just wondering, with respect to those promotional efforts, which will probably continue to ramp like you said in new states as they come online, and probably it's actually it represents pretty attractive economics for DraftKings too. How would you expect them to impact gross margins maybe relative to current levels?\nJason Robins: I think you brought up a great point there. When you said it's gotten you to try things, really the promotions are aimed at trial. Our hope is that you enjoyed those new sports and products that you tried and that that is ultimately what creates the retention. So I think a lot of what will drive where the promotional spend lands will have to do with what the customer acquisition trajectory looks like, which there's two pieces to that. One is we are still in the very early stages of many of the existing states that we have. Even in New Jersey, where we're going into only our second -- or we're in, sorry, only our second full-year, hard to believe it feels like a lot has happened. But just a week-and-a-half ago, or almost two weeks ago at this point was the two-year anniversary of us launching a new Jersey which is of course our first sportsbook, online sportsbook market. It's still very early in the industry and there's still especially we're seeing now potentially due to a lot of stay-at-home, just unbelievable new customer response. And so driving that trial and getting people on the platform is really throughout all the existing states, we're in going to be a big focus for at least near-term. And then the second piece that you have is what new states come on. So when you kind of put those together, that's ultimately going to be a big factor in driving what the level of promotional investment is and obviously very hard to predict. The way that we manage it and it's the same way we manage all of our marketing efforts is driven by NPV analysis, where we\u2019ll make investments whether it's external marketing spend or promotional spend or some combination thereof, we will make investments, if they return at acceptable hurdle rates for us, if they're NPV positive investments, and we will not make them if they're not. And we will continue to manage the business horizontally that way. We believe that maximizing long-term value is the best way to deploy our capital. So I know that it would be nice to be able to kind of predict what that exact level looks like. But I think part of our advantage is that we're very fluid and flexible and extraordinarily data driven in how we manage this.\nGreg Gibas: Got it, that's helpful. And then as we think a lot of -- think about a lot of the new players, maybe moving into the first few sports that resume for the first time with UFC, NASCAR, Golf, eSports, some of the ones you've mentioned. Have you seen those sports sees like continue boosted levels of activity relative to last year once the more major leagues came back like MLB, NBA, MLS, once those resumed play; is there any early data you can share there?\nJason Robins: Yes. So this is a -- the caveat that we're only a few weeks into MLB, NHL and NBA restarting. We're continuing to see great take up in numbers on those new things like eSports that we've driven trial of which coming back to, we're talking about a moment ago really helps validate our thesis that whether it's acquiring a new customer or getting somebody to try eSports that if we can get you to try things through incentives and promotions and really rely on the product itself and the experience retaining that that is a winning formula. And again with the caveat that we're really early, only a few weeks into the return of some of those other sports. We're continuing to see great response -- excuse me great participation in some of those new categories like eSports.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. You may proceed with your question.\nMike Hickey: Hey Jason, Jason, congrats guys. Solid execution obviously incredibly difficult environment, but you got a lot done. So good job guys. First question, I guess looking at New Jersey, which I think is probably your most established state in terms of time in running an OSB in night gaming business, obviously a lot has changed since March, when you sort of give a sort of a deeper look at that market in your Analyst Day deck. Just curious at that time, you're sort of looking to drive your contribution profit by year or two, which will be obviously December this year. Just wondering if you still think you can drive profit there in year or two, or maybe the accelerate spend for user acquisition is getting in the way or just the pullback in OSB or, just curious your thoughts on that specific order?\nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question and obviously a lot has changed COVID and the reduction in sports betting volume certainly hit New Jersey. That said, I don't think I would say we aren't going to be contribution profit positive. What we would like to do is sort of take the next quarter, see how things go, as you noted, if investments are there that maybe took us to contribution profit/negative, but they were good solid investments, we would probably make them. But right now, we're kind of waiting to see how things shake out with the return of sports. And we'll have an update next quarter on whether we think New Jersey will be contribution profit positive this year or not. But it's certainly trending that way. And I think it's very safe to say that without COVID it absolutely would have been and I think it's also safe to say that, we still have a good shot of driving positive contribution profit in New Jersey, but we also don't want to anchor ourselves to that because if there's good solid investments that return is very high, the returns for us in that state, and we will want to continue to make them.\nMike Hickey: Thanks for that. Last question from me, I think when you look at your sort of competitive differentiation, one thing that really stands out in our view, is the player migration from DFS to OSB, and then to iGaming. And I think iGaming in particular, as you've highlighted is really maybe outperformed, given the scenario that's unfolded since this year. But I'm curious given that migration, how sensitive your iGaming monies are to the return of sports? I would think that if you are in fact sharing a large portion of your players there that perhaps your iGaming could begin to sort of underperform market growth or not. But I'm wondering that and if any get any data in terms of the overlap between DFS, OSB, and maybe really OSB and iGaming and then I guess broadly speaking, just how you think about the sharing of these games and players in terms of longer-term potential? Thanks, guys.\nJason Robins: I think so there's a couple of pieces to that question. I think from an overall volume in the market standpoint, it's really hard given how unprecedented this whole last several months or to know, what will happen this fall in terms of the overall iGaming market. However, what I can tell you is from the DraftKings side historically, we have seen significant increases to both volume and share this time of year that we're coming into. And the reason is our primary source of iGaming revenue is from cross-sell of active sportsbook players and active daily fantasy sports players. And those customers certainly we worked hard to activate in cross-sell when there were no sports on but the cross-sell is typically much more effective, when they are already active and betting on the platform due to some of the product integrations that we've embedded into our sportsbook and the cross-sell that can occur with our data science engine in the background. So with the caveat that this is a new world for all of us and it's very hard to know, given the last few months how many, next few months we'll compare. I can tell you historically, we've seen growth in both volume and share during the time of year when we have the most activity on sports betting, which is certainly the one that we're about to enter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nStephen Grambling: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I think you both mentioned M&A in the opening remarks, what markets or segments do you see as perhaps being the most fertile ground to look in?\nJason Robins: Well, I think very much the same way we approach any investment we make, whether it's marketing product or M&A is the same we look at the value relative to the investment. I think a lot of what we think could potentially present opportunities is that while we feel we're very well capitalized, and can kind of whether anything that happens and we don't have much of a brick-and-mortar presence. So the impact of stay-at-home is actually more of a positive for us, as long as sports are being played. We think that we could find it, some of the other companies whether directly operating in the space or sort on, the kind of partner in vertical integration side. There could be opportunities where there's good value there. We don't feel like we need to make a big purchase or any purchase for that matter, we feel that after the last transaction, we have the critical pieces that we need to proceed at least for now. But I think there could be some opportunities that perhaps would not have otherwise presented themselves, just like given the events the last few months. I think the other thing; I would say is that we're also very bullish on the overall market. And if we can find assets, that are very complementary that as we grow in our core businesses, we also see growing alongside it, and that's something that could potentially be attractive as well. So that's kind of a little bit of a big picture of how we're looking at it. But the key point to emphasize is opportunistic, whereas we felt like we needed to as a critical piece of our strategy control our sports betting platform. We feel like the other piece is that we need to ultimately control, we either already have technology in place for or we can build it organically.\nStephen Grambling: Got it, that's -- that's helpful. And as a follow-up and sort of be a dead horse here. But going back to iGaming, how would you characterize the iGaming clarity, you've seen recently versus the core DFS and/or sports betting customer? And specifically given the greater confidence that you have in iGaming, how might that influence both the LTV and customer acquisition costs for the overall business?\nJason Robins: So I think that -- really the launch of our standalone app, part of the goal was to open-up to a new audience. It is still very early. The app didn't -- really launched like a month ago or so, a little bit less so with that kind of backdrop that we don't have a ton of data yet. We do think that some of our early efforts to onboard customers that maybe otherwise would not have been in our database are working. So we're hopeful that if that continues, and we can continue to tailor an experience that is iGaming first that we will reach some pieces of the market that maybe we weren't reaching before. As far as the impact to our metrics and bullishness on the market goes, I think the biggest impact is going to be on the LTV front for any states that do choose to do iGaming. If the market ends up being larger than we all thought it was and we end up being able to take a bigger share of it, then maybe we thought a year or two ago, that could have significant implications on the LTV of the customers in those states. And already we utilize a different LTV assumption when we acquire in states that do and don't have iGaming and you could potentially see the gap between that expand even more as the market continues on its growth trajectory.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jason Robins for any further remarks.\nJason Robins: Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We appreciate your insightful questions and look forward to continuing our dialogue together. We're excited for the future. DraftKings is well-positioned with over $1.2 billion in cash and no debt to enter new state as soon as practicable drive continued product innovation, take advantage of unique customer acquisition opportunities in the second half of 2020 and beyond, and to explore opportunistic M&A. Major sports are resuming and the early numbers look great for DraftKings. We're cautiously optimistic that the measures the leagues have implemented to-date will allow sporting events to continue in a safe manner. I hope you all stay safe and well during these challenging times and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I want to thank all of the healthcare providers across the country who continue to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the essential workers who keep our lives moving forward, as well as our employees for their continued focus and dedication during this unprecedented and challenging time. I continue to be tremendously impressed with the productivity of our employees across all of our functions, especially our product and technology teams. And we're driving our priorities forward even in a work-from-home world. We at DraftKings have had many conversations with our employees, our executive team and our Board to listen, learn and reflect on how we as an organization can do better to support and foster racial equality in the fight against injustice in America. We believe that the best innovation comes from diverse perspectives, thoughts, beliefs, ideas and experiences. We work hard to foster a culture of inclusion and belonging that makes our employees feel safe, empowered, engaged, championed, and inspired to be the very best. As a first step, we hired a Head of Inclusion, Equity and Belonging just under a year-ago and together are committed to allocating at least $1 million annually to support our company's goals, the progress already being made. Some examples include ongoing inclusive leadership training at all levels of the company, including training to better understand behavioral unconscious bias, micro messages and signals, enhancing our support and fostering and diversity within the organization through more targeted efforts on college campuses and increased partnerships for non-traditional pipelines among other things such as Boot Camp. And we have established Global Business Resource Groups to ensure our employees feel supported and heard across the organization. We'll continue to grow our efforts to support our employees, our fans, and our community. I'd also like to thank our investors large and small and give a special welcome to those investors who joined to support us on our journey with our follow-on equity offering in June. On today's call, I will cover four main topics. First, I would like to share a little insight into our performance over the last few weeks since major sports have begun to return. Second, I will share an update on our recent state launches in the pipeline of new state. Third, I'll review our recent product innovations and exciting new releases. And finally, I'll provide an update on the integration of our B2B business and the migration to our in-house proprietary technology platform. We had a strong second quarter given the limited sports calendar with second quarter pro forma revenue of $75 million. As sports have started to return, we saw revenue improve sequentially each month in the quarter, with June revenue increasing 20% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. This strong overall results and improvement are due to our product innovation, our entry into new jurisdiction, and pent-up demand for sports betting as Live Sports like Golf, European Soccer, NASCAR and UFC started to return. To give you a sense of demand, in the absence of major sports, I wanted to provide a couple of highlights. Top NASCAR races, which has traditionally been a new sport for us, saw similar action to popular NBA regular season game. In Golf, prior to this year, our top event of all time was the 2019 U.S. Open. Since the restarted PGA Tour, six PGA Tour events and the Match II have topped that major. In both May and June, we more than tripled our previous best month for UFC handle. The momentum we saw in June accelerated with the return of MLB, the NBA, and the NHL in late July and early August. As a result, we're seeing continued year-over-year revenue growth in the first part of Q3. Not only did the Yankees national game on opening night set records at DraftKings, it was also ESPN's most watched opening night baseball games ever, and the most watched regular season baseball game on any television network since 2011. In the first two weeks of MLBs return, we saw three times the handle compared to the first two weeks of the 2019 MLB season. In the first week of the NHL's return, our handle is more than twice the handle of first week of 2019 NHL playoff. With the NBA Christmas Day 2019 was our highest handle day, but four of the next five highest handle days occurred in the first week of the NBA's return. All of these statistics, I provided are just to give you a sense of this unique period and are on a normalized basis and that they do not include the effect of new states that are not necessarily indicative of our future performance. As you can see from these fantastic statistics, there is clearly pent-up demand that is compounded by a truly unique sport calendar. A byproduct of this demand is that we're seeing very strong marketing response rates and return on advertising spend. And in response to these great returns, we intend to invest to expand our leadership position in the market. We're really excited that sports have begun to return, but we all realize that there have been and there continue to be hiccups in the sports calendar in the back half of the year. We think leads and associations are doing a great job ensuring the safety and health of the athletes and staff, and we're optimistic that sports will continue to be played to schedule. Even if there are short-term hiccups, we have more conviction than ever in the long-term prospects of this industry and of our competitive position. Turning to legalization trend. We're extremely excited to be one of the first to launch sports betting in Colorado. We also launched iGaming in Pennsylvania in the second quarter. More recently, we launched iGaming in West Virginia and sports betting in Illinois. With these launches, DraftKings is now live in nine states for mobile sports betting and in three states for iGaming. And as you know, Virginia and Tennessee have already legalized online sports betting and Michigan has legalized both online sports betting and iGame. These three states account for 8% of the U.S. population. Separately, we're working together with state officials on regulations and licensing and look forward to launching as soon as possible. Finally, we're seeing great momentum across multiple states and continue to work to bring legal sports betting to more Americans. In the second quarter, we continue to develop innovative content and product. This is a key component of our long-term strategy, and is been critical to keeping our existing users engaged as sporting events were suspended or postponed. With the Match II, we elevated our content to engage consumers during a time when very few sports were being played. This event broke new ground in terms of integrations and customer engagement, with the broadcast showing live odds for the event winners as well as a variety of exciting new game market. The Match II is our biggest golf betting day ever, and we believe that event just scratches the surface of potential possibilities for similar integrated content. As another example, we significantly expanded our eSports offering and have seen exponential growth in this category. We added popular Madden simulated games and began to include streaming sports within our app, which has become a very popular feature. In fact, since the return of the NHL, the NBA, and Major League Baseball, users have continued to engage with eSports, which gives us confidence in that product's future. We launched a variety of free-to-play pools that covered everything from politics to the NFL Draft as well. And more recently, we continue to align ourselves with fun moments in American culture like the 2020 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating contest that was held in July. We also launched our standalone casino app for iGaming in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. This app is geared towards the casino-first player and features the same seamless, single platform, and wallet experience that users are accustomed choosing DraftKings. As we think about the future, we know that the best product and technology combined with innovation focused on the U.S. sports fan will be the winning combination in this industry. And I'm excited about the continued innovation that we see from our team of approximately 850 engineers. Our engineers are delivering on an innovation-related product roadmap empowered by our own vertically integrated technology stack. In terms of our organizational migration, and integration of that technology stack, I could not be more pleased with our progress. We're on track with the technology migration in our business integration and are working together extremely well as one company. Our technology migration is on track to be completed by no later than end of September 2021. When the migration is complete, our vertically integrated proprietary sports betting technology will create a sustainable and differentiated advantage for DraftKings. Looking forward, with over $1.2 billion in cash on our balance sheet and zero debt, DraftKings is well-positioned to build upon the growth of the online sports betting and iGaming market in the U.S. We will continue to bring new and innovative products to the market that strengthen our engagement with customers and maintain our competitive differentiation. Our second quarter performance validates this approach and is a testament to the company's resiliency, and our ability to respond in real time to changes in the sports calendar. The U.S. market is still in the early stages with many years of growth ahead. We will continue to invest in our core competitive advantages to grow and lead the way in the digital sports entertainment and gaming industry. These competitive differentiators include our mobile first DNA and our relentless focus on user experience. Our commitment to the development of innovative products as the primary means of engaging and retaining users built on our proprietary vertically integrated technology platform. Very high brand awareness and trust in addition to a large and growing customer base that includes potential customers in states which has yet to legalize online sports betting and/or iGaming. Our proven technology that allows us to enter new jurisdictions quickly and effectively including our single wallet and scalable regulatory platform. Our strong data science and capabilities around cross-sell and our ability to operate a highly analytical and data driven marketing machine at scale. These strengths have served us well as a DFS operator and will also differentiate us as a digital sports entertainment and gaming company. From a financial perspective, our business model features compelling unit economics due to our strong LTV intact metrics which are driven by our DFS database and strong brand recognition as well as our marketing and cross-sell capabilities. Additionally, we have a state entry playbook that has proven to be both successful and supportive of long-term profitability in each jurisdiction we enter. Our focus areas for the company remain the same. We're lasered in on entering new states as soon as possible. We believe that the best product is what will ultimately win with the U.S. sports fan. As a technology first organization, we'll continue to invest in our capabilities as we look to stay ahead of the competition and truly differentiate our products. Also, we continue to work towards migrating to our own proprietary technology platform. We'll be taking advantage of unique tack opportunities in the second half of 2020, as we're seeing strong response rate signaling what could be a very productive NFL season from a customer acquisition and activation perspective. And lastly, we'll continue to explore opportunistic M&A. By executing on these focused areas, we will build the best most trusted and most customer centric destination for Skin in the Game fan, offering the most entertaining real money gaming products that will forever transform the way people experience sports. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings, CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our second quarter results and outlook for the rest of 2020. So we aren't disclosing specific metrics for July and August. But as you can expect with a number of major sports resuming or starting their seasons, we've seen a strong uptick in our active users. And the hope is that that continues to be a trend through the start of the NFL season. Yes. So first of all, we have been involved in an audit with the IRS for many years, and that's something that continues to go on. This was a memo that has no force of law, is non-binding. And our view is deeply flawed in its analysis. And our position continues to be, which we believe has been reaffirmed to state legislators and courts throughout the country that DFS is not wagering. And we believe that arguments at the federal level are incredibly strong. And that many courts and legislatures have affirmed that. So that's going to continue to be an ongoing process. I expect it could take quite some time to resolve. So at this time, we don't have any estimates of what the ultimate resolution could look like. And our belief continues to be that our position is correct one. Sure. So just to clarify, I think probably we didn't phrase it as clearly as we could have. When we say new state playbook, we don't mean anything new is about the playbook, it's a playbook for new states. So, what Jason Park was referring to is we have multiple states that we have launched this year. We also have several other states that were not live going into last year's NFL season. In fact, we only have two states live going to last year's NFL season. That would be New Jersey and West Virginia. Every other state was launched either during the season or after. So we have a number of new states meaning new Sportsbook, sorry, states this year to start NFL and as you probably can guess from looking at our past years, this is the most important time for us to invest in customer acquisition and tend to have the best response rate. So we expect to see with all these states that we're not live, the beginning of next NFL really robust returns on our marketing spend, and you couple that with what we've been seeing over the last couple of months. First, in the pandemic, even as you know, very small number of sports started to trickle back with PGA Tour, NASCAR, UFC, all the way through the start of MLB and resumption of NHL and NBA. We're seeing record response rates and have continued to be able to acquire above our targets at lower [CAGs]. So if that is any indication of what this fall could look like we think that coupled with the new states that are now live at the beginning of the NFL season, could prove to be a really strong period for us to be able to invest in acquiring new customers. Absolutely. eSports I think we've talked about this really from day -- from the first moment we announced that we are going public. We believe eSports is going to be a huge category it's when not if. And I think like many things during the pandemic, sometimes what you see is an acceleration when you get an economic and sort of world shock like that, you more than see new things, see an acceleration of trends that were already happening. And I think eSports is probably the best example of that where, I believe we fast forward years ahead over the last few months in terms of the potential growth and ultimate trajectory to the eSports market. There are still only a handful of states that allow for betting on eSports. That's something we continue to work with regulators on. And I believe, as more and more comfort gets developed, you'll be able to see more opportunities throughout the states to bet on eSports. Right now, because of that, we focused more so on fantasy, on daily fantasy, which has been incredible amount of growth, but we believe ultimately eSports betting will be if not the biggest, certainly one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long-term. It's really a question of when. Well, I think they both serve a very important purpose. For customers that prefer a sports betting first experience we still want to make it easy and convenient for them to be able to partake in other sorts of games like online blackjack, if they like. But there are customers that prefer an online gaming first experience and really don't care as much about sports betting or if they do, it's secondary for them. So we want to be able to create an experience for both customers. The reality is that there's so much crossover that we feel it's important to have integrations in both apps. But naturally there is a customer that's going to be thinking sports betting first and customer that's going to be thinking casino first. And that's both helpful in terms of experience and retention of customers but also for new customer acquisition. As you can imagine advertising online blackjack and then driving people to download a Sportsbook app doesn't convert as well as advertising online blackjack and then driving people to download an online casino app. So we also are seeing some very promising and exciting results as we've transitioned our iGaming marketing to focus more on the standalone casino app. We're incredibly excited about the progress we're making there. We actually have a number of new things that we believe will be ready to roll-out over the next several months. That said we are still in the process of migrating to our own proprietary software that will probably take at least another year or so. So we will not necessarily be able to showcase on DraftKings, some of the new innovation in technology that we're developing in live betting until sometime next year. But I think that gives us even more time to innovate. So I really expect next NFL season is where you start to see a real meaningful difference between some of the offerings you saw in the past when it comes to NFL live betting and what you'll see in the 2021 season. Regarding incentives, we think of incentives much in the same way, as we think of any marketing meaning media purchase, or any other sort of marketing that we do, it's all oriented around getting a good return. And there are certainly incentives that are designed more and those are the most aggressive ones for new customer acquisitions. And then there are others that are designed more to retain. If you look at our longer-term projection, we expect the, kind of steady state incentives to be in the low 20% ish range of gross revenue. And that would be approximately 1% of handle a little bit more. So that's sort of where we see it netting out and I think that that's going to be still a mix of new customers obviously, we'll always be acquiring new customers on a platform and repeat. But really as just naturally your base transforms from most of the activity coming from repeat customers versus new, that'll come down. And then as you noted, when we combine that with some of the investments that we're making over the next year or two in product, we believe that that will even more improve our retention numbers. And the way I guess, you can view it is not to say there's no use of incentives in -- in retention, there is some but really, incentives are more designed to drive trial and product and experience is designed to retain and create the highest LTVs in loyalty. And that's really how we think about the kind of full funnel. Regarding iGaming, I think you're spot on. It is perhaps a bigger opportunity than we or others we're getting a credit for, obviously still a very important variable around how many states ultimately decide to move forward with it which we'll have to see based on some of the budget deficits, if that accelerates or doesn't. But certainly within the markets that we have iGaming, the performance has been incredible during COVID. And we don't necessarily think that it's just because of that, we think that it's just a market that could potentially be larger than anybody originally thought. So we're very excited about that. That's why we shifted so much investment into things like our standalone casino app and other product enhancements that we've put out there. We have several 100 games now that we offer, including many of our own proprietary games that we've developed in-house. We're going to continue to make those investments as long as we continue to be excited about that product. Well, certainly that's something that we've had discussion about. And I think the thing to remember with Illinois and feels like a long time given how much has happened early in the market, but it really isn't. The statute calls for 18 months after the first operator goes live, they can begin to issue mobile licenses. And once one of those is issued, doesn't matter who it's issued to the requirement to register in person goes away. So our hope is that that happens, at least on that timeframe. And we also think there's potential given the possibility of a budget gap that the State of Illinois to be facing that they decided that they did a few months ago, to suspend in-person registration for a longer period of time. But really, I think, regardless of where the in-person registration would happen that alone is going to always stifle the size of the market by multiples. You don't have to look any farther than Nevada where you know in the major population centers that you certainly have many, many different casinos that you can go to and Nevada, in only the first year or so, New Jersey was surpassed as a market for online sports betting, due to the fact that you had to register in-person at a casino. And hopefully we'll see other states take notice that the states that have chosen to do it that way are suppressing the amount of tax revenue that they can generate. And we believe the long-term trend continues to be towards more of an open market with fair access for companies and consumers alike. I think that that is a very good question that really the honest answer is no one knows. But the thing that makes us very excited that that feels like a real possibility is the number of customers we're acquiring. Because if you think about penetration, there's obviously two pieces, there's how many customers and then how much are they spending. And as you look at sort of population level penetration, it's really all about customer acquisition and retention. So the fact that we're seeing such huge response in record customer acquisition numbers this time of year, to me indicates that it's potentially creating a faster sort of race to that larger TAM simply because there's just more people that are joining the platform right now. Colorado has always been a great market for us in daily fantasy sports. So it's always kind of punched above its population size. So we're not surprised. It has been very strong on the sports betting front. Colorado is a state that also has a great sports culture. So they afford professional sports teams, great college sports, so again, not surprised. And we're very excited about potential to continue to grow Colorado over the long-term. We think it's going to be a great market for us. Sure. On the first question, just to kind of remind everybody on the call, what was being referenced is that, it is, a lot, it is about three times less expensive to buy the same media on a national basis on a per impression basis, about three times less expensive than it is to buy it in local markets, you pay 3X premium typically for local markets. It varies a bit channel by channel, but that's kind of the average. So where really we're going to see a difference is when we get to the point where north of 33% of the population has online sports betting, and then we'll be able to shift into national and then as each additional state adopts sports betting from thereon now, it should just get more and more efficient. That'll be a tailwind because we'll be buying the same national media, but reaching a larger base of potential customers. So we're not quite there yet to be able to say if that trend is happening or not, but simply based on the population penetration that ultimately occurs, there will almost certainly be a tailwind there given the way the media market is structured. On the second question, why do we believe that we won't see irrational spending? We don't really concern ourselves too much with whether you do or don't, because we don't respond to irrational spending. One of the nice things about the sports media market is there are lots of places you can go to find customers. And we don't base our decisions on how much we are going to spend on what our competitors are doing. We base them on the return on ad spend that we are seeing. At least now and potentially this is due to stay-at-home probably it is. So hard to say kind of how it plays out in the long-term, but right now, we're actually seeing falling tax. And we're actually able to spend more and continue to invest deeper in marketing than we had thought with lower tax. So at least for now, that is the trend. Obviously, we understand there are other capitalized competitors. That's part of why we raised the money we gave, we have over $1.2 billion on the balance sheet. So we feel we're well equipped to play the long game here and we're just going to continue with our disciplined approach of making it -- making investments where the returns meet our hurdles and not making them, regardless of what we see our competition doing where they do not meet our hurdles. That's a good question. So I think there's a couple of things to consider here. One of which you brought up which I'll talk to you in a moment. But the second of which the regulatory framework differs in different parts of the world. And based on how we're seeing the regulatory framework shape up being both state-by-state and also in virtually every state having some level of limitation on licenses that will ultimately create a ceiling for how much competition is able to penetrate any given state and collectively the United States. Even though that is the case, and we think could create even more concentrated market share here, you correctly noted that in a market like say, the UK where there are hundreds of live operating online sportsbooks even in that market, there is fairly concentrated share amongst a handful of players. So, we think that that is just a function of the industry, there's a lot of advantage to scale. There's a lot of brand loyalty, customers are very sticky. The investment in product and technology that you need to make to compete over the long run is very high and will continue to increase as hopefully we set that bar. And the fact that you have data makes a big difference, having more data and more ability to then build the best data science models to optimize your customer acquisition engines to understand player profiles and preferences. That is a huge scale advantage to. So we think when you put all those things together, it's not surprising that there is a lot of concentration that occurs in this industry, and it's actually not too dissimilar than other online industries. Most online industries have a lot of outsized winners because of these types of advantages. Well, I think that there are certainly some customers that chase incentives, but it appears to be a very small percentage of the market. And the bet that we're making and continue to have conviction around is that product quality, breadth, depth, user experience, convenience, ease of use, all of those types of things will ultimately be the primary factors driving where people choose to concentrate their play. Even though you do you see trial of multiple apps or products in other parts of the world, you do also still tend to see a concentration of wallet on one or two. And I think that's because there is a lot of headache that comes with moving your money around different places and bouncing around in that regard. And so I think most people, if you're giving them a good experience, prefer to stick with one provider. And it doesn't mean everybody's that way. But the customers that are the most valuable are those and thankfully encompasses from what we can tell the vast majority of the market. Absolutely. So first we do continue to use payment processors that we partner within various banks to process payments. Second, we partner with companies like Sportradar, IMG, FanDuel to get paid us that they're collecting. Thirdly, we partner with companies that provide security layers, geolocation, things like that. So those are some examples of things that are still outsourced pieces of the tech stack. The iGaming side is one where I think you'll continue to see us bring more and more of that in-house. Due to the nature of the industry, it is important to have a wide swath of content. So I think forever, you'll see us outsource a lot of that, but we're going to continue to work on developing our own proprietary games and increasing the amount of traffic that we get to those games, both as a way to differentiate and create unique experiences that others don't have in the market, but also as a way to continue to bring more of that margin to the bottom line. So that's something, I think you'll see us do. And we right now do not have any plans to address any sort of vertical integration of the other areas I mentioned. Sure. So NFL orders of magnitude larger than college, college just to give you some context, is our fifth largest sport. That's college football, I should say is our fifth largest sport. I think you're very astute in your comment that it will probably based on potentially different approaches taken by certain conferences and also this sort of very regional support nature. I mean, that's true of any sport, or any, any type of sport, but in a college, it is potentially even the most in terms of local loyalty. I think that you will see differential impacts to certain places that maybe the Big 10 for example, does not end-up having a seat and you could see that differentially affect some of our Mid-Western markets. But what we are seeing now is that we are getting enough incremental demand for other sports that we do believe are going to play and because of that, we felt the prudent thing to do was simply not to include college in our guidance. We're hopeful, obviously that some or all conferences figure out a way to play there, in the fall or the spring. But we didn't want to, given some of the uncertainty surrounding it, we felt like the prudent thing to do was to guide without college. Thank you. I think you brought up a great point there. When you said it's gotten you to try things, really the promotions are aimed at trial. Our hope is that you enjoyed those new sports and products that you tried and that that is ultimately what creates the retention. So I think a lot of what will drive where the promotional spend lands will have to do with what the customer acquisition trajectory looks like, which there's two pieces to that. One is we are still in the very early stages of many of the existing states that we have. Even in New Jersey, where we're going into only our second -- or we're in, sorry, only our second full-year, hard to believe it feels like a lot has happened. But just a week-and-a-half ago, or almost two weeks ago at this point was the two-year anniversary of us launching a new Jersey which is of course our first sportsbook, online sportsbook market. It's still very early in the industry and there's still especially we're seeing now potentially due to a lot of stay-at-home, just unbelievable new customer response. And so driving that trial and getting people on the platform is really throughout all the existing states, we're in going to be a big focus for at least near-term. And then the second piece that you have is what new states come on. So when you kind of put those together, that's ultimately going to be a big factor in driving what the level of promotional investment is and obviously very hard to predict. The way that we manage it and it's the same way we manage all of our marketing efforts is driven by NPV analysis, where we'll make investments whether it's external marketing spend or promotional spend or some combination thereof, we will make investments, if they return at acceptable hurdle rates for us, if they're NPV positive investments, and we will not make them if they're not. And we will continue to manage the business horizontally that way. We believe that maximizing long-term value is the best way to deploy our capital. So I know that it would be nice to be able to kind of predict what that exact level looks like. But I think part of our advantage is that we're very fluid and flexible and extraordinarily data driven in how we manage this. Yes. So this is a -- the caveat that we're only a few weeks into MLB, NHL and NBA restarting. We're continuing to see great take up in numbers on those new things like eSports that we've driven trial of which coming back to, we're talking about a moment ago really helps validate our thesis that whether it's acquiring a new customer or getting somebody to try eSports that if we can get you to try things through incentives and promotions and really rely on the product itself and the experience retaining that that is a winning formula. And again with the caveat that we're really early, only a few weeks into the return of some of those other sports. We're continuing to see great response -- excuse me great participation in some of those new categories like eSports. Yes, it's a great question and obviously a lot has changed COVID and the reduction in sports betting volume certainly hit New Jersey. That said, I don't think I would say we aren't going to be contribution profit positive. What we would like to do is sort of take the next quarter, see how things go, as you noted, if investments are there that maybe took us to contribution profit/negative, but they were good solid investments, we would probably make them. But right now, we're kind of waiting to see how things shake out with the return of sports. And we'll have an update next quarter on whether we think New Jersey will be contribution profit positive this year or not. But it's certainly trending that way. And I think it's very safe to say that without COVID it absolutely would have been and I think it's also safe to say that, we still have a good shot of driving positive contribution profit in New Jersey, but we also don't want to anchor ourselves to that because if there's good solid investments that return is very high, the returns for us in that state, and we will want to continue to make them. I think so there's a couple of pieces to that question. I think from an overall volume in the market standpoint, it's really hard given how unprecedented this whole last several months or to know, what will happen this fall in terms of the overall iGaming market. However, what I can tell you is from the DraftKings side historically, we have seen significant increases to both volume and share this time of year that we're coming into. And the reason is our primary source of iGaming revenue is from cross-sell of active sportsbook players and active daily fantasy sports players. And those customers certainly we worked hard to activate in cross-sell when there were no sports on but the cross-sell is typically much more effective, when they are already active and betting on the platform due to some of the product integrations that we've embedded into our sportsbook and the cross-sell that can occur with our data science engine in the background. So with the caveat that this is a new world for all of us and it's very hard to know, given the last few months how many, next few months we'll compare. I can tell you historically, we've seen growth in both volume and share during the time of year when we have the most activity on sports betting, which is certainly the one that we're about to enter. Well, I think very much the same way we approach any investment we make, whether it's marketing product or M&A is the same we look at the value relative to the investment. I think a lot of what we think could potentially present opportunities is that while we feel we're very well capitalized, and can kind of whether anything that happens and we don't have much of a brick-and-mortar presence. So the impact of stay-at-home is actually more of a positive for us, as long as sports are being played. We think that we could find it, some of the other companies whether directly operating in the space or sort on, the kind of partner in vertical integration side. There could be opportunities where there's good value there. We don't feel like we need to make a big purchase or any purchase for that matter, we feel that after the last transaction, we have the critical pieces that we need to proceed at least for now. But I think there could be some opportunities that perhaps would not have otherwise presented themselves, just like given the events the last few months. I think the other thing; I would say is that we're also very bullish on the overall market. And if we can find assets, that are very complementary that as we grow in our core businesses, we also see growing alongside it, and that's something that could potentially be attractive as well. So that's kind of a little bit of a big picture of how we're looking at it. But the key point to emphasize is opportunistic, whereas we felt like we needed to as a critical piece of our strategy control our sports betting platform. We feel like the other piece is that we need to ultimately control, we either already have technology in place for or we can build it organically. So I think that -- really the launch of our standalone app, part of the goal was to open-up to a new audience. It is still very early. The app didn't -- really launched like a month ago or so, a little bit less so with that kind of backdrop that we don't have a ton of data yet. We do think that some of our early efforts to onboard customers that maybe otherwise would not have been in our database are working. So we're hopeful that if that continues, and we can continue to tailor an experience that is iGaming first that we will reach some pieces of the market that maybe we weren't reaching before. As far as the impact to our metrics and bullishness on the market goes, I think the biggest impact is going to be on the LTV front for any states that do choose to do iGaming. If the market ends up being larger than we all thought it was and we end up being able to take a bigger share of it, then maybe we thought a year or two ago, that could have significant implications on the LTV of the customers in those states. And already we utilize a different LTV assumption when we acquire in states that do and don't have iGaming and you could potentially see the gap between that expand even more as the market continues on its growth trajectory. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We appreciate your insightful questions and look forward to continuing our dialogue together. We're excited for the future. DraftKings is well-positioned with over $1.2 billion in cash and no debt to enter new state as soon as practicable drive continued product innovation, take advantage of unique customer acquisition opportunities in the second half of 2020 and beyond, and to explore opportunistic M&A. Major sports are resuming and the early numbers look great for DraftKings. We're cautiously optimistic that the measures the leagues have implemented to-date will allow sporting events to continue in a safe manner. I hope you all stay safe and well during these challenging times and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you for your time today."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning everyone. Before jumping in, I wanted to remind everyone that the business combination was completed on April 23, 2020, and therefore we will be discussing results on a combined company pro forma basis to improve comparability, as if the business combination had closed on January 1, 2019. Pro forma means that we're including B2B for the entire period of Q2 rather than just from the April 24 through June 30 period. We're proud to announce that we delivered $75 million of pro forma revenue in Q2 2020. These results are very strong given the impact COVID-19 has had on the sports calendar. As sports have returned, we saw monthly revenue improve sequentially throughout the quarter with June pro forma revenue increasing 20% year-over-year. Notably, our year-to-date pro forma revenue through the first half of 2020 grew by 7% even with the impact of COVID. Our B2C segment which represents our U.S. product offerings of daily fantasy sports, sportsbooks, and iGaming generated $56 million of revenue in Q2, down just 2% versus that same period in 2019. We benefited from the product and content innovations we brought to market in DFS and OSP, such as eSports, as well as from our entries into Colorado for sports betting and Pennsylvania for iGaming both of which launched in the second quarter. In addition, our iGaming product offering was especially resilient in the second quarter, as it was not impacted by the sports calendar and perhaps even benefited from people staying at home. As you might expect, given the COVID pandemic, our B2C monthly unique payers in the quarter declined 35% year-over-year to 295,000. More than 100% of the decline was from our daily fantasy sports MUPs, which is both our largest source of monthly unique payers and the product offering that has been most impacted by the disruption in this sports calendar. MUPs improved in late May and June as some sports resumed their schedules. On the other hand, ARPMUP increased 51% in Q2 to $63 from $42 in the same period in 2019 which was predominantly driven by a mix shift into our iGaming product offering. Turning to our B2B results, our B2B business generated $19 million of pro forma revenue in the quarter, down 26% compared to the same period in 2019. COVID-related sports calendar disruptions resulted in a decline in player activity. Although the trend improved significantly in May and June, as the Bundesliga, Premier Liga, La Liga, and the English Premier League all resumed their season. On a combined company pro forma basis adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $60 million, as we were able to control our costs throughout the quarter, as sports resumed in May and June, and in anticipation of major sports resuming in July, we invested in marketing. Gross margin rate for the business declined on a pro forma and a GAAP basis as we saw an abnormal shift in users out of our highest margin DFS product offerings due to COVID. In addition, from a GAAP perspective, COGS was impacted by the amortization of acquired intangibles related to the business combination. Product and technology and general and administrative expenses grew year-over-year on a pro forma basis primarily due to headcount investments from 2019. On a GAAP basis, G&A expense grew due to a large amount of non-cash and one-time expenses such as stock-based compensation and transaction-related fees from the business combination and the follow-on equity offering. Sales and marketing spend increased year-over-year on a pro forma and GAAP basis primarily due to the six new states that became operational in Q2 of 2020 versus Q2 of 2019. We began to invest in advertising in late May and June, as sports begins to resume, and we saw very strong results in terms of advertising efficacy on user acquisition. We continue to advertise to prime the pump in anticipation of the return of major sports leagues in July and are pleased with our marketing efficacy which we believe to be a reflection of the pent-up demand as well as the unique sports calendar. Moving on to our balance sheet and liquidity, we're well capitalized with just over $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet as of June 30 and no debt. During the second quarter, we completed three significant capitalization events. First, we closed our business combination with Diamond Eagle and SPTech. Second, we called DraftKings' 16.6 million public warrants. And finally, on June 23, we issued 16 million shares in a follow-on equity offering. We're well capitalized to execute our multi-year plan and address our key priorities of entering new states that have been legalized, continuing to lead the market on product innovation, and exploring opportunistic and accretive M&A. Having now generated, $189 million of pro forma revenue in the first half of the year, we're guiding to a range of $500 million to $540 million of pro forma revenue for the full-year, which equates to year-over-year growth of 22% to 37% in the second half. This range assumes that all professional sports calendars that have been announced come to fruition through the end of the year, including the commencement of the 2020 to 2021 season, and that we operate in states in which we are live today. In light of recent cancellations by certain collegiate conferences, our guidance does not include college sports. However, we're cautiously optimistic that college sports will be played in some form. In terms of quarterly seasonality compared to the seasonality disclosure in the Analyst Day presentation that is available on our Investor Relations website, we expect to make up for half of the lower Q2 actuals on a seasonal percentage basis in Q3, and half in Q4. In terms of MUPs and ARPMUPs, we expect both MUP and ARPMUP growth rate for 2020 to be in line with 2019 growth rates for the full-year, with quarterly MUP growth in line with revenue growth and quarterly ARPMUP growth reflecting normalization of our product offering mix with the return of sports. Turning to our pro forma adjusted EBITDA, we're investing in marketing that will result in shorter-term EBITDA losses, but consistent with our strong LTV to CAC metrics will lead to performance in future periods consistent with our new state playbook. The Q3 calendar is very unique with all four major U.S. sports leagues commencing play within a seven-week period, which includes the beginning of the NFL season. Given this unique sports calendar investment to implement our new state playbook in Colorado, Illinois, and incremental investment for states in which we launched in late 2019, we expect our Q3 pro forma adjusted EBITDA loss to be wider than Q4. As long as we continue to see very attractive marketing spend efficacy like we have in recent months, we will continue to invest in advertising in a significant way during the second half of 2020. As a reminder, our marketing spend is highly flexible and can be reduced or paused all together as the sports calendar shift. Looking beyond 2020, we're beyond excited about our long-term growth expectations. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the lineup for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, May 15, 2020. At this time, I would like to turn it over to DraftKings' Chief Legal Officer, Stanton Dodge. Stanton Dodge.\nStanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. Statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and/or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility for updating forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties, and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. During the call management will also discuss certain non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures, which we believe to be useful in evaluating DraftKings\u2019 and SBTech\u2019s operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings\u2019 financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP or SBTech\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with IFRS. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or IFRS measures is available in our current report on Form 8-K/A filed today with the SEC and in our earnings presentation available on our website at investors.draftkings.com. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Chief Executive Officer, and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer at DraftKings. They will provide opening remarks and a review of financials and then we will open up the call to questions. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings CEO, Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Thank you, Stanton. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first earnings call as a publicly traded company. Before we start, I would like to thank all the essential workers, from healthcare professionals to grocery store employees, who have been on the front lines fighting this global pandemic. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by COVID-19. I would also like to express my appreciation to our shareholders for their support. We are thankful for the belief that our investors have demonstrated in DraftKings through their participation in our business combination. And we also greatly value and welcome those who have become new DraftKings shareholders.  The success of our transaction is a testament to the conviction and confidence our owners have in our ability to continue to build the only U.S.-based pure play sports betting and iGaming company. The DraftKings vision is unchanged. Our goal is to build the best, most trusted, and most customer-centric destination for skin-in-the-game fans, offering the most entertaining real-money gaming products that will forever transform the way people experience sports.  I'd like to cover three main topics today. First, I will provide a brief summary of the business, the large and growing market opportunity, our strong competitive positioning, and our ability to generate differentiated economics. Second, I will review how we are managing through the current crisis to best position our business as sporting events resume. And I will also provide an update on where things stand on the legislative front. Third, I will outline our major priorities going forward.  With that, let me start with a summary of our business. DraftKings is uniquely positioned at the intersection of digital sports entertainment and gaming in a rapidly growing industry. This opportunity represents an estimated addressable market of over $30 billion in the U.S. alone when considering a combination of online sports betting, fantasy sports, and iGames. There may also be less-developed fantasy and betting markets that could grow significantly in the coming years, such as eSports.  We believe the combination of a large currently underserved market along with strong momentum on the legislative front provides the potential to create an environment of continuous category expansion for many years to come. We see ourselves as the premier brand in digital sports entertainment. We are currently one of the leading U.S. digital sports books and have the number one rated daily fantasy sports and sports book apps in the country. Through the acquisition of SBTech, we have created the only vertically integrated sports betting company in the U.S., enabling us to be the product innovation leader for American sports, with a clear focus on the American sports fan. Finally, we have differentiated economics and online gaming due to our strong CAC and LTV metrics, driven by our large and growing fantasy sports database, a strong and well-known brand, significant expertise in infrastructure around marketing, and robust cross-sell metrics powered by years of investment in data science and analytics. Additionally, we have a clear state entry playbook to drive long-term profitability.  Turning to current events, I want to provide an overview of how we are responding to COVID-19. Certainly the current environment of major sports leagues and major sporting events has created short term revenue headwinds for the business. However, we are now in a strong position with nearly $0.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. Additionally, our long-term growth expectations remain unchanged and under certain scenarios may even accelerate. While, no one can predict exactly how COVID-19 will affect the world and for how long, we are confident, and when sports return, DraftKings will be ready.  As we have taken steps to navigate the short term impacts of the crisis, we have also been planning for what the post-COVID-19 world might look like, ensuring that the actions we are taking today are putting us in the strongest possible position. Our number one priority as a company is our employees' health and safety, and our organization continues to work productively in this work-from-home environment. Our teams are making great progress on our key priorities, such as launching new states, continuously upgrading our data automation and marketing technology capability, and building great products for our customers. Our product and technology teams have also created new content that is keeping our customers engaged during this unique period.  I would like to thank all of our tremendously talented employees who have stepped up and adapted to new working conditions without missing a beat. It has been truly remarkable to witness.  On that note, I am very proud of the content that we have developed over the last two months. For example, we have built a product that allows DraftKings' customers to engage in eSports events, such as simulated eNASCAR, Counter Strike, and Rocket League. We developed content for lesser known competitive sports, such as table tennis. We launched a plethora of pop culture free-to-play pools contests that covered everything from the democratic debates to TV shows like Survivor, The Last Dance and Top Chef.  We also want stimulated Madden games. And most recently we partnered with MLB on their new MLB Dream Bracket game. In parallel, we have continued to deliver on our state expansion roadmap successfully launching both iGaming in Pennsylvania and sports betting in Colorado in early May. The engagement numbers that we seeing across all of these products are a great validation that our customers are loving the content. And it also shows their passion for our products and loyalty to our brand. As we continue to monitor developments from sports leagues and teams, we are proactively planning for the variations of what the sports calendar could look like the rest of the year. With the expectation that this sports calendar will overlap like never before, our focus is on ensuring that we are prepared for the potential increased traffic in activity. There are still a lot of unknowns about how COVID-19 will ultimately impact major sporting events. But we are confident in our ability to perform as we prepare for what we hope will be a busy global sports calendar in the second half of the year. Currently, we do not anticipate any impact to our FY2021 or long-term plans as a result of COVID-19, assuming the sporting events calendar resumes to a normal state by 2021. There appears to be momentum with sports betting and iGaming legislation in the U.S. We are continuing to work with regulators to get our products live in states where we do not currently operate. In Q1, we launched sports betting in Iowa. And more recently we launched iGaming in Pennsylvania and online sports betting in Colorado. Additionally, an online sports betting bill became law in Virginia on April 22. Other states have passed legislation over the past year or so and are in the process of working towards launching operators. These states include Michigan, which passed a sports betting and iGaming law in December 2019; and Tennessee and Illinois, which legalized online sports setting about a year ago. At this time, approximately 14 states are actively considering sports betting legislation. We are hopeful that we will continue to see the momentum as many states are expected to confront budget deficit. Finally, before I turn it over to our CFO, Jason Park, to detail our Q1 performance and results, I wanted to provide an overview of our priorities for the business. As always, we are focused on entering new states at the earliest opportunity. In addition to the recent news in Pennsylvania and Colorado, we are working towards launching online sports betting in other states that have passed laws, such as Illinois, Michigan, Tennessee, and Virginia. We are in the process of working with regulators in West Virginia to hopefully launch iGaming. We will continue to invest in our product and technology capabilities as we look to stay ahead of the competition and truly differentiate our products in the market. Our ability to create new content quickly during this period was enabled by the technology and products investments we had previously made. These new products have allowed us to continue to acquire and retain users. And we will be monitoring activity on these alternate offerings once traditional sports return. Continued traction and engagement with products centered around e-sports and Pools based on pop-culture, positively affect CAC and LTV over time. Lastly, we will continue to work towards migrating to our own proprietary software and investing in live betting and other unique offerings for American sports. Strategically, we believe this will create a key differentiator for DraftKings helping us win with consumers and partners, and also improving our long-term margin profile. With that, I will now turn it over to DraftKings\u2019 CFO, Jason Park.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason. As many of you are aware, we completed our business combination with SBTech and Diamond Eagle on April 23. Accordingly our results for the first quarter, ending March 31, reflect those of legacy DraftKings and legacy SBTech each on a standalone basis. Starting with Old DraftKings, despite COVID we generated $89 million of net revenue in the quarter, which is an increase of 30% versus prior year. Notably pre-COVID prior to March 11, our revenue was up 60% versus prior year. These results are due to our strategy of launching in new states, as well as growing revenue in existing states. In this quarter, we were live in five new states for online sports betting, versus the first quarter of 2019, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Due to COVID, we missed several, sizable revenue opportunities attached to Q1 sporting events, such as March Madness, as well as several weeks of the NBA and NHL seasons. Nevertheless, we are pleased to have generated 30% revenue growth compared to the prior year. Our iGaming business such as online Blackjack and Roulette was not impacted by COVID-19 and exhibited strong results. Additionally, we saw acceleration in iGaming activity after major sporting events stopped, and people began looking for alternative forms of entertainment. Despite COVID-19 we had experienced strong MUP and ARPMUP growth for the quarter. We grew our MUPs to 720,000 up from 619,000, over Q1 2019, an increase of 16%. And our ARPMUP increased to $41, up from $37 last year, an increase of 12%. We are pleased with our unique player growth and with the success we have achieved cross-selling our customers into new product offerings. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $49.5 million this year versus negative $20.4 last year. As we expected our loss widened primarily due to our planned investment in connection with launching our product offerings in five new states. These investments in the form of promotions and external marketing are consistent with our new-state playbook and are expected to drive long-term profitable growth. As we began to see the impact of COVID-19, we reacted quickly, with the scale back external marketing spend in the March period. In addition to this investment into new states, we also invested into our organization. More than half of our new headcount was in our product and technology teams to support our continued innovation and focus on the diversification of our products. Our compensation expenses are already beginning to level off. As we begin to reach and scale throughout different parts of the organization. Our net income of negative $68.7 million was in line with our own expectations. Now turning to SBTech. Old SBTech revenue generated \u20ac22.6 million, an increase of 3% versus Q1 2019. Notably, pre-COVID, prior to March 11, our revenue was up 19% versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was negative \u20ac851,000 versus prior year of positive \u20ac4.3 million. SBTech was well on track to achieve positive EBITDA for the quarter, until COVID hit. And we anticipate to return to profitability once the major sports resume. As all of you can appreciate providing guidance in this environment is difficult for many companies and we are no exception. Given the significant certainty around how COVID-19 will impact the sports calendar, we are now providing 2020 revenue guidance. We are preparing internally for all possible scenarios and as we learn more from the leads, we will incorporate our learnings into our forecasting. I want to reiterate something Jason Robins said earlier, which is that based on what we know today, we do not anticipate any reductions to our fiscal year 2021 revenue projections. And we continue to believe that the long-term growth prospects of the business are strong. Finally, I would like to highlight our strong balance sheet. Coming off of a successful business combination and public listing on April 24, we are well capitalized with nearly $0.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet at close. While major sports to be on hold for a protracted period of time, we expect to be able to manage our company cash burn to $15 million to $20 million per month. We are able to achieve these low levels of cash burn due to our highly variable cost structure. The majority of our calls are tied to revenue and external marketing is at our discretion. There's even opportunity to improve that burn rate as we continue to diversify our offerings and grow our iGaming activity.  We are concluding our remarks for this period, and then we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: Hey, good morning, guys. So Jason Robins, in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about how this year it is likely we are going to have a lot of overlap in the sports calendar. Can you just talk a little bit about how you think that is going to affect your MUP and your ARPU? And kind of how you acquire customers this year versus a typical year? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yes, thanks, Thomas. So, obviously a lot is still moving around. Currently as an example, the Masters is scheduled for November. So very different overlap in terms of sport calendar than it would have been \u2013 had it been played as planned in April. And there will be other examples like that, but hard to know exactly what they will be without all the sports calendars fully developed yet for the year. That said, I think to answer your question, assuming there is overlap, usually what we've seen is, when there are more popular sports going on overall activity and overall revenue goes up, that is something that we see typically for example in Q4 when we have a lot of sporting activity going on each year. So I would expect there'll be similar impacts, but it's very hard to know because the combinations are just totally different than they've ever been in prior years. But generally speaking, I would expect that to create more activity. From our customer acquisition standpoint, I think the team is going to take the same approach they always do, which is every single creative, every single piece of media, everything that we put out there has a target in mind and is tied to the creative and offering that we are going after with that target. And I think that, what we'll try to do is just test into everything, hard to know if it will make sense to build on the example that I mentioned earlier to acquire heavily on Masters, when it's overlapping with football. It may be different than when it's overlapping with other sports. So we're going to test everything and we'll learn lot, who knows how applicable, probably not so much, hopefully not so much, those learnings will be for future years, but we're able to actually pretty quickly iterate in year. So a lot of the testing we do is really being optimized moment-by-moment. So that's the approach we're going to take.\nThomas Allen: Okay. And then in terms of the business that is going on right now, so the strong online gaming business as well as the more unique businesses like Korean Baseball and eSports, I mean what are you seeing in those customers? Like how different are they than your legacy customers and on the iGaming piece, how much of that business is legacy customers versus new customers? Thanks.\nJason Robins: So across the board, it's mostly our existing customer base. We've had some new customers coming in, are kind of typically we acquire customers throughout the year and I think probably more due than anything to people being home. We've seen pockets where that's gone up but hard to know that if there's like a particular new segment or anything that's being attracted to some of these offerings, my guess is it's mostly existing customers and mostly the same profile of customers we had typically been acquiring.\nThomas Allen: Okay. Then just final question on SB Tech transaction closed a little less than a month ago, but any surprises so far, anything positive or negative that you've seen in the past month? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yes, I wouldn't say that there's anything surprising. But overall it didn't really, especially given the challenges of not being able to be face-to-face. It's been really going about as well as we possibly could have hoped. Very good chemistry between the teams, I think in the world of Zoom, it's almost as good as being in person. So we've gotten to spend a lot of video based face-to-face time together. And I also think there's certain element of just unification that happens when there's a crisis externally. And a lot of people feel fortunate that they're part of a business that has I think really got a strong outlook in terms of the future. And I think a lot of people are looking around at some of their friends and colleagues and other industries that are getting hit pretty hard, I actually think in some ways that's helped bringing the teams together, but overall it's been a really positive, early experience. And I'm very excited and very pleased with the progress we're making.\nThomas Allen: Great. Thank you.\nJason Robins: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital. Please go ahead.\nRyan Sigdahl: Great. Thanks guys for taking my questions and congrats on completing the merger. First-off just on iGaming, so you mentioned an acceleration there, any way you can break that down kind of between new users playing versus the legacy users that are playing more? And then secondly, what are you seeing in April and thus far in May?\nJason Robins: So, we aren't disclosing any specific iGaming metrics, but what I would say is, if you look at the publicly available reports from New Jersey for last month, the overall iGaming market grew, I believe approximately 118% and Resorts Digital, which is DraftKings skin partner grew about 126%. So we're very pleased with the growth we're seeing in that product relative to the market. And I think that, you know not surprising, but certainly something that we're continuing to focus on. And I apologize, what was the second question?\nRyan Sigdahl: Just what trends, so we've seen New Jersey data for April, but what trends are you seeing thus far in May, have those continued accelerated, just directionally?\nJason Robins: Are you talking about in terms of iGaming or just overall for the business?\nRyan Sigdahl: iGaming specifically? \nJason Robins: Yes. So I think really it's been a continuation of what we've been seeing in April. I think that that there are some things that vary based on seasonality and sports, but iGaming is actually a remarkably consistent throughout the year. So I think that really, it's kind of been similar to what we've been seeing in April.\nRyan Sigdahl: And then switching over to marketing, so lack of major sports right now, but also we've seen CPMs, Google, Facebook costs you temporarily reduced here. So anything you can say about user acquisition in terms of number of new users as well as any metrics realized early, but on CAC, LTV or payback periods or however you want to think about it.\nJason Robins: So, I think right now, what we are trying to do is just test everything. And I think that you are right, given the reduction in some of the price of media that you're seeing, particularly in some of the big online \u2013 some of the big digital channels, there are opportunities that perhaps weren't there before to get more scale and reach and at the same time there's less sporting events to advertise, so those two things definitely counterbalance each other.  So what we're trying to do is just test into everything, figure out faster than hopefully our competition, what works and what doesn't and get those learnings into action in the marketplace.\nRyan Sigdahl: And then last one for me, and then I'll turn it over to someone else. So in the non-traditional categories, you talked about, I mean, eSports, pop culture, virtual sports, et cetera. Are there any one that jumps out that, that people are really enthused about and you're seeing more volume from and then also how do you think about those categories, the non-traditional sports categories over the next several years? Thanks.\nJason Robins: I think eSports is notable stand out. We launched to CS:GO and several others and it's been really strong volume compared to what eSports traditionally had seen. And the other thing I had mentioned are the simulated sports, particularly the simulated games that are using Madden, EA\u2019s Madden that people are playing fantasy and such with. To me, that's, it kind of makes sense, right, that there's a lot of football fans that want football year round and it's probably even enhanced by the fact that there's not a lot of other sports on TV, there's a lot of people that are at home looking to watch things.  So I think that's something that we're keeping an eye on and there could be some potential to extend the NFL season really throughout the year through simulated sports and I think it'll also work for other sports, but in particular I'm excited about the NFL, because part of what the NFL product, it's a scarce product. It's \u2013 a lot \u2013 there are a lot fewer NFL games and it's a shorter season than most of the other major sports. So I think there's a lot of potential there. And we do see a lot of people deactivate towards the end of the or after the Super Bowl. And many of them activate sporadically throughout the year on sporting events that are popular, like the Masters, for example, start of baseball season, brings new activation, March Madness of course. But there is a group that just loves the NFL and can't get enough of the NFL. So I think if you can find a way to give them that NFL experience more year round there's something there.\nRyan Sigdahl: Great, thanks guys. And good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Graham with Canaccord. Please go ahead. \nMichael Graham: Good morning. And thank you. My first question is just on the product roadmap. And can you talk about as you start to leverage SB Tech's technology into sort of live In-Play Betting, like when does that start to happen? And can you talk about the order of magnitude, opportunity in terms of increasing pricing or sort of the effective revenue yield on those bets?\nJason Robins: So I think right now, we're still in the early stages of planning around integration and migration. Really the goal for us is to make sure we have a high-quality migration and putting that above really speed is the approach that we're taking. At the same time we have made good progress, so I think, we're probably looking at least mid-to-late 2021, before you're going to start to see some of the types of things that you mentioned really in action, but it could be longer, but I think that the progress we're making has been very solid so far, so I feel good about that timeline. As far as to say, but our belief, economics might be that live betting due to the frequency of it and due to how rapid fire it is that there's sort of less kind of market norms around where pricing ends up, if you look at, for example, pregame NFL lines across all the sports books, they're typically not too different, sometimes you see a half point difference here and there, slightly different odds, but the market's kind of the market, whereas live betting is so rapid fire that there's no time for people to price shop. And so it's not as efficient or perfectly priced of a market. So those types of situations, I think create opportunity if you have the best algorithms, the best pricing models to differentiate for sure.\nMichael Graham: Okay. Thanks. And then on your relationships for OSB, with the in state licensed casino operators, can you just comment on how long those agreements typically last and do you think as you gain scale, is there opportunity to achieve some leverage there over time?\nJason Robins: So, already I think that, from the first deal that we did to now, it's certainly become more clear that we are a preferred partner and I think we've gotten a lot of really positive tailwind from that. All the deals are a little bit different and we don't comment on the specific ones, but really the approach that we take is, we want to find the right partners and we want to make sure that we have the best combination of flexibility on our end and security for the long-term. So that's the approach that we take when we strike these deals.\nMichael Graham: Okay. Jason and then the last one for me, just in thinking about the opportunity to acquire a new player is one of the clear areas is sort of the illegal shadow market, off shore sites and that sort of thing and the major difference from the player's perspective might be taxation. Can you just talk about how you think about that and do you react to that or address that with incentives or just, how has that issue shaped your strategy? Thanks a lot.\nJason Robins: Sure. So are you referring to taxation from the states or taxation on winning?\nMichael Graham: On winnings.\nJason Robins: Yes, I mean, our hope is that most people want to pay their taxes and it is illegal to not report winnings. I think a lot of people actually report illegal winnings believe it or not there is an area where you can enter gambling winnings on IRS form, which includes illegal gambling winnings. So I think that it's hard to say that, to some extent, the types of customers we want are the ones that are following the law and includes paying the taxes. So I think most people feel like if they're fortunate enough to win a large enough sum of money, that triggers a tax reporting requirement that they're happy to pay it, but you're right, that there will be some segment that maybe are trying to avoid paying taxes and that's just something we simply can't compete with in the illegal market. And it's also, I know this isn't what you asked, but it's also important and also why we hope. And so far I've seen that states are being very reasonable about the tax rates they're charging, because that also if not done appropriately can have an impact on how much it costs the customer and so far the states have generally been sensible about that and we've been able to be competitive with the illegal market on pricing. But that's something that's important to maintain because otherwise it'll be very challenging to disrupt the illegal market. And I actually think that's the more important thing, I think most people would rather pay their taxes than break the law.  But I do think people don't want to get a worse deal or worst price. And I think it's important that we're able to maintain competitive pricing, which will be enabled by sensible taxes and regulation.\nMichael Graham: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gibas with Northland Securities, please go ahead. \nGreg Gibas: Thanks for taking my questions. First, Park, can you talk about maybe any early success you're seeing cross-selling your DFS users to the new products that kind of just went online this past month in Colorado and Pennsylvania, just opening up for iGaming? And maybe how has early betting been in the States?\nJason Park: So, iGaming is a little bit different than sports betting in that all of our content is available in iGaming, whereas of course without a lot of major sports playing, sports betting does not have all of the traditional content available, that said, I would say that so far what we've seen has been a positive and in-line with better than what we expected. So, very early, we literally just launched these products in the last few weeks, but so far we think, what we're seeing is in-line with or better than what we expected. \nGreg Gibas: Okay, that's good to hear. And then can you maybe discuss a little bit of your proactive marketing measures that you have taken maybe to generate some interest on new users in the platform with not many live sporting events going on?\nJason Robins: It's been test, test, test. We've run, I think at this point 50 plus different types of content in our free-to-play pools. We have simulated NFL, Madden games going on, I think on some days up to 10 to 12 a day. On the weekends, I believe it's at that level. So we've been ramping up the things that are working, but it's been test, test, test and double, triple down on the things that work. And that really starts with testing on the existing traffic and user base. But then once we see what's working, we extend that into the external marketing strategy. So kind of step three is really to focus our customer acquisition efforts on the things that we know are already working to engage our existing customer base.\nGreg Gibas: Got it. That's helpful. And last one for me, and sorry if I missed this, too, but did you comment or at least kind of quantify the impact that you are seeing on payer activity in April and May as it kind of compares to the second half of margin anyway just with respect to unique payers or average spend per player?\nJason Robins: We aren't, it's kind of much like the rest of the world, it's been very fluid. So literally one week story may be different than the prior week story. So right now, we're kind of waiting for the dust to settle before we start putting any commentary out there about what we're seeing.\nGreg Gibas: Okay, sure. Thanks, guys.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Stauff with Susquehanna. \nJoe Stauff: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask maybe a longer-term question just on the existing DFS business. And I guess an expectation of growth, say, over the next couple years is for that business to grow revenue low-single digits. I was wondering if you can give us maybe a little bit more perspective in terms of the development of that market. Is it likely to be more user-driven? Is it likely to be more frequency of play? How do you guys think about the growth of that market in particular, given your 60% market share?\nJason Robins: So I think right now, there's a very strong interplay between how that market will look and grow and the pace of state legalization. And specifically what I mean is when, for example, in New Jersey, when we introduced all of these new products around, online retail, sports, betting, iGaming. We did see some cannibalization of daily fantasy sports. So the degree to which it will grow, whether it's low double digit, single digits or flat will depend on how quickly the other states that are in the process of either rolling out sports betting or considering legislation on sports betting move.  From a strategic perspective, certainly it's an important monetization engine for us. So that is always a focus and we're always testing and looking for ways to optimize there. But perhaps more importantly, it's the number one customer acquisition channel for us when we roll out online sports betting, iGaming and other products in state. So it's really most important to keep users active, keep building that active base by acquiring efficiently on to the DFS platform and then having really strong data on those customers. So that once we do see online sports betting or other products legalized in their state, we know exactly how to cross sell them.\nJoe Stauff: Okay. And as it relates to some of the states and trying to expect or trying to anticipate exactly some of the larger states in particular that you had mentioned earlier in the call, I guess can you give us an update in general about maybe the interaction between your legis \u2013 or your regulatory team in the states and all the things that need to be done in order to be able to launch and go through the compliance process with the states. Has that largely \u2013 I would imagine to a certain extent that has been largely disrupted. Or what is the status of that? And I'm talking about obviously with Tennessee and Michigan and so forth, trying to anticipate obviously when they would allow you guys or give you the greenlight to launch.\nJason Robins: So I'll say a quick word, and then I'm going to turn it over to our Chief Legal Officer Stanton Dodge, see if he has anything to add. But we're continuing to stay away from predictions on that. I think, the current environment has made it even more challenging to pin an exact date on it. So, we're working hard with everyone to try to move as quickly as possible. But there's also a recognition that there's a crisis going on and this may not be their number one priority at the moment. So we have to balance that, but I think that the approach we will continue to take is as we get enough information to feel confident and putting a kind of date or date range around it, we will absolutely be transparent with that. And at this time, we don't have enough information to do that. Stanton, is there anything I missed that you wanted to add?\nStanton Dodge: Yes, I would just say generally, every state is different and unique. So there's no real standard playbook of expectations. But generally speaking, to get the state up and running, you need to pass a law, which in some states requires you to go to the ballot such as Colorado. Then you need to get regulations passed and then get licensed. And with respect to whether you've seen any disruption in that as you're well aware of most legislatures have been out of session, but are seemed to be slowly coming back. But no much toward like Colorado still launched on May 1, in the midst of this. And we are also able to get iGaming regulations finalized and get us licensed in Pennsylvania.\nJoe Stauff: Okay. And just finally, one clarification. On your OSB category, can you just remind us with respect to how much or how much exposure you have to the European soccer leagues, in particular the Premier League, which may or may not start up sometime in June? I was just curious about that?\nJason Robins: So from the DraftKings perceptive, the old DraftKings perspective, it's a meaningful sport, but not a significant portion of our revenue each year. On the old SBTech side, given that the vast majority of their business is international, it's more important. It's almost two thirds for them, so it is very significant over there. So we'll see a meaningful impact on how that all shakes out to the B2B revenues. But I do not expect that significant of an impact to the B2C revenues.\nJoe Stauff: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jack Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. \nJack Kelly: Great, thanks for taking my question. Just back to the live betting, I guess with the lack of sports and less velocity on your systems, I mean, have you been able to accelerate anything on your product roadmap in regards to live betting? And then as the leagues start to need more revenue with lack of fan attendance, does this open up opportunities for more partnership opportunities to help them generate more revenue or make up lost revenue from fans not attending?\nJason Robins: Great question. So on the first topic, we have definitely been doubling down in terms of our product roadmap, our long-term product roadmap of which live betting is a clear and important part of it. Perhaps you could argue on the sports book product, the most important part. We also have been balancing that with utilizing this opportunity to expand our offerings on new sports and daily fantasy sports, pushing out more e-sports and other things. So it's been a combination of content expansion due to sort of the lack of traditional sports content out there, along with progress against our medium to long-term roadmap on things like live betting, which really won't start to in a visible way to the consumer really take shape until probably second half of next year.  But I haven't been very pleased with the progress you've made across all of these things. I think the team has really stepped up and I think in some ways we're more productive than ever right now. So we're making a lot of progress across a lot of different areas. And then I apologize, what was the second question?\nJack Kelly: Working closer with the leagues on just trying to help them generate more revenue in game wagering with lack of attendance.\nJason Robins: So, the leagues are certainly just like the whole sports world valuating, what this all means for them. Certainly a lot of revenue depending on the sport, depending on the team it varies, but a lot of revenue does come from in-stadium and they're contemplating if there were to be some kind of a reduction in that revenue what could that possibly be replaced with or mitigated by. So, those are discussions we always have, and I think this particular situation, the pandemic has in some ways accelerated interest in certain areas as an example. I think there's been more significant interest in these simulated sports, products that I was referencing earlier than there had been in the past because the thought and the league's minds are, hey, if we do have to postpone or cancel or shift around the calendar, how do we engage fans? I think there's been more focus on tying the digital experience to the television broadcast because the thought is that more fans than ever could be consuming this content from home. So, like everyone, I think there's still a lot of unknowns that I think we'll kind of affect where things in terms of potential partnership opportunities, steer towards. But just like any situation where there's major shock or disruption, a lot of things that maybe were less interesting are not really on the table before are now potentially on the table. So we're trying to be at the center of all those discussions and be helpful wherever we can.\nJack Kelly: And then just one more question for me. I know it is still hard to make predictions what is going to happen, but it does seem that the NBA might permanently push their start of the season to Christmas. Any thoughts on that and how that could impact financial performance?\nJason Robins: First, and this is just personal opinion. I love the idea of the NBA starting on Christmas. Just as a fan, I feel like that's the day every year, it's almost like Thanksgiving with football that I think of NBA is the major sport. And as excited as I think people are for the start of the season anyway, it's still early in the NFL season when NBA typically starts versus starting in late December might actually I think create a bit more focused on the NBA versus, still being in the thick of the NFL. For example, if your favorite NFL team is may already be out of it by the time Christmas hits and that's not the case sometimes when it's mid or late October when the NBA traditionally has started. So I personally loved the idea. As far as impact on revenues, it's really hard to say it's unprecedented. We've never had that situation before. And my baseline expectation is I don't know why it would be that different. It's just basically pushing the same calendar out a month or two. But, it's hard to know because it does change where the overlap is. And more specifically assuming that the calendar is not condensed, that the idea of starting on Christmas means you play more deep into the summer. It will be more overlap with baseball. There's also and I think this could be a positive, there's just a lot less going on in the sports world during the summer than there is in the fall.  So in some ways, there might be more incrementality to having the playoffs for the NBA, and the season kind of, sorry, the regular season games to the NBA in the summer, and then the playoffs in the summer as well could potentially be less competitive with a lot of the other sporting events that are happening during the fall. And that could create some positive impacts, but really hard to say we're all going to have to observe how the data comes in, if they do make that change. And once we do, we'll be pretty quick in being able to update our forecasts. And right now, it\u2019s the best educated guess and we don't even really know what the schedule is going to look like. So even on that front, it's still a guessing game.\nJack Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And now I will like to turn the call back to Jason Robins for his final remarks.\nJason Robins: Thank you again for joining us today for our first earnings call. We appreciate your thoughtful questions and look forward to continuing this dialogue with everyone. As discussed earlier, we are very pleased that our product and technology investments have created avenues to continue to engage our customers while most major sports are on hiatus. And I am very proud of our employees for their customer centric approach to designing and marketing these new offerings. Furthermore, I am very confident that regardless of how long COVID-19 disrupts our daily lives, DraftKings is well positioned to continue innovating on product, building market share, and working with policy makers to expand the addressable market. We appreciate the support our shareholders have placed in us, and we hope all of you are as excited as we are to watch our vision unfold over the coming years. We're also really excited about executing it. Thanks again. I hope everyone is staying safe and well during these challenging times. And we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's program. This concludes it and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Thank you, Stanton. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first earnings call as a publicly traded company. Before we start, I would like to thank all the essential workers, from healthcare professionals to grocery store employees, who have been on the front lines fighting this global pandemic. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by COVID-19. I would also like to express my appreciation to our shareholders for their support. We are thankful for the belief that our investors have demonstrated in DraftKings through their participation in our business combination. And we also greatly value and welcome those who have become new DraftKings shareholders.  The success of our transaction is a testament to the conviction and confidence our owners have in our ability to continue to build the only U.S.-based pure play sports betting and iGaming company. The DraftKings vision is unchanged. Our goal is to build the best, most trusted, and most customer-centric destination for skin-in-the-game fans, offering the most entertaining real-money gaming products that will forever transform the way people experience sports.  I'd like to cover three main topics today. First, I will provide a brief summary of the business, the large and growing market opportunity, our strong competitive positioning, and our ability to generate differentiated economics. Second, I will review how we are managing through the current crisis to best position our business as sporting events resume. And I will also provide an update on where things stand on the legislative front. Third, I will outline our major priorities going forward.  With that, let me start with a summary of our business. DraftKings is uniquely positioned at the intersection of digital sports entertainment and gaming in a rapidly growing industry. This opportunity represents an estimated addressable market of over $30 billion in the U.S. alone when considering a combination of online sports betting, fantasy sports, and iGames. There may also be less-developed fantasy and betting markets that could grow significantly in the coming years, such as eSports.  We believe the combination of a large currently underserved market along with strong momentum on the legislative front provides the potential to create an environment of continuous category expansion for many years to come. We see ourselves as the premier brand in digital sports entertainment. We are currently one of the leading U.S. digital sports books and have the number one rated daily fantasy sports and sports book apps in the country. Through the acquisition of SBTech, we have created the only vertically integrated sports betting company in the U.S., enabling us to be the product innovation leader for American sports, with a clear focus on the American sports fan. Finally, we have differentiated economics and online gaming due to our strong CAC and LTV metrics, driven by our large and growing fantasy sports database, a strong and well-known brand, significant expertise in infrastructure around marketing, and robust cross-sell metrics powered by years of investment in data science and analytics. Additionally, we have a clear state entry playbook to drive long-term profitability.  Turning to current events, I want to provide an overview of how we are responding to COVID-19. Certainly the current environment of major sports leagues and major sporting events has created short term revenue headwinds for the business. However, we are now in a strong position with nearly $0.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. Additionally, our long-term growth expectations remain unchanged and under certain scenarios may even accelerate. While, no one can predict exactly how COVID-19 will affect the world and for how long, we are confident, and when sports return, DraftKings will be ready.  As we have taken steps to navigate the short term impacts of the crisis, we have also been planning for what the post-COVID-19 world might look like, ensuring that the actions we are taking today are putting us in the strongest possible position. Our number one priority as a company is our employees' health and safety, and our organization continues to work productively in this work-from-home environment. Our teams are making great progress on our key priorities, such as launching new states, continuously upgrading our data automation and marketing technology capability, and building great products for our customers. Our product and technology teams have also created new content that is keeping our customers engaged during this unique period.  I would like to thank all of our tremendously talented employees who have stepped up and adapted to new working conditions without missing a beat. It has been truly remarkable to witness.  On that note, I am very proud of the content that we have developed over the last two months. For example, we have built a product that allows DraftKings' customers to engage in eSports events, such as simulated eNASCAR, Counter Strike, and Rocket League. We developed content for lesser known competitive sports, such as table tennis. We launched a plethora of pop culture free-to-play pools contests that covered everything from the democratic debates to TV shows like Survivor, The Last Dance and Top Chef.  We also want stimulated Madden games. And most recently we partnered with MLB on their new MLB Dream Bracket game. In parallel, we have continued to deliver on our state expansion roadmap successfully launching both iGaming in Pennsylvania and sports betting in Colorado in early May. The engagement numbers that we seeing across all of these products are a great validation that our customers are loving the content. And it also shows their passion for our products and loyalty to our brand. As we continue to monitor developments from sports leagues and teams, we are proactively planning for the variations of what the sports calendar could look like the rest of the year. With the expectation that this sports calendar will overlap like never before, our focus is on ensuring that we are prepared for the potential increased traffic in activity. There are still a lot of unknowns about how COVID-19 will ultimately impact major sporting events. But we are confident in our ability to perform as we prepare for what we hope will be a busy global sports calendar in the second half of the year. Currently, we do not anticipate any impact to our FY2021 or long-term plans as a result of COVID-19, assuming the sporting events calendar resumes to a normal state by 2021. There appears to be momentum with sports betting and iGaming legislation in the U.S. We are continuing to work with regulators to get our products live in states where we do not currently operate. In Q1, we launched sports betting in Iowa. And more recently we launched iGaming in Pennsylvania and online sports betting in Colorado. Additionally, an online sports betting bill became law in Virginia on April 22. Other states have passed legislation over the past year or so and are in the process of working towards launching operators. These states include Michigan, which passed a sports betting and iGaming law in December 2019; and Tennessee and Illinois, which legalized online sports setting about a year ago. At this time, approximately 14 states are actively considering sports betting legislation. We are hopeful that we will continue to see the momentum as many states are expected to confront budget deficit. Finally, before I turn it over to our CFO, Jason Park, to detail our Q1 performance and results, I wanted to provide an overview of our priorities for the business. As always, we are focused on entering new states at the earliest opportunity. In addition to the recent news in Pennsylvania and Colorado, we are working towards launching online sports betting in other states that have passed laws, such as Illinois, Michigan, Tennessee, and Virginia. We are in the process of working with regulators in West Virginia to hopefully launch iGaming. We will continue to invest in our product and technology capabilities as we look to stay ahead of the competition and truly differentiate our products in the market. Our ability to create new content quickly during this period was enabled by the technology and products investments we had previously made. These new products have allowed us to continue to acquire and retain users. And we will be monitoring activity on these alternate offerings once traditional sports return. Continued traction and engagement with products centered around e-sports and Pools based on pop-culture, positively affect CAC and LTV over time. Lastly, we will continue to work towards migrating to our own proprietary software and investing in live betting and other unique offerings for American sports. Strategically, we believe this will create a key differentiator for DraftKings helping us win with consumers and partners, and also improving our long-term margin profile. With that, I will now turn it over to DraftKings' CFO, Jason Park. Yes, thanks, Thomas. So, obviously a lot is still moving around. Currently as an example, the Masters is scheduled for November. So very different overlap in terms of sport calendar than it would have been \u2013 had it been played as planned in April. And there will be other examples like that, but hard to know exactly what they will be without all the sports calendars fully developed yet for the year. That said, I think to answer your question, assuming there is overlap, usually what we've seen is, when there are more popular sports going on overall activity and overall revenue goes up, that is something that we see typically for example in Q4 when we have a lot of sporting activity going on each year. So I would expect there'll be similar impacts, but it's very hard to know because the combinations are just totally different than they've ever been in prior years. But generally speaking, I would expect that to create more activity. From our customer acquisition standpoint, I think the team is going to take the same approach they always do, which is every single creative, every single piece of media, everything that we put out there has a target in mind and is tied to the creative and offering that we are going after with that target. And I think that, what we'll try to do is just test into everything, hard to know if it will make sense to build on the example that I mentioned earlier to acquire heavily on Masters, when it's overlapping with football. It may be different than when it's overlapping with other sports. So we're going to test everything and we'll learn lot, who knows how applicable, probably not so much, hopefully not so much, those learnings will be for future years, but we're able to actually pretty quickly iterate in year. So a lot of the testing we do is really being optimized moment-by-moment. So that's the approach we're going to take. So across the board, it's mostly our existing customer base. We've had some new customers coming in, are kind of typically we acquire customers throughout the year and I think probably more due than anything to people being home. We've seen pockets where that's gone up but hard to know that if there's like a particular new segment or anything that's being attracted to some of these offerings, my guess is it's mostly existing customers and mostly the same profile of customers we had typically been acquiring. Yes, I wouldn't say that there's anything surprising. But overall it didn't really, especially given the challenges of not being able to be face-to-face. It's been really going about as well as we possibly could have hoped. Very good chemistry between the teams, I think in the world of Zoom, it's almost as good as being in person. So we've gotten to spend a lot of video based face-to-face time together. And I also think there's certain element of just unification that happens when there's a crisis externally. And a lot of people feel fortunate that they're part of a business that has I think really got a strong outlook in terms of the future. And I think a lot of people are looking around at some of their friends and colleagues and other industries that are getting hit pretty hard, I actually think in some ways that's helped bringing the teams together, but overall it's been a really positive, early experience. And I'm very excited and very pleased with the progress we're making. Thanks, Tom. So, we aren't disclosing any specific iGaming metrics, but what I would say is, if you look at the publicly available reports from New Jersey for last month, the overall iGaming market grew, I believe approximately 118% and Resorts Digital, which is DraftKings skin partner grew about 126%. So we're very pleased with the growth we're seeing in that product relative to the market. And I think that, you know not surprising, but certainly something that we're continuing to focus on. And I apologize, what was the second question? Are you talking about in terms of iGaming or just overall for the business? Yes. So I think really it's been a continuation of what we've been seeing in April. I think that that there are some things that vary based on seasonality and sports, but iGaming is actually a remarkably consistent throughout the year. So I think that really, it's kind of been similar to what we've been seeing in April. So, I think right now, what we are trying to do is just test everything. And I think that you are right, given the reduction in some of the price of media that you're seeing, particularly in some of the big online \u2013 some of the big digital channels, there are opportunities that perhaps weren't there before to get more scale and reach and at the same time there's less sporting events to advertise, so those two things definitely counterbalance each other.  So what we're trying to do is just test into everything, figure out faster than hopefully our competition, what works and what doesn't and get those learnings into action in the marketplace. I think eSports is notable stand out. We launched to CS:GO and several others and it's been really strong volume compared to what eSports traditionally had seen. And the other thing I had mentioned are the simulated sports, particularly the simulated games that are using Madden, EA's Madden that people are playing fantasy and such with. To me, that's, it kind of makes sense, right, that there's a lot of football fans that want football year round and it's probably even enhanced by the fact that there's not a lot of other sports on TV, there's a lot of people that are at home looking to watch things.  So I think that's something that we're keeping an eye on and there could be some potential to extend the NFL season really throughout the year through simulated sports and I think it'll also work for other sports, but in particular I'm excited about the NFL, because part of what the NFL product, it's a scarce product. It's \u2013 a lot \u2013 there are a lot fewer NFL games and it's a shorter season than most of the other major sports. So I think there's a lot of potential there. And we do see a lot of people deactivate towards the end of the or after the Super Bowl. And many of them activate sporadically throughout the year on sporting events that are popular, like the Masters, for example, start of baseball season, brings new activation, March Madness of course. But there is a group that just loves the NFL and can't get enough of the NFL. So I think if you can find a way to give them that NFL experience more year round there's something there. So I think right now, we're still in the early stages of planning around integration and migration. Really the goal for us is to make sure we have a high-quality migration and putting that above really speed is the approach that we're taking. At the same time we have made good progress, so I think, we're probably looking at least mid-to-late 2021, before you're going to start to see some of the types of things that you mentioned really in action, but it could be longer, but I think that the progress we're making has been very solid so far, so I feel good about that timeline. As far as to say, but our belief, economics might be that live betting due to the frequency of it and due to how rapid fire it is that there's sort of less kind of market norms around where pricing ends up, if you look at, for example, pregame NFL lines across all the sports books, they're typically not too different, sometimes you see a half point difference here and there, slightly different odds, but the market's kind of the market, whereas live betting is so rapid fire that there's no time for people to price shop. And so it's not as efficient or perfectly priced of a market. So those types of situations, I think create opportunity if you have the best algorithms, the best pricing models to differentiate for sure. So, already I think that, from the first deal that we did to now, it's certainly become more clear that we are a preferred partner and I think we've gotten a lot of really positive tailwind from that. All the deals are a little bit different and we don't comment on the specific ones, but really the approach that we take is, we want to find the right partners and we want to make sure that we have the best combination of flexibility on our end and security for the long-term. So that's the approach that we take when we strike these deals. Sure. So are you referring to taxation from the states or taxation on winning? Yes, I mean, our hope is that most people want to pay their taxes and it is illegal to not report winnings. I think a lot of people actually report illegal winnings believe it or not there is an area where you can enter gambling winnings on IRS form, which includes illegal gambling winnings. So I think that it's hard to say that, to some extent, the types of customers we want are the ones that are following the law and includes paying the taxes. So I think most people feel like if they're fortunate enough to win a large enough sum of money, that triggers a tax reporting requirement that they're happy to pay it, but you're right, that there will be some segment that maybe are trying to avoid paying taxes and that's just something we simply can't compete with in the illegal market. And it's also, I know this isn't what you asked, but it's also important and also why we hope. And so far I've seen that states are being very reasonable about the tax rates they're charging, because that also if not done appropriately can have an impact on how much it costs the customer and so far the states have generally been sensible about that and we've been able to be competitive with the illegal market on pricing. But that's something that's important to maintain because otherwise it'll be very challenging to disrupt the illegal market. And I actually think that's the more important thing, I think most people would rather pay their taxes than break the law.  But I do think people don't want to get a worse deal or worst price. And I think it's important that we're able to maintain competitive pricing, which will be enabled by sensible taxes and regulation. It's been test, test, test. We've run, I think at this point 50 plus different types of content in our free-to-play pools. We have simulated NFL, Madden games going on, I think on some days up to 10 to 12 a day. On the weekends, I believe it's at that level. So we've been ramping up the things that are working, but it's been test, test, test and double, triple down on the things that work. And that really starts with testing on the existing traffic and user base. But then once we see what's working, we extend that into the external marketing strategy. So kind of step three is really to focus our customer acquisition efforts on the things that we know are already working to engage our existing customer base. We aren't, it's kind of much like the rest of the world, it's been very fluid. So literally one week story may be different than the prior week story. So right now, we're kind of waiting for the dust to settle before we start putting any commentary out there about what we're seeing. Thank you. So I think right now, there's a very strong interplay between how that market will look and grow and the pace of state legalization. And specifically what I mean is when, for example, in New Jersey, when we introduced all of these new products around, online retail, sports, betting, iGaming. We did see some cannibalization of daily fantasy sports. So the degree to which it will grow, whether it's low double digit, single digits or flat will depend on how quickly the other states that are in the process of either rolling out sports betting or considering legislation on sports betting move.  From a strategic perspective, certainly it's an important monetization engine for us. So that is always a focus and we're always testing and looking for ways to optimize there. But perhaps more importantly, it's the number one customer acquisition channel for us when we roll out online sports betting, iGaming and other products in state. So it's really most important to keep users active, keep building that active base by acquiring efficiently on to the DFS platform and then having really strong data on those customers. So that once we do see online sports betting or other products legalized in their state, we know exactly how to cross sell them. So I'll say a quick word, and then I'm going to turn it over to our Chief Legal Officer Stanton Dodge, see if he has anything to add. But we're continuing to stay away from predictions on that. I think, the current environment has made it even more challenging to pin an exact date on it. So, we're working hard with everyone to try to move as quickly as possible. But there's also a recognition that there's a crisis going on and this may not be their number one priority at the moment. So we have to balance that, but I think that the approach we will continue to take is as we get enough information to feel confident and putting a kind of date or date range around it, we will absolutely be transparent with that. And at this time, we don't have enough information to do that. Stanton, is there anything I missed that you wanted to add? So from the DraftKings perceptive, the old DraftKings perspective, it's a meaningful sport, but not a significant portion of our revenue each year. On the old SBTech side, given that the vast majority of their business is international, it's more important. It's almost two thirds for them, so it is very significant over there. So we'll see a meaningful impact on how that all shakes out to the B2B revenues. But I do not expect that significant of an impact to the B2C revenues. Great question. So on the first topic, we have definitely been doubling down in terms of our product roadmap, our long-term product roadmap of which live betting is a clear and important part of it. Perhaps you could argue on the sports book product, the most important part. We also have been balancing that with utilizing this opportunity to expand our offerings on new sports and daily fantasy sports, pushing out more e-sports and other things. So it's been a combination of content expansion due to sort of the lack of traditional sports content out there, along with progress against our medium to long-term roadmap on things like live betting, which really won't start to in a visible way to the consumer really take shape until probably second half of next year.  But I haven't been very pleased with the progress you've made across all of these things. I think the team has really stepped up and I think in some ways we're more productive than ever right now. So we're making a lot of progress across a lot of different areas. And then I apologize, what was the second question? So, the leagues are certainly just like the whole sports world valuating, what this all means for them. Certainly a lot of revenue depending on the sport, depending on the team it varies, but a lot of revenue does come from in-stadium and they're contemplating if there were to be some kind of a reduction in that revenue what could that possibly be replaced with or mitigated by. So, those are discussions we always have, and I think this particular situation, the pandemic has in some ways accelerated interest in certain areas as an example. I think there's been more significant interest in these simulated sports, products that I was referencing earlier than there had been in the past because the thought and the league's minds are, hey, if we do have to postpone or cancel or shift around the calendar, how do we engage fans? I think there's been more focus on tying the digital experience to the television broadcast because the thought is that more fans than ever could be consuming this content from home. So, like everyone, I think there's still a lot of unknowns that I think we'll kind of affect where things in terms of potential partnership opportunities, steer towards. But just like any situation where there's major shock or disruption, a lot of things that maybe were less interesting are not really on the table before are now potentially on the table. So we're trying to be at the center of all those discussions and be helpful wherever we can. First, and this is just personal opinion. I love the idea of the NBA starting on Christmas. Just as a fan, I feel like that's the day every year, it's almost like Thanksgiving with football that I think of NBA is the major sport. And as excited as I think people are for the start of the season anyway, it's still early in the NFL season when NBA typically starts versus starting in late December might actually I think create a bit more focused on the NBA versus, still being in the thick of the NFL. For example, if your favorite NFL team is may already be out of it by the time Christmas hits and that's not the case sometimes when it's mid or late October when the NBA traditionally has started. So I personally loved the idea. As far as impact on revenues, it's really hard to say it's unprecedented. We've never had that situation before. And my baseline expectation is I don't know why it would be that different. It's just basically pushing the same calendar out a month or two. But, it's hard to know because it does change where the overlap is. And more specifically assuming that the calendar is not condensed, that the idea of starting on Christmas means you play more deep into the summer. It will be more overlap with baseball. There's also and I think this could be a positive, there's just a lot less going on in the sports world during the summer than there is in the fall.  So in some ways, there might be more incrementality to having the playoffs for the NBA, and the season kind of, sorry, the regular season games to the NBA in the summer, and then the playoffs in the summer as well could potentially be less competitive with a lot of the other sporting events that are happening during the fall. And that could create some positive impacts, but really hard to say we're all going to have to observe how the data comes in, if they do make that change. And once we do, we'll be pretty quick in being able to update our forecasts. And right now, it's the best educated guess and we don't even really know what the schedule is going to look like. So even on that front, it's still a guessing game. Thank you again for joining us today for our first earnings call. We appreciate your thoughtful questions and look forward to continuing this dialogue with everyone. As discussed earlier, we are very pleased that our product and technology investments have created avenues to continue to engage our customers while most major sports are on hiatus. And I am very proud of our employees for their customer centric approach to designing and marketing these new offerings. Furthermore, I am very confident that regardless of how long COVID-19 disrupts our daily lives, DraftKings is well positioned to continue innovating on product, building market share, and working with policy makers to expand the addressable market. We appreciate the support our shareholders have placed in us, and we hope all of you are as excited as we are to watch our vision unfold over the coming years. We're also really excited about executing it. Thanks again. I hope everyone is staying safe and well during these challenging times. And we look forward to speaking with you again soon."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. As many of you are aware, we completed our business combination with SBTech and Diamond Eagle on April 23. Accordingly our results for the first quarter, ending March 31, reflect those of legacy DraftKings and legacy SBTech each on a standalone basis. Starting with Old DraftKings, despite COVID we generated $89 million of net revenue in the quarter, which is an increase of 30% versus prior year. Notably pre-COVID prior to March 11, our revenue was up 60% versus prior year. These results are due to our strategy of launching in new states, as well as growing revenue in existing states. In this quarter, we were live in five new states for online sports betting, versus the first quarter of 2019, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Due to COVID, we missed several, sizable revenue opportunities attached to Q1 sporting events, such as March Madness, as well as several weeks of the NBA and NHL seasons. Nevertheless, we are pleased to have generated 30% revenue growth compared to the prior year. Our iGaming business such as online Blackjack and Roulette was not impacted by COVID-19 and exhibited strong results. Additionally, we saw acceleration in iGaming activity after major sporting events stopped, and people began looking for alternative forms of entertainment. Despite COVID-19 we had experienced strong MUP and ARPMUP growth for the quarter. We grew our MUPs to 720,000 up from 619,000, over Q1 2019, an increase of 16%. And our ARPMUP increased to $41, up from $37 last year, an increase of 12%. We are pleased with our unique player growth and with the success we have achieved cross-selling our customers into new product offerings. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $49.5 million this year versus negative $20.4 last year. As we expected our loss widened primarily due to our planned investment in connection with launching our product offerings in five new states. These investments in the form of promotions and external marketing are consistent with our new-state playbook and are expected to drive long-term profitable growth. As we began to see the impact of COVID-19, we reacted quickly, with the scale back external marketing spend in the March period. In addition to this investment into new states, we also invested into our organization. More than half of our new headcount was in our product and technology teams to support our continued innovation and focus on the diversification of our products. Our compensation expenses are already beginning to level off. As we begin to reach and scale throughout different parts of the organization. Our net income of negative $68.7 million was in line with our own expectations. Now turning to SBTech. Old SBTech revenue generated \u20ac22.6 million, an increase of 3% versus Q1 2019. Notably, pre-COVID, prior to March 11, our revenue was up 19% versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was negative \u20ac851,000 versus prior year of positive \u20ac4.3 million. SBTech was well on track to achieve positive EBITDA for the quarter, until COVID hit. And we anticipate to return to profitability once the major sports resume. As all of you can appreciate providing guidance in this environment is difficult for many companies and we are no exception. Given the significant certainty around how COVID-19 will impact the sports calendar, we are now providing 2020 revenue guidance. We are preparing internally for all possible scenarios and as we learn more from the leads, we will incorporate our learnings into our forecasting. I want to reiterate something Jason Robins said earlier, which is that based on what we know today, we do not anticipate any reductions to our fiscal year 2021 revenue projections. And we continue to believe that the long-term growth prospects of the business are strong. Finally, I would like to highlight our strong balance sheet. Coming off of a successful business combination and public listing on April 24, we are well capitalized with nearly $0.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet at close. While major sports to be on hold for a protracted period of time, we expect to be able to manage our company cash burn to $15 million to $20 million per month. We are able to achieve these low levels of cash burn due to our highly variable cost structure. The majority of our calls are tied to revenue and external marketing is at our discretion. There's even opportunity to improve that burn rate as we continue to diversify our offerings and grow our iGaming activity.  We are concluding our remarks for this period, and then we'll open the line for questions. So, iGaming is a little bit different than sports betting in that all of our content is available in iGaming, whereas of course without a lot of major sports playing, sports betting does not have all of the traditional content available, that said, I would say that so far what we've seen has been a positive and in-line with better than what we expected. So, very early, we literally just launched these products in the last few weeks, but so far we think, what we're seeing is in-line with or better than what we expected."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Stanton Dodge, Chief Legal Officer. You may begin.\nStanton Dodge : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact, constitute forward-looking statements that are sure to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility for updating forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. During the call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute to DraftKing's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in our annual report on Form 10-K that was filed today with the SEC and our earnings presentation, both of which are available on our website at investors.draftkings.com. Hosting the call today are Jason Robins, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open up the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, everyone. I hope you are all doing well. Before I share my thoughts on the fourth quarter, I want to thank everyone at DraftKings for their tremendous effort and contributions to our success. We had an incredible 2021, and our dedicated employees continued to deliver during an ongoing and challenging pandemic. I also want to thank our loyal customers for their continued support. At DraftKings, we are always striving to put our customers at the center of everything we do. On today's call, I will cover the following topics. First, I'll discuss our financial achievements. We outperformed our expectations for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, capping off a year in which five of our states were contribution profit positive. We're off to a tremendous start in 2022 as well. Customer acquisition in new states has been accelerating while continuing to pay back on a gross profit basis in the two- to three-year time frame. As of today, 10 states are either already contribution profit positive or on track to achieve that milestone in 2022. Overall, we expect DraftKings to be contribution profit positive for FY '22. And if we were to have frozen new state launches at the end of 2021, we expect that DraftKings would have been able to achieve EBITDA profitability as an enterprise in Q4 of this year. Second, we continue to see rapid expansion of the OSB and iGaming TAM in the U.S. This is being driven by both new jurisdictions legalizing OSB and iGaming as well as continued healthy growth in existing states. Overall, in 2021, seven states enacted legislation for mobile sports betting, and we launched in five states last year with the other two states subsequently launching in 2022. In iGaming, one state enacted legislation in which we subsequently launched. We also saw two new states open up for Daily Fantasy Sports. Third, additional product features and functionality for our mobile sports betting and iGaming apps are driving increased customer retention and monetization as well as improved margins. Many of these benefits are now possible as a result of the migration to our in-house sports betting platform, which gives us the ability to diversify our bet types, optimize our in-game betting features and expand the breadth and depth of our content offering. We also introduced our new Dynasty Rewards loyalty program and continue to expand our social functionality. And finally, adjacent verticals further increase our TAM with the added benefits of more efficient customer acquisition, higher customer LTV. Our new growth initiatives such as DraftKings Marketplace and media are seeing promising early results, and we're optimistic about the potential for future growth. DraftKings\u2019 47% year-over-year revenue growth to $473 million in Q4 exceeded our guidance by 8%. The strong fourth quarter brought our full year revenue to nearly $1.3 billion, representing 101% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter also outperformed our expectations at minus $128 million. Fourth quarter Monthly Unique Payers increased to about $2 million, up 32% versus Q4 2020. Average revenue per Monthly Unique Payer increased 19% year-over-year to $77. I'm very pleased with the market share we achieved in Q4, which reflects the success of our technology migration and the strength of our overall business and brand. Our handle share for mobile sports betting across all active states was 32% in Q4. For iGaming, our gross revenue share was 20% in Q4, including Connecticut; and our market share in New Jersey set a record in each of October, November and December. We look forward to providing more color on a number of topics at our upcoming Investor Day, including our TAM, market share, product innovation, unit economics at both the player and state level, enterprise EBITDA and new organic growth vectors. Our key performance metrics, including user acquisition, retention and engagement continued to trend well in the fourth quarter and led to strong results across products. The fourth quarter was a record quarter for mobile sports betting handle on an absolute basis as we were live in more states compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as on a same-state basis. In states where we were live for the entirety of Q4 2021 and Q4 2020, we saw a significant increase in engagement, with handle up to 65% due to paid actives growing by 37% and handle per paid active growing by 20%. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, iGaming gross revenue grew 153% year-over-year, including all state, and 61% year-over-year on a same-state basis. Looking at New Jersey, our most mature state where we launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in 2018, our MUPs continued to grow at a healthy rate. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Combined OSB and iGaming MUPs grew 18% year-over-year. MUPs in New Jersey were 78% higher relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. We had a very strong launch for mobile sports betting and iGaming in Connecticut, a state with only three mobile sports betting operators and only two iGaming operators. For mobile sports betting in Connecticut, our handle market share was 47%. Our gross gaming revenue share was 51% and our net gaming revenue share was 57% in the fourth quarter. For iGaming in Connecticut, our gross revenue share was 58%. Our business momentum has continued into Q1. On January 8, we launched mobile sports betting in New York. It took DraftKings less than 24 hours to acquire 100,000 first-time paid betters in New York compared to 17 days for Arizona, 170 days for New Jersey, 312 days for Pennsylvania and 344 days for Indiana. In our first 30 days, we acquired over 300,000 users in New York, which was 2.3x the average of our other states in their first 30 days on a population-adjusted basis. There is no question that customers are joining our platform faster than they did in states that we launched in previous years. As a result, our CACs are fantastic, but overall spending for the first few months is higher than it was for our more mature states, such as New Jersey. When the New York market launched, there was some aggressive promotional behavior by many operators, but DraftKings is committed to maintaining its disciplined approach to customer acquisition and is targeting a two- to three-year path to profitability for the state. We believe that product will be the key differentiator between operators over time. For example, our technology provides a seamless customer experience through a single integrated sign-in in wallet across product offerings and jurisdictions. We are already seeing this play out in the Northeast, where customers who travel between New York, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are able to play on the DraftKings app without having to open a new account. On January 12, we announced that DraftKings will become the official Sportsbook provider of the Oregon lottery. Pursuant to our exclusive agreement with the Oregon Lottery, DraftKings Sportsbook replaced the scoreboard app on January 18. The DraftKings Sportsbook app offers additional betting markets and an overall superior customer experience. We look forward to serving all sports betters in Oregon. On January 28, we launched mobile sports betting for eligible customers in Louisiana's permitted parishes. With several professional franchises in addition to Division 1 collegiate athletic, there are ample hometown fan bases and opportunities in Louisiana to engage. And last Sunday, an exciting NFL playoff ended with another game that went down to the wire. It was also a great end to the season for DraftKings as on Super Bowl Sunday, our total actives across all products was nearly 1.7 million. In fact, this year's Super Bowl was our highest-ever day for actives and handle both in total and on a same-state basis. Looking ahead, we are raising our revenue guidance to incorporate the impact of New York and Louisiana as well as strong underlying performance in the states we were already live in last quarter. Jason Park will provide more detail. Turning to legalization trends. we have continued to see momentum. Following our launches in New York and Louisiana in January, DraftKings is live with online sports betting in 17 states that collectively represent approximately 36% of the U.S. population. Additionally, DraftKings is live with iGaming in 5 states, representing approximately 11% of the U.S. population. After the governor of Ohio signed into law a bill authorizing mobile and retail sports wagering, there are now 3 U.S. jurisdictions that have legalized where we are preparing to launch upon licensure and approval from regulators, Maryland, Puerto Rico and Ohio. These jurisdictions represent approximately 7% of the U.S. population and will bring the percentage of the population where DraftKings expects to offer legalized mobile sports betting to approximately 43%. So far in 2022, 10 state legislatures have introduced legislation to legalize mobile sports betting, and 8 state legislatures have introduced legislation either to expand their existing sports betting frameworks, create referendums regarding sports betting legislation or increase in-person sports betting opportunities. In addition, 3 states have introduced iGaming legislation and 3 other states have introduced online poker legislation. We also made 2 announcements that position us from mobile and retail sports betting in Kansas and the state of Washington pending changes in state law, licensure and receiving necessary approval from state regulators. I also want to comment on California and Florida. In California, we continue to work with a number of leading online sports betting operators in support of a campaign to bring regulated safe and responsible online sports betting to the state. Legal online sports betting is projected to bring hundreds of millions in tax revenue annually to the state to address 2 of the state's most pressing issues, homelessness and mental health. We are confident that the California Solutions to Homelessness and Mental Health Support Act will create a competitive market with the best products and experience for consumers. In Florida, we were fortunately not able to get the required number of signatures in time for inclusion on the ballot this November. This is due to a variety of factors, including COVID as well as the compressed time frame given when signature gathering started. We are very encouraged, however, by the over 1 million individuals who signed petitions in less than 8 months, which shows that Floridians do want the opportunity to vote on a competitive mobile sports betting market in the state. We are exploring all options to ensure that Floridians get that opportunity as soon as possible. And if we were to refile, we are very confident that, given the extended time frame, we will be able to qualify for the 2024 ballot. Ontario has announced that the province will launch the first competitive regulated and licensed online sports setting and iGaming market in Canada on April 4, 2022. We look forward to launching in Ontario and competing in that market, pending licensure and required approvals. For context, Ontario represents about 40% of Canada's population and would be the fifth-largest U.S. state by population. Moving on to product and technology. We continue to add breadth and depth to our mobile sports betting and iGaming products. As we have mentioned in the past, we believe that the long-term winners in this industry will provide the best product experience to customers. With the completion of the migration to our in-house bet engine, we are now capturing the acquisition synergies we anticipated in our mobile sports betting cost structure and have turned a variable cost into a fixed cost. For mobile sports betting, we launched parlay and same-game parlay insurance promotion capabilities in the fourth quarter. For those who are unfamiliar with this feature, parlay insurance allows betters to win something even if they lose legs within their parlay bet. This new capability has had a great response from our users, and it has supported growth in our mix in mobile sports betting handle coming from parlays. For same-game parlays, we also expanded our sport coverage beyond the NFL, college football and the NBA with the launch of College Basketball and the NHL in November. We invested in our in-play offering and in-play experience by introducing a new front-end user interface for Flash Bet that allows for a more engaging wagering experience. Flash Bet is an immersive live betting experience where users can follow what's going on in the game and get shown our flash markets, which refer to the next occurrence that will happen in the game. Markets supported by this functionality include Next Play Result, Drive Result and Drive Yardage for the NFL and next team to score and type of score for the NBA. For iGaming, we continue to benefit from cross-selling in the games we have created in-house. In the fourth quarter, 49% of mobile sports betting users in our iGaming states also engaged with our iGaming product. When looking at DraftKings' developed games, 56% of iGaming handle in the fourth quarter came from DraftKings developed teams, which is important both for differentiation and from a gross margin rate perspective. As an example, DraftKings Rocket is now launched in Connecticut and in Michigan in addition to New Jersey. This game continues to be very popular with our users. In the first 14 days following launch, 40% of Michigan's iGaming paid actives and 41% of Connecticut's iGaming paid actives played Rocket. This compares to 33% of New Jersey iGaming paid actives in the first 14 days. We look forward to updating you on the DraftKings developed means we will launch in 2022 on future earnings calls. DraftKings Social is an industry-first innovation that creates an integrated social community allowing fans to interact with each other within a peer-to-peer environment. This functionality, which we began rolling out in Q2 of 2021, is now live across our Sports Betting and Daily Fantasy sports products, and it is driving customer engagement through features such as bet-sharing. The average number of bets for users who have placed at least 1 bet through our social platform grew 67% from Q3 to Q4 which significantly outpaced quarter-over-quarter growth for users who have not placed a wager through our social platform. We will continue to add to our social functionality in 2022. For example, we're launching several additional social integration points across our Sportsbook and DFS products in the first part of the year. We're also building additional features, such as betting groups, which allow friends to bet in private groups where everyone gets to see each other's bets and chat, as well as chat features for both DFS and our live casino games. We will also be launching a feature that allows any user to go live with video and audio, which broadcast bets they make in real time to viewers. In November, we launched Dynasty Rewards, our all-new cross-product loyalty program that rewards players to their play across all DraftKings consumer products in all jurisdictions. Dynasty Rewards is the most comprehensive DraftKings loyalty program ever, featuring a wide spectrum of rewards curated for every kind of customer, from free credits to exclusive experiences. With the ability to earn on everything DraftKings and to choose how you're rewarded, we believe it will take the customers' experience to the next level, help drive retention and cement DraftKings as a top gaming and entertainment brand. We have tapped into our deep roster of lead deals and strategic partnerships to craft these once-in-a-lifetime exclusive experiences. At the launch of Dynasty Rewards, we partner with the NFL for an exclusive DraftKings Super Bowl getaway and the NHL for the Winter Classic, with many more experiences to come. Engagement with the loyalty program has been phenomenal. Approximately 95% of customers in our highest 2 tiers have actively engaged with the Dynasty Rewards program since launch. And this is just the beginning. Over the months ahead, we will continue to enhance Dynasty Rewards with more ways to earn and redeem, deeper integrations and utility within our core products, new perks with partners and retail locations and more. Draftkings Marketplace had another dynamic quarter as interest and demand continues to be strong. We sit at the intersection of Web3 and sports culture as the only company to offer digital collectibles, sports betting, daily fantasy and iGaming products. As the NFT space evolves, the broader DraftKings ecosystem will create more opportunities for our marketplace around utility gamification and custom offers that only we can provide. The fourth quarter featured drops from the Usain Bolt, Rob Gronkowski, Wayne Gretzky, Simone Biles, Tom Brady and Tony Hawk as well as SLAM Logo passes in the soft dome franchise. We also revealed plans with the NFL Players Association and One Team Partners, the group licensing partner of the NFLPA to launch gamified NFT collections that we anticipate debuting on DraftKings Marketplace during the 2022, 2023 NFL season. The agreement grants DraftKings licensing rights for active NFL players, including the authentic use of name, image and likeness. Initial anticipated features of DraftKings gamified NFL player NFTs include the ability for customers to use these collectibles within games against each other on the platform as well as separate buying and selling functionality. It is expected that there will be a variety of NFT additions in tiers that incorporate different aspects of utility and digital rarity. DraftKings previously announced a strategic agreement with Polygon to provide a scalable, eco-friendly blockchain solution that enables added throughput, lower transaction fees and expanded capabilities. We continue to add functionality and features to Marketplace. We launched auctions in conjunction with the exclusive drop of Dale Earnhardt Jr. NFT, and also offer an experiential element, with 1 auction featuring NFT coupled with the chance to do a lap with Dale at Speedway. Our media vertical is seeing good momentum with month-over-month audience growth, driven in large part through our Dan Le Batard and VSiN assets. Our goal is to continue to grow our audience and content, which is uniquely positioned across 3 dynamic industries: Sports, entertainment and technology. As part of that, we are excited to welcome Mike Golic Sr. to our roster of talent, and we have also been actively working closely with our partners at Meadowlark to greenlight several new shows that we expect will be announced in the coming months. And finally, last month, we announced the addition of 2 new senior leaders with extensive media experience to bolster our team and add velocity to our efforts. We will continue to invest in adjacent growth vectors like DraftKings Marketplace and media in 2022, with the approach that each of them will continue to drive the LTV-to-CAC flywheel that we are creating along with our existing core DFS, OSB and iGaming offerings. I'd also like to provide an update on our acquisition of Golden Nugget Online Gaming. In Q4, we made significant progress towards closing the acquisition. And upon closing, we are prepared to integrate the business and capture the synergies we outlined when we announced the transaction in August. We're excited to deploy a multi-brand strategy while accessing the millions of loyal Golden Nugget Online Gaming and Fertitta Entertainment customers. We anticipate multiple channels for cost savings by, among other things, recognizing enhanced returns on advertising spend through marketing efficiencies and eliminating platform costs by migrating to DraftKings' in-house technology. I also want to provide some recent updates on responsible gaming. I am proud that DraftKings is playing the long game and refining the customer experience through a relentless focus on responsible gaming education and by supporting research in this area. In December, DraftKings announced a multiyear financial commitment to the Kindbridge Institute for a new research program to study the nexus of veterans and responsible gaming, with the ultimate goal of advancing evidence-based research in this area and improving the lives of the veterans. And in January, we announced a multiyear financial commitment to assist the 35 state problem gaming councils across the country by providing critical funding, which will support the work of local non-profit organizations. As part of the new initiative, entitled the State Council Funding Program, DraftKings has offered each state council $15,000 per year for 3 years, a total commitment of $1.575 million over the span of the 3-year program. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings' CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our fourth quarter results and 2022 guidance.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to announce that we generated $473 million in revenue for the quarter, an increase of 47% versus Q4 2020. Our revenue performance was significantly better than the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter, which was $437 million. Our B2C business generated $458 million for the quarter, an increase of 58% versus Q4 2020. OSB hold was not a driver of overperformance versus our guidance. Our guidance on November 4 had included $25 million of core hold in October and November and December combined were fairly typical. Given that hold was neutral relative to the guidance we shared in November, the $36 million organic outperformance versus our guidance was due to strength across customer acquisition, retention and monetization. In our B2C business, we continued to drive strong growth through player acquisition and retention, as measured through MUPs, as well as player engagement and monetization as measured through ARPMUP. B2C Monthly Unique Payers in the quarter increased 32% year-over-year to approximately 2.0 million, which brings our full year MUPs to 1.49 million, which is up 69% versus prior year. The increase reflects excellent player retention in states where we were live with our OSB and iGaming product offerings in Q4 2020 as well as the expansion of our OSB and iGaming product offerings into new states. Results reflected typical intraquarter seasonality, with October and November higher from a MUPs perspective, followed by a modest decline in December. As a reminder, a MUP is a monthly unique player, and therefore, our number of annual active players is higher based on how many months per year a MUP plays. Average Revenue per Monthly Unique Payer, or ARPMUP, was $77 in Q4, representing a 19% increase versus $65 for the same period in 2020, which brings our full year ARPMUP to $67, up 31% versus prior year. Our ARPMUP was positively impacted by a continued mix shift into our Sportsbook and iGaming product offerings and cross-selling our customers into more products. B2B generated $15 million, a decrease versus prior year due primarily to the termination of our Asian reseller agreement. We generated $251 million of gross profit dollars on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the entire business in the quarter, representing a 33% increase versus last year. Gross margin rate in the quarter on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the business was 53% versus 33% in Q3 and versus 59% last year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, you can see how the promotional intensity for new customer acquisition impacted our gross margin rate in Q3 versus Q4, where we focus more on monetization. On a year-over-year basis, more than half of the share gross margin rate was due to the reduction in B2B revenues resulting from the termination of our Asia reseller agreement. The remaining portion of the change was primarily due to investment in new states launched after Q4 2020, including Michigan, Virginia, Wyoming, Arizona and Connecticut. As Jason mentioned, the migration to our in-house bet engine has positively impacted our COGS as a percentage of revenue for OSB. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $128 million, which also exceeded our expectations due to the strong underlying performance of our business. Our sales and marketing expenses were $263 million, which include our external marketing. External marketing was higher in Q4 2021 versus the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the 5 additional states that went live in 2021, offset by declines in more mature states. The 5 new states represent 9% of the U.S. population and were in their first NFL season. We are seeing more customers engage faster in new states versus states that launched in 2018 through 2020, which improves our per player acquisition costs while -- accelerating our total marketing investment in a new state. As a reminder, we invest to acquire a player based on 2- to 3-year gross profit paybacks, which we will discuss more at our upcoming Investor Day. Our general and administrative and product and technology costs on an adjusted EBITDA basis were $74 million and $42 million, respectively, as we continued to invest to achieve scale in our back office functions such as human resources, legal, finance and accounting and customer service as well as adding to our technology team principally for new product development. A majority of the combined $23 million of year-over-year growth in these 2 expense lines was due to the compensation of new employees. Our strong Q4 revenue brought our full year to $1.296 billion of revenue, $616 million of gross profit at a 48% gross margin rate and negative $676 million of EBITDA. Taking a step back, 2021 was a fantastic year of execution and continued learning. We will discuss more in our upcoming Investor Day, but it is clear that the business model is working. We are acquiring customers efficiently with clear 2- to 3-year gross profit payback periods, and states are turning positive 2 to 3 years after launching. Therefore, we have an increasingly clear line of sight into turning EBITDA-positive. Moving on to our balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. As we look forward through our scenario-driven multiyear plan, we continue to feel that we are well capitalized for the legalization path and growth ahead of us. As a reminder, our primary use of capital is to fund state launches. And under almost all scenarios and state launch timing, we have sufficient capital to achieve positive free cash flow. Looking at 2022, on our November earnings call, we introduced annual revenue guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Given new state launches and underlying customer acquisition, retention and monetization trends, today, we are increasing our 2022 revenue guidance to a range of $1.85 billion to $2.0 billion, a 7% increase at the midpoint to $1.925 billion. Our revised guidance equates to year-over-year revenue growth of 43% to 54% and B2C growth of 57%. We expect both MUPs and ARPMUP to grow in 2022, with MUPs increasing at a rate of about 50% higher than the expected rate of increase in ARPMUP. This guidance includes New York, Oregon and Louisiana as well as the resumption of mobile registration in Illinois no later than March 5. It also includes approximately $70 million in DraftKings Marketplace revenue in 2022. It does not include additional state launches, nor the impact of the Golden Nugget acquisition, which we anticipate will close this quarter. We will update our guidance following the closing of the transaction. For B2B, we expect revenues to be about $40 million with minimal growth going forward. Regarding our 2022 quarterly revenue cadence, we expect Q1 to be between $400 million and $420 million. Please remember that although New York and Louisiana launched in Q1, new states typically start generating positive GAAP revenue after 1 to 2 months. Looking at the rest of the year, we expect Q2 to be similar to Q1, Q3 to be modestly lower than Q1 and Q4 to represent the seasonally highest quarter for revenue. You'll notice this cadence implies a higher percentage of revenue in the second half of this year compared to 2021. This is partly due to New York and Louisiana as well as DraftKings Marketplace ramping throughout the year. Additionally, revenue distribution is affected by variations in hold. For example, in 2021, Q1 and Q2 had positive variances, whereas Q3 and Q4 had negative variance. For the purposes of our guidance, we are not assuming variances in hold will reflect last year's patterns as these are primarily driven by sport outcomes. Prior to today, we have not provided guidance for adjusted EBITDA. However, over the past few years, we have gained experience in multiple states, ran many tests to understand how to optimize our business increased our clarity on organizational requirements and gain scale in marketing, which supports providing EBITDA guidance at this time. We are focused on growth and on efficiency. We feel terrific about our customer cohort gross profit paybacks as well as state profitability, and thus, our trajectory for revenue and EBITDA. Three important points on profitability. First, we expect to be contribution profit positive this year, with contribution profit defined as gross profit minus external marketing. Number two, if we had not launched any additional states after December 31, 2021, we expect that DraftKings would have been able to achieve EBITDA profitability in Q4 of 2022. And most importantly, number three, based on all the states we are currently in, and if legalization trends remain consistent with prior years, which has been around 7% to 9% OSB legalization per year and 3% to 4% iGaming legalization per year, we would expect to be EBITDA positive in Q4 of 2023. For this year, including the 5 states representing approximately 11% of the population that we have launched since September and a return to mobile registration in Illinois, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between negative $825 million to $925 million. Our business model is based on acquiring customers with 2- to 3-year gross profit paybacks, states turning positive contribution profit after 2 to 3 years and then positive contribution profit states offsetting negative contribution profit states. In 2022, the states we launched in 2018, 2019 and 2020 will generate significant positive contribution profit. This includes New Jersey, which exceeded the expectations we laid out at our last Investor Day on both the top and bottom line. The positive contribution profit from these more mature states is partially offset by the negative contribution profit from newer 2021 states as well as large negative contribution profit from New York. Our guidance for adjusted EBITDA also includes continued near-term investments in non-external marketing expenses, given the high-growth stage of our industry. We will see the benefits of the investments we are making in 2023 as our P&T, G&A and fixed marketing expenses will grow at a meaningfully lower annual rate compared to prior years. From a quarterly perspective for 2022, given our launch in New York on January 8 and in Louisiana on January 28, we expect our adjusted EBITDA loss in Q1 to be between $320 million and $340 million. We expect Q3, which is impacted by the start of the NFL season to be slightly worse than Q1, with the second quarter representing a little less than half of our expected Q1 loss. We expect our fourth quarter loss to be smallest as we benefit from higher seasonal revenue. As a reminder, as you think about the rest of 2022, please keep in mind that any states at launch have minimal to negative impact initially on the top line as we promote, and a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA and as we spend on external marketing, to drive early customer engagement at CACs that are consistent with our 2- to 3-year gross profit payback period target. Our marketing spend is also highly flexible and can be reduced or paused altogether if attractive customer acquisition opportunities are not available or the sports calendar shifts. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord. Your line is open.\nMichael Graham: Hey, thanks very much, and thanks for all the detail. I just wanted to ask two. The first one is just any quick update on in New York, how you're sort of dealing with the high tax rate there and sort of passing that along to the players. And then for a more involved question, just on ARPMUP, the performance there was so strong. Maybe just a little more color on the mix of factors from engagement or product or cross-selling? Just a little bit more color on sort of what you're seeing under the hood that's driving such good performance there.\nJason Robins : Thanks, Michael. Two questions. So the first one on New York. There's been some chatter of New York considering in this upcoming legislative session adjusting the tax rate down. I think the approach we're taking is a wait-and-see on that. And I think if that happens, depending on where it lands, then we'll adjust accordingly. And if it doesn't happen, then we'll adjust accordingly. So I think we're kind of taking a wait-and-see approach to this legislative session. And in New York, customer acquisition has been so efficient and the early player cohort results have been so strong that we're hopeful that, with an appropriate tax rate, it can be a very profitable market for us. But if not, we'll make the necessary adjustments to ensure that it meets the two- to three-year payback and that it is a very profitable market for us in the long run. As far as ARPMUP goes, few things that play there. One, we continue to see mix shift into OSB and iGaming from legacy DFS. That's been helpful. Second, we've improved our product dramatically over the last six months or so after migrating onto our own proprietary tech platform. We've seen an uptick in parlay mix. We've seen an uptick in live betting. So lots of good things there. And then lastly, I think that, really, the ability for us to cross-sell and to engage and activate customers continues to get better as our CRM programs have more and more test data, and we optimize those.\nMichael Graham: All right. Thanks so much, Jason.\nJason Robins : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Stauff with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJoseph Stauff : Thank you. Good morning, Jason. Good morning, Jason. I wanted to ask relative to your EBITDA guidance -- EBITDA loss guidance in 2022, what sort of, say, promotional and advertising underlying environment are you assuming with respect to that guidance? And then the second piece to that is, I guess it's fair to assume that in the handful of states/province that you'll launch maybe later this year. I know you don't like to guide until you're actually in there. But one would think, say, the midpoint of that EBITDA loss guidance, the $875 million, is likely to be wider. Is that fair? And is there any magnitude you could give us?\nJason Robins : So on the first question, the new states that we've launched recently, including, of course, New York and Louisiana this year and then a few last year, we'll continue to invest in those in customer acquisition. Typically, the first year, sometimes two years, of customer acquisition are the strongest cohorts that you acquire. And I think it's really important that we continue to invest there. As noted earlier, we're keeping an eye on the New York legislative session. And I think depending on what happens there with the tax rate, we may make some adjustments. But as of now, we are basing it on what we know. And then as far as new states, as you noted, we don't really get into the habit of saying, here's what we expect to happen because we don't know when new states are going to launch. Obviously, Ontario has some clarity around it. But most other states that have legalized, namely Ohio, Puerto Rico and Maryland, have not yet set dates. So I think for now, we're going to wait and see on that. And I think there's a number of factors that could drive EBITDA better or worse than what we're guiding to right now. I think there's some upside, and there's, of course, the possibility of new states where we'd invest. So hard to say what the net impact will be, given all the moving parts.\nJoseph Stauff : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley : Hi, guys, good morning. Jason, I just wanted to dig into some of the comments on the reaching breakeven or profitability in 4Q '23. I guess my key question is, if we already use the same assumptions -- and you're incorporating some growth in these numbers, which we appreciate. Under the same assumptions, would you be full year profitable in 2024? And is that -- or is that too ambitious?  And sort of as the follow-up to that, would external marketing expense dollars actually start to decline as we get out into that period, let's call it, 4Q '23 or 2024? Or are we just seeing leverage, meaning declining as a percentage of sales, but not necessarily declining in absolute dollars, to get to some of those assumptions? Thanks.\nJason Robins : Yes, good question. So as we noted, we would expect, if we had frozen state launches at the end of last year, we'd be profitable by this year fourth quarter. And given, as you mentioned, normal 7% to 9% legalization of the population on OSB, 3% to 4% on iGaming, we'd expect to be profitable by the fourth quarter. As far as the entire year for '24, I think the expectation is we would either be profitable or close to it. Obviously, the further out we go, the more moving parts. But based on the assumptions we're making, it would be pretty much in that zone of either profitable or very close to profitable. And then as far as the question around marketing, we're not providing specific guidance around what marketing will be. But certainly, there will be a very strong impact from leverage. I think you can expect some slowdown in fixed costs as well. And obviously, the revenue growth we expect to continue to be strong. So I think that's really the primary driver there. But whether or not we make some optimizations to marketing, it will depend on how our testing goes.\nShaun Kelley : Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nThomas Allen : Thanks. So two questions for me. First question, fourth quarter revenues were well ahead and EBITDA beat. One pushback we've heard is on where MUPs were a little bit lower at around 2 million, versus you guys had talked to on the third quarter call around 2.1 million. Can you discuss that a little bit? Second question, Jason Park, I think I heard you say that you have sufficient capital until you have positive free cash flow. So there's definitely a concern in the market that you may need to raise capital. So can you just address that?\nJason Robins : Thomas. First of all, very prescient report by you, almost nailing our EBITDA guidance, that was good. But I think as far as the MUPs go, we had said we had $2.1 million in September. Last quarter's average was actually lower. We haven't guided to MUPs, typically, so we didn't provide a guide. But I mean, it was pretty much on target with consensus, only like 3 or 4 analysts, I think, even predicting MUPs. And I think we were a couple of points short, but we were right where we wanted to be. But we haven't provided guidance there. And of course, it's an average of all 3 months. So as you get into certain months with different sport mixes and further into the NFL season, it can vary. But if you look at the quarter, last quarter, we actually went up in MUPs quarter-over-quarter, and we certainly went up year-over-year. And then I apologize, what was the other question? Oh, on capital and free cash flow. So we have said all along and continue to say that we expect that we have enough capital on the balance sheet to get to free cash flow positive. Nothing has changed there. Obviously, we would have to have a meaningful improvement in year-over-year losses starting in '23, which is what we expect, very similar to, I think, what you wrote in your report. But our plan, our multiyear plan that we have, does not require any additional capital raise.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Stephen Gambling with Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling : Grambling, but close. Follow-up on MUPs. I think I heard you reference 1.7 million actives at the Super Bowl. How does this compare to last year? As optically, it does look like it's down sequentially from fourth quarter even as New York opened.\nJason Robins : Well, it was way up from last year. I mean, remember, that was 1 day. If you look at the quarterly MUPs, it's going to be higher than any 1 day would be, or at least the monthly would be. Obviously, there's some seasonality in there as football ended in February. But that was 1 day that was by far the most we've ever had in 1 day, and it's not even close. We haven't disclosed specific number last year from Super Bowl, but that's something we can consider doing at our upcoming Investor Day, but I can tell you it was up extraordinarily higher year-over-year versus last Super Bowl.\nStephen Grambling : And if I can sneak 1 other very quick one in. I guess on the guidance, EBITDA loss guidance, I guess, what is the underlying assumption on the broader promotional intensity?\nJason Robins : Our assumption is that we continue to run very similar new customer promos to what we've run in the past, and that we run similar retention-based promotions around key moments like the start of NFL season. So nothing's really changed there. And I think as we've noted in the past, as states mature, just based on the fact that a higher percentage of promotion is spent on new customers than repeat, you should expect to see natural decline. And then, of course, the mix of new versus mature or more mature, I should say, states will affect the overall. But I think that you can kind of assume it looked like -- or it will look like what it's looked like in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly : Just with your guide to contribution profit neutral, it kind of implies you're spending a lot of money on technology, G&A. How much of these investments are going to revenue channels that we would consider outside of gaming or gambling? And then is there anything you could give us what your total contribution profit was in '21?\nJason Robins : So on the first question, very little is going outside of our DFS, OSB and iGaming products. Our expectation is that the new verticals are breakeven or better. So I don't think you should expect to see any real negative impact to EBITDA from anything new that we're investing in organically at the moment. As far as how -- why, I think if you kind of take a step back and look at the competitive picture, and we've always said that we believe that product is where you win. We\u2019re in a position where our top 2 competitors have thousands of engineers, have much more mature markets in Europe that they've built up a team around for many, many years. So our strategy was to really pull forward a lot of the product and technology hiring that we needed to do. As we go forward, I think you should expect to see a meaningful slowdown in fixed costs over the next several years because, really, for us, it was about trying to pull forward and achieve a higher level of scale. Maybe a little ahead of where the revenue is, but knowing we had growth, I mean, we more than doubled year-over-year last year, we don't expect it to take more than a year or 2 to grow into that. But it's really a reflection of, if we felt like products and technology was going to be the most important thing winning long term, we had to be on a more level playing field with those we are competing with. And then what was the other question?\nJed Kelly : Contribution profit for '21.\nJason Robins : We'll have more information on that at our upcoming Investor Day. What we said so far is that we will be positive contribution profit in 2022, but we'll have more information on what 2021 looked like in our upcoming Investor Day on March 3.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli : So guys, you provided a lot of color. I was just hoping kind of to more or less understand the definition and see where kind of the contribution profit, if you could bridge the commentary around contribution profit for 2022 relative to the EBITDA guidance and just kind of address some of the major buckets there that maybe we're not appreciating entirely in that kind of definition or nomenclature that you guys use.\nJason Robins : Sure. So contribution profit is gross profit minus the external marketing, so the advertising that's oriented towards customer acquisition. And we include all of it. So it's not just the local advertising, any national advertising, DFS advertising, we're doing is all included in that number. And as we've said, we expect to be contribution profit positive in 2021 based on the states that we're in today -- 2022, excuse me, based on the states that we're in today.  I think that the logical assumption is that the remaining costs are fixed costs. And as I noted in the last question, we felt like, in order to be competitive and feel like we're actually out competing our top rivals right now. But in order to get there, we had to staff up on the product and technology side. We still have less engineers than some of our top competitors. But I think we've been able to ship product and rapidly evolve our products faster than anyone else in the market, and that's partly due to our focus on the U.S. We don't have to use some of those engineers to focus on products overseas. So I think that's been very helpful. And I think we feel like now, we're in a position where we can moderate fixed cost growth and really allow the revenue scale and the contribution profit from states to kick in and drive improvements to the bottom line, probably starting later this year and certainly into 2023.\nCarlo Santarelli : Great. That's helpful. And just longer term, the external marketing as a percentage of net revenue, you guys are still targeting like around 10%?\nJason Robins : Yes, that's about right. We'll have more information on that in our upcoming Investor Day, but that's about right.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz : If you could just spend a minute on Canada specifically because if I'm correct, that's incremental to the numbers that you've laid out today. And I'm just wondering if the calculus there in terms of that market entry is it's not a regular state. If the calculus changes there in any way, one way or the other, and how we might work that into our models here.\nJason Robins : Definitely, it's different. There's been a gray market there for many years, which a lot of the operators will be competing with have already been operating in and have already had time to build customer bases. So as noted in last year's Investor Day, we are not projecting the same level of market share in Ontario or in Canada in general that we are projecting in the U.S. just because we don't have that early-mover advantage that we have in the U.S. I think the way we'll approach it is the same way we approach everything else that we do. It's going to be analytically based. We're going to target 2- to 3-year paybacks. And I think, depending on what we see in the data, we'll adjust accordingly. But it should be a good market, it has iGaming, it has sports betting, and we already have a decently sized user base of DFS customers there. So we're pretty excited about Ontario.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.\nDaniel Politzer : I just want to follow up on Ontario. How do you think about the promotional environment there versus a big market that we're saying launch such as New York? What are -- are there any differences in terms of what you'd spend maybe there, just given the population and maybe differences in regulations?\nJason Robins : Yes. It's something I think we're still evaluating. Obviously, Ontario is a very large population. It's -- I think it would be the fifth-largest state by population if it were in the U.S. So it's a pretty meaningful population. And of course, it has iGaming. So I think that improves the overall TAM available to us. So just like we will with external marketing, we're going to do a lot of testing, and we're going to base whatever decisions we make on what the data tells us.\nDaniel Politzer : And then just a quick clarification on the fourth quarter EBITDA becoming positive. Does that assume a launch in Ontario and Maryland will be some of the other jurisdictions you haven't already launched in?\nJason Robins : No. We -- so to be clear, we've said that if we did not launch any states after the end of 2021, we would have been EBITDA positive in the end of -- in Q4 of 2022. So the intent is not to be based on -- we've launched now in New York and Louisiana. But what we've also said is that if you assume a normal legalization trend of 7% to 9% in OSB and 3% to 4% in iGaming, that we would expect to be EBITDA positive by Q4 of '23. So I think you can assume that Ontario is included in that, and it will obviously depend on any other states or jurisdictions that open up. And -- if that ends up being higher, that's a good thing because it means that the TAM is larger, but we won't get there on the EBITDA positive side because there'll be more investment. If it ends up being a slower pace of legalization, which ironically is probably not great because it means that the TAM isn't growing as quickly, we would actually expect to achieve EBITDA profitability on a faster basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoseph Greff : Question is this. Most of my questions on the business have been asked and answered. But why aren't insiders buying the stock? And will insiders buy the stock?\nJason Robins : Well, of course, we can't talk about what will happen, but we have had several insiders buy the stock. Many members of our Board...\nJoseph Greff : Outside of Directors, I'm talking about inside executives.\nJason Robins : Well, I've been exercising options, as has several other members of our executive team, which is in effect, buying stock. So I think as long as there's options to be exercised, that would probably be the first stop for most executives. But I can't speak for everyone else. Also, as you know, there's wash rules. So based on 10b5 programs that have not been active the last few months but were active within the 6-month time frame, it's not possible for executives to buy shares right now. But we can certainly exercise options and we have been.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson.\nRobert Fishman: I have a follow-up on advertising. We've seen how sports betting advertising is already 1 of the top local TV categories in the legalized markets. And now that New York is live and you continue to scale across the U.S., can you discuss your plans to ramp up on the national advertising piece? And how do you think about the balance of local versus national ad spend this year?\nJason Robins : It's a great question. We've said in the past that we expect to achieve optimal -- excuse me, more efficiency on the advertising side because, of course, advertising at the national level is much less expensive in many channels like television on a cost per impression basis than local. We have already started, starting last NFL season, shifting some of our spend into national. We crossed that threshold with the launch of New York of about 1/3. So I think you'll continue to see more. And what's nice is that those national ads that we run, with each new state that legalizes, it's not like we have to put more national advertising out there. It actually reaches that population and was always reaching that population. The difference is now, they can sign up for the app. So I think you'll continue to see some tailwinds coming from just more state legalization and a continued shift into national. Of course, with state launches, we'll always have some heavy up on the local side, and there are certain channels that will always be local, like outdoor digital. But I think the national advertising will continue to grow as a percentage of the portfolio, and that should have a tailwind effect on the overall efficiency.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Chaiken with Credit Suisse.\nBenjamin Chaiken : Kind of on the lines of Carlo's question, the implied SG&A bucket, as you're bridging from contribution profit to EBITDA, which you can infer from the '22 guide, or ballpark. Is that fixed? Or does that growth inflation? How should we think about that?\nJason Robins : Well, we've already made a number of market adjustments. Obviously, it's a tough labor market to deal with that. I don't expect that we'll have -- obviously, who knows? It's -- I don't have a crystal ball, but I don't expect, based on what we know today, that we'll will have any more impact to labor cost due to inflation. As I noted earlier, we had to really hire up quickly in order to be competitive with some of the more at-scale European competitors that had, much larger than we did 2 years ago, product and engineering teams. We feel like now we're in a position where we can be very competitive, actually outcompete on product and technology. And we feel like outside of some things like customer service, obviously grows as new states open. Outside of some of the smaller categories like that, we expect much more moderate fixed cost growth starting 2023 forward.\nBenjamin Chaiken : Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then 1 more. You may have kind of implicitly answered it, but you guided overall 4Q '23 EBITDA to be positive, but that included some incremental states even after New York. I guess just for like illustrative purposes, how should we think about that time line if things remained static?\nJason Robins : Well, you mean if no more states legalize?\nBenjamin Chaiken : Yes.\nJason Robins : Yes, I think it would be faster. So really, as we've talked about in the past, with a 2- to 3-year path to profitability in states, that first year and sometimes part at least of the second year, are meaningful investments for us as we ramp up our customer bases in those states. So were there to be more states in rapid succession, I think it would push out profitability a little. And were there to be less in the example you gave, I think it would accelerate profitability.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham and Company.\nBernard McTernan : It seems like as markets keep launching, they're further along the TAM curve, which New York is the latest example of with Ontario in the already very much established gray market. How far along this curve do you think it could launch relative to the $5 billion market opportunity that you guys called out before at the 100% -- assuming 100% regulation?\nJason Robins: Very hard to say. We don't have any experience yet in Canada. So -- but I think the -- in terms of quantifying. But I think the effect you talked about, absolutely, we believe to be the case. There's already a large built up market. To some extent, that's true in the U.S., too, where there have been a legal operators and bookmakers that are local for many, many years. And I think that what you're seeing is that, with overall increased awareness, and really, we think the overall sort of weight of advertising, even though it seems more competitive, I actually think it's helped us. I think DraftKings does a differentially better job converting new users. And I think 1 of the reasons you see such a faster pace to 100,000 users in recent states like Arizona and New York, it's because of the competitive advertising, ironically. So I think a lot of that is actually accelerating our ability to launch faster and to grow faster. And it might even lead to a faster path to profitability in states. We'll have to see.\nOperator: That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jason Robins for closing remarks.\nJason Robins: Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We are very excited about 2022, and we look forward to speaking with you at our virtual Investor Day on March 3. I hope all of you stay safe and well. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I hope you are all doing well. Before I share my thoughts on the fourth quarter, I want to thank everyone at DraftKings for their tremendous effort and contributions to our success. We had an incredible 2021, and our dedicated employees continued to deliver during an ongoing and challenging pandemic. I also want to thank our loyal customers for their continued support. At DraftKings, we are always striving to put our customers at the center of everything we do. On today's call, I will cover the following topics. First, I'll discuss our financial achievements. We outperformed our expectations for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, capping off a year in which five of our states were contribution profit positive. We're off to a tremendous start in 2022 as well. Customer acquisition in new states has been accelerating while continuing to pay back on a gross profit basis in the two- to three-year time frame. As of today, 10 states are either already contribution profit positive or on track to achieve that milestone in 2022. Overall, we expect DraftKings to be contribution profit positive for FY '22. And if we were to have frozen new state launches at the end of 2021, we expect that DraftKings would have been able to achieve EBITDA profitability as an enterprise in Q4 of this year. Second, we continue to see rapid expansion of the OSB and iGaming TAM in the U.S. This is being driven by both new jurisdictions legalizing OSB and iGaming as well as continued healthy growth in existing states. Overall, in 2021, seven states enacted legislation for mobile sports betting, and we launched in five states last year with the other two states subsequently launching in 2022. In iGaming, one state enacted legislation in which we subsequently launched. We also saw two new states open up for Daily Fantasy Sports. Third, additional product features and functionality for our mobile sports betting and iGaming apps are driving increased customer retention and monetization as well as improved margins. Many of these benefits are now possible as a result of the migration to our in-house sports betting platform, which gives us the ability to diversify our bet types, optimize our in-game betting features and expand the breadth and depth of our content offering. We also introduced our new Dynasty Rewards loyalty program and continue to expand our social functionality. And finally, adjacent verticals further increase our TAM with the added benefits of more efficient customer acquisition, higher customer LTV. Our new growth initiatives such as DraftKings Marketplace and media are seeing promising early results, and we're optimistic about the potential for future growth. DraftKings' 47% year-over-year revenue growth to $473 million in Q4 exceeded our guidance by 8%. The strong fourth quarter brought our full year revenue to nearly $1.3 billion, representing 101% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter also outperformed our expectations at minus $128 million. Fourth quarter Monthly Unique Payers increased to about $2 million, up 32% versus Q4 2020. Average revenue per Monthly Unique Payer increased 19% year-over-year to $77. I'm very pleased with the market share we achieved in Q4, which reflects the success of our technology migration and the strength of our overall business and brand. Our handle share for mobile sports betting across all active states was 32% in Q4. For iGaming, our gross revenue share was 20% in Q4, including Connecticut; and our market share in New Jersey set a record in each of October, November and December. We look forward to providing more color on a number of topics at our upcoming Investor Day, including our TAM, market share, product innovation, unit economics at both the player and state level, enterprise EBITDA and new organic growth vectors. Our key performance metrics, including user acquisition, retention and engagement continued to trend well in the fourth quarter and led to strong results across products. The fourth quarter was a record quarter for mobile sports betting handle on an absolute basis as we were live in more states compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as on a same-state basis. In states where we were live for the entirety of Q4 2021 and Q4 2020, we saw a significant increase in engagement, with handle up to 65% due to paid actives growing by 37% and handle per paid active growing by 20%. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, iGaming gross revenue grew 153% year-over-year, including all state, and 61% year-over-year on a same-state basis. Looking at New Jersey, our most mature state where we launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in 2018, our MUPs continued to grow at a healthy rate. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Combined OSB and iGaming MUPs grew 18% year-over-year. MUPs in New Jersey were 78% higher relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. We had a very strong launch for mobile sports betting and iGaming in Connecticut, a state with only three mobile sports betting operators and only two iGaming operators. For mobile sports betting in Connecticut, our handle market share was 47%. Our gross gaming revenue share was 51% and our net gaming revenue share was 57% in the fourth quarter. For iGaming in Connecticut, our gross revenue share was 58%. Our business momentum has continued into Q1. On January 8, we launched mobile sports betting in New York. It took DraftKings less than 24 hours to acquire 100,000 first-time paid betters in New York compared to 17 days for Arizona, 170 days for New Jersey, 312 days for Pennsylvania and 344 days for Indiana. In our first 30 days, we acquired over 300,000 users in New York, which was 2.3x the average of our other states in their first 30 days on a population-adjusted basis. There is no question that customers are joining our platform faster than they did in states that we launched in previous years. As a result, our CACs are fantastic, but overall spending for the first few months is higher than it was for our more mature states, such as New Jersey. When the New York market launched, there was some aggressive promotional behavior by many operators, but DraftKings is committed to maintaining its disciplined approach to customer acquisition and is targeting a two- to three-year path to profitability for the state. We believe that product will be the key differentiator between operators over time. For example, our technology provides a seamless customer experience through a single integrated sign-in in wallet across product offerings and jurisdictions. We are already seeing this play out in the Northeast, where customers who travel between New York, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are able to play on the DraftKings app without having to open a new account. On January 12, we announced that DraftKings will become the official Sportsbook provider of the Oregon lottery. Pursuant to our exclusive agreement with the Oregon Lottery, DraftKings Sportsbook replaced the scoreboard app on January 18. The DraftKings Sportsbook app offers additional betting markets and an overall superior customer experience. We look forward to serving all sports betters in Oregon. On January 28, we launched mobile sports betting for eligible customers in Louisiana's permitted parishes. With several professional franchises in addition to Division 1 collegiate athletic, there are ample hometown fan bases and opportunities in Louisiana to engage. And last Sunday, an exciting NFL playoff ended with another game that went down to the wire. It was also a great end to the season for DraftKings as on Super Bowl Sunday, our total actives across all products was nearly 1.7 million. In fact, this year's Super Bowl was our highest-ever day for actives and handle both in total and on a same-state basis. Looking ahead, we are raising our revenue guidance to incorporate the impact of New York and Louisiana as well as strong underlying performance in the states we were already live in last quarter. Jason Park will provide more detail. Turning to legalization trends. we have continued to see momentum. Following our launches in New York and Louisiana in January, DraftKings is live with online sports betting in 17 states that collectively represent approximately 36% of the U.S. population. Additionally, DraftKings is live with iGaming in 5 states, representing approximately 11% of the U.S. population. After the governor of Ohio signed into law a bill authorizing mobile and retail sports wagering, there are now 3 U.S. jurisdictions that have legalized where we are preparing to launch upon licensure and approval from regulators, Maryland, Puerto Rico and Ohio. These jurisdictions represent approximately 7% of the U.S. population and will bring the percentage of the population where DraftKings expects to offer legalized mobile sports betting to approximately 43%. So far in 2022, 10 state legislatures have introduced legislation to legalize mobile sports betting, and 8 state legislatures have introduced legislation either to expand their existing sports betting frameworks, create referendums regarding sports betting legislation or increase in-person sports betting opportunities. In addition, 3 states have introduced iGaming legislation and 3 other states have introduced online poker legislation. We also made 2 announcements that position us from mobile and retail sports betting in Kansas and the state of Washington pending changes in state law, licensure and receiving necessary approval from state regulators. I also want to comment on California and Florida. In California, we continue to work with a number of leading online sports betting operators in support of a campaign to bring regulated safe and responsible online sports betting to the state. Legal online sports betting is projected to bring hundreds of millions in tax revenue annually to the state to address 2 of the state's most pressing issues, homelessness and mental health. We are confident that the California Solutions to Homelessness and Mental Health Support Act will create a competitive market with the best products and experience for consumers. In Florida, we were fortunately not able to get the required number of signatures in time for inclusion on the ballot this November. This is due to a variety of factors, including COVID as well as the compressed time frame given when signature gathering started. We are very encouraged, however, by the over 1 million individuals who signed petitions in less than 8 months, which shows that Floridians do want the opportunity to vote on a competitive mobile sports betting market in the state. We are exploring all options to ensure that Floridians get that opportunity as soon as possible. And if we were to refile, we are very confident that, given the extended time frame, we will be able to qualify for the 2024 ballot. Ontario has announced that the province will launch the first competitive regulated and licensed online sports setting and iGaming market in Canada on April 4, 2022. We look forward to launching in Ontario and competing in that market, pending licensure and required approvals. For context, Ontario represents about 40% of Canada's population and would be the fifth-largest U.S. state by population. Moving on to product and technology. We continue to add breadth and depth to our mobile sports betting and iGaming products. As we have mentioned in the past, we believe that the long-term winners in this industry will provide the best product experience to customers. With the completion of the migration to our in-house bet engine, we are now capturing the acquisition synergies we anticipated in our mobile sports betting cost structure and have turned a variable cost into a fixed cost. For mobile sports betting, we launched parlay and same-game parlay insurance promotion capabilities in the fourth quarter. For those who are unfamiliar with this feature, parlay insurance allows betters to win something even if they lose legs within their parlay bet. This new capability has had a great response from our users, and it has supported growth in our mix in mobile sports betting handle coming from parlays. For same-game parlays, we also expanded our sport coverage beyond the NFL, college football and the NBA with the launch of College Basketball and the NHL in November. We invested in our in-play offering and in-play experience by introducing a new front-end user interface for Flash Bet that allows for a more engaging wagering experience. Flash Bet is an immersive live betting experience where users can follow what's going on in the game and get shown our flash markets, which refer to the next occurrence that will happen in the game. Markets supported by this functionality include Next Play Result, Drive Result and Drive Yardage for the NFL and next team to score and type of score for the NBA. For iGaming, we continue to benefit from cross-selling in the games we have created in-house. In the fourth quarter, 49% of mobile sports betting users in our iGaming states also engaged with our iGaming product. When looking at DraftKings' developed games, 56% of iGaming handle in the fourth quarter came from DraftKings developed teams, which is important both for differentiation and from a gross margin rate perspective. As an example, DraftKings Rocket is now launched in Connecticut and in Michigan in addition to New Jersey. This game continues to be very popular with our users. In the first 14 days following launch, 40% of Michigan's iGaming paid actives and 41% of Connecticut's iGaming paid actives played Rocket. This compares to 33% of New Jersey iGaming paid actives in the first 14 days. We look forward to updating you on the DraftKings developed means we will launch in 2022 on future earnings calls. DraftKings Social is an industry-first innovation that creates an integrated social community allowing fans to interact with each other within a peer-to-peer environment. This functionality, which we began rolling out in Q2 of 2021, is now live across our Sports Betting and Daily Fantasy sports products, and it is driving customer engagement through features such as bet-sharing. The average number of bets for users who have placed at least 1 bet through our social platform grew 67% from Q3 to Q4 which significantly outpaced quarter-over-quarter growth for users who have not placed a wager through our social platform. We will continue to add to our social functionality in 2022. For example, we're launching several additional social integration points across our Sportsbook and DFS products in the first part of the year. We're also building additional features, such as betting groups, which allow friends to bet in private groups where everyone gets to see each other's bets and chat, as well as chat features for both DFS and our live casino games. We will also be launching a feature that allows any user to go live with video and audio, which broadcast bets they make in real time to viewers. In November, we launched Dynasty Rewards, our all-new cross-product loyalty program that rewards players to their play across all DraftKings consumer products in all jurisdictions. Dynasty Rewards is the most comprehensive DraftKings loyalty program ever, featuring a wide spectrum of rewards curated for every kind of customer, from free credits to exclusive experiences. With the ability to earn on everything DraftKings and to choose how you're rewarded, we believe it will take the customers' experience to the next level, help drive retention and cement DraftKings as a top gaming and entertainment brand. We have tapped into our deep roster of lead deals and strategic partnerships to craft these once-in-a-lifetime exclusive experiences. At the launch of Dynasty Rewards, we partner with the NFL for an exclusive DraftKings Super Bowl getaway and the NHL for the Winter Classic, with many more experiences to come. Engagement with the loyalty program has been phenomenal. Approximately 95% of customers in our highest 2 tiers have actively engaged with the Dynasty Rewards program since launch. And this is just the beginning. Over the months ahead, we will continue to enhance Dynasty Rewards with more ways to earn and redeem, deeper integrations and utility within our core products, new perks with partners and retail locations and more. Draftkings Marketplace had another dynamic quarter as interest and demand continues to be strong. We sit at the intersection of Web3 and sports culture as the only company to offer digital collectibles, sports betting, daily fantasy and iGaming products. As the NFT space evolves, the broader DraftKings ecosystem will create more opportunities for our marketplace around utility gamification and custom offers that only we can provide. The fourth quarter featured drops from the Usain Bolt, Rob Gronkowski, Wayne Gretzky, Simone Biles, Tom Brady and Tony Hawk as well as SLAM Logo passes in the soft dome franchise. We also revealed plans with the NFL Players Association and One Team Partners, the group licensing partner of the NFLPA to launch gamified NFT collections that we anticipate debuting on DraftKings Marketplace during the 2022, 2023 NFL season. The agreement grants DraftKings licensing rights for active NFL players, including the authentic use of name, image and likeness. Initial anticipated features of DraftKings gamified NFL player NFTs include the ability for customers to use these collectibles within games against each other on the platform as well as separate buying and selling functionality. It is expected that there will be a variety of NFT additions in tiers that incorporate different aspects of utility and digital rarity. DraftKings previously announced a strategic agreement with Polygon to provide a scalable, eco-friendly blockchain solution that enables added throughput, lower transaction fees and expanded capabilities. We continue to add functionality and features to Marketplace. We launched auctions in conjunction with the exclusive drop of Dale Earnhardt Jr. NFT, and also offer an experiential element, with 1 auction featuring NFT coupled with the chance to do a lap with Dale at Speedway. Our media vertical is seeing good momentum with month-over-month audience growth, driven in large part through our Dan Le Batard and VSiN assets. Our goal is to continue to grow our audience and content, which is uniquely positioned across 3 dynamic industries: Sports, entertainment and technology. As part of that, we are excited to welcome Mike Golic Sr. to our roster of talent, and we have also been actively working closely with our partners at Meadowlark to greenlight several new shows that we expect will be announced in the coming months. And finally, last month, we announced the addition of 2 new senior leaders with extensive media experience to bolster our team and add velocity to our efforts. We will continue to invest in adjacent growth vectors like DraftKings Marketplace and media in 2022, with the approach that each of them will continue to drive the LTV-to-CAC flywheel that we are creating along with our existing core DFS, OSB and iGaming offerings. I'd also like to provide an update on our acquisition of Golden Nugget Online Gaming. In Q4, we made significant progress towards closing the acquisition. And upon closing, we are prepared to integrate the business and capture the synergies we outlined when we announced the transaction in August. We're excited to deploy a multi-brand strategy while accessing the millions of loyal Golden Nugget Online Gaming and Fertitta Entertainment customers. We anticipate multiple channels for cost savings by, among other things, recognizing enhanced returns on advertising spend through marketing efficiencies and eliminating platform costs by migrating to DraftKings' in-house technology. I also want to provide some recent updates on responsible gaming. I am proud that DraftKings is playing the long game and refining the customer experience through a relentless focus on responsible gaming education and by supporting research in this area. In December, DraftKings announced a multiyear financial commitment to the Kindbridge Institute for a new research program to study the nexus of veterans and responsible gaming, with the ultimate goal of advancing evidence-based research in this area and improving the lives of the veterans. And in January, we announced a multiyear financial commitment to assist the 35 state problem gaming councils across the country by providing critical funding, which will support the work of local non-profit organizations. As part of the new initiative, entitled the State Council Funding Program, DraftKings has offered each state council $15,000 per year for 3 years, a total commitment of $1.575 million over the span of the 3-year program. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings' CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our fourth quarter results and 2022 guidance. Thanks, Michael. Two questions. So the first one on New York. There's been some chatter of New York considering in this upcoming legislative session adjusting the tax rate down. I think the approach we're taking is a wait-and-see on that. And I think if that happens, depending on where it lands, then we'll adjust accordingly. And if it doesn't happen, then we'll adjust accordingly. So I think we're kind of taking a wait-and-see approach to this legislative session. And in New York, customer acquisition has been so efficient and the early player cohort results have been so strong that we're hopeful that, with an appropriate tax rate, it can be a very profitable market for us. But if not, we'll make the necessary adjustments to ensure that it meets the two- to three-year payback and that it is a very profitable market for us in the long run. As far as ARPMUP goes, few things that play there. One, we continue to see mix shift into OSB and iGaming from legacy DFS. That's been helpful. Second, we've improved our product dramatically over the last six months or so after migrating onto our own proprietary tech platform. We've seen an uptick in parlay mix. We've seen an uptick in live betting. So lots of good things there. And then lastly, I think that, really, the ability for us to cross-sell and to engage and activate customers continues to get better as our CRM programs have more and more test data, and we optimize those. Thank you. So on the first question, the new states that we've launched recently, including, of course, New York and Louisiana this year and then a few last year, we'll continue to invest in those in customer acquisition. Typically, the first year, sometimes two years, of customer acquisition are the strongest cohorts that you acquire. And I think it's really important that we continue to invest there. As noted earlier, we're keeping an eye on the New York legislative session. And I think depending on what happens there with the tax rate, we may make some adjustments. But as of now, we are basing it on what we know. And then as far as new states, as you noted, we don't really get into the habit of saying, here's what we expect to happen because we don't know when new states are going to launch. Obviously, Ontario has some clarity around it. But most other states that have legalized, namely Ohio, Puerto Rico and Maryland, have not yet set dates. So I think for now, we're going to wait and see on that. And I think there's a number of factors that could drive EBITDA better or worse than what we're guiding to right now. I think there's some upside, and there's, of course, the possibility of new states where we'd invest. So hard to say what the net impact will be, given all the moving parts. Yes, good question. So as we noted, we would expect, if we had frozen state launches at the end of last year, we'd be profitable by this year fourth quarter. And given, as you mentioned, normal 7% to 9% legalization of the population on OSB, 3% to 4% on iGaming, we'd expect to be profitable by the fourth quarter. As far as the entire year for '24, I think the expectation is we would either be profitable or close to it. Obviously, the further out we go, the more moving parts. But based on the assumptions we're making, it would be pretty much in that zone of either profitable or very close to profitable. And then as far as the question around marketing, we're not providing specific guidance around what marketing will be. But certainly, there will be a very strong impact from leverage. I think you can expect some slowdown in fixed costs as well. And obviously, the revenue growth we expect to continue to be strong. So I think that's really the primary driver there. But whether or not we make some optimizations to marketing, it will depend on how our testing goes. Thomas. First of all, very prescient report by you, almost nailing our EBITDA guidance, that was good. But I think as far as the MUPs go, we had said we had $2.1 million in September. Last quarter's average was actually lower. We haven't guided to MUPs, typically, so we didn't provide a guide. But I mean, it was pretty much on target with consensus, only like 3 or 4 analysts, I think, even predicting MUPs. And I think we were a couple of points short, but we were right where we wanted to be. But we haven't provided guidance there. And of course, it's an average of all 3 months. So as you get into certain months with different sport mixes and further into the NFL season, it can vary. But if you look at the quarter, last quarter, we actually went up in MUPs quarter-over-quarter, and we certainly went up year-over-year. And then I apologize, what was the other question? Oh, on capital and free cash flow. So we have said all along and continue to say that we expect that we have enough capital on the balance sheet to get to free cash flow positive. Nothing has changed there. Obviously, we would have to have a meaningful improvement in year-over-year losses starting in '23, which is what we expect, very similar to, I think, what you wrote in your report. But our plan, our multiyear plan that we have, does not require any additional capital raise. Well, it was way up from last year. I mean, remember, that was 1 day. If you look at the quarterly MUPs, it's going to be higher than any 1 day would be, or at least the monthly would be. Obviously, there's some seasonality in there as football ended in February. But that was 1 day that was by far the most we've ever had in 1 day, and it's not even close. We haven't disclosed specific number last year from Super Bowl, but that's something we can consider doing at our upcoming Investor Day, but I can tell you it was up extraordinarily higher year-over-year versus last Super Bowl. Our assumption is that we continue to run very similar new customer promos to what we've run in the past, and that we run similar retention-based promotions around key moments like the start of NFL season. So nothing's really changed there. And I think as we've noted in the past, as states mature, just based on the fact that a higher percentage of promotion is spent on new customers than repeat, you should expect to see natural decline. And then, of course, the mix of new versus mature or more mature, I should say, states will affect the overall. But I think that you can kind of assume it looked like -- or it will look like what it's looked like in the past. So on the first question, very little is going outside of our DFS, OSB and iGaming products. Our expectation is that the new verticals are breakeven or better. So I don't think you should expect to see any real negative impact to EBITDA from anything new that we're investing in organically at the moment. As far as how -- why, I think if you kind of take a step back and look at the competitive picture, and we've always said that we believe that product is where you win. We're in a position where our top 2 competitors have thousands of engineers, have much more mature markets in Europe that they've built up a team around for many, many years. So our strategy was to really pull forward a lot of the product and technology hiring that we needed to do. As we go forward, I think you should expect to see a meaningful slowdown in fixed costs over the next several years because, really, for us, it was about trying to pull forward and achieve a higher level of scale. Maybe a little ahead of where the revenue is, but knowing we had growth, I mean, we more than doubled year-over-year last year, we don't expect it to take more than a year or 2 to grow into that. But it's really a reflection of, if we felt like products and technology was going to be the most important thing winning long term, we had to be on a more level playing field with those we are competing with. And then what was the other question? We'll have more information on that at our upcoming Investor Day. What we said so far is that we will be positive contribution profit in 2022, but we'll have more information on what 2021 looked like in our upcoming Investor Day on March 3. Sure. So contribution profit is gross profit minus the external marketing, so the advertising that's oriented towards customer acquisition. And we include all of it. So it's not just the local advertising, any national advertising, DFS advertising, we're doing is all included in that number. And as we've said, we expect to be contribution profit positive in 2021 based on the states that we're in today -- 2022, excuse me, based on the states that we're in today.  I think that the logical assumption is that the remaining costs are fixed costs. And as I noted in the last question, we felt like, in order to be competitive and feel like we're actually out competing our top rivals right now. But in order to get there, we had to staff up on the product and technology side. We still have less engineers than some of our top competitors. But I think we've been able to ship product and rapidly evolve our products faster than anyone else in the market, and that's partly due to our focus on the U.S. We don't have to use some of those engineers to focus on products overseas. So I think that's been very helpful. And I think we feel like now, we're in a position where we can moderate fixed cost growth and really allow the revenue scale and the contribution profit from states to kick in and drive improvements to the bottom line, probably starting later this year and certainly into 2023. Yes, that's about right. We'll have more information on that in our upcoming Investor Day, but that's about right. Definitely, it's different. There's been a gray market there for many years, which a lot of the operators will be competing with have already been operating in and have already had time to build customer bases. So as noted in last year's Investor Day, we are not projecting the same level of market share in Ontario or in Canada in general that we are projecting in the U.S. just because we don't have that early-mover advantage that we have in the U.S. I think the way we'll approach it is the same way we approach everything else that we do. It's going to be analytically based. We're going to target 2- to 3-year paybacks. And I think, depending on what we see in the data, we'll adjust accordingly. But it should be a good market, it has iGaming, it has sports betting, and we already have a decently sized user base of DFS customers there. So we're pretty excited about Ontario. Yes. It's something I think we're still evaluating. Obviously, Ontario is a very large population. It's -- I think it would be the fifth-largest state by population if it were in the U.S. So it's a pretty meaningful population. And of course, it has iGaming. So I think that improves the overall TAM available to us. So just like we will with external marketing, we're going to do a lot of testing, and we're going to base whatever decisions we make on what the data tells us. No. We -- so to be clear, we've said that if we did not launch any states after the end of 2021, we would have been EBITDA positive in the end of -- in Q4 of 2022. So the intent is not to be based on -- we've launched now in New York and Louisiana. But what we've also said is that if you assume a normal legalization trend of 7% to 9% in OSB and 3% to 4% in iGaming, that we would expect to be EBITDA positive by Q4 of '23. So I think you can assume that Ontario is included in that, and it will obviously depend on any other states or jurisdictions that open up. And -- if that ends up being higher, that's a good thing because it means that the TAM is larger, but we won't get there on the EBITDA positive side because there'll be more investment. If it ends up being a slower pace of legalization, which ironically is probably not great because it means that the TAM isn't growing as quickly, we would actually expect to achieve EBITDA profitability on a faster basis. Well, of course, we can't talk about what will happen, but we have had several insiders buy the stock. Many members of our Board... Well, I've been exercising options, as has several other members of our executive team, which is in effect, buying stock. So I think as long as there's options to be exercised, that would probably be the first stop for most executives. But I can't speak for everyone else. Also, as you know, there's wash rules. So based on 10b5 programs that have not been active the last few months but were active within the 6-month time frame, it's not possible for executives to buy shares right now. But we can certainly exercise options and we have been. It's a great question. We've said in the past that we expect to achieve optimal -- excuse me, more efficiency on the advertising side because, of course, advertising at the national level is much less expensive in many channels like television on a cost per impression basis than local. We have already started, starting last NFL season, shifting some of our spend into national. We crossed that threshold with the launch of New York of about 1/3. So I think you'll continue to see more. And what's nice is that those national ads that we run, with each new state that legalizes, it's not like we have to put more national advertising out there. It actually reaches that population and was always reaching that population. The difference is now, they can sign up for the app. So I think you'll continue to see some tailwinds coming from just more state legalization and a continued shift into national. Of course, with state launches, we'll always have some heavy up on the local side, and there are certain channels that will always be local, like outdoor digital. But I think the national advertising will continue to grow as a percentage of the portfolio, and that should have a tailwind effect on the overall efficiency. Well, we've already made a number of market adjustments. Obviously, it's a tough labor market to deal with that. I don't expect that we'll have -- obviously, who knows? It's -- I don't have a crystal ball, but I don't expect, based on what we know today, that we'll will have any more impact to labor cost due to inflation. As I noted earlier, we had to really hire up quickly in order to be competitive with some of the more at-scale European competitors that had, much larger than we did 2 years ago, product and engineering teams. We feel like now we're in a position where we can be very competitive, actually outcompete on product and technology. And we feel like outside of some things like customer service, obviously grows as new states open. Outside of some of the smaller categories like that, we expect much more moderate fixed cost growth starting 2023 forward. Well, you mean if no more states legalize? Yes, I think it would be faster. So really, as we've talked about in the past, with a 2- to 3-year path to profitability in states, that first year and sometimes part at least of the second year, are meaningful investments for us as we ramp up our customer bases in those states. So were there to be more states in rapid succession, I think it would push out profitability a little. And were there to be less in the example you gave, I think it would accelerate profitability. Very hard to say. We don't have any experience yet in Canada. So -- but I think the -- in terms of quantifying. But I think the effect you talked about, absolutely, we believe to be the case. There's already a large built up market. To some extent, that's true in the U.S., too, where there have been a legal operators and bookmakers that are local for many, many years. And I think that what you're seeing is that, with overall increased awareness, and really, we think the overall sort of weight of advertising, even though it seems more competitive, I actually think it's helped us. I think DraftKings does a differentially better job converting new users. And I think 1 of the reasons you see such a faster pace to 100,000 users in recent states like Arizona and New York, it's because of the competitive advertising, ironically. So I think a lot of that is actually accelerating our ability to launch faster and to grow faster. And it might even lead to a faster path to profitability in states. We'll have to see. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We are very excited about 2022, and we look forward to speaking with you at our virtual Investor Day on March 3. I hope all of you stay safe and well. Thank you."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to announce that we generated $473 million in revenue for the quarter, an increase of 47% versus Q4 2020. Our revenue performance was significantly better than the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter, which was $437 million. Our B2C business generated $458 million for the quarter, an increase of 58% versus Q4 2020. OSB hold was not a driver of overperformance versus our guidance. Our guidance on November 4 had included $25 million of core hold in October and November and December combined were fairly typical. Given that hold was neutral relative to the guidance we shared in November, the $36 million organic outperformance versus our guidance was due to strength across customer acquisition, retention and monetization. In our B2C business, we continued to drive strong growth through player acquisition and retention, as measured through MUPs, as well as player engagement and monetization as measured through ARPMUP. B2C Monthly Unique Payers in the quarter increased 32% year-over-year to approximately 2.0 million, which brings our full year MUPs to 1.49 million, which is up 69% versus prior year. The increase reflects excellent player retention in states where we were live with our OSB and iGaming product offerings in Q4 2020 as well as the expansion of our OSB and iGaming product offerings into new states. Results reflected typical intraquarter seasonality, with October and November higher from a MUPs perspective, followed by a modest decline in December. As a reminder, a MUP is a monthly unique player, and therefore, our number of annual active players is higher based on how many months per year a MUP plays. Average Revenue per Monthly Unique Payer, or ARPMUP, was $77 in Q4, representing a 19% increase versus $65 for the same period in 2020, which brings our full year ARPMUP to $67, up 31% versus prior year. Our ARPMUP was positively impacted by a continued mix shift into our Sportsbook and iGaming product offerings and cross-selling our customers into more products. B2B generated $15 million, a decrease versus prior year due primarily to the termination of our Asian reseller agreement. We generated $251 million of gross profit dollars on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the entire business in the quarter, representing a 33% increase versus last year. Gross margin rate in the quarter on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the business was 53% versus 33% in Q3 and versus 59% last year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, you can see how the promotional intensity for new customer acquisition impacted our gross margin rate in Q3 versus Q4, where we focus more on monetization. On a year-over-year basis, more than half of the share gross margin rate was due to the reduction in B2B revenues resulting from the termination of our Asia reseller agreement. The remaining portion of the change was primarily due to investment in new states launched after Q4 2020, including Michigan, Virginia, Wyoming, Arizona and Connecticut. As Jason mentioned, the migration to our in-house bet engine has positively impacted our COGS as a percentage of revenue for OSB. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $128 million, which also exceeded our expectations due to the strong underlying performance of our business. Our sales and marketing expenses were $263 million, which include our external marketing. External marketing was higher in Q4 2021 versus the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the 5 additional states that went live in 2021, offset by declines in more mature states. The 5 new states represent 9% of the U.S. population and were in their first NFL season. We are seeing more customers engage faster in new states versus states that launched in 2018 through 2020, which improves our per player acquisition costs while -- accelerating our total marketing investment in a new state. As a reminder, we invest to acquire a player based on 2- to 3-year gross profit paybacks, which we will discuss more at our upcoming Investor Day. Our general and administrative and product and technology costs on an adjusted EBITDA basis were $74 million and $42 million, respectively, as we continued to invest to achieve scale in our back office functions such as human resources, legal, finance and accounting and customer service as well as adding to our technology team principally for new product development. A majority of the combined $23 million of year-over-year growth in these 2 expense lines was due to the compensation of new employees. Our strong Q4 revenue brought our full year to $1.296 billion of revenue, $616 million of gross profit at a 48% gross margin rate and negative $676 million of EBITDA. Taking a step back, 2021 was a fantastic year of execution and continued learning. We will discuss more in our upcoming Investor Day, but it is clear that the business model is working. We are acquiring customers efficiently with clear 2- to 3-year gross profit payback periods, and states are turning positive 2 to 3 years after launching. Therefore, we have an increasingly clear line of sight into turning EBITDA-positive. Moving on to our balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. As we look forward through our scenario-driven multiyear plan, we continue to feel that we are well capitalized for the legalization path and growth ahead of us. As a reminder, our primary use of capital is to fund state launches. And under almost all scenarios and state launch timing, we have sufficient capital to achieve positive free cash flow. Looking at 2022, on our November earnings call, we introduced annual revenue guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Given new state launches and underlying customer acquisition, retention and monetization trends, today, we are increasing our 2022 revenue guidance to a range of $1.85 billion to $2.0 billion, a 7% increase at the midpoint to $1.925 billion. Our revised guidance equates to year-over-year revenue growth of 43% to 54% and B2C growth of 57%. We expect both MUPs and ARPMUP to grow in 2022, with MUPs increasing at a rate of about 50% higher than the expected rate of increase in ARPMUP. This guidance includes New York, Oregon and Louisiana as well as the resumption of mobile registration in Illinois no later than March 5. It also includes approximately $70 million in DraftKings Marketplace revenue in 2022. It does not include additional state launches, nor the impact of the Golden Nugget acquisition, which we anticipate will close this quarter. We will update our guidance following the closing of the transaction. For B2B, we expect revenues to be about $40 million with minimal growth going forward. Regarding our 2022 quarterly revenue cadence, we expect Q1 to be between $400 million and $420 million. Please remember that although New York and Louisiana launched in Q1, new states typically start generating positive GAAP revenue after 1 to 2 months. Looking at the rest of the year, we expect Q2 to be similar to Q1, Q3 to be modestly lower than Q1 and Q4 to represent the seasonally highest quarter for revenue. You'll notice this cadence implies a higher percentage of revenue in the second half of this year compared to 2021. This is partly due to New York and Louisiana as well as DraftKings Marketplace ramping throughout the year. Additionally, revenue distribution is affected by variations in hold. For example, in 2021, Q1 and Q2 had positive variances, whereas Q3 and Q4 had negative variance. For the purposes of our guidance, we are not assuming variances in hold will reflect last year's patterns as these are primarily driven by sport outcomes. Prior to today, we have not provided guidance for adjusted EBITDA. However, over the past few years, we have gained experience in multiple states, ran many tests to understand how to optimize our business increased our clarity on organizational requirements and gain scale in marketing, which supports providing EBITDA guidance at this time. We are focused on growth and on efficiency. We feel terrific about our customer cohort gross profit paybacks as well as state profitability, and thus, our trajectory for revenue and EBITDA. Three important points on profitability. First, we expect to be contribution profit positive this year, with contribution profit defined as gross profit minus external marketing. Number two, if we had not launched any additional states after December 31, 2021, we expect that DraftKings would have been able to achieve EBITDA profitability in Q4 of 2022. And most importantly, number three, based on all the states we are currently in, and if legalization trends remain consistent with prior years, which has been around 7% to 9% OSB legalization per year and 3% to 4% iGaming legalization per year, we would expect to be EBITDA positive in Q4 of 2023. For this year, including the 5 states representing approximately 11% of the population that we have launched since September and a return to mobile registration in Illinois, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between negative $825 million to $925 million. Our business model is based on acquiring customers with 2- to 3-year gross profit paybacks, states turning positive contribution profit after 2 to 3 years and then positive contribution profit states offsetting negative contribution profit states. In 2022, the states we launched in 2018, 2019 and 2020 will generate significant positive contribution profit. This includes New Jersey, which exceeded the expectations we laid out at our last Investor Day on both the top and bottom line. The positive contribution profit from these more mature states is partially offset by the negative contribution profit from newer 2021 states as well as large negative contribution profit from New York. Our guidance for adjusted EBITDA also includes continued near-term investments in non-external marketing expenses, given the high-growth stage of our industry. We will see the benefits of the investments we are making in 2023 as our P&T, G&A and fixed marketing expenses will grow at a meaningfully lower annual rate compared to prior years. From a quarterly perspective for 2022, given our launch in New York on January 8 and in Louisiana on January 28, we expect our adjusted EBITDA loss in Q1 to be between $320 million and $340 million. We expect Q3, which is impacted by the start of the NFL season to be slightly worse than Q1, with the second quarter representing a little less than half of our expected Q1 loss. We expect our fourth quarter loss to be smallest as we benefit from higher seasonal revenue. As a reminder, as you think about the rest of 2022, please keep in mind that any states at launch have minimal to negative impact initially on the top line as we promote, and a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA and as we spend on external marketing, to drive early customer engagement at CACs that are consistent with our 2- to 3-year gross profit payback period target. Our marketing spend is also highly flexible and can be reduced or paused altogether if attractive customer acquisition opportunities are not available or the sports calendar shifts. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode after the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session to ask a question during the session [Operator Instruction]. If you require any further assistance, please. First stars euro, I will now. I will turn the call over to your host Dodge DAS Chief Legal Officer. You may begin.\nR. Stanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. The inventory during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility for updating forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties, and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. During the call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings ' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings ' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, filed today with the SEC, and in our earnings presentation, both of which are available on our website at investors. draftkings.com. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of DraftKings, who'll share some opening remarks and an update on our business. And Jason Park, Chief Financial of DraftKings will provide the review of our financials. We will then open up the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will cover the following topics. First, we're very pleased with our Q3 performance. Revenue in the third quarter grew 60% year-over-year and met our guidance due to continued excellent customer acquisition and engagement. Lower than expected sports betting hold primarily due to NFL game outcomes impacted revenue and EBITDA in the quarter. Strong customer acquisition performance and new state launches, particularly Arizona, drove additional promotional investment which also impacted third quarter revenue and EBITDA.  In addition to mobile sports betting launches in Arizona and Wyoming in Q3, we also launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in Connecticut in October. Second, looking forward. The pipeline and new states in Canadian provinces continues to be healthy. Louisiana, Maryland, New York, and Ontario have all authorized mobile sports betting and Ontario has authorized IDB. We expect these jurisdictions to launch in the coming month. Third, the migration to our in-house bet engine and proprietary sports betting technology is complete.  We are thrilled with the early performance and our new ability to rapidly add innovative features and functionality to our top ranked mobile sports betting app. I'm also very proud of the team for delivering ahead of our scheduled deadline. Fourth, our new growth initiatives which include DraftKings Marketplace in our Content and Media business are seeing promising early results.  Fifth, we are very excited about the pending acquisition of Golden Nugget Online Gaming and are working towards closing in early 2022. I will also comment on the discussions we had with Entain. And before turning it over to Jason Park, I will also provide an update on our ongoing responsible gaming and corporate and social responsibility initiatives. We delivered strong revenue growth of 60% in the third quarter of 2021, which met our guidance from our Q2 earnings call.  On a same-state basis, as well as adjusting for lower-than-expected hold primarily due to NFL game outcomes, revenue would've been $40 million higher than our guidance. I'm very pleased with our market share in Q3 as well, which reflects the success of our technology migration, the strength of our overall business. Our handle share for mobile sports betting across all active states improved from an average of 31% in July and August, 33% in September. For iGaming, our GGR share improved from an average of 15% in July and August, 17% in September. Third Quarter monthly unique payers increased 31% versus Q3 2020 to 1.3 million, which includes the record month of more than 2.1 million in September.  Average revenue per monthly unique payer increased 38% to $47. We're particularly proud of the growth in ARPMUP, given that Q3 of 2020 had a jam pack sports schedule with 2 months of basketball and hockey that did not occur in this year's Third Quarter. Fundamental user acquisition, retention, and engagement trends are all tracking better than we have projected last quarter, which sets us up well for the rest of the year in 2022. This was true across all of our products. In week 1 of the NFL season, we have more than two times the number of mobile sports betting paid actives than we have for NFL Week 1 last year.  And then the Third Quarter of 2021, [Indiscernible] paid actives on a same-state basis increased 50% compared to the third quarter of 2020. iGaming gross revenue has grown sequentially on a same-state basis in each quarter of 2021. And we expect that sequential growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter. iGaming gross revenue grew 154% year-over-year in Q3 2021, including all states and 82% on a same-state basis. In DFS, we set a single day record for paid entries on September 12th, and NFL Sundays for weeks 2 and 3 were our second, third largest days, reinforcing that are DFS product continues to grow and provide an ongoing [Indiscernible] manage at new state launch.  Looking at New Jersey, our most mature state where we launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in 2018 are must continue to grow at an impressive rate. In the third quarter of 2021, despite not having basketball and hockey, combined OSB and iGaming maps grew 23% year-over-year. Maps in New Jersey increased 124% versus the third quarter 2019. We had very successful OSB launches in Arizona and Wyoming in Q3 and launched OSB and iGaming in Connecticut in early Q4. Our launch in Arizona went extremely well and exceeded our internal underwriting case.  Our data-driven and highly disciplined marketing approach resulted in much higher-than-expected new user acquisition in September, which has given us the confidence to continue to invest in acquiring new customers. The result is that we are set up very well to be a leader in the state. We are also very excited about Wyoming, which is a smaller state but offers a meaningful opportunity with visitors to the state. With the ramp up of Arizona in perspective, it took DraftKings just 17 days to acquire a 100 thousand first-time paid betters compared to 170 days for New Jersey, 312 days for Pennsylvania, and 344 days for Indiana.  This is despite the fact that DraftKings did not have the DFS in Arizona until August 28th, only 12 days before we launch mobile sports betting. In New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, DFS was operational for more than 6 years prior to launching mobile sports betting in those states, which makes our customer acquisition success in Arizona even more impressive. Our business momentum has continued into Q4. For DFS, October 3rd, which is the NFL Sunday featuring the Tampa Bay versus New England game was the highest gross revenue day in our history. For OSB in New Jersey, the October 5th wildcard playoff game between the Yankees and the Red Sox is the highest MLB handle game in our history, beating the previous all-time high by 12%.  For iGaming, October was our strongest EGR month of the year by more than 10%, even when excluding the launch of iGaming in Connecticut. We announced on October 13th that as the exclusive odds supplier, DraftKings will provide sports betting information and Daily Fantasy content across Turner Sports telecasts and Bleacher Report digital channels including the BR app. related to Turner's NHL content. On October 18, we continue to lay the groundwork for our vision of DraftKings marketplace by announcing a blockchain collaboration with Polygon, which provides us a scalable, eco -friendly blockchain solution that enables added throughput and expanded capabilities.  Also, DraftKings now is the option that potential contribute to polygon governance and help secure the network is a validated note. On October 19th, we launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in Connecticut. In Connecticut, DraftKings is one of only 3 sports book operators and 2 iGaming operators authorized in the state. And on November 4th, we announced an expanded multi-year relationship with the NBA to make DraftKings the co-official sports betting partner of the league. This agreement grants DraftKings ' expansive NBA rights and assets to integrate within a sports betting, [Indiscernible], iGaming and free-to-play products in promotional offerings.  As has been widely publicized, NFL game outcomes have been favorable to players this year for a number of reasons. Primetime NFL games played on Thursday, Sunday, and Monday nights typically have higher viewership and therefore high handle. Through week 7, 71% of NFL primetime favorites and 57% of NFL [Indiscernible] have won in 2021. They'll also have not been as many big upsets across all NFL games. Before we gate, there is not a single upset by underdogs at least 7.5. points. Additionally, we have had four NFL weeks for more than 66% of the favorites won. a very popular parlayed bet is the pair a large favor on the money line with other bets.  Therefore, in March favorites win consistently, parlays hit more frequently. Of course, game outcomes can also swing the other way. The last week of October had very favorable results for the house. Between last Thursday and this Monday alone DraftKings generated a positive variance of more than $25 million of revenue compared to our forecast due to favorable event outcomes. While we had a great finish to the month, we still ended October close to $25 million below our forecast due to lower-than-expected [Indiscernible] resulting from player-friendly event outcomes.  Despite these outcomes and due to the continued momentum of our business. We are increasing the midpoint of our 2021 revenue guidance, which Jason Park will cover in more detail later on the call. Turning to legalization trends, we have continued to see momentum in mobile sports betting and iGaming. In 2021, 25 state legislators have introduced legislation to legalize mobile sports betting, 5 state legislators have introduced legislation to expand their existing sports betting frameworks, and 2 state legislators have introduced legislation to legalize sports studying, limited to retail locations. In addition, 4 states have introduced iGaming legislation, and 3 states have introduced online poker legislation.  In total, nearly 13% of the U.S. population [Indiscernible] laws passed in their state legalizing competitive online sports betting markets in 2021, demonstrating continued momentum three years after the overturn of PASPA. Following our launches in Wyoming, Arizona and Connecticut, DraftKings is live with online sports betting in 15 states that collectively represent 29% of the U.S. population. Additionally, DraftKings is now live with 5 iGaming states, representing approximately 11% of the U.S. population. States we're drafting has the potential opportunity to participate via market access agreement or direct license. New York, Maryland, and Louisiana authorized mobile sports betting this year. These 3 states represent 9% of the U.S. population and bring the percentage of the population with legalized mobile sports betting to 39%.  We are actively preparing to be able to launch in these jurisdictions pending the necessary licensing and regulatory approvals to do so. I also want to comment on California and Florida. In California, we are working with a number of leading online sports betting operators in support of a campaign to bring a well-regulated, safe, and responsible online sports betting market to the state. Legal online sports betting will bring hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue annually to the state. Directly [Indiscernible] two of its biggest challenges, homelessness and mental health, by providing permanent shelter and housing, as well as addiction services for those in need.  The California Solutions to Homelessness and Mental Health Support Act ensures a comprehensive licensing process. One that requires extensive vetting of experienced operators and create the competitive marketplace this competition for market share will ensure the best products and experience for consumers. In Florida, we continue to work with FanDuel and the Florida Education Champions, that collected signatures required to have a mobile sports betting question on the ballot in November 2022. We are excited for the potential prospect of Florida voters, deciding to have a safe, legal, regulated, and competitive market for online sports betting in this state, with a market leading in technologically advanced product offerings.  If enacted, all tax revenues from mobile sports betting conducted pursuant to this referendum will be dedicated to the funding of state public education system. Turning to Canada, Ontario continues to establish parameters for the launch of the online gaming market in the province. We look forward to further progress in Ontario and Canada as a whole. For context, Ontario represents about 40% of the candidate population and would be the fifth largest U.S. state by population were in America. Moving onto product and technology, I am very proud of all that our team accomplished in the Third Quarter. For mobile sports betting, we completed the full online and retail migration to our own in-house bet engine in the third quarter and migration went very smoothly and was completed ahead of schedule.  This was the largest technology project we have ever undertaken. It consumed resources that are now free to focus more on innovation and we're already experiencing benefits from the transition to our own technology. To provide context for our recent product improvement. Over the first 3 weeks the NFL season, new users bet nearly 20% more on average than new users did during the same period in 2020. And their mix of handle on any type of parlay as opposed to single event that increased to 23% from 15%. We, now, price approximately 80% of our combined pre -match and live back-handled in-house, and into increase that percentage over time.  In August, we announced the launch of micro-betting across the DraftKings Sportsbook. Integrating micro-betting technology allows our customers to engage even further with the sports they loved by betting, play-by-play throughout a sporting event. We're particularly proud of the depth of the futures markets and player props that we now offer. For example, in NBA, we're now offering micro-bets on approximately 40 different players covering statistics such as points assisted and rebounds for each. For iGaming, we continue to benefit from the games we have developed internally.  79% of our iGaming users that played in the third quarter, at some point, played a DraftKings - developed game. We also added DraftKings Rocket to our mobile iGaming suite, New Jersey on September 1st. Built entirely in-house, DraftKings Rocket is the latest game that our team has developed and follow the addition of both Danish 21 and DK Craps earlier this year. In New Jersey, rocket set a new launch month record for most gross revenue by a DraftKings developing, improving on the debut of DraftKings crap Jack in New Jersey by 46%. DraftKings is the only provider of rocket in U.S. and developing this game is further evidence of us bringing ongoing innovation to our consumers. Following our April acquisition of blue-ribbon software, jackpots are now live in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Michigan. We are continuing to add to this functionality, including launching a feature that allows multiple games to be attached to a Jackpot. In the third quarter, research firm Eilers & Krejcik tested 34 sports betting app and ranked each on user experience, betting interface, features, core and aesthetics. As part of this survey, Eilers & Krejcik evaluated the new DraftKings app, post-migration, based on our own in-house technology.  I am pleased to say that we ranked number 1 overall, and we were also ranked in the top 3 across four of the five criteria, including user experience, betting interface, features and aesthetics. We're continuing to make significant progress with several exciting new organic growth factors. The launch of DraftKings Marketplace has been amazing. I'm proud of the highly acceptable and easy-to-use experience that we've built, Which combined with compelling content, has driven positive user engagement.  Marketplace is a large opportunity given our ability to cross-sell existing customers and acquire new ones by offering a new way for fans to interact with their favorite athletes in sports moments. The 70 [Indiscernible] on DraftKings marketplace, provided by our partner Autograph, were oversubscribed 14:1 on average. And the secondary transactions, market has seen strong engagement by users seeking to collect their favorite NFTs. In the third quarter, more than 1/3 of marketplace users were new to DraftKings.  These users completed over a 120,000 primary and secondary transactions, totaling approximately $20 million gross merchandise volume. Since the initial [Indiscernible], which featured Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Tony Hawk, Derek Jeter, Naomi Osaka, and Tiger Woods, we have added drafts by Usain Bolt and Rob Gronkowski. Recently, Autograph teamed up with Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures to release on DraftKings marketplace exclusive digital collectibles from SAW, one of the most successful horror franchises in history.  Our media business continues to grow as sports betting content is in demand, and we recognize the importance of reaching a wider audience through our own channels. Since we acquired VSiN. It has expanded at talent lineup and broadcasting footprint. In September, we scaled up production to offer a full 24, 7 lineup. We also amended our first nationwide content distribution deal with YouTube TV that delivered recent bleeding sports betting, news and insight that subscribers as part of YouTube, TV, sports Plus add-on package and introduced millions of subscribers to be premium content.  Recent podcasts and iHeart Radio are also experiencing incredible success as we surpassed 4 million downloads in the month of September. We will continue to invest in these exciting and differentiating growth factors into 2022. With the approach to each of them will continue to drive the LTV to cap flywheel that we're creating along with our existing DFS, OSB and [Indiscernible] offerings. I'd also like to provide an update on our acquisition of Golden Nugget online gaming. In Q3, we made significant progress towards closing the acquisition of Golden Nugget online gaming and have strong plans in place to integrate the business and captured synergies we outlined in the presentation materials from August.  For more information on the strategic rationale for this deal, please refer to the materials on our Investor Relations website and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I also want to make a few comments on the discussions we recently concluded with entertain. We are continuously looking at multiple organic and inorganic growth opportunities that are accretive to our shareholders, most of which never come the fruition, but offer great learning opportunities for me in the team. This situation was unique because there was a leak. Pursuant to the UK Takeover Code, it had to be disclosed that we are in discussion, even though the discussions were very early. We had the chance to meet with the leadership of [Indiscernible], in order to explore the merits of the combination. [Indiscernible] has a very impressive team, and we have a great deal of respect for the business [Indiscernible].  However, after carefully assessing our potential transaction and weighing various considerations including our own organic growth plans as well as other deal flow, we decided not to make an offer. We continue to be very excited about the vision we have for growing DraftKings. We have the industry-leading brand, a vertically integrated technology stack, top ranked apps across our verticals, a robust and innovative product road map, and the best team in the world. We're very well-positioned to maintain and grow our leadership position in North America and beyond.  We recognize that we're very fortunate and have worked very hard to get to where we are. A Company with a strong balance sheet and a clear path for many years of very high growth in a market with tens of billions of dollars of still unrealized [Indiscernible]. The bar for changing that trajectory is incredibly high, and it would take a lot for us to decide to pursue any large asset with the slower growth profile. At the same time, we felt obligated to look at this deal, but just because we look at something doesn't mean we will decide to do it.  Turning to corporate social responsibility, DraftKings serve to the catalyst that facilitate meaningful relationships between our employees and customers and the communities and causes they feel passionate about in order to create a better world for everyone. Keeping with our focus on responsibility, we integrated the American Gaming Associations have a game plan that responsibly Public Service campaigns. Across our retail sports book and into our team partners stadium.  Along with our own responsible gaming tag, it's more fun when for fun. Last month, our partners at the NFL announced the new responsible gaming initiative in collaboration with the National Accounts on problem gambling. We commend the NFL 's commitment to this important work and look forward to our future collaboration to advance safe play. We quickly mobilized our customers to raise funds for feeding Louisiana in the aftermath of hurricane [Indiscernible]. We raised funds for the Larry Fitzgerald foundations to support a breast cancer research, and we supported three mission-driven organizations for Hispanic Heritage Month with total donations of $625,000 to further our commitment to equity and entrepreneurship.  This week, we also announced the relationship with the Pat Tillman Foundation, which honors NFL great-turned - military hero, Pat Tillman.

We are proud to support the foundation's work, and all military personnel, veterans, and their family. I will now turn the call over to drafting CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our third quarter results and revised 2021 guidance.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason, and good morning everyone. We're pleased to announce that we generated $213 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a 60% increase versus Q3 2020 revenue of $133 million. Our [Indiscernible] business generated $189 million for the quarter, representing an 82% increase versus prior year. Offset by B2B, which declined 19% versus prior year to $24 million. A year-over-year decline in B2B reflects the impact of the termination of our Asia Reseller Agreement, which we ended on April 1, 2021 with a transition period that has already ended.  In terms of the B2C business, we continue to drive strong growth in player acquisition and retention as measured through [Indiscernible] as well it's player engagement and monetization as measured through [Indiscernible], BDC monthly unique payers in the quarter increased 31% year-over-year to 1.3 million. The increase reflects the expansion of our OSB and iGaming product offerings into new states and superb retention of existing players. Results reflect typical intra -quarter seasonality with July and August lower from a month's perspective, while in September, we had a record 2.1 million MUPs due to the start of the NFL season.  Average revenue per monthly unique payer or ARPMUP, was $47 in Q3, representing a 38% increase versus the same period in 2020. Our ARPMUP was positively impacted by strong customer engagement, our continued mix shift into our sportsbook and iGaming product offerings and cross-selling our customers into more products. We guided to $213 million at the midpoint and delivered $213 million. Revenue would have been $40 million higher were it not for lower than forecast [Indiscernible] rates and investment in new state launches. Lower than forecasted [Indiscernible] cost us roughly $25 million of revenue in the third quarter.  While hold was higher than Q3 prior year, it was lower than we expected, with NFL outcomes being the largest contributor. For context, in September, 67% of prime-time favorites went outright and 89% of prime time over is hit. As we've mentioned in the past, Q3 is uniquely [Indiscernible] of hold variances because of the concentration of just 3 weeks of NFL games in the quarter. So, sport outcomes can impact Q3 results meaningfully. In addition to hold, we launched two new states in Q3, which were not included in our prior guidance.  These new states resulted in negative 15 million of net revenue due to new customer promotional investment driven by much better-than-expected customer acquisition. In Arizona for example, over the first 30 days, we acquired 8 times the number of customers that we acquired in New Jersey on a population adjusted basis. Customer response has exceeded our own expectations, which we attribute to broader awareness in sports betting and the continuous improvement of our state launches playbook.  The net revenue investment was due to promotional contra revenue in the final weeks of the Q3 period, which has already begun to pay back in Q4. Please note we are breaking out the impact of lower than forecast hold in new state launches because these factors were material to third-quarter results relative to our guidance. We generated $71 million of gross profit dollars on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the entire business in the quarter, representing a 17% increase versus last year. Gross margin rate on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the business was 33% in the quarter versus 46% last year.  Very importantly, on a year-over-year basis, our gross margin rate was impacted heavily by the forementioned investment of net revenue in new states launched in Q3, as well as 3 additional states, Tennessee, Michigan, and Virginia that launched after Q3 of 2020. These new states together accounted for more than 3 quarters of the year-over-year decrease in gross margin rate. Outside of this, we saw improvement in our COGS structure across our product offerings offset by the ongoing mix shift out of our more mature and not higher-margin DFS product offering and into OSB and iGaming.  And as a reminder, our costs as a percentage of revenue for OSB will improve starting in Q4 due to the migration to our in-house bet engine. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative 314 million. Which includes approximately 60 million of impact from lower than forecasted hold percentage and the investment we made in new seats. Excluding the 60 million impact of these items, adjusted EBITDA would have been significantly better than the same-state basis expectations we provided on our Q2 earnings call. As a reminder, investment in new state launches includes promotional expense, cost of revenue, and external marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses were $289 million, which include our extra marketing sector and marketing was higher than the third quarter of 2020 as we were live in 14 total stage versus 9 last year.  The five new states represent 10% of the U.S. population and are in there first full NFL season. We continue to see very attractive [Indiscernible] opportunities that support this investment in marketing. Our general and administrative, and product and technology costs on an adjusted EBITDA basis were $58 million and $38 million, respectively. As we continue to invest to achieve scale in our back-office functions, such as customer service, finance and accounting, legal and human resources, as well as adding to our technology team, principally for new product development.  A majority of the combined $29 million of year-over-year growth in these 2 expense lines was from compensation for new employees. Much of the head count growth was in our customer experience department where we are focused on providing best in the industry customer experience, and it's impacted by a rapid growth in months. In the quarter, we expensed 233 million in items that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA, but are included in GAAP operating income, including $176 million for stock-based comp and $57 million for amortization of acquired intangible, depreciation and other amortization and other non-recurring expenses.  Moving onto our Balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash on our Balance Sheet. We are well capitalized to execute our multiyear plan and address our key priorities of customer acquisition. Entering new states as they legalize continuing to lead the market on product innovation and pursuing accretive M&A. Looking at the rest of 2021 on our August earnings call, we increased the midpoint of our revenue guidance from 1.1 billion to 1.25 billion. Today, we are increasing the midpoint to $1.26 billion and narrowing the range to $1.24 billion to $1.28 billion.  We are increasing our guidance because of broad strength and fundamental customer acquisition, engagement and monetization trends, as well as modest contribution from our 3 newest states. These factors are offset by close to $25 million in lower than forecast hold in October, which we assume we do not make up for during the rest of the quarter. October has been an exciting month to say the least, with two very challenging hold weekends, only partially offset by last weekend, which was very positive. Thank you, Justin Sims\nJustin Sims: Our revised guidance equates to year-over-year revenue growth of 93 to 99%. We expect both [Indiscernible] and ARPMUP up to grow in 2020. One with [Indiscernible] increasing at more than twice the rate ARPMUP. This guidance assumes no new states. We expect Q4 EBITDA loss to be a little less than half of our Q3 2021 loss. This is a wider loss in what we communicated in August, primarily because our August guidance did not include new states. We are acquiring customers faster than we expected in our new states that still attractive [Indiscernible] consistent with our 2 to 3-year payback periods. And on that note, I want to affirm our conviction in our state level path to profitability.  As a reminder, we have discussed a two to three-year time frame for new states to become profitable and at our Investor Day earlier this year, we confirmed that New Jersey had already reached this threshold on the earlier side of that 2-to-3-year window. I look forward to providing an update on New Jersey as well as more detail on path to profitability in additional states early next year once we have full 2021 results. As we look beyond 2021, we have completed our multiyear an annual planning processes, and have high confidence that our 2022 revenue will be in the range of $1.7 to $1.9 billion.  We are only including states in which we are currently live and we are utilizing empirical data on cohort performance along with new product functionality and its expected impact. We are also including expected growth from our media and content business, as well as DraftKings Marketplace. We are not including the impact of the Golden Nugget acquisition, which we anticipate will close in Q1 of 2022. We are very excited about our growth prospects underpinned by an exciting team, sustainable differentiation due to our brand and product and technology capabilities which drive very attractive unit economics and LTV to CAC ratios. That concludes our remarks and we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question or comment at this time, [Operator Instructions]. And we also ask that you limit yourself to one question. Our first question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company.\nBernie Mcternan : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Here are the questions. I was just wondering on the Entain offer, is there a reason why it would be advantageous to go global now? I know it's, obviously, still pretty early days in the U.S. opportunity. And then within that, how unique is Entain as a potential global asset as you evaluate other M&A framework?\nJason Robins : Thank you, Bernie. So, we've laid out a few areas that we would potentially look to in terms of M&A. One is global expansion. Also, product expansion and also things that we think would help us further improve our position in the U.S. market. So, all of those are areas we look at. I think as opportunities come along, it's hard to sort of say, hey, I'm going to do this 1 first, this 1 second, and it's 1 third, it's like here at the list and we'll look at being. As they come along. I think that we were certainly very impressed at the entertain team and Company they've built.  I think they're a great asset. There are other international assets that I think are of interest as well. But Entain is a great Company. So, in this case, we just decided it wasn't the right thing for us at this time to pursue them and I think we'll continue to look at things out there. Most of the things we look at, we don't end up pursuing. And this was a unique one, because due to the UK Takeover Code, a very early discussion had to get publicized when normally we would just never have the [Indiscernible].\nBernie Mcternan : Understood. Thanks for taking the question.\nJason Robins : You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly : Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the guidance for next year, I think you've mentioned product, some of the products. So how much of that factors in sort of migrating SP Tech in closing the yield gap. And then, Jason, just a longer-term one on media. A lot of it seems commoditized between all the different providers. You see it all on Twitter every Sunday. How do you think about differentiating your media strategy? Is it going to be getting Tier-1 sports content on your platform? Thanks.\nJason Robins : So, on the first topic, I think we have really exciting plans and a great product roadmap for next year. I think we recently launched same Game Parlays, pushing that and continuing to make that a best-in-class offering and driving additional user adoption, I think will be very helpful. We already saw overall parlays move from I think 15% to 23% in just a couple of months. So, I think with a full year next year under our belt, we think we can really move that percentage up and get a lot more adoption of same game parlay in general.  And we have a number of other features including our social features and other things that we think are going to have really exciting developments next year. So, we do expect that to contribute. What we would say about that hold question is -- we're not always really -- we don't really look to optimize the rate of hold. We look to optimize gross profit. In some cases, that might mean that you actually drive more volume through having promotions and other things that can drive down hold percentage, but end up being gross profit positive.  And then of course we look to maximize long-term LTV of our customers. So that's really our primary focus, but I do think some of the things, such as the continued adoption of same game parlays, will help drive that rate of holdup as well. On the media question, I agree that there is a lot of commoditized media and content out there. We will have more to say, I don't want to tip our hand, but I actually I'm very excited about the strategy that our new Chief Media Officer, Brian, has put together.  And I think it's going to allow us to pursue this in a unique and differentiated way. So, beyond that, I think there's also this really strong synergies with the things that we have planned along with the core areas of our business now and the DFF OSB, and iGaming side. So more and more to say on that in the coming quarters.\nJed Kelly : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff : Thanks for taking my question. Jason, thanks for providing 2002 revenue guidance. I was hoping you could speak a little bit maybe directionally on cost of revenue and sales and marketing in 2022 relative to what you've, what you'd anticipated in Incorporated for 2021.\nJason Robins : I think the big wildcard with 2022 is, of course, what new state launches look like. We didn't include that in our revenue guidance, but by the time we actually end up publishing results, I'm expecting there will be additional states in there, and that's going to move the needle quite a bit on our external marketing investment. Beyond that, I think right now we really like the flexibility of being able to spend deeper when the results are there. We had tremendous CAC in Arizona. I mean, that just absolutely blew away our expectations at the volume. We were able to acquire and keeping that CAC as low as we did. So, I think we like the flexibility of being able to spend deeper, and not having an external commitment to what sales and marketing would look like.\nJoe Greff : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley, with Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley : Hey, good morning everyone. Just wanted to ask a little bit more, maybe on the CAC environment, Jason. There has been some discussion out there that maybe the marketing and promotional environment is actually slower a little bit. Just given some really aggressive tactics very early on in the NFL launch. Is that consistent with behavior you've seen, and how do you think that trends as we move across the [Indiscernible] in particular?\nJason Robins : It's hard for me to say what others are doing. We certainly monitor the marketplace, but it's not totally precise. That said, I do think you're right that there has been a little bit of a pull back. From our perspective, we just follow the data, so we're going to spend when the results are coming in and we're going to pull back if they're not and we're seeing still really, really strong CACs and really, really good volume coming. Not just in new states, but in some of our more tenured states as well, so that's really our approach.  Obviously, the overall media environment has an effect on that, but it cuts both ways. Yes, there's competition for customers, but also more overall spend from the entire industry drives more people into the market, which I think benefits those, that which we feel we do have the best-in-class products and experiences. So, I think that's actually an interesting way to look at it.  That, yes, of course, there's more competition for customers, but it's also growing the market faster. And Arizona is a great example of that where we just -- were way, way ahead of the pace that we've seen in other states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, despite the fact that we didn't really have a DFS database there like we did in those other states.\nShaun Kelley : Thank you very much.\nJason Robins : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen : Thanks, I'm trying to Q&A here first off, their news reports this week about you likely getting a license in New York. Can you just talk about how you're going to approach that market? And if you think there can be long term profitability, there was such high-tech tax rates and secondly, just on the try or tried to guide how much of your thinking about -- how much are you embedding NFT's in that guidance. Thanks.\nJason Robins : Thanks, Thomas. So, I think we obviously want to wait and see what the regulator and what the state of New York says about whether we're able to achieve getting that license. Certainly, we would love that, and hopefully, those rumors are true. But we'll find out when we find out and we'll be respectful of that process. That said, if we were to be awarded a license, I think we feel just like we In other states, that we can achieve the same long-term profit margins in New York.  There's a lot of levers we can pull, such as cutting back on rate of promotion and spending less on external marketing. Those are things I would expect everyone in the industry would do because I don't think anyone is going to want to run at a long-term unprofitable rate in any state. Certainly, early on, we will approach it just like we do other states where we'll invest into it and look for that 2-to-3-year path to profitability.  But I think over the long term, we feel we can achieve something in the similar range, in a similar range to what we're achieving in other states from a long-term margin perspective. And then on the second question. It's not insignificant, but it's not super meaningful either. We have less than a $100 million in the plan for that, for the [Indiscernible]. So, we're pretty excited about it. We think it's going to be a growth product, but we're also taking a measured approach and not putting too much in there, and really relying on the strength of the core business to carry a next year in our guidance.\nThomas Allen : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord.\nMichael Graham : Thank you. A quick one, just can you remind us on the magnitude of the gross margin benefit you're expecting to see from the in-house technology switch. And then more broadly, wondering if you can comment, like going back and looking at a more mature state like in New Jersey. What are you seeing in terms of player behavior where you're not as focused on gaining new players in terms of like what is driving loyalty or what is driving switching? Just any learnings you have there in some of those more mature states that you can apply to the newer states.\nJason Robins : I'll answer your second first and then I'm going to turn it to Jason Park to answer the first one. So, New Jersey and it's almost funny to call it a more mature state. It's still only a little over 3 years in, and we're still seeing really strong user growth there, that is in part driven by strong royalty. We're seeing great retention numbers, but we're also still acquiring customers as well. So really excited about New Jersey, really excited about our more tenured states.  I think that what we're proving out is that two to three-year payback on the customer and two to three-year path to profitability in a state, really will hold. And we're going to talk more about that once we have full-year results in Q1 time frame. And I think similar to all of how we approach everything, we're just going to follow the data as long as customer acquisition is continuing to work, we're going to invest there. Certainly, we expect some of the earlier cohorts to have stronger LTV.  So, we're keeping a close eye on that, but New Jersey still only 3 years in, and I think if obviously a little bit of a different ramp, but if you look at the iGaming market, which is I think in its seventh or eighth year at this point, it's still growing. The 30-plus percent we're growing more than that. So, I think New Jersey, you're going to see grow for many years to come. And then Jason, do you want to take?\nJason Park : Yes, sure. Hey, good morning, Mike. The gross margin rate impact from being vertically integrated that's commenced in Q4. As a reminder, some roughly high single-digits of revenue for the OSB product offering only. So please don't apply that to the entire business. For the OSB product offering, that essentially goes away in Q4.\nMichael Graham : Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling : Hi, thanks. You made a comment that nobody wants to run an unprofitable business and it seems like some peers, from piecing together public disclosures, maybe running sports betting at near, I would say, even close to 0 revenue. Let alone profit to feed in the iGaming. Are you seeing any of this dynamic playing out and how do you think about your strategy in that context? Thanks.\nJason Robins : I think it is still very early in the market, and I am not so sure that that's going to continue long term. As far as how it inter plays between products, we're always looking at total value. So right now, that doesn't seem like an approach that we think based on what we see makes sense, but could it ever be something that us or others think makes sense, perhaps?  But I don't see that as a likely outcome. I think that sports betting on its own is going to be a very profitable business for us. We're already seeing that New Jersey as an example. So, I expect that to be the case across states. Also, most states don't have iGaming at this point. There's about 39% of the population with legalized sports betting and only I think 11%, I want to say with iGaming. We really have to feel like we can run the sports betting vertical at a profit even just to make it work from that perspective.\nStephen Grambling : Great. Thanks so much.\nJason Robins : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Stauff is Susquehanna.\nJoseph Stauff : Good morning. Just a question on user growth, you know, $2.1 million MUPs in September. With the NBA launching in October, I would imagine that number, directionally, is going to go up. What's the right way to think about how that is going to say evolve, both going into November, as well as December. And then New Jersey, MUP growth of 23% in third quarter, which she said, Jason, is interesting. And I'm curious to see, is it fair to assume most of that MUP growth is really sourcing from the sports side of the product offering? Thank you.\nJason Robins : Sorry. Can you say the second question one more time and I'll answer it.\nJoseph Stauff : Sure. In New Jersey, your MUP growth up 23% in the third quarter. Are most of those new users really coming from the sports side of your product offering?\nJason Robins : So, on your first question, overall MUP, we think Q4 will be in a similar range to what September was. Yes, you're right. NBA is starting, but also as the NFL season continues, there's less activity. And right now, I think that we're still seeing really strong month-over-month going into both October and early November. But historically, we've seen that turned down a bit and then it tends to pick back up again once the playoffs are going into the Super Bowl. In terms of New Jersey, it's really a combination of customer acquisition and also really strong retention that's driving that.  And our sports offering is certainly a big driver of what gets people there. Once we have them on the platform, they're playing across products, so it's really hard to say, is sports driving more active, or is it iGaming? But our goal, of course, is to get as much crossover as possible. And we've been able to cross-sell over 50% of our online sportsbook customers into iGaming. So, I think typically sports is where we acquire the players, but in a state that's a few years in like New Jersey where there's so much being driven off of existing cohorts. It's really hard to say.\nJoseph Stauff : Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli : Hey guys, thanks. Jason, if you could, when you guys think about how kind of the whole percentage and directionally, when you think about the whole percentage, we all look at obviously state data and there's a lot that's in there that we don't necessarily have full transparency up. But when you look at like average blends at holds that get reported at the percent. How would you say that number compares to what the reality is when you take out the promo aspect of what drags those holds lower?\nJason Park : Hey, Carlo. This is Jason Park. I'll try to tackle that one. I totally agree with you. The state tax report, I think it's really important to remind everyone those are regulatory and tax reports and trying to bridge those to GAAP can be difficult, not to mention that every state has a slightly different definition of hold and handle. I think that's a the most important thing it is difficult. We -- having said that, we do see those and we notice I think what you're noticing which is DraftKings is sort of at parity with the broad swath of the industry.  There is a couple of outliers. I think the right way to think about it is, what would drive those state tax report hold numbers -- hold percentages higher for certain competitors? And it really just comes down to a couple of different vectors. I think product mix is a big one and certain operators just likely have a higher parlay mix as a percentage of their total handle. Which would drive hold percentage up and as you know, we've launched in Game Parlay, and we're really excited about the traction there.  So, I think that will change over time. And then another potential reason is just promotional mix, which really does get obfuscated in the state tax reports. And to the extent that an Operator uses more free bets that can really sort of make the state tax reports look like they have a higher hold percentage. Those free bets come through at a very high hold percentage.\nJason Robins : Yeah. And then just to add to that last point. The free bet doesn't pay out the stake. So, it inflates the hold rate versus Todd's boosts or other sorts of things that are directly affecting the odds that takes it down. the promotional impact from a GAAP perspective might be similar, but the state hold rate looks higher and the tax basis it looks higher and that's one of the factors we consider when deciding what types of promotion is to run. Obviously, we want to do what's best for the customer, but we're also looking at how we optimize for taxes.\nCarlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you, guys.\nJason Robins : Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ben Adam with Loop Capital Markets.\nDaniel Adam : Hi! Good morning, guys. Regarding the $25 million hold impacts of revenues in the quarter, what was the EBITDA impact from holding in Q3? And then, separately, yesterday, Penn called out a $12.5 million lobbying expense in California; just wondering if -- were you guys part of that lobbying consortium as well? And if so, did that flow through the P&L in Q3?\nJason Robins : That the flow-through on the Q3, 25 million in this would apply to Q4, as well as very high flow-through. There are it is not a 100% flow-through because there are certain elements of COGS that you still have to pay regardless of what the GGR\nJason Park : And so on. The second question, we are part of the consortium in California, there's 7 operators that have contributed to it, and we've raised about a $100 million so far. I think we're really well positioned there. As far as how it impacted the P&L, I think it does get included in its adjusted out. It is not part of our adjusted EBITDA.\nDaniel Adam : Okay. Great. Thanks, [Indiscernible].\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to understand some of the puts and takes for the change in your full-year guidance. You mentioned that marketplace will contribute about $100 million to next year. So, thinking that maybe 25 million to the 21 change in guidance and you highlighted the whole issues in Q3 and Q4. How much for New States because your previous guidance didn't include New States that have since come online so, just how much of that piece. Thanks.\nJason Robins : Marketplace, I know I said less than 100 in the '70s and we launched it in August of this year. I think that this year it's going to be closer to 10, 15 versus 25, but we don't really know yet. It's still sort of a very new product, so we've actually been, I think, quite conservative with how we've looked at that in the guidance. As far as the new state impact to next year, we have not included in the New States. Matt, next year, sorry or this year?\nRobin Farley : The New States this year. So, you're -- I know that the net change in your 21 guidance and just what piece of it was a New States.\nJason Robins : Okay. New States are pretty modest in terms of their contribution in Q4, and they're actually close to 0 in terms of the year. So, as we noted in our earnings call, we had about $14, $15 million investment in Arizona in particular that hit Q3 on a negative revenue side. We're going to make back less than that in the Q4 time frame. So really there's really no impact from New States on the guide this year. In fact, if anything, it's slightly negative.\nRobin Farley : Okay. That's helpful and I appreciate that you guys are now breaking out the hold impact. Is there anything when we think about next year? Could you talk about the negative hold in Q3 and Q4? Is there anything that was above-average hold at benefited in the first half that we should think about that will be a tougher comp for you or that would make your guidance next year actually and currently better?\nJason Robins : We actually mentioned in our Q2 call that we held above what we were forecasting. So, we had a positive variance in Q2. I can -- we can go back and look and see. I think we quantified that. Yes, we quantified it, but happy to offline. Have our team point you towards the materials and then Q1 Jason. Do you remember if that was also above?\nJason Park : It's also a good guide in Q1.\nJason Robins : We had another positive variance in Q1. So, you're right, the first half of the year did benefit. It swings both ways, of course. But we can point you towards some of the specific numbers if you'd think about next year, offline.\nRobin Farley : Yeah. I appreciate that. I don't think you would quantify the first half completely, so thanks.\nJason Robins : You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Katz of Jefferies.\nDavid Katz : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. You've started roll in micro beads and in-game wagering which I've understood historically has higher hold considerably so. Number one. Has that performed the way you've expected it so show far and second, Should that be accretive to hold percentage as you roll more of it in?\nJason Robins : So definitely. we've seen an increase in parlay mix, as we noted, went up already in just a couple of short months from 15% of our holds - excuse me, of our, is it revenue or handle?\nJason Park : Handle.\nJason Robins : Of our handle to 23%. Interestingly, because so many favorites hit and so many money line favorites hit, it swings both ways. Overall, it can be a positive, but when you have a lot of favorites winning, it can actually go the other way. Parlays just tend to have higher variance in general, even though the average is higher. We do expect over a longer period of time, which hopefully Q4 will be in. Certainly, we expect for 2022, to see those continue to increase. Both as a percentage of handle and then also have a positive impact on our hold rate and our revenue overall. Some of that is built into the guide for next year.\nDavid Katz : Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.\nDaniel Politzer : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to drill a bit more into Entain. Can you talk a bit more about your rationale there for approaching them. Was it Global Technology or cash flow? And then just on your rationale for walking away, was it more of a function of price, deal complexity, or something else altogether?\nJason Robins : So, as we noted earlier, one of our pillars we think for long-term growth will be global expansion. That could happen soon, it could happen years from now. We don't have a set timetable. We kind of look at different things as they come about, as long as they fit a long-term strategy. So, this is one that we thought potentially could have been a good route. Up for global expansion.  As far as why we walked away, I think there are a variety of factors, and certainly, value is one of them. But there are a variety of factors that lead us to feel like it just wasn't the right thing for us to do at this time. I think [Indiscernible] complexity was probably a smaller part of it, although not entirely on meaningful factor is really more about our confidence in our current trajectory in the U.S. our desire to focus on the U.S. and ultimately the value that we felt like we would be shedding by pursuing that asset.\nDaniel Politzer : Understood. Thanks so much. so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.\nChad Beynon : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. With respect to your $25 million stock investment in Vivid, how should we think about what the intention was for this? if you have more access to the industry and you'll be able to learn more than what your plans are in the future in the ticket space? Thanks.\nJason Robins : Well, we're very excited about the relationship we've developed with V ivid. We have a lot of interesting things planned, which we'll be unveiling in the coming quarters. And ticketing is certainly an area that we think overlaps. We have SportsFan and ticketserve, often bought by SportsFan to sporting events. And SportsFan go to other events too like concerts and things like that. So, our expectation is that with a hopeful return to post-pandemic, we're going to see a lot more activity in terms of concerts and sporting events. It seems like demand is up for those things, and we also got a really good deal.  We don't typically invest. It's not a way that we really use investor capital often. We in fact established a totally separate entity called Drive by DraftKings which is our vehicle that we see is really the bulk of the investments that will be considered would be through that of the earlier stage. In the case of vivid, we got a great deal because along with the investment we've got to put right which protects us 100% on the downside. So beyond just wanting to have a deeper relationship with them, we also felt like it was just a really smart use of capital for the next year or so.\nChad Beynon : Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Hey guys, maybe just a high-level question as you think about that, $1.7 billion EBITDA target you presented at your Analyst Day, where do you see the most areas for upside and I guess also downside. as we sit here today.\nJason Robins : Well, any of the great question there's a few areas I think they could have upside. One is the TAM could end up just being larger than we think. Certainly, we've seen evidence that the industry is developing faster and remains to be seen if that's actually an indication that the TAM is larger, but that could very well be a possibility. Secondly, I think you could see a deeper amount of legalization. We only assume, for example, 30% of the population would have iGaming, and 65% would have sports betting, and already, we're at 39% for online sports betting and 11% for iGaming less than 3 years since a little over 3 years since past [Indiscernible] overturned. So that could be another area of upside.  Additionally, some of the areas we've talked about expansion, both global and product expansion, are not built into there. I think there could be some upside in that as well. We're particularly excited about the Marketplace product that we launched. We have big plans in the media and content space. And at some point, we'll have to see when we do think we'll expand globally. So, I think there's a lot of upside along all of those dimensions. As far as where there could be downside, I think the biggest assumption that we're focused on is around the share. And so far, that's done great. Despite the fact that the narrative has been competition, competition, everyone jumping in.  We actually saw our share rise in September. We went up 2% in mobile sports betting, we went up 2% in iGaming. We're now above our long-term target for mobile sports betting. We're right in the middle of the range for our long-term target for iGaming and that's despite the fact that we're in, perhaps, the most competitive times. Certainly, I hope it's near the peak, but I think there's good argument that this is as competitive as it's ever going to get. Certainly, we are pretty excited about that. I think that there might even be some upside there as well on the share side, but right now we feel comfortable with what we've guided to long-term.\nBarry Jonas : Really helpful. Thank you.\nJason Robins : Welcome.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ryan Sigdahl, Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\nRyan Sigdahl : Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the negative NGR and impact to revenue from promos and New States launches. Is that a primary function of the start of football in Q3 impacting that or is that the right assumption as we think about New State launches throughout other parts of the year?\nJason Robins : So, I think that for -- I'll answer that in two ways. One, we are always optimizing our go-to-market playbook. I think we've gotten way better and that's part of why we've acquired so quickly in a state like Arizona, where we achieved a 100,000 customers, hundreds of days earlier than some of our older, more tenured states took. And part of that is figuring out what the right cocktail of external marketing spend is, What promos work, how to mix everything, channel mix other things.  So, I think that's been a big thing that we've improved on, and the results are pretty striking, so that's part of what I would say that it's hard to say, this is going to be -- we're 3 years into this thing and I think it's hard to say that this is going to be exactly how it looks for any long-term period of time and we're always following the data and doing analytics to make it better. That said, I do think you're right that football is going to be or has been a big driver here because the volume of new customers that you can acquire, let's say a state launched in the middle of May.  There is no way we would have been able to achieve the volume of new customers that we achieved in some of the states that launched at the beginning of football season, that just always the best time of the year to acquire customers. So, when you have more new customers coming in faster, it's going to drive more promotional investment, more external marketing investment and that's why I think you saw in Arizona and of course, the lesser extent, but still important Wyoming. And despite the fact that I said in the beginning, we're always optimizing, I would be surprised if that ever changes, unless there's some -- if football ever becomes less of the outsized customer acquisition time, then maybe. But I don't see that changing anytime soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks.\nJason Robins : Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We appreciate your questions and look forward to continuing our conversations with you. We're excited for what the rest of the year and beyond holds for us. I hope you all stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call on February.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will cover the following topics. First, we're very pleased with our Q3 performance. Revenue in the third quarter grew 60% year-over-year and met our guidance due to continued excellent customer acquisition and engagement. Lower than expected sports betting hold primarily due to NFL game outcomes impacted revenue and EBITDA in the quarter. Strong customer acquisition performance and new state launches, particularly Arizona, drove additional promotional investment which also impacted third quarter revenue and EBITDA.  In addition to mobile sports betting launches in Arizona and Wyoming in Q3, we also launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in Connecticut in October. Second, looking forward. The pipeline and new states in Canadian provinces continues to be healthy. Louisiana, Maryland, New York, and Ontario have all authorized mobile sports betting and Ontario has authorized IDB. We expect these jurisdictions to launch in the coming month. Third, the migration to our in-house bet engine and proprietary sports betting technology is complete.  We are thrilled with the early performance and our new ability to rapidly add innovative features and functionality to our top ranked mobile sports betting app. I'm also very proud of the team for delivering ahead of our scheduled deadline. Fourth, our new growth initiatives which include DraftKings Marketplace in our Content and Media business are seeing promising early results.  Fifth, we are very excited about the pending acquisition of Golden Nugget Online Gaming and are working towards closing in early 2022. I will also comment on the discussions we had with Entain. And before turning it over to Jason Park, I will also provide an update on our ongoing responsible gaming and corporate and social responsibility initiatives. We delivered strong revenue growth of 60% in the third quarter of 2021, which met our guidance from our Q2 earnings call.  On a same-state basis, as well as adjusting for lower-than-expected hold primarily due to NFL game outcomes, revenue would've been $40 million higher than our guidance. I'm very pleased with our market share in Q3 as well, which reflects the success of our technology migration, the strength of our overall business. Our handle share for mobile sports betting across all active states improved from an average of 31% in July and August, 33% in September. For iGaming, our GGR share improved from an average of 15% in July and August, 17% in September. Third Quarter monthly unique payers increased 31% versus Q3 2020 to 1.3 million, which includes the record month of more than 2.1 million in September.  Average revenue per monthly unique payer increased 38% to $47. We're particularly proud of the growth in ARPMUP, given that Q3 of 2020 had a jam pack sports schedule with 2 months of basketball and hockey that did not occur in this year's Third Quarter. Fundamental user acquisition, retention, and engagement trends are all tracking better than we have projected last quarter, which sets us up well for the rest of the year in 2022. This was true across all of our products. In week 1 of the NFL season, we have more than two times the number of mobile sports betting paid actives than we have for NFL Week 1 last year.  And then the Third Quarter of 2021, [Indiscernible] paid actives on a same-state basis increased 50% compared to the third quarter of 2020. iGaming gross revenue has grown sequentially on a same-state basis in each quarter of 2021. And we expect that sequential growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter. iGaming gross revenue grew 154% year-over-year in Q3 2021, including all states and 82% on a same-state basis. In DFS, we set a single day record for paid entries on September 12th, and NFL Sundays for weeks 2 and 3 were our second, third largest days, reinforcing that are DFS product continues to grow and provide an ongoing [Indiscernible] manage at new state launch.  Looking at New Jersey, our most mature state where we launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in 2018 are must continue to grow at an impressive rate. In the third quarter of 2021, despite not having basketball and hockey, combined OSB and iGaming maps grew 23% year-over-year. Maps in New Jersey increased 124% versus the third quarter 2019. We had very successful OSB launches in Arizona and Wyoming in Q3 and launched OSB and iGaming in Connecticut in early Q4. Our launch in Arizona went extremely well and exceeded our internal underwriting case.  Our data-driven and highly disciplined marketing approach resulted in much higher-than-expected new user acquisition in September, which has given us the confidence to continue to invest in acquiring new customers. The result is that we are set up very well to be a leader in the state. We are also very excited about Wyoming, which is a smaller state but offers a meaningful opportunity with visitors to the state. With the ramp up of Arizona in perspective, it took DraftKings just 17 days to acquire a 100 thousand first-time paid betters compared to 170 days for New Jersey, 312 days for Pennsylvania, and 344 days for Indiana.  This is despite the fact that DraftKings did not have the DFS in Arizona until August 28th, only 12 days before we launch mobile sports betting. In New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, DFS was operational for more than 6 years prior to launching mobile sports betting in those states, which makes our customer acquisition success in Arizona even more impressive. Our business momentum has continued into Q4. For DFS, October 3rd, which is the NFL Sunday featuring the Tampa Bay versus New England game was the highest gross revenue day in our history. For OSB in New Jersey, the October 5th wildcard playoff game between the Yankees and the Red Sox is the highest MLB handle game in our history, beating the previous all-time high by 12%.  For iGaming, October was our strongest EGR month of the year by more than 10%, even when excluding the launch of iGaming in Connecticut. We announced on October 13th that as the exclusive odds supplier, DraftKings will provide sports betting information and Daily Fantasy content across Turner Sports telecasts and Bleacher Report digital channels including the BR app. related to Turner's NHL content. On October 18, we continue to lay the groundwork for our vision of DraftKings marketplace by announcing a blockchain collaboration with Polygon, which provides us a scalable, eco -friendly blockchain solution that enables added throughput and expanded capabilities.  Also, DraftKings now is the option that potential contribute to polygon governance and help secure the network is a validated note. On October 19th, we launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in Connecticut. In Connecticut, DraftKings is one of only 3 sports book operators and 2 iGaming operators authorized in the state. And on November 4th, we announced an expanded multi-year relationship with the NBA to make DraftKings the co-official sports betting partner of the league. This agreement grants DraftKings ' expansive NBA rights and assets to integrate within a sports betting, [Indiscernible], iGaming and free-to-play products in promotional offerings.  As has been widely publicized, NFL game outcomes have been favorable to players this year for a number of reasons. Primetime NFL games played on Thursday, Sunday, and Monday nights typically have higher viewership and therefore high handle. Through week 7, 71% of NFL primetime favorites and 57% of NFL [Indiscernible] have won in 2021. They'll also have not been as many big upsets across all NFL games. Before we gate, there is not a single upset by underdogs at least 7.5. points. Additionally, we have had four NFL weeks for more than 66% of the favorites won. a very popular parlayed bet is the pair a large favor on the money line with other bets.  Therefore, in March favorites win consistently, parlays hit more frequently. Of course, game outcomes can also swing the other way. The last week of October had very favorable results for the house. Between last Thursday and this Monday alone DraftKings generated a positive variance of more than $25 million of revenue compared to our forecast due to favorable event outcomes. While we had a great finish to the month, we still ended October close to $25 million below our forecast due to lower-than-expected [Indiscernible] resulting from player-friendly event outcomes.  Despite these outcomes and due to the continued momentum of our business. We are increasing the midpoint of our 2021 revenue guidance, which Jason Park will cover in more detail later on the call. Turning to legalization trends, we have continued to see momentum in mobile sports betting and iGaming. In 2021, 25 state legislators have introduced legislation to legalize mobile sports betting, 5 state legislators have introduced legislation to expand their existing sports betting frameworks, and 2 state legislators have introduced legislation to legalize sports studying, limited to retail locations. In addition, 4 states have introduced iGaming legislation, and 3 states have introduced online poker legislation.  In total, nearly 13% of the U.S. population [Indiscernible] laws passed in their state legalizing competitive online sports betting markets in 2021, demonstrating continued momentum three years after the overturn of PASPA. Following our launches in Wyoming, Arizona and Connecticut, DraftKings is live with online sports betting in 15 states that collectively represent 29% of the U.S. population. Additionally, DraftKings is now live with 5 iGaming states, representing approximately 11% of the U.S. population. States we're drafting has the potential opportunity to participate via market access agreement or direct license. New York, Maryland, and Louisiana authorized mobile sports betting this year. These 3 states represent 9% of the U.S. population and bring the percentage of the population with legalized mobile sports betting to 39%.  We are actively preparing to be able to launch in these jurisdictions pending the necessary licensing and regulatory approvals to do so. I also want to comment on California and Florida. In California, we are working with a number of leading online sports betting operators in support of a campaign to bring a well-regulated, safe, and responsible online sports betting market to the state. Legal online sports betting will bring hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue annually to the state. Directly [Indiscernible] two of its biggest challenges, homelessness and mental health, by providing permanent shelter and housing, as well as addiction services for those in need.  The California Solutions to Homelessness and Mental Health Support Act ensures a comprehensive licensing process. One that requires extensive vetting of experienced operators and create the competitive marketplace this competition for market share will ensure the best products and experience for consumers. In Florida, we continue to work with FanDuel and the Florida Education Champions, that collected signatures required to have a mobile sports betting question on the ballot in November 2022. We are excited for the potential prospect of Florida voters, deciding to have a safe, legal, regulated, and competitive market for online sports betting in this state, with a market leading in technologically advanced product offerings.  If enacted, all tax revenues from mobile sports betting conducted pursuant to this referendum will be dedicated to the funding of state public education system. Turning to Canada, Ontario continues to establish parameters for the launch of the online gaming market in the province. We look forward to further progress in Ontario and Canada as a whole. For context, Ontario represents about 40% of the candidate population and would be the fifth largest U.S. state by population were in America. Moving onto product and technology, I am very proud of all that our team accomplished in the Third Quarter. For mobile sports betting, we completed the full online and retail migration to our own in-house bet engine in the third quarter and migration went very smoothly and was completed ahead of schedule.  This was the largest technology project we have ever undertaken. It consumed resources that are now free to focus more on innovation and we're already experiencing benefits from the transition to our own technology. To provide context for our recent product improvement. Over the first 3 weeks the NFL season, new users bet nearly 20% more on average than new users did during the same period in 2020. And their mix of handle on any type of parlay as opposed to single event that increased to 23% from 15%. We, now, price approximately 80% of our combined pre -match and live back-handled in-house, and into increase that percentage over time.  In August, we announced the launch of micro-betting across the DraftKings Sportsbook. Integrating micro-betting technology allows our customers to engage even further with the sports they loved by betting, play-by-play throughout a sporting event. We're particularly proud of the depth of the futures markets and player props that we now offer. For example, in NBA, we're now offering micro-bets on approximately 40 different players covering statistics such as points assisted and rebounds for each. For iGaming, we continue to benefit from the games we have developed internally.  79% of our iGaming users that played in the third quarter, at some point, played a DraftKings - developed game. We also added DraftKings Rocket to our mobile iGaming suite, New Jersey on September 1st. Built entirely in-house, DraftKings Rocket is the latest game that our team has developed and follow the addition of both Danish 21 and DK Craps earlier this year. In New Jersey, rocket set a new launch month record for most gross revenue by a DraftKings developing, improving on the debut of DraftKings crap Jack in New Jersey by 46%. DraftKings is the only provider of rocket in U.S. and developing this game is further evidence of us bringing ongoing innovation to our consumers. Following our April acquisition of blue-ribbon software, jackpots are now live in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Michigan. We are continuing to add to this functionality, including launching a feature that allows multiple games to be attached to a Jackpot. In the third quarter, research firm Eilers & Krejcik tested 34 sports betting app and ranked each on user experience, betting interface, features, core and aesthetics. As part of this survey, Eilers & Krejcik evaluated the new DraftKings app, post-migration, based on our own in-house technology.  I am pleased to say that we ranked number 1 overall, and we were also ranked in the top 3 across four of the five criteria, including user experience, betting interface, features and aesthetics. We're continuing to make significant progress with several exciting new organic growth factors. The launch of DraftKings Marketplace has been amazing. I'm proud of the highly acceptable and easy-to-use experience that we've built, Which combined with compelling content, has driven positive user engagement.  Marketplace is a large opportunity given our ability to cross-sell existing customers and acquire new ones by offering a new way for fans to interact with their favorite athletes in sports moments. The 70 [Indiscernible] on DraftKings marketplace, provided by our partner Autograph, were oversubscribed 14:1 on average. And the secondary transactions, market has seen strong engagement by users seeking to collect their favorite NFTs. In the third quarter, more than 1/3 of marketplace users were new to DraftKings.  These users completed over a 120,000 primary and secondary transactions, totaling approximately $20 million gross merchandise volume. Since the initial [Indiscernible], which featured Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Tony Hawk, Derek Jeter, Naomi Osaka, and Tiger Woods, we have added drafts by Usain Bolt and Rob Gronkowski. Recently, Autograph teamed up with Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures to release on DraftKings marketplace exclusive digital collectibles from SAW, one of the most successful horror franchises in history.  Our media business continues to grow as sports betting content is in demand, and we recognize the importance of reaching a wider audience through our own channels. Since we acquired VSiN. It has expanded at talent lineup and broadcasting footprint. In September, we scaled up production to offer a full 24, 7 lineup. We also amended our first nationwide content distribution deal with YouTube TV that delivered recent bleeding sports betting, news and insight that subscribers as part of YouTube, TV, sports Plus add-on package and introduced millions of subscribers to be premium content.  Recent podcasts and iHeart Radio are also experiencing incredible success as we surpassed 4 million downloads in the month of September. We will continue to invest in these exciting and differentiating growth factors into 2022. With the approach to each of them will continue to drive the LTV to cap flywheel that we're creating along with our existing DFS, OSB and [Indiscernible] offerings. I'd also like to provide an update on our acquisition of Golden Nugget online gaming. In Q3, we made significant progress towards closing the acquisition of Golden Nugget online gaming and have strong plans in place to integrate the business and captured synergies we outlined in the presentation materials from August.  For more information on the strategic rationale for this deal, please refer to the materials on our Investor Relations website and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I also want to make a few comments on the discussions we recently concluded with entertain. We are continuously looking at multiple organic and inorganic growth opportunities that are accretive to our shareholders, most of which never come the fruition, but offer great learning opportunities for me in the team. This situation was unique because there was a leak. Pursuant to the UK Takeover Code, it had to be disclosed that we are in discussion, even though the discussions were very early. We had the chance to meet with the leadership of [Indiscernible], in order to explore the merits of the combination. [Indiscernible] has a very impressive team, and we have a great deal of respect for the business [Indiscernible].  However, after carefully assessing our potential transaction and weighing various considerations including our own organic growth plans as well as other deal flow, we decided not to make an offer. We continue to be very excited about the vision we have for growing DraftKings. We have the industry-leading brand, a vertically integrated technology stack, top ranked apps across our verticals, a robust and innovative product road map, and the best team in the world. We're very well-positioned to maintain and grow our leadership position in North America and beyond.  We recognize that we're very fortunate and have worked very hard to get to where we are. A Company with a strong balance sheet and a clear path for many years of very high growth in a market with tens of billions of dollars of still unrealized [Indiscernible]. The bar for changing that trajectory is incredibly high, and it would take a lot for us to decide to pursue any large asset with the slower growth profile. At the same time, we felt obligated to look at this deal, but just because we look at something doesn't mean we will decide to do it.  Turning to corporate social responsibility, DraftKings serve to the catalyst that facilitate meaningful relationships between our employees and customers and the communities and causes they feel passionate about in order to create a better world for everyone. Keeping with our focus on responsibility, we integrated the American Gaming Associations have a game plan that responsibly Public Service campaigns. Across our retail sports book and into our team partners stadium.  Along with our own responsible gaming tag, it's more fun when for fun. Last month, our partners at the NFL announced the new responsible gaming initiative in collaboration with the National Accounts on problem gambling. We commend the NFL 's commitment to this important work and look forward to our future collaboration to advance safe play. We quickly mobilized our customers to raise funds for feeding Louisiana in the aftermath of hurricane [Indiscernible]. We raised funds for the Larry Fitzgerald foundations to support a breast cancer research, and we supported three mission-driven organizations for Hispanic Heritage Month with total donations of $625,000 to further our commitment to equity and entrepreneurship.  This week, we also announced the relationship with the Pat Tillman Foundation, which honors NFL great-turned - military hero, Pat Tillman. The foundation carries on Pat Tillman's legacy by giving military service members, veterans and their spouses the educational tools and community support to reach their fullest potential as leaders. We are proud to support the foundation's work, and all military personnel, veterans, and their family. I will now turn the call over to drafting CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our third quarter results and revised 2021 guidance. Thank you, Bernie. So, we've laid out a few areas that we would potentially look to in terms of M&A. One is global expansion. Also, product expansion and also things that we think would help us further improve our position in the U.S. market. So, all of those are areas we look at. I think as opportunities come along, it's hard to sort of say, hey, I'm going to do this 1 first, this 1 second, and it's 1 third, it's like here at the list and we'll look at being. As they come along. I think that we were certainly very impressed at the entertain team and Company they've built.  I think they're a great asset. There are other international assets that I think are of interest as well. But Entain is a great Company. So, in this case, we just decided it wasn't the right thing for us at this time to pursue them and I think we'll continue to look at things out there. Most of the things we look at, we don't end up pursuing. And this was a unique one, because due to the UK Takeover Code, a very early discussion had to get publicized when normally we would just never have the [Indiscernible]. You're welcome. So, on the first topic, I think we have really exciting plans and a great product roadmap for next year. I think we recently launched same Game Parlays, pushing that and continuing to make that a best-in-class offering and driving additional user adoption, I think will be very helpful. We already saw overall parlays move from I think 15% to 23% in just a couple of months. So, I think with a full year next year under our belt, we think we can really move that percentage up and get a lot more adoption of same game parlay in general.  And we have a number of other features including our social features and other things that we think are going to have really exciting developments next year. So, we do expect that to contribute. What we would say about that hold question is -- we're not always really -- we don't really look to optimize the rate of hold. We look to optimize gross profit. In some cases, that might mean that you actually drive more volume through having promotions and other things that can drive down hold percentage, but end up being gross profit positive.  And then of course we look to maximize long-term LTV of our customers. So that's really our primary focus, but I do think some of the things, such as the continued adoption of same game parlays, will help drive that rate of holdup as well. On the media question, I agree that there is a lot of commoditized media and content out there. We will have more to say, I don't want to tip our hand, but I actually I'm very excited about the strategy that our new Chief Media Officer, Brian, has put together.  And I think it's going to allow us to pursue this in a unique and differentiated way. So, beyond that, I think there's also this really strong synergies with the things that we have planned along with the core areas of our business now and the DFF OSB, and iGaming side. So more and more to say on that in the coming quarters. I think the big wildcard with 2022 is, of course, what new state launches look like. We didn't include that in our revenue guidance, but by the time we actually end up publishing results, I'm expecting there will be additional states in there, and that's going to move the needle quite a bit on our external marketing investment. Beyond that, I think right now we really like the flexibility of being able to spend deeper when the results are there. We had tremendous CAC in Arizona. I mean, that just absolutely blew away our expectations at the volume. We were able to acquire and keeping that CAC as low as we did. So, I think we like the flexibility of being able to spend deeper, and not having an external commitment to what sales and marketing would look like. It's hard for me to say what others are doing. We certainly monitor the marketplace, but it's not totally precise. That said, I do think you're right that there has been a little bit of a pull back. From our perspective, we just follow the data, so we're going to spend when the results are coming in and we're going to pull back if they're not and we're seeing still really, really strong CACs and really, really good volume coming. Not just in new states, but in some of our more tenured states as well, so that's really our approach.  Obviously, the overall media environment has an effect on that, but it cuts both ways. Yes, there's competition for customers, but also more overall spend from the entire industry drives more people into the market, which I think benefits those, that which we feel we do have the best-in-class products and experiences. So, I think that's actually an interesting way to look at it.  That, yes, of course, there's more competition for customers, but it's also growing the market faster. And Arizona is a great example of that where we just -- were way, way ahead of the pace that we've seen in other states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, despite the fact that we didn't really have a DFS database there like we did in those other states. Thank you. Thanks, Thomas. So, I think we obviously want to wait and see what the regulator and what the state of New York says about whether we're able to achieve getting that license. Certainly, we would love that, and hopefully, those rumors are true. But we'll find out when we find out and we'll be respectful of that process. That said, if we were to be awarded a license, I think we feel just like we In other states, that we can achieve the same long-term profit margins in New York.  There's a lot of levers we can pull, such as cutting back on rate of promotion and spending less on external marketing. Those are things I would expect everyone in the industry would do because I don't think anyone is going to want to run at a long-term unprofitable rate in any state. Certainly, early on, we will approach it just like we do other states where we'll invest into it and look for that 2-to-3-year path to profitability.  But I think over the long term, we feel we can achieve something in the similar range, in a similar range to what we're achieving in other states from a long-term margin perspective. And then on the second question. It's not insignificant, but it's not super meaningful either. We have less than a $100 million in the plan for that, for the [Indiscernible]. So, we're pretty excited about it. We think it's going to be a growth product, but we're also taking a measured approach and not putting too much in there, and really relying on the strength of the core business to carry a next year in our guidance. I'll answer your second first and then I'm going to turn it to Jason Park to answer the first one. So, New Jersey and it's almost funny to call it a more mature state. It's still only a little over 3 years in, and we're still seeing really strong user growth there, that is in part driven by strong royalty. We're seeing great retention numbers, but we're also still acquiring customers as well. So really excited about New Jersey, really excited about our more tenured states.  I think that what we're proving out is that two to three-year payback on the customer and two to three-year path to profitability in a state, really will hold. And we're going to talk more about that once we have full-year results in Q1 time frame. And I think similar to all of how we approach everything, we're just going to follow the data as long as customer acquisition is continuing to work, we're going to invest there. Certainly, we expect some of the earlier cohorts to have stronger LTV.  So, we're keeping a close eye on that, but New Jersey still only 3 years in, and I think if obviously a little bit of a different ramp, but if you look at the iGaming market, which is I think in its seventh or eighth year at this point, it's still growing. The 30-plus percent we're growing more than that. So, I think New Jersey, you're going to see grow for many years to come. And then Jason, do you want to take? I think it is still very early in the market, and I am not so sure that that's going to continue long term. As far as how it inter plays between products, we're always looking at total value. So right now, that doesn't seem like an approach that we think based on what we see makes sense, but could it ever be something that us or others think makes sense, perhaps?  But I don't see that as a likely outcome. I think that sports betting on its own is going to be a very profitable business for us. We're already seeing that New Jersey as an example. So, I expect that to be the case across states. Also, most states don't have iGaming at this point. There's about 39% of the population with legalized sports betting and only I think 11%, I want to say with iGaming. We really have to feel like we can run the sports betting vertical at a profit even just to make it work from that perspective. Thank you. Sorry. Can you say the second question one more time and I'll answer it. So, on your first question, overall MUP, we think Q4 will be in a similar range to what September was. Yes, you're right. NBA is starting, but also as the NFL season continues, there's less activity. And right now, I think that we're still seeing really strong month-over-month going into both October and early November. But historically, we've seen that turned down a bit and then it tends to pick back up again once the playoffs are going into the Super Bowl. In terms of New Jersey, it's really a combination of customer acquisition and also really strong retention that's driving that.  And our sports offering is certainly a big driver of what gets people there. Once we have them on the platform, they're playing across products, so it's really hard to say, is sports driving more active, or is it iGaming? But our goal, of course, is to get as much crossover as possible. And we've been able to cross-sell over 50% of our online sportsbook customers into iGaming. So, I think typically sports is where we acquire the players, but in a state that's a few years in like New Jersey where there's so much being driven off of existing cohorts. It's really hard to say. Yeah. And then just to add to that last point. The free bet doesn't pay out the stake. So, it inflates the hold rate versus Todd's boosts or other sorts of things that are directly affecting the odds that takes it down. the promotional impact from a GAAP perspective might be similar, but the state hold rate looks higher and the tax basis it looks higher and that's one of the factors we consider when deciding what types of promotion is to run. Obviously, we want to do what's best for the customer, but we're also looking at how we optimize for taxes. Thank you. That the flow-through on the Q3, 25 million in this would apply to Q4, as well as very high flow-through. There are it is not a 100% flow-through because there are certain elements of COGS that you still have to pay regardless of what the GGR Marketplace, I know I said less than 100 in the '70s and we launched it in August of this year. I think that this year it's going to be closer to 10, 15 versus 25, but we don't really know yet. It's still sort of a very new product, so we've actually been, I think, quite conservative with how we've looked at that in the guidance. As far as the new state impact to next year, we have not included in the New States. Matt, next year, sorry or this year? Okay. New States are pretty modest in terms of their contribution in Q4, and they're actually close to 0 in terms of the year. So, as we noted in our earnings call, we had about $14, $15 million investment in Arizona in particular that hit Q3 on a negative revenue side. We're going to make back less than that in the Q4 time frame. So really there's really no impact from New States on the guide this year. In fact, if anything, it's slightly negative. We actually mentioned in our Q2 call that we held above what we were forecasting. So, we had a positive variance in Q2. I can -- we can go back and look and see. I think we quantified that. Yes, we quantified it, but happy to offline. Have our team point you towards the materials and then Q1 Jason. Do you remember if that was also above? We had another positive variance in Q1. So, you're right, the first half of the year did benefit. It swings both ways, of course. But we can point you towards some of the specific numbers if you'd think about next year, offline. You're welcome. So definitely. we've seen an increase in parlay mix, as we noted, went up already in just a couple of short months from 15% of our holds - excuse me, of our, is it revenue or handle? Of our handle to 23%. Interestingly, because so many favorites hit and so many money line favorites hit, it swings both ways. Overall, it can be a positive, but when you have a lot of favorites winning, it can actually go the other way. Parlays just tend to have higher variance in general, even though the average is higher. We do expect over a longer period of time, which hopefully Q4 will be in. Certainly, we expect for 2022, to see those continue to increase. Both as a percentage of handle and then also have a positive impact on our hold rate and our revenue overall. Some of that is built into the guide for next year. So, as we noted earlier, one of our pillars we think for long-term growth will be global expansion. That could happen soon, it could happen years from now. We don't have a set timetable. We kind of look at different things as they come about, as long as they fit a long-term strategy. So, this is one that we thought potentially could have been a good route. Up for global expansion.  As far as why we walked away, I think there are a variety of factors, and certainly, value is one of them. But there are a variety of factors that lead us to feel like it just wasn't the right thing for us to do at this time. I think [Indiscernible] complexity was probably a smaller part of it, although not entirely on meaningful factor is really more about our confidence in our current trajectory in the U.S. our desire to focus on the U.S. and ultimately the value that we felt like we would be shedding by pursuing that asset. Well, we're very excited about the relationship we've developed with V ivid. We have a lot of interesting things planned, which we'll be unveiling in the coming quarters. And ticketing is certainly an area that we think overlaps. We have SportsFan and ticketserve, often bought by SportsFan to sporting events. And SportsFan go to other events too like concerts and things like that. So, our expectation is that with a hopeful return to post-pandemic, we're going to see a lot more activity in terms of concerts and sporting events. It seems like demand is up for those things, and we also got a really good deal.  We don't typically invest. It's not a way that we really use investor capital often. We in fact established a totally separate entity called Drive by DraftKings which is our vehicle that we see is really the bulk of the investments that will be considered would be through that of the earlier stage. In the case of vivid, we got a great deal because along with the investment we've got to put right which protects us 100% on the downside. So beyond just wanting to have a deeper relationship with them, we also felt like it was just a really smart use of capital for the next year or so. Well, any of the great question there's a few areas I think they could have upside. One is the TAM could end up just being larger than we think. Certainly, we've seen evidence that the industry is developing faster and remains to be seen if that's actually an indication that the TAM is larger, but that could very well be a possibility. Secondly, I think you could see a deeper amount of legalization. We only assume, for example, 30% of the population would have iGaming, and 65% would have sports betting, and already, we're at 39% for online sports betting and 11% for iGaming less than 3 years since a little over 3 years since past [Indiscernible] overturned. So that could be another area of upside.  Additionally, some of the areas we've talked about expansion, both global and product expansion, are not built into there. I think there could be some upside in that as well. We're particularly excited about the Marketplace product that we launched. We have big plans in the media and content space. And at some point, we'll have to see when we do think we'll expand globally. So, I think there's a lot of upside along all of those dimensions. As far as where there could be downside, I think the biggest assumption that we're focused on is around the share. And so far, that's done great. Despite the fact that the narrative has been competition, competition, everyone jumping in.  We actually saw our share rise in September. We went up 2% in mobile sports betting, we went up 2% in iGaming. We're now above our long-term target for mobile sports betting. We're right in the middle of the range for our long-term target for iGaming and that's despite the fact that we're in, perhaps, the most competitive times. Certainly, I hope it's near the peak, but I think there's good argument that this is as competitive as it's ever going to get. Certainly, we are pretty excited about that. I think that there might even be some upside there as well on the share side, but right now we feel comfortable with what we've guided to long-term. Welcome. So, I think that for -- I'll answer that in two ways. One, we are always optimizing our go-to-market playbook. I think we've gotten way better and that's part of why we've acquired so quickly in a state like Arizona, where we achieved a 100,000 customers, hundreds of days earlier than some of our older, more tenured states took. And part of that is figuring out what the right cocktail of external marketing spend is, What promos work, how to mix everything, channel mix other things.  So, I think that's been a big thing that we've improved on, and the results are pretty striking, so that's part of what I would say that it's hard to say, this is going to be -- we're 3 years into this thing and I think it's hard to say that this is going to be exactly how it looks for any long-term period of time and we're always following the data and doing analytics to make it better. That said, I do think you're right that football is going to be or has been a big driver here because the volume of new customers that you can acquire, let's say a state launched in the middle of May.  There is no way we would have been able to achieve the volume of new customers that we achieved in some of the states that launched at the beginning of football season, that just always the best time of the year to acquire customers. So, when you have more new customers coming in faster, it's going to drive more promotional investment, more external marketing investment and that's why I think you saw in Arizona and of course, the lesser extent, but still important Wyoming. And despite the fact that I said in the beginning, we're always optimizing, I would be surprised if that ever changes, unless there's some -- if football ever becomes less of the outsized customer acquisition time, then maybe. But I don't see that changing anytime soon. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We appreciate your questions and look forward to continuing our conversations with you. We're excited for what the rest of the year and beyond holds for us. I hope you all stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call on February."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning everyone. We're pleased to announce that we generated $213 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a 60% increase versus Q3 2020 revenue of $133 million. Our [Indiscernible] business generated $189 million for the quarter, representing an 82% increase versus prior year. Offset by B2B, which declined 19% versus prior year to $24 million. A year-over-year decline in B2B reflects the impact of the termination of our Asia Reseller Agreement, which we ended on April 1, 2021 with a transition period that has already ended.  In terms of the B2C business, we continue to drive strong growth in player acquisition and retention as measured through [Indiscernible] as well it's player engagement and monetization as measured through [Indiscernible], BDC monthly unique payers in the quarter increased 31% year-over-year to 1.3 million. The increase reflects the expansion of our OSB and iGaming product offerings into new states and superb retention of existing players. Results reflect typical intra -quarter seasonality with July and August lower from a month's perspective, while in September, we had a record 2.1 million MUPs due to the start of the NFL season.  Average revenue per monthly unique payer or ARPMUP, was $47 in Q3, representing a 38% increase versus the same period in 2020. Our ARPMUP was positively impacted by strong customer engagement, our continued mix shift into our sportsbook and iGaming product offerings and cross-selling our customers into more products. We guided to $213 million at the midpoint and delivered $213 million. Revenue would have been $40 million higher were it not for lower than forecast [Indiscernible] rates and investment in new state launches. Lower than forecasted [Indiscernible] cost us roughly $25 million of revenue in the third quarter.  While hold was higher than Q3 prior year, it was lower than we expected, with NFL outcomes being the largest contributor. For context, in September, 67% of prime-time favorites went outright and 89% of prime time over is hit. As we've mentioned in the past, Q3 is uniquely [Indiscernible] of hold variances because of the concentration of just 3 weeks of NFL games in the quarter. So, sport outcomes can impact Q3 results meaningfully. In addition to hold, we launched two new states in Q3, which were not included in our prior guidance.  These new states resulted in negative 15 million of net revenue due to new customer promotional investment driven by much better-than-expected customer acquisition. In Arizona for example, over the first 30 days, we acquired 8 times the number of customers that we acquired in New Jersey on a population adjusted basis. Customer response has exceeded our own expectations, which we attribute to broader awareness in sports betting and the continuous improvement of our state launches playbook.  The net revenue investment was due to promotional contra revenue in the final weeks of the Q3 period, which has already begun to pay back in Q4. Please note we are breaking out the impact of lower than forecast hold in new state launches because these factors were material to third-quarter results relative to our guidance. We generated $71 million of gross profit dollars on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the entire business in the quarter, representing a 17% increase versus last year. Gross margin rate on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the business was 33% in the quarter versus 46% last year.  Very importantly, on a year-over-year basis, our gross margin rate was impacted heavily by the forementioned investment of net revenue in new states launched in Q3, as well as 3 additional states, Tennessee, Michigan, and Virginia that launched after Q3 of 2020. These new states together accounted for more than 3 quarters of the year-over-year decrease in gross margin rate. Outside of this, we saw improvement in our COGS structure across our product offerings offset by the ongoing mix shift out of our more mature and not higher-margin DFS product offering and into OSB and iGaming.  And as a reminder, our costs as a percentage of revenue for OSB will improve starting in Q4 due to the migration to our in-house bet engine. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative 314 million. Which includes approximately 60 million of impact from lower than forecasted hold percentage and the investment we made in new seats. Excluding the 60 million impact of these items, adjusted EBITDA would have been significantly better than the same-state basis expectations we provided on our Q2 earnings call. As a reminder, investment in new state launches includes promotional expense, cost of revenue, and external marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses were $289 million, which include our extra marketing sector and marketing was higher than the third quarter of 2020 as we were live in 14 total stage versus 9 last year.  The five new states represent 10% of the U.S. population and are in there first full NFL season. We continue to see very attractive [Indiscernible] opportunities that support this investment in marketing. Our general and administrative, and product and technology costs on an adjusted EBITDA basis were $58 million and $38 million, respectively. As we continue to invest to achieve scale in our back-office functions, such as customer service, finance and accounting, legal and human resources, as well as adding to our technology team, principally for new product development.  A majority of the combined $29 million of year-over-year growth in these 2 expense lines was from compensation for new employees. Much of the head count growth was in our customer experience department where we are focused on providing best in the industry customer experience, and it's impacted by a rapid growth in months. In the quarter, we expensed 233 million in items that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA, but are included in GAAP operating income, including $176 million for stock-based comp and $57 million for amortization of acquired intangible, depreciation and other amortization and other non-recurring expenses.  Moving onto our Balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash on our Balance Sheet. We are well capitalized to execute our multiyear plan and address our key priorities of customer acquisition. Entering new states as they legalize continuing to lead the market on product innovation and pursuing accretive M&A. Looking at the rest of 2021 on our August earnings call, we increased the midpoint of our revenue guidance from 1.1 billion to 1.25 billion. Today, we are increasing the midpoint to $1.26 billion and narrowing the range to $1.24 billion to $1.28 billion.  We are increasing our guidance because of broad strength and fundamental customer acquisition, engagement and monetization trends, as well as modest contribution from our 3 newest states. These factors are offset by close to $25 million in lower than forecast hold in October, which we assume we do not make up for during the rest of the quarter. October has been an exciting month to say the least, with two very challenging hold weekends, only partially offset by last weekend, which was very positive. Thank you, Justin Sims Yes, sure. Hey, good morning, Mike. The gross margin rate impact from being vertically integrated that's commenced in Q4. As a reminder, some roughly high single-digits of revenue for the OSB product offering only. So please don't apply that to the entire business. For the OSB product offering, that essentially goes away in Q4. Hey, Carlo. This is Jason Park. I'll try to tackle that one. I totally agree with you. The state tax report, I think it's really important to remind everyone those are regulatory and tax reports and trying to bridge those to GAAP can be difficult, not to mention that every state has a slightly different definition of hold and handle. I think that's a the most important thing it is difficult. We -- having said that, we do see those and we notice I think what you're noticing which is DraftKings is sort of at parity with the broad swath of the industry.  There is a couple of outliers. I think the right way to think about it is, what would drive those state tax report hold numbers -- hold percentages higher for certain competitors? And it really just comes down to a couple of different vectors. I think product mix is a big one and certain operators just likely have a higher parlay mix as a percentage of their total handle. Which would drive hold percentage up and as you know, we've launched in Game Parlay, and we're really excited about the traction there.  So, I think that will change over time. And then another potential reason is just promotional mix, which really does get obfuscated in the state tax reports. And to the extent that an Operator uses more free bets that can really sort of make the state tax reports look like they have a higher hold percentage. Those free bets come through at a very high hold percentage. And so on. The second question, we are part of the consortium in California, there's 7 operators that have contributed to it, and we've raised about a $100 million so far. I think we're really well positioned there. As far as how it impacted the P&L, I think it does get included in its adjusted out. It is not part of our adjusted EBITDA. It's also a good guide in Q1. Handle."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stanton Dodge, Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead.\nStanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical facts constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility for updating forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. During the call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings\u2019 operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings\u2019 financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed today with the SEC and in our earnings presentation, which is available on our website at investors.draftkings.com. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open up the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, everyone. On today\u2019s call, I will cover six key messages. First, we generated $298 million of revenue in Q2 due to excellent engagement from our customers and no discernible adverse impact from the reopening of the economy. Second, we saw positive legislative momentum continue, with several states authorizing mobile sports wagering this year. Third, we continue to make big strides on product and technology, including the migration to our in-house bet engine. Fourth, we are laying the foundation for our media and content business. Fifth, we are launching an exciting new vertical in the non-fungible token industry under the brand of DraftKings Marketplace. And before turning it over to Jason Park, I will also provide an update on our ongoing responsible gaming initiative. We continued to deliver strong and healthy revenue growth in the second quarter of 2021. Revenue for the quarter increased 297% year-over-year to $298 million on a pro forma basis. Monthly unique players increased 281% to 1.1 million and average revenue per monthly unique player increased 26% to $80. While year-over-year comparisons were obviously impacted by COVID, our results were very strong relative to our expectation. At this stage, we\u2019re not seeing any signs of the economies reopening impacting demand for our mobile product offerings. We continue to acquire customers efficiently with tech at or below our target. And as a data-driven company, we will dial up or down our investments according to the numbers. ARPMUP is also outperforming our expectations, which may be an indication that player LTVs could be even better than we thought. As of now, we are not making any adjustments to our models or internal CAC target. Engagement in the quarter was outstanding across all our products, particularly during the NBA and NHL playoffs and finals, major golf tournament, Champions League, Copa Am\u00e9rica and the Euro Cup. We\u2019re also very excited about the continued traction we are seeing in combat sports, such as the UFC. To give a sense of the engagement we saw in the quarter, excluding new states, NBA playoffs handle and paid active increased 82% and 47% compared to the 2020 playoffs. To give a sense of engagement on a more normalized basis, handle and paid actives for the NBA playoffs grew 293% and 119% in New Jersey compared to the NBA playoffs in Q2 of 2019. Also, excluding new states, handle for The Masters increased 47%, with paid actives up 35% compared to the 2020 Masters in November. Handle and paid actives for The Masters grew 241% and 78% in New Jersey compared to The Masters in Q2 of 2019. In fact, overall OSB handle in New Jersey grew 196% and paid actives increased 111% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2019. iGaming gross revenue also continued to grow at an impressive rate in the quarter, despite retail casinos reopening to full capacity in all the four states where we operate with iGaming. The overall New Jersey iGaming market group 33% in Q2, which is even more impressive when considering that New Jersey iGaming it\u2019s been available for almost eight years. More importantly, DraftKings\u2019 iGaming gross revenue in New Jersey grew more than 2.5x the rate of the overall market in the second quarter, which is outstanding given the tailwinds we experienced in the same period last year due to COVID. Our business momentum has continued into Q3. On July 9, we announced an expansion and extension of our existing exclusive daily fantasy sports and sports betting relationship with Major League Baseball. As an official sports betting partner of MLB, our brand will be visible throughout digital odds displays and virtual signage within MLB game. The expanded relationship also includes the right to an innovative bet and watch streaming integration with fans with open enacted mlb.com and DraftKings accounts will be able to watch a free live MLB game within the DraftKings app. July 10 was an all-time top 10-day for acquiring a new mobile sports betting customers, even though July is traditionally our slowest acquisition month for the year. This critical day included the Wimbledon Women\u2019s Championships, Brazil versus Argentina in the Copa Am\u00e9rica final and the Poirier versus McGregor fight. On July 15, we received a license in Louisiana Gaming Control Board to launch our fantasy sports product and approved parishes in the state. We moved forward with the launch on July 16. Arizona also recently legalized fantasy sports, and we are actively preparing to launch in this date pending receipt of licensure and regulatory approval. And on July 21, we revealed plans to launch DraftKings Marketplace, which I\u2019ll comment on in a few minutes. Looking ahead, due to the continued outperformance of our core business, we are raising our revenue guidance, which Jason Park will cover in more detail a little bit later on the call. Turning to legalization trend. We have seen continued momentum in both mobile sports betting and iGaming legislation. In 2021, 25 state legislatures have introduced legislation to legalize mobile sports betting. Five state legislatures have introduced legislation to expand their existing sports wagering framework and two state legislatures have introduced legislation to legalize sports betting limited to retail location. In addition, four states have introduced iGaming legislation and three states have introduced online poker only legislation. Six of the states were DraftKings has potential opportunity to participate via market access agreement or direct license, Wyoming, Arizona, New York, Maryland, Louisiana and Connecticut have already authorized mobile sports wagering this year. These six states represent 13% of the U.S. population and brought the percentage of the population with legalized mobile sports betting to 39%. DraftKings is live with online sports betting in 12 states that collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population. Additionally, DraftKings is live with iGaming in four states, representing approximately 10% of the U.S. population. Connecticut is also authorized by iGaming, which would add about 1% of the population. I want to provide a bit more color on Florida and New York. In Florida, we have teamed up with FanDuel and Florida Education Champions to collect approximately 900,000 verified signatures. If we were able to successfully collect those signatures, we will have a mobile sports betting question on the ballot in November 2022. It is our shared goal to have a safe, legal, regulated and competitive market for online sports betting in the Sunshine State and Floridians deserve a market-leading and technologically advanced product offering. In New York, the RFA for mobile sports betting with issued in July, and we were prepared to respond in a fulsome and timely manner. We look forward to the potential of offering mobile sports betting in New York. Turning to Canada. We continue to believe that the country represents a very meaningful opportunity and we\u2019ve seen strong legislative progress this year. At the federal level, the bill to repeal the single game sports wagering prohibition has passed the legislature and received royal assent. So it is now law and parlays are no longer required. At the provincial level, Ontario has enacted a law to create the regulatory framework for competitive iGaming and mobile sports wagering market. For context, Ontario represents about 40% of Canada\u2019s population. If Ontario were a U.S. state, it would be the fifth largest state by population. We\u2019re excited about this momentum and we look forward to further progress in Ontario and Canada as well. Moving on to product and technology. I\u2019m very pleased to announce another quarter of significant progress. As we have mentioned in the past, we believe that the long-term winners in this industry will have a relentless focus on bringing the best product experience to customers. For mobile sports betting, we have completed our back-end migration in 11 states and have just one state left pending final approval. Being vertically integrated will greatly enhance our ability to continuously drive differentiated products and customer experiences and offer market you need to DraftKings. For example, we\u2019re happy to announce that we have launched Same Game Parlays. Same Game Parlays are a thought after feature from our customers that we are now able to offer due to our vertical integration. In addition, we are on track to bring other new features, including new end game markets to our customers by the start of the NFL season. We signed a multi-year support data supplier agreement with Genius Sports, which gives us access to Genius\u2019 full portfolio of global sports data and content, including official NFL data and content. The terms of this deal are consistent with our long-term gross margin expectations. For iGaming, we added DK Craps to our mobile Casino suite in New Jersey with Pennsylvania, Michigan, and West Virginia to follow pending approval. The game is a DraftKings-exclusive and built in-house, perhaps it\u2019s a challenging game to develop, given the seemingly endless path players can take. And our internal teams were able to deliver an authentic and truly differentiated Craps experience. In addition, we have launched our jackpot technology, which is enabled by our prior acquisition of Blue Ribbon. Over the past quarter, we have taken additional meaningful steps to begin building out our media business. We firmly believe that DraftKings has an exciting opportunity to play in the media space, given our brand recognition and trusted relationship with millions of paying customers across our DFS, OSB and iGaming vertical. We also have tremendous relationships across the industry with sports partners and media entities, as well as newly acquired assets like VSiN and our distribution relationship with Meadowlark. When analyzing the media vertical, we see three critical factors that will lead to our success in both the short and long-term. Media is a logical adjacent vertical for DFS, OSB and iGaming given the clear LTV to cash benefits for our core business. Specifically, we have the potential to acquire DFS, OSB and iGaming customers through our content assets, such as VSiN and distribution relationship such as Meadowlark. We believe we will also be able to improve retention of our existing DFS, OSB and iGaming players as a result for our differentiated media content. Given our well-known brand millions of paying customers, ownership of proprietary content in the form of gaming and DFS data and the VSiN platform, we will have the opportunity to be a unique content provider in the sports and entertainment space. Media and of itself is a great business, which has the potential to diversify our revenue stream through ad sales, content distribution deals and potentially even recurring subscription revenue. If I said to say, we are very excited about the future of our media and content business, and we will continue to update you on this topic in the coming quarters. We are continuing to explore exciting new growth sectors. Some of which we can pursue organically, some inorganically. On July 21, we revealed plans to launch DraftKings Marketplace, a digital collectables ecosystem designed for mainstream accessibility. Draftkings Marketplace offers curated NFT drops for U.S. dollar purchase and support secondary market transaction. Our first NFT drop will be in the near future. And instantaneously millions of customers will have the ability to seamlessly buy and sell digital collectables across sports, entertainment, and culture using their existing DraftKings account. This first drop is enabled by our exclusive sports content distribution relationship with Autograph. It was established exclusive relationships with prominent iconic athletes, such as Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Tony Hawk, Derek Jeter, Naomi Osaka, Tiger Woods and more. We are pursuing this vertical because it fits the criteria we have outlined here in the path. Notably that NFTs offer a logical crossbill opportunity with our existing customers. As a result, this vertical can enhance customer stickiness in LTV as well as the potential for new customer acquisition through affiliation with these iconic athletes fan base. It also has very attractive economics given the large potential revenue opportunity based on transaction fees, modest initial investment and excellent EBITDA margin. We also continue to explore other vectors, including deepening and strengthening our existing product offerings and geographic expansion outside of the U.S. I also want to provide some recent updates on one of our highest ESG priorities, responsible gaming. DraftKings responsible gaming mission is to leverage technology, employee training and evidence-based research to protect consumers. In the second quarter, we announced three ways, we are advancing this critical mission. In May, we made a financial commitment to the International Center for Responsible Gaming\u2019s fund to support research on sports wagering. As a result of DraftKings contribution, the ICRG was able to proceed with the competitive request for applications from researchers around the world who were interested in pursuing groundbreaking research. In June, we collaborated with the American Gaming Association to promote the AGA\u2019s Have A Game Plan Bet Responsibly public service campaign. DraftKings is committed to publicize the campaign in many of the companies own channels, including at DraftKings\u2019 retail gaming properties to promote safer play. This collaboration marks the first time in the industry that the Have A Game Plan campaign will be comprehensively rolled out across a national retail sportsbook footprint. Most recently, we finalized a strategic consulting agreement with the Division on Addiction at Cambridge Health Alliance, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. In coordination with the DraftKings Responsible Gaming team, the Division on Addiction will create an innovative systems-based safer play approach to training employees across the business in responsible gaming. Responsible gaming is an area in which we will continue to work with the industry and invest in as company. We are committed to continually improving and evolving how we can best support our customers, this goal standard tools for proactively identifying intervening and providing guidance to players can set limits effectively, utilize cool off periods and self-exclusion. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our second quarter results and revised expectations for 2021.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we will be discussing our results on a combined company pro forma basis to improve comparability as if we owned our B2B business starting on January 1, 2020 rather than on April 23, 2020. We are pleased to announce that we generated $298 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a 297% increase versus Q2 2020 revenue of $75 million. Our B2C business generated $270 million for the quarter, representing a 383% increase versus prior year. We continued to drive strong growth in players and player retention as measured through MUP, as well as player engagement and monetization as measured through ARPMUP. B2C monthly unique payers in the quarter increased 281% year-over-year to $1.1 million. The increase reflects strong unique payer retention and acquisition across DFS, OSB and iGaming. The expansion of our OSB and iGaming product offerings into new states and the lack of traditional sports for much of the second quarter of 2020. Q2 MUPs represented typical seasonality with Q2 being a slower sports quarter than Q1. Average revenue per monthly unique payer or ARPMUP was $80 in Q2 representing a 26% increase versus the same period in 2020. Our ARPMUP was positively impacted by the return to our more normal sports schedule, which resulted in stronger and more consistent customer engagement across our DFS and sportsbook product offering. The launch of our sportsbook and iGaming product offerings in additional states also positively impacted our product mix. We also continue to drive engagement across our B2C product offerings, as we cross sell our users into more products. Clearly, a portion of the tremendous year-over-year growth of our B2C business is due to the sports cancellations and postponements that occurred in Q2 2020 due to COVID-19. Second quarter 2021 revenue also exceeded our expectations, not only due to the over performance of our core business as a result of continued strong customer acquisition, retention and monetization, but also due to higher than forecast OSB hold percentage, which contributed about $20 million to our outperformance in the quarter. Year-to-date in 2021 higher than forecasts OSB whole percentage has contributed approximately $40 million to our outperformance. B2B revenue was $27 million for the quarter up 44% versus prior year, which was negatively impacted by COVID. We generated $139 million of gross profit dollars on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the entire business in the quarter representing a 223% increase versus the prior year period. Gross margin rate on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the business was 47% in the quarter. As we have noted in the past, our gross margin rate is impacted by a mix shift out of our more mature and thus higher margin DFS product offering and into a higher growth rate and lower margin OSB in iGaming product offerings. In addition, gross margin rate within a period is impacted by promotional intensity, typically most intense when a new state launches and at the beginning of a major sports season, as we aim to acquire customers. Gross margin rates for OSB will be positively impacted by the conversion to our own bet engine, which is now complete in all states, but one pending approval, though we will continue to pay our third-party bet engine provider through the end of Q3 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $95 million as we invested in external marketing and in our product technology and G&A function. Our sales and marketing expenses were $157 million, which included our external marketing. External marketing was higher than prior year due to there being a full sports calendar in Q2 2021 versus a COVID impacted calendar in Q2 2020, as well as being live in 12 total states versus eight in Q2 2020. We are continuing to see very attractive CAC opportunities that support this investment in marketing. Our general and administrative and product and technology costs on an adjusted EBITDA basis for $41 million and $36 million respectively, as we continue to invest to achieve scale in our back office functions such as customer service, finance and accounting, legal and human resources, as well as adding to our technology team. A majority of the combined $17 million of year-over-year growth in these two expense lines was from compensation. Much of the head count growth was in our customer experience department, where we are focused on providing best in industry customer experience. And it\u2019s largely a variable cost impacted by our rapid growth in month. In the quarter, we expense $226 million in items that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA, but are included in GAAP operating income, including $172 million for stock-based compensation and $54 million for amortization of acquired intangibles, depreciation and other amortization and other non-recurring expenses. The expense associated with our stock-based compensation awards is based on a defined service period for our time-based brand and a probability based model for performance based and long-term incentive plans brand. Our Board grants equity awards to retain, motivate, and incentivize key employees, align their interests with them as shareholders and tie a significant amount of their compensation to working together to produce outstanding company performance. Moving onto our balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We are very well capitalized to execute our multi-year plan and address our key priorities of customer acquisition, entering new states as they legalize, continuing to lead the market on product innovation and exploring opportunistic and accretive M&A. Looking at the rest of 2021 on our first quarter earnings call in May, we increased our 2021 revenue guidance to $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion from $900 million to $1 billion. Given our continued strong performance in 2021 in underlying acquisition, retention and monetization of player, we are increasing our guidance to $1.21 billion to $1.29 billion of revenue for 2021, which equates to year-over-year growth of 88% to 100%. We are raising the midpoint of our 2021 revenue guidance, which results and implied second half growth of more than 40% based on our strong results in Q2 and Q3 to date, as well as our demonstrated and continued plan for strong user engagement and efficient customer acquisition. We expect both MUP and ARPMUP to grow in 2021. With MUPs increasing at a higher rate than ARPMUP. We also assume that all professional and college sports calendars that have been announced come to fruition, and that we continue to operate in the states in which we are live today. These states collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population for mobile sports betting and 10% of the U.S. population for iGaming. The Wyoming, Arizona, Maryland, Louisiana, Connecticut, and New York have authorized mobile sports wagering. We did not know the exact date, these states will launch nor in the case of New York, the results of the selection process. As such, we are not including them in our revenue guidance. The underlying strength in our business is responsible for the revenue guidance increase.  Regarding our 2021 quarterly revenue cadence, we have a high conviction plan in place for the start of the NFL season and have incorporated sensitivities on a variety of internal and external factors, the largest being sport outcome variability. Based on this analysis, we expect Q3 to be roughly 17% of the midpoint of our new 2021 revenue guidance, which is similar in dollar terms to the guidance we shared with you on May 7, due to ongoing excellent customer retention, the efficacy of our customer acquisition investments and new product features. We expect Q4 to account for approximately 34% of our revenue for the year based on the midpoint of our revised guidance range. While we are not providing guidance for 2021 adjusted EBITDA, our investment in sales and marketing as the key input, we always use facts to inform our decision on where, how, and how much to invest in external marketing. Our results since the economy fully reopened confirmed that our CAC continue to be very attractive. Based on the attractive LTV to CAC ratio opportunities we\u2019re seeing, we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to take advantage of these circumstances. From a quarterly perspective, we plan to deploy and optimize, but overall similar promotional and marketing campaign, as we did in Q3 of 2020, including more activity in the later part of the quarter, which will disproportionately affect adjusted EBITDA in Q3. In the fourth quarter, we expect a slight improvement compared to adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, as we monetize our Q3 promotional and marketing investments and benefit from higher seasonal revenues. As a result, we expect our adjusted EBITDA loss in the second half of 2021 to be approximately 60% of our total annual loss for 2021. Before wrapping up, I want to touch on state level unit economics. As you know, our business model is predicated on states turning profitable after two to three years due to underlying LTV to CAC dynamics. At this point, I want to affirm our outlook for our most mature state New Jersey, which we said would generate $210 million in net revenue and $65 million in contribution profit at our March investor day. Our other states are on a similar trajectory, and I look forward to providing you updates on those in the near future. As a reminder, our marketing spend is highly flexible and can be reduced or paused altogether, if the sports calendar shifts or if LTV to CAC opportunities become less attractive. Our spend is also impacted by the launch of new states. That concludes our remarks. And we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. You may begin.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if we could just dig in a little further on the customer acquisition spending outlook for the third quarter of the back half. Maybe just help us a little bit with the timing. It looks like you got very good cost leverage this quarter with on the sales and marketing line and those numbers coming down sequentially. So just what\u2019s the right expectation for thinking about that investment, especially into NFL and giving the timing of probably some of your larger broadcast contracts and like?\nJason Robins: Thank you, Shaun. So really, we\u2019re going to start with \u2013 we\u2019ve seen recently that while we kind of expected or at least about there might be some slowdown in performance due to the reopening, we\u2019re not seeing that. So based on what we\u2019re seeing today, I would expect we\u2019re going to get very good results going into NFL. NFL is basically like our holiday season. It\u2019s when we acquire the most new players and reactivate large portions of the player base. We do have a lower CAC target, as the players that we acquire tend to be a little bit more casual than the ones that we acquire and say, Q2. So we\u2019re going to manage that CAC target and we\u2019ll dial the investment up or down accordingly based on results, which is really hard to predict. I mean, we always learn a lot the first week going into NFL. And based on what we\u2019ve seen recently, I would expect strong results, we\u2019ll continue and we\u2019ll want to invest into it. But it\u2019s really hard to say and we\u2019ll be monitoring the data on an hourly basis and turning campaigns on and off accordingly.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, thanks. I guess just following up on the outlook, I think that you referenced that the dollar guidance is roughly unchanged. When we think about the math, I guess, what are some of the puts and takes to think about that could drive numbers above or below, I guess, as we think about the strong growth that you\u2019ve seen, and it looks like that\u2019s embedding some deceleration?\nJason Robins: Are you talking about Q3 specifically?\nStephen Grambling: I guess both Q3 and Q4.\nJason Robins: I think, we raised a little bit in the back half of the year, but you\u2019re right, we aren\u2019t necessarily banking on the overperformance we\u2019ve seen in Q1 and Q2 carrying over. I think that continues to be us being a bit cautious about what this NFL season might look like. Obviously, COVID has been up and down and we could see this swing either way. But based on what we see today, everyone\u2019s going to be back in stadiums, gatherings will be back to normal generally in most places. So we\u2019re just being a bit cautious given how significant the NFL period is for customer acquisition and activation about what we think will happen in the back half of the year. Also, there\u2019s only three weeks of NFL in Q3. So it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s an interesting period because you activate a lot of players, but a lot of their spending comes in Q4. So the ARPMUP is typically not as high in Q3 as we see in other quarters. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re also paying attention to.\nStephen Grambling: Got it. And I guess the NCAA being back would be maybe a partial offset. I guess, one follow-up, I guess, on the SBTech integration. I know that you talked about some of the increased functionality. How are you thinking about the kind of milestones? Do you feel like the most challenging aspects are behind you? Or do you still have to kind of test it through the NFL season? Thank you.\nJason Robins: Yes, that\u2019s a great question. So we\u2019ve definitely tested it quite extensively over the last few weeks. We\u2019ve migrated in all, but one state not one is pending approval. So we feel pretty good, obviously, we want to see how NFL looks from a trading perspective. But we\u2019ve done pretty rigorous testing throughout the other sports on the calendar, and we feel pretty good about it. We launched Same Game Parlays last week, which was a big feature that our customers have been asking for also typically has a higher margin. So we have not built in any additional revenue or any additional whole percentage based on new features we\u2019re launching. We don\u2019t sort of building off what you said. We want to test those things and see how they look going into NFL before we would promise any more revenue based on it. But we do think that there\u2019s some potential upside in the new features that we\u2019ll be launching in the coming weeks and months.\nStephen Grambling: Thanks. Best of luck.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. You may begin.\nJed Kelly: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just falling back up on the SBTech and Same Game Parlays, I expect you plan to market that product into NFL, and you think that will close the yield gap with some of your competitors at a little more vertically integrated. And then another question, just on the seasonality on MUP, the decline in sports betting, Jason, how do you think of sort of making sports betting a year round phenomenon and not as decently dependent on football? Thank you.\nJason Robins: So on the first question I think that we certainly have seen evidence across other companies in the marketplace that Same Game Parlays have a higher yield. So we could certainly see that we have not built that into any of our forward-looking guidance. So we\u2019re not counting on it, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re certainly hoping will be the case. And in general, I would say, we\u2019re not really trying to maximize whole percentage at this stage. We\u2019re on boarding a lot of new customers. It\u2019s the early days of the industry. So really, we\u2019re focusing on getting people onto the platform, getting them active and there\u2019ll be a time and a place where we\u2019ll focus more attention on increasing whole percentage. It\u2019s just not right now. And then sorry, what was the second question?\nJed Kelly: Just on MUPs, we saw a seasonal decline. I mean, how do you think about sort of making sports betting more year round and not as dependent on football, it might be impossible, but how do you think about that?\nJason Robins: I don\u2019t know \u2013 certainly, we think that as more people try more sports, it\u2019ll smooth out a little bit. There are certain sports like soccer, which are very popular among the younger generations, which I think over time will increase. But you\u2019re right, the sports themselves are seasonal. So it\u2019s very hard for us to control anything when there\u2019s popularity difference between different sports. And there are only certain times a year. As hard as we may try, we\u2019re not at any time soon going to be able to get more people to bet on basketball or baseball than they do on NFLs, just based on the fan base size. So that\u2019s something that I think just will always have to kind of live with on sports, but what we can do is continue to launch other types of products. So, obviously, iGaming has been a good one for us. That\u2019s something that people can play year-round. We\u2019re cross-selling very effectively onto that product. So while certainly, we see bumps when there\u2019s more actives, we do think it\u2019s a bit smoother seasonally. We recently announced that we\u2019re launching the marketplace. So NFTs, I think will be a year-round thing. There might be some seasonality given the sports focus, but we\u2019re also going to branch into NFTs for other things outside of sports. So I think is that that product continues to grow in the coming years, we\u2019ll see that help smooth out. So I think really that\u2019s the way that we\u2019re looking at smoothing out seasonality is just trying to diversify into other products that we can effectively cross-sell our customers into and might have a little bit less seasonal variation.\nJed Kelly: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Graham from Canaccord. You may begin.\nMichael Graham: Yes. Thank you and congrats on the great performance, I wanted to ask two, one on ARPMUP. Jason, if you could just take us under the hood a little bit on what\u2019s driving that strength. You mentioned cross-selling a minute ago, is it iGaming? Is it more sports being engaged in by each player or bigger bets from players? Or just can you tell us anything that helps us understand that? And then you had mentioned a long time ago that when you got to one-third coverage of the United States, that you would switch a lot of resources towards national ads. And I know you\u2019re sort of like almost there, but not quite there. Just wondering if you could update us on sort of how you\u2019re thinking about the marketing mix going forward.\nJason Robins: So thanks for the question that regarding ARPMUP, certainly there\u2019s some seasonality to it Q3 because it\u2019s a high activation quarter, but only a few weeks of NFL to monetize, I think we\u2019ll have lower ARPMUP than Q2. But even relatively speaking, meaning, year-over-year and actually, given the sport calendar change really looking at 2019 can be helpful versus Q2 2021. I think that we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we might just have a higher LTV player than we thought. And I think that\u2019s probably the biggest driver beyond anything else. We have also improved cross sell rates. So iGaming is helping, but even on the course, sports betting products, I think that it\u2019s still looking like ARPMUP was higher than expected again with the caveat that, it\u2019s hard to compare anything Q2 versus 2020 Q2. And looking back at 2019, it was a very different time than only a few states that we had. I think, live was sports betting at that point. So actually I think it might\u2019ve just been New Jersey at that point. Although, it could be wrong on that, there might\u2019ve been one or two others. Never mind, I\u2019m sorry. It was New Jersey, West Virginia and Indiana at that point. So there were only a few. So it\u2019s a little hard to compare, but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve also not changed our CAC targets. We\u2019re not counting on higher LTVs, but we\u2019re certainly optimistic cautiously that that could be the case. And we\u2019re going to be monitoring that in the coming quarters and hopefully, we\u2019ll have more data as the sports schedule stabilizes and it\u2019s easier to make year-over-year comparisons. And then the second question was sorry, remind me what the second question was? On national ad spend, right? So we\u2019re at right now 25% of the population. I do think there\u2019s a possibility that some new states will launch either right before during the NFL season Wyoming and Arizona being two that seemed like they\u2019re on a good track. And I think others like Louisiana may get in there as well. And if that happens, I still don\u2019t think we\u2019ll quite be at 33%. But I do think you\u2019ll see us start to mix some national advertising in this year to test that. I think it\u2019s important that if we\u2019re planning on shifting quite a bit, as we get into the mid-30s and 40s level international advertising, that we have some data in this NFL season to look at, to be able to optimize for next year. So you will see us start to test into that this NFL season.\nMichael Graham: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bernie McTernan from Needham and Company. You may begin.\nBernie McTernan: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up before Jason, you mentioned a bit more cautious on the NFL. I was hoping to dive into that a little bit more. Is it competitive environment or something else you were referring to?\nJason Robins: Well, I think we\u2019re still waiting to see what a year it\u2019s potentially people in stadiums and more of an open economy looks like that. The biggest factor, of course, that could change. We also don\u2019t know that. So I think there\u2019s a lot of moving variables and we\u2019re just trying to exercise caution and not getting overly bullish based on results that we\u2019ve seen. Early on suggesting that the reopening is having no adverse effect on the momentum we\u2019ve seen. If we get an NFL season under our belt with the economy, generally open around the country and around the states, we have online sports betting and iGaming. I think then we start to feel really good that we\u2019re not going to see any adverse impact in that. It\u2019s really just truly momentum in the industry and with drafting.\nBernie McTernan: Understood. And then just to drill down the NFT marketplace for a second, could you just talk about like what the economics of a transaction in the marketplace are the level of investment of time and money that it will take and kind of what\u2019s the upside opportunity? I think there\u2019s three or four major NFT marketplaces right now. Do you need to be a top operator to really move the needle for the company? Or is that the right way to think about it?\nJason Robins: I think it is the right way to think about it, because being marketplace having liquidity is important that said we also have exclusive rights that we\u2019ve secured through our relationship with Autograph to be able to sell an NFTs that are for top athletes like Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Naomi Osaka, Tiger Woods, Derek Jeter, and many others, Tony Hawk, many others. So we feel pretty good that having that exclusivity, no matter how liquid our marketplace is, initially, we will drive a lot of traffic, but over the long-term, I think being a marketplace, it\u2019s important to have the highest or close to highest level of liquidity, people are going to go where there\u2019s the most buying and selling when they\u2019re posting secondary transactions and things like that, which is true of any marketplace really. So I think that is how we\u2019re looking at it. We do have a much larger user base than any of the other marketplaces that exist today. So we feel like we\u2019re starting from a position of strength. Much like the daily fantasy user base has helped us with we launched online sports betting into other states. I think that having a big database with millions of active customers will really be a leg up for us and it just comes down to how effectively can we cross sell. And I think we feel pretty good about that given our track record of selling other \u2013 cross selling other products, but this is also our first foray into something it\u2019s a little bit different. So we\u2019re going to have to see how the data shakes out.\nBernie McTernan: Understood. Thanks taking the questions.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ben Chaiken from Credit Suisse. You may begin.\nBen Chaiken: Hey, how\u2019s it going? It looks like the \u2013it seems like the media angle is particularly interesting. You talked about MLB streaming, I think you mentioned exploring some subscription revenues, if I caught that I guess when it comes to unique sporting events that require a one-time payment or some type of exclusive access I guess I\u2019m thinking like boxing or out of network game, why not offer a promotion that allows access upon signup and deposit with DraftKings high level, it just seems like the cost of that versus your normal CAC is compelling relative to other channels. Is that something you could do? And then forgive me if this question lacks awareness in some way, and there\u2019s no obvious answer. Why it wouldn\u2019t work? Thanks.\nJason Robins: All right. I think it\u2019s a great idea. That\u2019s definitely something we\u2019ve talked about. In order to do, it depends on the event, but most of the time you have to have the rights. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll look into exploring as well and those rights of course costs money. So while, giving it away is one way to look at it. It\u2019s actually really the cost of the right that matters, which of course are lower than the cost of the pay-per-view because that\u2019s how money is made by companies that traditionally do that. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019re absolutely looking at amongst other things. We\u2019re still very early in developing our media strategy. Our goal is to have much more of it fleshed out by the end of the year and have explored some of those opportunities in the marketplace, such as the one you mentioned to see if we don\u2019t \u2013 it could be something that works for us. We do want the media vertical to on its own be a profit generating vertical certainly over the long-term. I think, we have the flexibility to not do that if we wanted to, but as of today, we believe that we can both make a profit directly in the vertical and have the synergistic benefit of being able to acquire and keep retain users using the content that we put out there as well.\nBen Chaiken: Got you. That makes sense. And then just quickly follow-up or second question would be, I think \u2013 I know Canada is not in your numbers, but it sounds like Ontario is going to be alive maybe by the end of this year, October, November, who knows. But will that fall \u2013 will Canada follow a similar cadence to how you\u2019ve launched new states, and I think you\u2019ve provided some guidance around New Jersey and other states about how you think about promotion, external marketing. Is that a reasonable way to think about Canada? Or is there a different format just because this is a little size-wise is different?\nJason Robins: I think we look at it the same way. It\u2019s an LTV to CAC question. We have plenty of daily fantasy customers in Canada, and we don\u2019t see really any differences between their spend levels and the customers that we have in the U.S. So I don\u2019t really have any reason to believe it\u2019s different. The interesting thing about Canada is that most major operators around the world have been in Canada for quite some time. So it\u2019s a little bit different than new U.S. states where they\u2019re opening up. And in some ways I think we have to focus on taking customers that have already been playing as much as trying to convert new customers, which is why we projected a lower long-term market share for Canada than we have for the U.S. One thing I wanted to \u2013 just on your previous question note as well that occurred to me after I answered. A lot of pay-per-views that distribute through multiple platforms, they actually have in their contracts with the platforms they distribute on that no one can give away for a free, or even under a certain price because it undermines the other platforms. They would say, why would anyone pay to for a pay-per-view on my platform, if they\u2019re getting it free elsewhere? Very common in the media industry, there\u2019s lots of things like this, MFMs are a very common thing and also restrictions on what you can and can\u2019t sell things for very common. So, that\u2019s something we would have to work around unless we had exclusive rights to distribute a pay-per-view.\nBen Chaiken: Makes sense. Thank you.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. You may begin.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. Can you quantify a little bit of how much of the revenue raised for the year is due to new initiative like Marketplace?\nJason Robins: Hi, Robin. We have not built in any additional revenue expectation from new initiatives. We really don\u2019t have enough data, we have no data to base it on. So we haven\u2019t assumed any new states. We haven\u2019t assumed any new initiatives generating revenue. Those are all things that once we have a little bit more clarity on the state side as to which dates and when might go live, we would be able to update. And then as we get a little bit of data on new initiatives, I think we\u2019d be able to update that. That said, I wouldn\u2019t expect new initiatives to generate a huge amount of revenue this year. This will be very early days of us launching them. Obviously, we have very strong conviction and are very excited about the long-term prospects and think that the market that we\u2019re entering like NFTs could be really, really large. But it\u2019ll take a little time for those new products to ramp.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Thanks. And then other question is on the agreement that you signed with Genius Sports, you mentioned your access to all of your other data outside of the NFL or that was part of the deal. Does that lower your cost in some way for things outside of the NFL, in other words, was it packaged with other things that lower the cost that you\u2019ve been paying for that data elsewhere?\nJason Robins: That\u2019s a great question. We aren\u2019t really able to give any specifics on that contract. But what we will say is that we do not expect any adverse effects to our long-term gross margin projections based on the pricing that we receive. So I think you can kind of read between the lines based on that. But due to confidentiality, we\u2019re not able to disclose any details of the contract.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. You may begin.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. My one question and it\u2019s one that I\u2019ve asked two quarters back, but not lately is around in-game wagering and the breadth of offerings there, obviously we\u2019re reminded by the parlay indication. If you could just talk about the breadth of offerings where you are today and what we can reasonably expect in the future. And is that something that\u2019s entirely driven within the confines of OSB tech or other, B2B services or tuck-ins or other things you may need to fully build that out? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Thank you. One of the things that really we\u2019ve noted, we\u2019re excited about with now having migrated to our in-house platform is the ability to drive innovation and things like in-game wagering and other innovative types of bets that previously we had a lot more dependence on our partner can before. So we\u2019re really excited about that. And it\u2019s been an all consuming thing the migration. As you can imagine, it was a large project, the largest we\u2019ve ever done from a product and technology perspective. And it\u2019s a real testament to the great people on our product and engineering team to be able to have not only done that a little bit ahead of schedule, but also to have continued to launch new things, including our upcoming launch of Marketplace, but also several new states and other sorts of things along the way, including DK Craps and many iGaming games that we released. So really just \u2013 I\u2019m so proud of that team for not only ahead of schedule completing a very smooth migration, but also continuing to innovate. But it is true that it was very all consuming. And so, I think now that that\u2019s mostly behind us, we do still have one state left. We\u2019re really in a position to start focusing on driving innovation and launching new things. As far as third-parties, much like our iGaming product, we\u2019re going to do both. There\u2019s just a speed to market aspect of being able to integrate different providers and also at the same time launch things ourselves. And much like what we\u2019re doing with iGaming, we\u2019ll look at things that either we can\u2019t get through third-party providers or economically, it just makes sense for us to bring in-house. And we\u2019ll do that over time with the goal being most things are in-house over the long-term. But there\u2019s just such a long tail of different types of bets and same thing on iGaming, different types of games that there\u2019s always going to be a mix of things that we\u2019ve completely built on our own and things that we\u2019ve built either partially or in partnership with third-parties.\nDavid Katz: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Joe Stauff from Susquehanna. You may begin.\nJoe Stauff: Good morning, Jason and Jason. One other question to add on regarding your product offering. How do you think about, especially given your newfound flexibility in the in-house platform about extending out to different consumer segments? Again, whether they be offshore or something \u2013 I know it\u2019s not an immediate thing, but how do you think about extending your product into those other consumer segments say over time?\nJason Robins: So I definitely think that there\u2019s an opportunity as you noted to expand globally, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at doing either inorganically or organically or a combination of the two. But I think within sports betting, the opportunity to maybe branch into other sports that we haven\u2019t had as deep of an offering, it could reach different types of people is interesting. And I think something that we\u2019re exploring. And then, outside of sports, which we\u2019ve always \u2013 isn\u2019t specific to the migration of course. We definitely feel in the iGaming segment that we do better with people who are sports fans that we can cross sell. And we\u2019ve been working hard to try to extend our brand and extend our reach into the non-sports fan iGaming audience. And that\u2019s something I think we\u2019ve been getting a bit of traction on, but really need to continue to invest. I think that\u2019s probably the biggest opportunity for us now in terms of consumer segments that we\u2019re just not penetrating at the moment.\nJoe Stauff: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Stephen Glagola from Cowen. You may begin.\nStephen Glagola: Hi. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to unpack the announcement with Genius yesterday, a bit more on Same Game Parlays. Where the Same Game Parlays launched on the app a product built in-house by DraftKings? Or are you using Genius\u2019 BetBuilder product? And if it is Genius\u2019 product, why are using their product? I believe, BetMGM is also using that same product and FanDuel has developed an in-house parlay product. So if you can just talk around that please.\nJason Robins: Yes. I mentioned this a few moments ago, but we\u2019re going to put out a mix of different things that are organically developed and things where we\u2019re partnering. And it\u2019s going to depend on a variety of factors, such as the opportunity cost of building them in the short-term, the actual cost of using a third-party. In this particular case, it was packaged up with a larger deal. So we felt like it was a good way to get Same Game Parlays into the market really quickly in advance of NFL. And it frees up our engineering time to focus on other things. So that\u2019s a lot of how in the short-term we\u2019re going to look at it. If there\u2019s a good solution, it gets us something as good or better than what our competitors have. And we can free up engineering bandwidth to focus on other things that maybe our competitors don\u2019t have. That\u2019s going to be the initial focus. And then over time, I think we will take things that prove to be large parts of our offering that we think there\u2019s an economic benefit to vertically integrating and focused on those. But in the short-term, it\u2019s really about as quickly as possible having the broadest and deepest product offerings, since we think at this stage of getting maximum activation and retention of consumers is the most important thing.\nStephen Glagola: All right. Thanks, Jason. But just to be clear, so that is \u2013 it is the \u2013 that is the Betgenius product and that is on the app right now for the parlay.\nJason Robins: I believe so. I know we were using, because we just announced the deal, I think yesterday and we had the Same Game Parlays we launched earlier this week. I know we were using another provider. I\u2019m not sure if we fully switched over to Betgenius yet, but that\u2019s the plan.\nStephen Glagola: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Barry Jonas from Truist Securities. You may begin.\nBarry Jonas: States have been slower to legalize iGaming than say sports betting. I know your expectations there as the same as sports betting, but what do you think needs to happen to get more momentum on the iGaming legalization front?\nJason Robins: I think, we\u2019ve always felt, and I think have said that it\u2019s going to be sports first and then iGaming. I think that that\u2019s just the kind of natural evolution of things that states are going to be more comfortable in many cases going sports first. And then, once they get used to the tax revenues coming in, see more and more states doing iGaming, we think more and more states are comfortable with iGaming as well. Some states such as Connecticut this year chose to do them all at once, Michigan did the same thing, Pennsylvania did the same thing. So we may see that here and there. And then we may see states like West Virginia, for example, that it\u2019s sports betting first and then a year or two later, did iGaming. So I think it will be a mix, but we certainly expect the momentum to be first with sports betting legalization, and then iGaming to be something that follows that. I think that in terms of your question about how to get them comfortable, I think there\u2019s really two things. One is just most states don\u2019t want to be the guinea pigs. So more and more that they see other states particularly it tends to be regional in their geographic areas doing it. And the more that they feel like, everything\u2019s going well and the playbook on how to regulate it is clear, the more I think, comfort they\u2019ll get. I think also seeing how much tax revenue can be generated and back to the kind of regional point, if there\u2019s bleed from states like, right neighboring them because they have iGaming and a state that\u2019s chosen to do sports betting does not. I think that could be a reason that they move faster. But it\u2019s really just time. And we\u2019re going to continue to push the message out there that this is something that can be done in a safe manner. We have great guardrails in place and are continuing to invest in getting better at responsible gaming and there\u2019s real meaningful tax revenue that can be generated by adding that product.\nBarry Jonas: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will comes from the line of Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital. You maybe begin.\nRyan Sigdahl: Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Nice metrics on New Jersey iGaming that you gave, really strong performance there. What do you think is driving that accelerated market share gain recently here versus the past several quarters? And then secondly, why do you think you\u2019re having more success taking share on gaming versus the OSB? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Great good question. I mean, I think iGaming is actually and hopefully it foreshadows OSB a great example of where we\u2019ve invested in launching our own games and enhancing our own products. And for example, we mentioned we had launched our own in-house Craps game last quarter. And I think that that\u2019s really helped generate momentum and gain market share. And we\u2019ve been really consumed with the migration. And also of course, there are many things we couldn\u2019t do on the product front before migrating. So I think now that we\u2019re finally in a position where we control our own destiny there and we\u2019re able to innovate, I hope to be able to do many of the same things that we\u2019ve done in the last several quarters on the iGaming front product-wise. And we hope that that helps us gain more share and retain and acquire customers more effectively.\nRyan Sigdahl: Great. Thanks guys. Good luck.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question for today will be coming from the line Mike Hickey from The Benchmark Company. You may begin.\nMike Hickey: Nice. Good morning, Jason, Jason, nice quarter guys and guide. Congrats. First one, just any progress that you made on sort of adding social layers to your app. I think that was sort of a theme on your last call tie in on retention there on your user base. And the second question on NFTs, just curious, obviously the crossbow opportunities seems like a no brainer but curious on the user acquisition side, thinking about key offerings maybe tied into live events and that can bring players into the ecosystem. Thanks guys.\nJason Robins: Thanks. Social is off to a great start. It\u2019s very early. I mean, we launched an MVP only a few months ago, and so we still feel like we have a very lengthy and exciting roadmap there. But the early results have been very strong. We\u2019ve seen great adoption. We monitor daily and monthly active users on the social features, separate from daily and monthly active users on the product \u2013 on the other products. And we\u2019ve seen that continually increasing since we\u2019ve launched. And I think we\u2019ll learn a lot in NFL season based on how many of our customers that we acquire and active we\u2019re able to get adopting those social features. So very excited about it. I think it\u2019s too early to share any metrics. But we\u2019re starting to flesh out what metrics we might be comfortable sharing on the coming \u2013 in the coming quarters. On the NFT side, I definitely feel like it\u2019ll be a great cross-sell product. We\u2019ll know when we get the data, but we\u2019ve done enough market research on our customers to know that quite a few of them are interested in it and there\u2019s good overlap with our current customer base. And I do agree that it could also potentially have some upside on the customer acquisition side, just like we do with every product in our portfolio, which are the best products to most efficiently bring people onto the platform. And then once they\u2019re on the platform, we try to cross sell them across everything we do. And I think there could be some upside on that front for sure, but we\u2019re going to have to wait and see, and really we\u2019ll do whatever the data suggests. But it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve talked about it\u2019s a potential upside. And in general, I think just having the broadest product portfolio gives us the most options for how we can acquire different pockets of customers. So not only does it increase LTV, but also has positive effect on our tax efficiency over time to just have the broadest and deepest product portfolio possible.\nOperator: Thank you. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today.\nJason Robins: Thank you all for joining us on today\u2019s call. We appreciate your questions and look forward to continuing our conversations with you. Our performance in 2021 continues to be very strong and we\u2019re excited for what the rest of the year and beyond holds for us. DraftKings is well-positioned with $2.6 billion in cash to capitalize on legislative advancements in several states, complete the migration to our own in-house set engine, expand and initiate relationships with important organizations and advanced new product technology and content initiatives. I hope you all stay safe and well and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in November.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will cover six key messages. First, we generated $298 million of revenue in Q2 due to excellent engagement from our customers and no discernible adverse impact from the reopening of the economy. Second, we saw positive legislative momentum continue, with several states authorizing mobile sports wagering this year. Third, we continue to make big strides on product and technology, including the migration to our in-house bet engine. Fourth, we are laying the foundation for our media and content business. Fifth, we are launching an exciting new vertical in the non-fungible token industry under the brand of DraftKings Marketplace. And before turning it over to Jason Park, I will also provide an update on our ongoing responsible gaming initiative. We continued to deliver strong and healthy revenue growth in the second quarter of 2021. Revenue for the quarter increased 297% year-over-year to $298 million on a pro forma basis. Monthly unique players increased 281% to 1.1 million and average revenue per monthly unique player increased 26% to $80. While year-over-year comparisons were obviously impacted by COVID, our results were very strong relative to our expectation. At this stage, we're not seeing any signs of the economies reopening impacting demand for our mobile product offerings. We continue to acquire customers efficiently with tech at or below our target. And as a data-driven company, we will dial up or down our investments according to the numbers. ARPMUP is also outperforming our expectations, which may be an indication that player LTVs could be even better than we thought. As of now, we are not making any adjustments to our models or internal CAC target. Engagement in the quarter was outstanding across all our products, particularly during the NBA and NHL playoffs and finals, major golf tournament, Champions League, Copa Ame\u0301rica and the Euro Cup. We're also very excited about the continued traction we are seeing in combat sports, such as the UFC. To give a sense of the engagement we saw in the quarter, excluding new states, NBA playoffs handle and paid active increased 82% and 47% compared to the 2020 playoffs. To give a sense of engagement on a more normalized basis, handle and paid actives for the NBA playoffs grew 293% and 119% in New Jersey compared to the NBA playoffs in Q2 of 2019. Also, excluding new states, handle for The Masters increased 47%, with paid actives up 35% compared to the 2020 Masters in November. Handle and paid actives for The Masters grew 241% and 78% in New Jersey compared to The Masters in Q2 of 2019. In fact, overall OSB handle in New Jersey grew 196% and paid actives increased 111% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2019. iGaming gross revenue also continued to grow at an impressive rate in the quarter, despite retail casinos reopening to full capacity in all the four states where we operate with iGaming. The overall New Jersey iGaming market group 33% in Q2, which is even more impressive when considering that New Jersey iGaming it's been available for almost eight years. More importantly, DraftKings' iGaming gross revenue in New Jersey grew more than 2.5x the rate of the overall market in the second quarter, which is outstanding given the tailwinds we experienced in the same period last year due to COVID. Our business momentum has continued into Q3. On July 9, we announced an expansion and extension of our existing exclusive daily fantasy sports and sports betting relationship with Major League Baseball. As an official sports betting partner of MLB, our brand will be visible throughout digital odds displays and virtual signage within MLB game. The expanded relationship also includes the right to an innovative bet and watch streaming integration with fans with open enacted mlb.com and DraftKings accounts will be able to watch a free live MLB game within the DraftKings app. July 10 was an all-time top 10-day for acquiring a new mobile sports betting customers, even though July is traditionally our slowest acquisition month for the year. This critical day included the Wimbledon Women's Championships, Brazil versus Argentina in the Copa Ame\u0301rica final and the Poirier versus McGregor fight. On July 15, we received a license in Louisiana Gaming Control Board to launch our fantasy sports product and approved parishes in the state. We moved forward with the launch on July 16. Arizona also recently legalized fantasy sports, and we are actively preparing to launch in this date pending receipt of licensure and regulatory approval. And on July 21, we revealed plans to launch DraftKings Marketplace, which I'll comment on in a few minutes. Looking ahead, due to the continued outperformance of our core business, we are raising our revenue guidance, which Jason Park will cover in more detail a little bit later on the call. Turning to legalization trend. We have seen continued momentum in both mobile sports betting and iGaming legislation. In 2021, 25 state legislatures have introduced legislation to legalize mobile sports betting. Five state legislatures have introduced legislation to expand their existing sports wagering framework and two state legislatures have introduced legislation to legalize sports betting limited to retail location. In addition, four states have introduced iGaming legislation and three states have introduced online poker only legislation. Six of the states were DraftKings has potential opportunity to participate via market access agreement or direct license, Wyoming, Arizona, New York, Maryland, Louisiana and Connecticut have already authorized mobile sports wagering this year. These six states represent 13% of the U.S. population and brought the percentage of the population with legalized mobile sports betting to 39%. DraftKings is live with online sports betting in 12 states that collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population. Additionally, DraftKings is live with iGaming in four states, representing approximately 10% of the U.S. population. Connecticut is also authorized by iGaming, which would add about 1% of the population. I want to provide a bit more color on Florida and New York. In Florida, we have teamed up with FanDuel and Florida Education Champions to collect approximately 900,000 verified signatures. If we were able to successfully collect those signatures, we will have a mobile sports betting question on the ballot in November 2022. It is our shared goal to have a safe, legal, regulated and competitive market for online sports betting in the Sunshine State and Floridians deserve a market-leading and technologically advanced product offering. In New York, the RFA for mobile sports betting with issued in July, and we were prepared to respond in a fulsome and timely manner. We look forward to the potential of offering mobile sports betting in New York. Turning to Canada. We continue to believe that the country represents a very meaningful opportunity and we've seen strong legislative progress this year. At the federal level, the bill to repeal the single game sports wagering prohibition has passed the legislature and received royal assent. So it is now law and parlays are no longer required. At the provincial level, Ontario has enacted a law to create the regulatory framework for competitive iGaming and mobile sports wagering market. For context, Ontario represents about 40% of Canada's population. If Ontario were a U.S. state, it would be the fifth largest state by population. We're excited about this momentum and we look forward to further progress in Ontario and Canada as well. Moving on to product and technology. I'm very pleased to announce another quarter of significant progress. As we have mentioned in the past, we believe that the long-term winners in this industry will have a relentless focus on bringing the best product experience to customers. For mobile sports betting, we have completed our back-end migration in 11 states and have just one state left pending final approval. Being vertically integrated will greatly enhance our ability to continuously drive differentiated products and customer experiences and offer market you need to DraftKings. For example, we're happy to announce that we have launched Same Game Parlays. Same Game Parlays are a thought after feature from our customers that we are now able to offer due to our vertical integration. In addition, we are on track to bring other new features, including new end game markets to our customers by the start of the NFL season. We signed a multi-year support data supplier agreement with Genius Sports, which gives us access to Genius' full portfolio of global sports data and content, including official NFL data and content. The terms of this deal are consistent with our long-term gross margin expectations. For iGaming, we added DK Craps to our mobile Casino suite in New Jersey with Pennsylvania, Michigan, and West Virginia to follow pending approval. The game is a DraftKings-exclusive and built in-house, perhaps it's a challenging game to develop, given the seemingly endless path players can take. And our internal teams were able to deliver an authentic and truly differentiated Craps experience. In addition, we have launched our jackpot technology, which is enabled by our prior acquisition of Blue Ribbon. Over the past quarter, we have taken additional meaningful steps to begin building out our media business. We firmly believe that DraftKings has an exciting opportunity to play in the media space, given our brand recognition and trusted relationship with millions of paying customers across our DFS, OSB and iGaming vertical. We also have tremendous relationships across the industry with sports partners and media entities, as well as newly acquired assets like VSiN and our distribution relationship with Meadowlark. When analyzing the media vertical, we see three critical factors that will lead to our success in both the short and long-term. Media is a logical adjacent vertical for DFS, OSB and iGaming given the clear LTV to cash benefits for our core business. Specifically, we have the potential to acquire DFS, OSB and iGaming customers through our content assets, such as VSiN and distribution relationship such as Meadowlark. We believe we will also be able to improve retention of our existing DFS, OSB and iGaming players as a result for our differentiated media content. Given our well-known brand millions of paying customers, ownership of proprietary content in the form of gaming and DFS data and the VSiN platform, we will have the opportunity to be a unique content provider in the sports and entertainment space. Media and of itself is a great business, which has the potential to diversify our revenue stream through ad sales, content distribution deals and potentially even recurring subscription revenue. If I said to say, we are very excited about the future of our media and content business, and we will continue to update you on this topic in the coming quarters. We are continuing to explore exciting new growth sectors. Some of which we can pursue organically, some inorganically. On July 21, we revealed plans to launch DraftKings Marketplace, a digital collectables ecosystem designed for mainstream accessibility. Draftkings Marketplace offers curated NFT drops for U.S. dollar purchase and support secondary market transaction. Our first NFT drop will be in the near future. And instantaneously millions of customers will have the ability to seamlessly buy and sell digital collectables across sports, entertainment, and culture using their existing DraftKings account. This first drop is enabled by our exclusive sports content distribution relationship with Autograph. It was established exclusive relationships with prominent iconic athletes, such as Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Tony Hawk, Derek Jeter, Naomi Osaka, Tiger Woods and more. We are pursuing this vertical because it fits the criteria we have outlined here in the path. Notably that NFTs offer a logical crossbill opportunity with our existing customers. As a result, this vertical can enhance customer stickiness in LTV as well as the potential for new customer acquisition through affiliation with these iconic athletes fan base. It also has very attractive economics given the large potential revenue opportunity based on transaction fees, modest initial investment and excellent EBITDA margin. We also continue to explore other vectors, including deepening and strengthening our existing product offerings and geographic expansion outside of the U.S. I also want to provide some recent updates on one of our highest ESG priorities, responsible gaming. DraftKings responsible gaming mission is to leverage technology, employee training and evidence-based research to protect consumers. In the second quarter, we announced three ways, we are advancing this critical mission. In May, we made a financial commitment to the International Center for Responsible Gaming's fund to support research on sports wagering. As a result of DraftKings contribution, the ICRG was able to proceed with the competitive request for applications from researchers around the world who were interested in pursuing groundbreaking research. In June, we collaborated with the American Gaming Association to promote the AGA's Have A Game Plan Bet Responsibly public service campaign. DraftKings is committed to publicize the campaign in many of the companies own channels, including at DraftKings' retail gaming properties to promote safer play. This collaboration marks the first time in the industry that the Have A Game Plan campaign will be comprehensively rolled out across a national retail sportsbook footprint. Most recently, we finalized a strategic consulting agreement with the Division on Addiction at Cambridge Health Alliance, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. In coordination with the DraftKings Responsible Gaming team, the Division on Addiction will create an innovative systems-based safer play approach to training employees across the business in responsible gaming. Responsible gaming is an area in which we will continue to work with the industry and invest in as company. We are committed to continually improving and evolving how we can best support our customers, this goal standard tools for proactively identifying intervening and providing guidance to players can set limits effectively, utilize cool off periods and self-exclusion. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our second quarter results and revised expectations for 2021. Thank you, Shaun. So really, we're going to start with \u2013 we've seen recently that while we kind of expected or at least about there might be some slowdown in performance due to the reopening, we're not seeing that. So based on what we're seeing today, I would expect we're going to get very good results going into NFL. NFL is basically like our holiday season. It's when we acquire the most new players and reactivate large portions of the player base. We do have a lower CAC target, as the players that we acquire tend to be a little bit more casual than the ones that we acquire and say, Q2. So we're going to manage that CAC target and we'll dial the investment up or down accordingly based on results, which is really hard to predict. I mean, we always learn a lot the first week going into NFL. And based on what we've seen recently, I would expect strong results, we'll continue and we'll want to invest into it. But it's really hard to say and we'll be monitoring the data on an hourly basis and turning campaigns on and off accordingly. Are you talking about Q3 specifically? I think, we raised a little bit in the back half of the year, but you're right, we aren't necessarily banking on the overperformance we've seen in Q1 and Q2 carrying over. I think that continues to be us being a bit cautious about what this NFL season might look like. Obviously, COVID has been up and down and we could see this swing either way. But based on what we see today, everyone's going to be back in stadiums, gatherings will be back to normal generally in most places. So we're just being a bit cautious given how significant the NFL period is for customer acquisition and activation about what we think will happen in the back half of the year. Also, there's only three weeks of NFL in Q3. So it's not \u2013 it's an interesting period because you activate a lot of players, but a lot of their spending comes in Q4. So the ARPMUP is typically not as high in Q3 as we see in other quarters. So that's something we're also paying attention to. Yes, that's a great question. So we've definitely tested it quite extensively over the last few weeks. We've migrated in all, but one state not one is pending approval. So we feel pretty good, obviously, we want to see how NFL looks from a trading perspective. But we've done pretty rigorous testing throughout the other sports on the calendar, and we feel pretty good about it. We launched Same Game Parlays last week, which was a big feature that our customers have been asking for also typically has a higher margin. So we have not built in any additional revenue or any additional whole percentage based on new features we're launching. We don't sort of building off what you said. We want to test those things and see how they look going into NFL before we would promise any more revenue based on it. But we do think that there's some potential upside in the new features that we'll be launching in the coming weeks and months. Thank you. So on the first question I think that we certainly have seen evidence across other companies in the marketplace that Same Game Parlays have a higher yield. So we could certainly see that we have not built that into any of our forward-looking guidance. So we're not counting on it, but it's something that we're certainly hoping will be the case. And in general, I would say, we're not really trying to maximize whole percentage at this stage. We're on boarding a lot of new customers. It's the early days of the industry. So really, we're focusing on getting people onto the platform, getting them active and there'll be a time and a place where we'll focus more attention on increasing whole percentage. It's just not right now. And then sorry, what was the second question? I don't know \u2013 certainly, we think that as more people try more sports, it'll smooth out a little bit. There are certain sports like soccer, which are very popular among the younger generations, which I think over time will increase. But you're right, the sports themselves are seasonal. So it's very hard for us to control anything when there's popularity difference between different sports. And there are only certain times a year. As hard as we may try, we're not at any time soon going to be able to get more people to bet on basketball or baseball than they do on NFLs, just based on the fan base size. So that's something that I think just will always have to kind of live with on sports, but what we can do is continue to launch other types of products. So, obviously, iGaming has been a good one for us. That's something that people can play year-round. We're cross-selling very effectively onto that product. So while certainly, we see bumps when there's more actives, we do think it's a bit smoother seasonally. We recently announced that we're launching the marketplace. So NFTs, I think will be a year-round thing. There might be some seasonality given the sports focus, but we're also going to branch into NFTs for other things outside of sports. So I think is that that product continues to grow in the coming years, we'll see that help smooth out. So I think really that's the way that we're looking at smoothing out seasonality is just trying to diversify into other products that we can effectively cross-sell our customers into and might have a little bit less seasonal variation. So thanks for the question that regarding ARPMUP, certainly there's some seasonality to it Q3 because it's a high activation quarter, but only a few weeks of NFL to monetize, I think we'll have lower ARPMUP than Q2. But even relatively speaking, meaning, year-over-year and actually, given the sport calendar change really looking at 2019 can be helpful versus Q2 2021. I think that we're cautiously optimistic that we might just have a higher LTV player than we thought. And I think that's probably the biggest driver beyond anything else. We have also improved cross sell rates. So iGaming is helping, but even on the course, sports betting products, I think that it's still looking like ARPMUP was higher than expected again with the caveat that, it's hard to compare anything Q2 versus 2020 Q2. And looking back at 2019, it was a very different time than only a few states that we had. I think, live was sports betting at that point. So actually I think it might've just been New Jersey at that point. Although, it could be wrong on that, there might've been one or two others. Never mind, I'm sorry. It was New Jersey, West Virginia and Indiana at that point. So there were only a few. So it's a little hard to compare, but that's why we've also not changed our CAC targets. We're not counting on higher LTVs, but we're certainly optimistic cautiously that that could be the case. And we're going to be monitoring that in the coming quarters and hopefully, we'll have more data as the sports schedule stabilizes and it's easier to make year-over-year comparisons. And then the second question was sorry, remind me what the second question was? On national ad spend, right? So we're at right now 25% of the population. I do think there's a possibility that some new states will launch either right before during the NFL season Wyoming and Arizona being two that seemed like they're on a good track. And I think others like Louisiana may get in there as well. And if that happens, I still don't think we'll quite be at 33%. But I do think you'll see us start to mix some national advertising in this year to test that. I think it's important that if we're planning on shifting quite a bit, as we get into the mid-30s and 40s level international advertising, that we have some data in this NFL season to look at, to be able to optimize for next year. So you will see us start to test into that this NFL season. Well, I think we're still waiting to see what a year it's potentially people in stadiums and more of an open economy looks like that. The biggest factor, of course, that could change. We also don't know that. So I think there's a lot of moving variables and we're just trying to exercise caution and not getting overly bullish based on results that we've seen. Early on suggesting that the reopening is having no adverse effect on the momentum we've seen. If we get an NFL season under our belt with the economy, generally open around the country and around the states, we have online sports betting and iGaming. I think then we start to feel really good that we're not going to see any adverse impact in that. It's really just truly momentum in the industry and with drafting. I think it is the right way to think about it, because being marketplace having liquidity is important that said we also have exclusive rights that we've secured through our relationship with Autograph to be able to sell an NFTs that are for top athletes like Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Naomi Osaka, Tiger Woods, Derek Jeter, and many others, Tony Hawk, many others. So we feel pretty good that having that exclusivity, no matter how liquid our marketplace is, initially, we will drive a lot of traffic, but over the long-term, I think being a marketplace, it's important to have the highest or close to highest level of liquidity, people are going to go where there's the most buying and selling when they're posting secondary transactions and things like that, which is true of any marketplace really. So I think that is how we're looking at it. We do have a much larger user base than any of the other marketplaces that exist today. So we feel like we're starting from a position of strength. Much like the daily fantasy user base has helped us with we launched online sports betting into other states. I think that having a big database with millions of active customers will really be a leg up for us and it just comes down to how effectively can we cross sell. And I think we feel pretty good about that given our track record of selling other \u2013 cross selling other products, but this is also our first foray into something it's a little bit different. So we're going to have to see how the data shakes out. All right. I think it's a great idea. That's definitely something we've talked about. In order to do, it depends on the event, but most of the time you have to have the rights. So that's something that we'll look into exploring as well and those rights of course costs money. So while, giving it away is one way to look at it. It's actually really the cost of the right that matters, which of course are lower than the cost of the pay-per-view because that's how money is made by companies that traditionally do that. So that's something that we're absolutely looking at amongst other things. We're still very early in developing our media strategy. Our goal is to have much more of it fleshed out by the end of the year and have explored some of those opportunities in the marketplace, such as the one you mentioned to see if we don't \u2013 it could be something that works for us. We do want the media vertical to on its own be a profit generating vertical certainly over the long-term. I think, we have the flexibility to not do that if we wanted to, but as of today, we believe that we can both make a profit directly in the vertical and have the synergistic benefit of being able to acquire and keep retain users using the content that we put out there as well. I think we look at it the same way. It's an LTV to CAC question. We have plenty of daily fantasy customers in Canada, and we don't see really any differences between their spend levels and the customers that we have in the U.S. So I don't really have any reason to believe it's different. The interesting thing about Canada is that most major operators around the world have been in Canada for quite some time. So it's a little bit different than new U.S. states where they're opening up. And in some ways I think we have to focus on taking customers that have already been playing as much as trying to convert new customers, which is why we projected a lower long-term market share for Canada than we have for the U.S. One thing I wanted to \u2013 just on your previous question note as well that occurred to me after I answered. A lot of pay-per-views that distribute through multiple platforms, they actually have in their contracts with the platforms they distribute on that no one can give away for a free, or even under a certain price because it undermines the other platforms. They would say, why would anyone pay to for a pay-per-view on my platform, if they're getting it free elsewhere? Very common in the media industry, there's lots of things like this, MFMs are a very common thing and also restrictions on what you can and can't sell things for very common. So, that's something we would have to work around unless we had exclusive rights to distribute a pay-per-view. Thank you. Hi, Robin. We have not built in any additional revenue expectation from new initiatives. We really don't have enough data, we have no data to base it on. So we haven't assumed any new states. We haven't assumed any new initiatives generating revenue. Those are all things that once we have a little bit more clarity on the state side as to which dates and when might go live, we would be able to update. And then as we get a little bit of data on new initiatives, I think we'd be able to update that. That said, I wouldn't expect new initiatives to generate a huge amount of revenue this year. This will be very early days of us launching them. Obviously, we have very strong conviction and are very excited about the long-term prospects and think that the market that we're entering like NFTs could be really, really large. But it'll take a little time for those new products to ramp. That's a great question. We aren't really able to give any specifics on that contract. But what we will say is that we do not expect any adverse effects to our long-term gross margin projections based on the pricing that we receive. So I think you can kind of read between the lines based on that. But due to confidentiality, we're not able to disclose any details of the contract. Thank you. One of the things that really we've noted, we're excited about with now having migrated to our in-house platform is the ability to drive innovation and things like in-game wagering and other innovative types of bets that previously we had a lot more dependence on our partner can before. So we're really excited about that. And it's been an all consuming thing the migration. As you can imagine, it was a large project, the largest we've ever done from a product and technology perspective. And it's a real testament to the great people on our product and engineering team to be able to have not only done that a little bit ahead of schedule, but also to have continued to launch new things, including our upcoming launch of Marketplace, but also several new states and other sorts of things along the way, including DK Craps and many iGaming games that we released. So really just \u2013 I'm so proud of that team for not only ahead of schedule completing a very smooth migration, but also continuing to innovate. But it is true that it was very all consuming. And so, I think now that that's mostly behind us, we do still have one state left. We're really in a position to start focusing on driving innovation and launching new things. As far as third-parties, much like our iGaming product, we're going to do both. There's just a speed to market aspect of being able to integrate different providers and also at the same time launch things ourselves. And much like what we're doing with iGaming, we'll look at things that either we can't get through third-party providers or economically, it just makes sense for us to bring in-house. And we'll do that over time with the goal being most things are in-house over the long-term. But there's just such a long tail of different types of bets and same thing on iGaming, different types of games that there's always going to be a mix of things that we've completely built on our own and things that we've built either partially or in partnership with third-parties. So I definitely think that there's an opportunity as you noted to expand globally, and that's something that we're looking at doing either inorganically or organically or a combination of the two. But I think within sports betting, the opportunity to maybe branch into other sports that we haven't had as deep of an offering, it could reach different types of people is interesting. And I think something that we're exploring. And then, outside of sports, which we've always \u2013 isn't specific to the migration of course. We definitely feel in the iGaming segment that we do better with people who are sports fans that we can cross sell. And we've been working hard to try to extend our brand and extend our reach into the non-sports fan iGaming audience. And that's something I think we've been getting a bit of traction on, but really need to continue to invest. I think that's probably the biggest opportunity for us now in terms of consumer segments that we're just not penetrating at the moment. Yes. I mentioned this a few moments ago, but we're going to put out a mix of different things that are organically developed and things where we're partnering. And it's going to depend on a variety of factors, such as the opportunity cost of building them in the short-term, the actual cost of using a third-party. In this particular case, it was packaged up with a larger deal. So we felt like it was a good way to get Same Game Parlays into the market really quickly in advance of NFL. And it frees up our engineering time to focus on other things. So that's a lot of how in the short-term we're going to look at it. If there's a good solution, it gets us something as good or better than what our competitors have. And we can free up engineering bandwidth to focus on other things that maybe our competitors don't have. That's going to be the initial focus. And then over time, I think we will take things that prove to be large parts of our offering that we think there's an economic benefit to vertically integrating and focused on those. But in the short-term, it's really about as quickly as possible having the broadest and deepest product offerings, since we think at this stage of getting maximum activation and retention of consumers is the most important thing. I believe so. I know we were using, because we just announced the deal, I think yesterday and we had the Same Game Parlays we launched earlier this week. I know we were using another provider. I'm not sure if we fully switched over to Betgenius yet, but that's the plan. I think, we've always felt, and I think have said that it's going to be sports first and then iGaming. I think that that's just the kind of natural evolution of things that states are going to be more comfortable in many cases going sports first. And then, once they get used to the tax revenues coming in, see more and more states doing iGaming, we think more and more states are comfortable with iGaming as well. Some states such as Connecticut this year chose to do them all at once, Michigan did the same thing, Pennsylvania did the same thing. So we may see that here and there. And then we may see states like West Virginia, for example, that it's sports betting first and then a year or two later, did iGaming. So I think it will be a mix, but we certainly expect the momentum to be first with sports betting legalization, and then iGaming to be something that follows that. I think that in terms of your question about how to get them comfortable, I think there's really two things. One is just most states don't want to be the guinea pigs. So more and more that they see other states particularly it tends to be regional in their geographic areas doing it. And the more that they feel like, everything's going well and the playbook on how to regulate it is clear, the more I think, comfort they'll get. I think also seeing how much tax revenue can be generated and back to the kind of regional point, if there's bleed from states like, right neighboring them because they have iGaming and a state that's chosen to do sports betting does not. I think that could be a reason that they move faster. But it's really just time. And we're going to continue to push the message out there that this is something that can be done in a safe manner. We have great guardrails in place and are continuing to invest in getting better at responsible gaming and there's real meaningful tax revenue that can be generated by adding that product. Great good question. I mean, I think iGaming is actually and hopefully it foreshadows OSB a great example of where we've invested in launching our own games and enhancing our own products. And for example, we mentioned we had launched our own in-house Craps game last quarter. And I think that that's really helped generate momentum and gain market share. And we've been really consumed with the migration. And also of course, there are many things we couldn't do on the product front before migrating. So I think now that we're finally in a position where we control our own destiny there and we're able to innovate, I hope to be able to do many of the same things that we've done in the last several quarters on the iGaming front product-wise. And we hope that that helps us gain more share and retain and acquire customers more effectively. Thank you. Thanks. Social is off to a great start. It's very early. I mean, we launched an MVP only a few months ago, and so we still feel like we have a very lengthy and exciting roadmap there. But the early results have been very strong. We've seen great adoption. We monitor daily and monthly active users on the social features, separate from daily and monthly active users on the product \u2013 on the other products. And we've seen that continually increasing since we've launched. And I think we'll learn a lot in NFL season based on how many of our customers that we acquire and active we're able to get adopting those social features. So very excited about it. I think it's too early to share any metrics. But we're starting to flesh out what metrics we might be comfortable sharing on the coming \u2013 in the coming quarters. On the NFT side, I definitely feel like it'll be a great cross-sell product. We'll know when we get the data, but we've done enough market research on our customers to know that quite a few of them are interested in it and there's good overlap with our current customer base. And I do agree that it could also potentially have some upside on the customer acquisition side, just like we do with every product in our portfolio, which are the best products to most efficiently bring people onto the platform. And then once they're on the platform, we try to cross sell them across everything we do. And I think there could be some upside on that front for sure, but we're going to have to wait and see, and really we'll do whatever the data suggests. But it's something that we've talked about it's a potential upside. And in general, I think just having the broadest product portfolio gives us the most options for how we can acquire different pockets of customers. So not only does it increase LTV, but also has positive effect on our tax efficiency over time to just have the broadest and deepest product portfolio possible. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We appreciate your questions and look forward to continuing our conversations with you. Our performance in 2021 continues to be very strong and we're excited for what the rest of the year and beyond holds for us. DraftKings is well-positioned with $2.6 billion in cash to capitalize on legislative advancements in several states, complete the migration to our own in-house set engine, expand and initiate relationships with important organizations and advanced new product technology and content initiatives. I hope you all stay safe and well and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in November."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we will be discussing our results on a combined company pro forma basis to improve comparability as if we owned our B2B business starting on January 1, 2020 rather than on April 23, 2020. We are pleased to announce that we generated $298 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a 297% increase versus Q2 2020 revenue of $75 million. Our B2C business generated $270 million for the quarter, representing a 383% increase versus prior year. We continued to drive strong growth in players and player retention as measured through MUP, as well as player engagement and monetization as measured through ARPMUP. B2C monthly unique payers in the quarter increased 281% year-over-year to $1.1 million. The increase reflects strong unique payer retention and acquisition across DFS, OSB and iGaming. The expansion of our OSB and iGaming product offerings into new states and the lack of traditional sports for much of the second quarter of 2020. Q2 MUPs represented typical seasonality with Q2 being a slower sports quarter than Q1. Average revenue per monthly unique payer or ARPMUP was $80 in Q2 representing a 26% increase versus the same period in 2020. Our ARPMUP was positively impacted by the return to our more normal sports schedule, which resulted in stronger and more consistent customer engagement across our DFS and sportsbook product offering. The launch of our sportsbook and iGaming product offerings in additional states also positively impacted our product mix. We also continue to drive engagement across our B2C product offerings, as we cross sell our users into more products. Clearly, a portion of the tremendous year-over-year growth of our B2C business is due to the sports cancellations and postponements that occurred in Q2 2020 due to COVID-19. Second quarter 2021 revenue also exceeded our expectations, not only due to the over performance of our core business as a result of continued strong customer acquisition, retention and monetization, but also due to higher than forecast OSB hold percentage, which contributed about $20 million to our outperformance in the quarter. Year-to-date in 2021 higher than forecasts OSB whole percentage has contributed approximately $40 million to our outperformance. B2B revenue was $27 million for the quarter up 44% versus prior year, which was negatively impacted by COVID. We generated $139 million of gross profit dollars on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the entire business in the quarter representing a 223% increase versus the prior year period. Gross margin rate on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the business was 47% in the quarter. As we have noted in the past, our gross margin rate is impacted by a mix shift out of our more mature and thus higher margin DFS product offering and into a higher growth rate and lower margin OSB in iGaming product offerings. In addition, gross margin rate within a period is impacted by promotional intensity, typically most intense when a new state launches and at the beginning of a major sports season, as we aim to acquire customers. Gross margin rates for OSB will be positively impacted by the conversion to our own bet engine, which is now complete in all states, but one pending approval, though we will continue to pay our third-party bet engine provider through the end of Q3 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $95 million as we invested in external marketing and in our product technology and G&A function. Our sales and marketing expenses were $157 million, which included our external marketing. External marketing was higher than prior year due to there being a full sports calendar in Q2 2021 versus a COVID impacted calendar in Q2 2020, as well as being live in 12 total states versus eight in Q2 2020. We are continuing to see very attractive CAC opportunities that support this investment in marketing. Our general and administrative and product and technology costs on an adjusted EBITDA basis for $41 million and $36 million respectively, as we continue to invest to achieve scale in our back office functions such as customer service, finance and accounting, legal and human resources, as well as adding to our technology team. A majority of the combined $17 million of year-over-year growth in these two expense lines was from compensation. Much of the head count growth was in our customer experience department, where we are focused on providing best in industry customer experience. And it's largely a variable cost impacted by our rapid growth in month. In the quarter, we expense $226 million in items that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA, but are included in GAAP operating income, including $172 million for stock-based compensation and $54 million for amortization of acquired intangibles, depreciation and other amortization and other non-recurring expenses. The expense associated with our stock-based compensation awards is based on a defined service period for our time-based brand and a probability based model for performance based and long-term incentive plans brand. Our Board grants equity awards to retain, motivate, and incentivize key employees, align their interests with them as shareholders and tie a significant amount of their compensation to working together to produce outstanding company performance. Moving onto our balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We are very well capitalized to execute our multi-year plan and address our key priorities of customer acquisition, entering new states as they legalize, continuing to lead the market on product innovation and exploring opportunistic and accretive M&A. Looking at the rest of 2021 on our first quarter earnings call in May, we increased our 2021 revenue guidance to $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion from $900 million to $1 billion. Given our continued strong performance in 2021 in underlying acquisition, retention and monetization of player, we are increasing our guidance to $1.21 billion to $1.29 billion of revenue for 2021, which equates to year-over-year growth of 88% to 100%. We are raising the midpoint of our 2021 revenue guidance, which results and implied second half growth of more than 40% based on our strong results in Q2 and Q3 to date, as well as our demonstrated and continued plan for strong user engagement and efficient customer acquisition. We expect both MUP and ARPMUP to grow in 2021. With MUPs increasing at a higher rate than ARPMUP. We also assume that all professional and college sports calendars that have been announced come to fruition, and that we continue to operate in the states in which we are live today. These states collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population for mobile sports betting and 10% of the U.S. population for iGaming. The Wyoming, Arizona, Maryland, Louisiana, Connecticut, and New York have authorized mobile sports wagering. We did not know the exact date, these states will launch nor in the case of New York, the results of the selection process. As such, we are not including them in our revenue guidance. The underlying strength in our business is responsible for the revenue guidance increase.  Regarding our 2021 quarterly revenue cadence, we have a high conviction plan in place for the start of the NFL season and have incorporated sensitivities on a variety of internal and external factors, the largest being sport outcome variability. Based on this analysis, we expect Q3 to be roughly 17% of the midpoint of our new 2021 revenue guidance, which is similar in dollar terms to the guidance we shared with you on May 7, due to ongoing excellent customer retention, the efficacy of our customer acquisition investments and new product features. We expect Q4 to account for approximately 34% of our revenue for the year based on the midpoint of our revised guidance range. While we are not providing guidance for 2021 adjusted EBITDA, our investment in sales and marketing as the key input, we always use facts to inform our decision on where, how, and how much to invest in external marketing. Our results since the economy fully reopened confirmed that our CAC continue to be very attractive. Based on the attractive LTV to CAC ratio opportunities we're seeing, we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to take advantage of these circumstances. From a quarterly perspective, we plan to deploy and optimize, but overall similar promotional and marketing campaign, as we did in Q3 of 2020, including more activity in the later part of the quarter, which will disproportionately affect adjusted EBITDA in Q3. In the fourth quarter, we expect a slight improvement compared to adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, as we monetize our Q3 promotional and marketing investments and benefit from higher seasonal revenues. As a result, we expect our adjusted EBITDA loss in the second half of 2021 to be approximately 60% of our total annual loss for 2021. Before wrapping up, I want to touch on state level unit economics. As you know, our business model is predicated on states turning profitable after two to three years due to underlying LTV to CAC dynamics. At this point, I want to affirm our outlook for our most mature state New Jersey, which we said would generate $210 million in net revenue and $65 million in contribution profit at our March investor day. Our other states are on a similar trajectory, and I look forward to providing you updates on those in the near future. As a reminder, our marketing spend is highly flexible and can be reduced or paused altogether, if the sports calendar shifts or if LTV to CAC opportunities become less attractive. Our spend is also impacted by the launch of new states. That concludes our remarks. And we will now open the line for questions."

During the call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed today with the SEC and in our earnings presentation, which is available on our Web site at investors.draftkings.com. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open up the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, everyone. To start today's call, I want to touch on a few recent examples of how DraftKings, our employees and our customers are giving back to our communities. In March, DraftKings celebrated International Women's Day, our newest global company holiday and launched a free-to-play pool celebrating female athletes. About 100,000 people participated in each entry and raised money for U.S. and global organization supporting and empowering female leaders and entrepreneurs.  We also recently announced the appointment of Gisele B\u00fcndchen, environmental activist and philanthropist as a special advisor to me and our Board of Directors for ESG initiatives. Gisele is a global icon who has utilized the platform she established in fashion entertainment to lead and advocate for vital environmental causes and social causes. The strategic counsel and unique global perspective that Gisele brings to the Board will be indispensable. She is already making an impact as we have collaborated to set a goal of planting 1 million trees by Earth Day 2022.  We launched several opportunities for customers to directly support the effort, including through charity daily fantasy sports contests and free-to-play pools. And in coordination with the Arbor Day Foundation, DraftKings has pledged to plant the first 100,000 trees in several U.S. states. May is Military Appreciation Month in the U.S. During this month, we also recognize Military Spouse Day and Memorial Day. DraftKings is proud to continue to support service members, veterans and their families. We are launching our second Tech for Heroes class of 2021, providing veterans and military spouses with free high tech skills and training to support their post service career goals.  DraftKings customers will also have the opportunity to show their support through charity DFS contests to benefit our Tech for Heroes initiatives. All of these initiatives are part of our overarching CSR program, DraftKings Serves, which is a catalyst to facilitate meaningful relationships between our employees, our customers and the causes they feel passionate about in order to create a better world for everyone.  At DraftKings, we're committed to creating inclusive pathways for people to build, create, imagine and innovate. Through DraftKings Serves, we're advancing that mission with a focus on service, equity, responsibility, vitality, entrepreneurship and sports. I am very proud of these initiatives and our ability to encourage our global community of customers to really make an impact where it is needed.  On today's call, we will cover the following topics; our first quarter results and recent accomplishments, our recent state launches and legalization trends, our product and technology investments as well as the migration to our in-house bet engine. And before turning it over to Jason Park, I will talk about the acquisitions we have completed. DraftKings is off to an outstanding start in 2021. Revenue for the first quarter increased 175% year-over-year to 312 million on a pro forma basis. MUPs grew 114% and ARPMUP grew 48%. These results reflect continued over performance of our core business due to strong customer acquisition and retention as well as the successful launches of mobile sports betting and iGaming in Michigan and mobile sports betting in Virginia.  Our first quarter results also benefited from external factors that once again broke our way, including better than expected online sports betting whole percentage and the extension of an executive order through April 3 that allowed for mobile registration in Illinois, which was our largest online sports betting state and it turns the handle on the first quarter.  Please note that the executive order was not renewed following April 3, which may negatively affect the growth rate of the overall Illinois sports betting market, though we are relatively well positioned given the large number of mobile registrants we have already captured.  In the first quarter, we continue to make progress with the migration to our own in-house bet engine and we are on track to complete the migration by the end of the third quarter of 2021. We expanded our relationships with the NFL and PGA Tour. As an official sports betting partner of the NFL, DraftKings will have the right to integrate relevant sports betting content directly into NFL media properties, including NFL.com and the NFL app. We will also be able to enhance the fan experience with NFL highlights and footage.  We also renewed our rights as the official and exclusive daily fantasy sports partner of the NFL. As part of the continued DFS agreement, we will have exclusive rights to NFL IP and marks with plans to collaborate with the league on a variety of content and product offerings that fans can engage with on the DraftKings DFS.  Following the legalization of sports betting and fantasy sports in Arizona, we expanded our existing commercial relationship with the PGA Tour to provide market access for retail and mobile sports betting in Arizona, pending necessary approvals. We also plan to operate with the PGA Tour premium retail sports book at TPC Scottsdale, home of the Waste Management Phoenix Open pending necessary approvals.  We secured partnerships with the UFC and WWE to reach broader fan bases across sports. DraftKings is UFC\u2019s first sports book and daily fantasy partner in the United States and Canada. Combat sports and UFC in particular have grown into a high demand category. While DraftKings and UFC have previously collaborated on specific events, we are proud to become official partners and launch impactful integrations.  We became an official gaming partner of WWE. Our collaboration with WWE centers on our free-to-play pools product and launched with an inaugural free-to-play pools at WrestleMania in April that had over 100,000 combined entries. In March, we raised approximately $1.1 billion in net proceeds by selling 0% coupon convertible notes that will mature in 2028. We will not see any dilution until our stock is at $135.50 per share. This capital raises another example of our proactive approach to ensuring we are well financed to pursue our growth objectives.  In terms of acquisitions, we announced and closed two; Vegas Sports Information Network, Inc. or VSiN, which is a multiplatform broadcast and content company that has delivered trusted sports betting news, analysis and data to U.S. sports bettors since 2017. And Blue Ribbon Software, which is a leading global jackpot and gamification company that provides platform-agnostic, real-time gamification tools that allow for fully customizable jackpot promotions.  I also want to provide a few highlights from three significant sporting events in 2021; the Super Bowl, The Masters and March Madness. For the Super Bowl, DFS entry fees grew 66% and paid active users grew 60% compared to the Super Bowl in 2020. Also for the Super Bowl, New Jersey OSB handle grew 70% and active users grew 44% compared to Super Bowl in 2020.  For The Masters, DFS entry fees grew 21% though there were only five months separating this year's Masters and last year's event in November 2020. Also for The Masters, New Jersey handle grew 30% and active users grew 9% compared to the event held just five months earlier in November of 2020.  For March Madness, New Jersey handle grew 181% in 2021 versus 2019 and active users grew 80%. We are raising our revenue outlook for 2021 due to our expectations for continued growth in the outperformance of our core business. Jason Park will provide more details in a few minutes. Turning to new U.S. states for DraftKings and legalization trends. In the first quarter, we launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in Michigan and we launched mobile sports betting in Virginia. When comparing our mobile sports betting handle in Michigan from our launch on January 22 through March 31, 2021 on a per capita basis with New Jersey mobile sports betting for the same time period in 2019, Michigan outperformed New Jersey by 3% in OSB and 291% in iGaming.  As a reminder, by this time in 2019, we were already live in New Jersey for five months prior to this period, including the entire NFL season, which is a very important time for customer acquisitions.  The same is true for our mobile sports betting handle per capita in Virginia from January 24 to March 31, 2021. The state outperformed New Jersey by 7% for the same time period in 2019. As with Michigan, Virginia had just launched while New Jersey was already live for five months, including the entire NFL season.  When considered with the information we presented at our Investor Day in March, these results in non-New Jersey states further confirmed our view that New Jersey is a reasonable and perhaps conservative proxy for the performance of other states in the U.S. Also, by generating $95 million in only a second full month, the Michigan iGaming market is on an annual run rate of over $1.1 billion in gross revenue, a mark that New Jersey did not hit until December 2020, seven years after its launch.  In Michigan, our cross-selling efforts are also working well with 56% of sports book players in the state also engaging with our iGaming product offering from launch through March 31. It is now just about three years since PASPA was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. 26 jurisdictions representing 44% of the population have legalized sports betting and 18 jurisdictions representing 35% of the population have legalized mobile sports betting, 15 of which are currently live representing 27% of the population. DraftKings is live with online sports betting in 12 states that collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population. Six states representing approximately 11% of the U.S. population have legalized some form of iGaming. DraftKings is live in four states, representing approximately 10% of the U.S. population. We believe the outlook for further legalization is very promising.  In 2021, more than 20 state legislatures have introduced legislation to legalize online sports betting, five state legislators have introduced legislation to expand their existing sports wagering framework, and one state legislature introduced legislation to legalize sports betting limited to retail locations. In addition, four states have introduced iGaming legislation and three states have introduced online poker legislation.  Three of the states that introduced legislation to legalize mobile sports betting this year; Wyoming, Arizona and New York have already enacted mobile sports wagering laws. Maryland has made significant progress in the mobile and retail sports wagering bill passed by the legislature and now pending action from the governor. The three states that have enacted laws this year represent 8% of the U.S. population and bring the percentage of population with legalized mobile sports betting to 35%.  We also continue to believe that Canada represents a very meaningful opportunity for DraftKings. Most progress to date has been made in Ontario, as the government's 2020 provincial budget has been adopted and amends existing laws to remove the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation statutory monopoly on Internet gaming in the province. We look forward to further progress in Ontario and in Canada as a whole.  I'd now like to comment on our progress with the integration and migration to our in-house bet engine and discuss our new product and content initiatives. I continue to be pleased with the progress we are making with our organizational integration and the migration to our proprietary in-house, back-end technology for trading.  We have been testing our in-house bet engine on an ongoing basis. The migration remains on track to be complete by the end of the third quarter in 2021. As we have previously discussed, being vertically integrated is important and will help with innovation, speed to market, site stability and availability. We will also realize gross margin synergies associated with the migration starting in the fourth quarter of this year. In terms of the product innovation, we announced an agreement with DISH Network to bring DraftKings Sportsbook and daily fantasy experiences directly to DISH\u2019s customers nationwide. The service launched on March 3 with the first of its kind patent pending DraftKings app integration on the DISH TV Hopper platform. Since launching, more than 600,000 unique devices have used the DraftKings app on a DISH box.  The agreement also provided for the subsequent launch of SLING TV new exclusive sports betting information channels in collaboration with DraftKings. SLING TV subscribers and SLING free users can now view real-time game scores and betting odds on the DraftKings Basketball, Baseball and Hockey channels. SLING TV will continue to bring the DraftKings sports betting experience to customers with more sports and expanded offerings in the future. We continue to build differentiating iGaming content to increase engagement with our customers. In April, we added Spanish 21, a DraftKings-built unique casino game to our product suite. Spanish 21 was available immediately to customers in New Jersey and we plan to expand it to Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, pending regulatory approval. Spanish 21 has always been a popular land-based casino game. We are currently the only operator offering Spanish 21 and are proud to bring the blackjack variant exclusively to our casino products. We are also very excited to announce the upcoming launch of a first-of-its-kind social functionality to both our DFS and Sportsbook app.  The launch of DraftKings Social, which is expected to roll out over the next few weeks, marks an industry first innovation to create an integrated social community across sports betting and daily fantasy sports, as fans can interact with each other within the shared peer-to-peer environment.  With daily fantasy and sports betting already being predominantly online, this launch both enhances the digital engagement possibilities of these products while also leaning further into the inherently social spirit of sports fandom and competition. The product is particularly unique because it amplifies our ability to create an interconnected ecosystem across our consumer products.  In addition to functionality, like shared login and wallets that we already offer, features like universal profiles, friends list, commenting, and loyalty flash rewards will also allow DraftKings to connect users across products in a way that no other company is currently doing.  Turning to M&A. Our acquisition of VSiN allows us to benefit from the explosion and appetite for sports betting content as more states legalize, and to participate in media content creation for this rapidly growing adjacency to the sports betting market.  VSiN not only provides additional revenue streams through subscriptions and advertising, but also has a highly engaged and growing audience that may provide CAC advantages and help with engagement with sports betting customers. We welcome Brian Musburger and his team to the DraftKings family.  We broadened our sports entertainment footprint by completing a content distribution, monetization and sponsorship agreement with Meadowlark Media. As part of the deal, Meadowlark Media and DraftKings will distribute The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz and the Le Batard & Friends Network across a wide range of audio, TV, digital and social channels.  Additionally, the network of shows will prominently feature DraftKings odds, betting trends and general sports book and daily fantasy information. We continue to be big believers in the intersection of content and gaming as the consumption of each benefits the other.  With the hiring of Brian Angiolet as our Chief Media Officer, we are accelerating our plans to establish ourselves as both a product provider and resource for fans. As our media presence grows with the acquisition of VSiN, partnership with Meadowlark Media and integration agreements with Turner Sports and ESPN, Brian's creative ideas will expand the possibilities for DraftKings content. We look forward to sharing more in the coming quarters.  We also completed the acquisition of Blue Ribbon Software. DraftKings will now be able to enhance the customer experience by integrating Blue Ribbon\u2019s unique jackpot functionality, including personalized promotions and rewards tailored to the individual customer or jackpots across DraftKings various product offerings.  We expect to launch our jackpot technology in the second half of 2021 in our iGaming product. We are strengthening our capabilities to rapidly integrate these acquisitions while also staying focused on winning in this rapidly growing industry and migrating to our in-house bet engine.  In conclusion, we are off to a great start in 2021. We performed exceptionally well in the first quarter, saw legislative advancements in several states, continued to make progress with the migration to our own in-house bet engine, expanded and initiated relationships with important organizations and advanced new product technology and content initiatives.  I will now turn the call over to DraftKings CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our first quarter results and revised expectations for 2021.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we will be discussing our results on a combined company pro forma basis to improve comparability as if we owned our B2B business starting on January 1, 2020 rather than on April 23, 2020.  We are pleased to announce that we generated 312 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a 175% increase versus Q1 2020 revenue of 113 million. A portion of this amazing growth is due to the sports postponements that occurred in Q1 2020 due to COVID-19.  Our B2C business generated 281 million for the quarter, representing a 217% increase versus prior year. B2C monthly unique payers in the quarter increased 114% year-over-year to 1.5 million. The increase reflects strong unique payer retention and acquisition across VFS, OSB and iGaming as well as the lack of traditional sports in the last three weeks of March 2020.  Average revenue per monthly unique payer, or ARPMUP, was $61 in Q1 representing a 48% increase versus the same period in 2020. Our ARPMUP was positively impacted by increased engagement with our iGaming and online sports book product offerings and our excellent cross-selling capabilities. Our B2B business generated $31 million in the quarter, up 26% versus prior year due to the positive impact of FX as well as last March being impacted by COVID.  First quarter revenue exceeded our expectations due to a number of factors, including the extension of an executive order that allowed for continued mobile registration in Illinois through Q1, higher than forecast OSB hold percentage, over performance in our core business as a result of continued strong customer acquisitions, retention and monetization and strong launches in Michigan and Virginia.  We generated $155 million of gross profit dollars on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the entire business in the quarter, representing a 135% increase versus the prior year period. Gross margin rate on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the business declined as expected to 50% in the quarter.  As we have noted in the past, our gross margin rate has been impacted and will continue to be impacted by a mix shift out of our more mature and thus higher margin VFS product offerings and into higher growth rates and lower margin OSB in iGaming product offerings.  In addition, gross margin rate within a period is impacted by promotional intensity, typically most intense when a new state launches and at the beginning of a major sports season, as we aim to acquire customers. Gross margin rates will be positively impacted by the conversion to our own bet engine which will be complete by the end of Q3 as well as several gross margin rate improvement initiatives.  Our sales and marketing expenses were $220 million, which include our external marketing. External marketing was higher than prior year due to being live in 12 total states versus seven in Q1 2020, including the launch of mobile sports betting and iGaming in Michigan and mobile sports betting in Virginia which occurred in the quarter. The governor of Illinois also extended an executive order that allowed for mobile registration in Illinois through April 3, which allowed us to continue to acquire during that period. Additionally, we continued to see accretive LTV to CAC opportunities, which allowed us to invest deeper in marketing in part due to the stay-at-home nature of COVID.  Our general and administrative and product and technology costs on an adjusted EBITDA basis were 41 million and 34 million, respectively, as we continue to invest to achieve scale in our back office functions such as finance and accounting, legal and human resources as well as adding to our technology team.  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative 139 million as we rolled out our new state playbook in multiple jurisdictions and continued to invest in our product technology and G&A functions.  In the quarter, we expensed $186 million in items that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA but are included in GAAP operating income, notably 152 million for stock-based compensation and 34 million for amortization of acquired intangibles, depreciation and other amortization, as well as transaction-related expenses. Our stock-based compensation expense reflects accruals related to equity awards based on our anticipated revenue performance in 2021.  Moving on to our balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet following our issuance of 0% coupon convertible notes that will mature in 2028. We raised approximately 1.1 billion in net proceeds from this offering.  We are well capitalized to execute our multiyear plan and address our key priorities of taking advantage of this unique time for customer acquisitions, entering new states as they legalize, continuing to lead the market on product innovation, and exploring opportunistic and accretive M&A. Looking at the rest of 2021, on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we provided a range for 2021 revenue of 900 million to 1 billion. Given our strong start to 2021 and underlying acquisition, retention and monetization of players, we are increasing our guidance to 1.05 billion to 1.15 billion of revenue for 2021, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79%, and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance.  The 16% increase in the midpoint of our 2021 revenue guidance reflects strong performance in Q1 which has continued in Q2, continued strong user activation due to our marketing spend, well executed launches of mobile sports betting in Michigan and Virginia and iGaming in Michigan, and a modest impact of VSiN and Blue Ribbon on 2021 revenue.  We assume that all professional and college sports calendars that have been announced come to fruition and that we continue to operate in states in which we are live today. These states collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population for mobile sports betting and 10% of the U.S. population for iGaming. Though Wyoming, Arizona and New York have legalized, we do not know the exact date these states will launch and are not including them in our revenue guidance.  In addition, for the past several quarters, our financial results have benefited from the stay-at-home nature of COVID and the unique sports calendar in the second half of 2020. We expect both MUPs and ARPMUPs to grow in 2021, with MUPs increasing at a higher rate than ARPMUPs.  Regarding our 2021 quarterly revenue cadence, all things being equal, which means no new states launch beyond Michigan and Virginia, we expect Q1 to represent 28% of full year 2021 revenue, Q2 to be slightly more than 20%, and Q3 to be slightly below 20% of full year revenue. We currently expect the fourth quarter to account for slightly more than 30% of our revenue for the year.  While we are not providing guidance for 2021 adjusted EBITDA, sales and marketing expense is a key input. As discussed, sales and marketing in older vintage states will begin to moderate as we continue to invest in accretive LTV to CAC opportunities.  2020 and 2021 vintage states will have increased sales and marketing as we lap partial years for 2020 launches, execute our new state playbook in Michigan and Virginia well into the second quarter and invest in customer acquisition in Iowa, given the launch of mobile registration on January 1.  We have also announced new relationships, including our expanded agreement to become an official sports betting partner of the NFL. The net effect is that we continue to expect to spend significantly more on sales and marketing in 2021 compared to 2020. The significant number of customers we are acquiring also results in an increase in variable costs, such as customer service.  From a quarterly perspective, we continue to expect our Q3 adjusted EBITDA loss to be deepest and meaningfully wider than last year\u2019s Q3 loss as we ramp up external marketing substantially for the start of the NFL season, especially since we will have three states in their first full NFL season.  We expect our Q2 loss to be somewhat better than Q1, though still heavily impacted by investments associated with our launches in Michigan and Virginia. In the fourth quarter, we expect a slightly narrower loss than the second quarter as we benefit from higher seasonal revenue. As a reminder, our marketing spend is impacted by the launch of new states. Our spend is also highly flexible and can be reduced or paused altogether if the sports calendar shifts. That concludes our remarks. And we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nJason Robins: Good morning.\nStephen Grambling: In the release, you highlighted the launch of social aspects on the app. Can you just help us maybe think longer term about maybe social and what do you envision as a potential opportunity? Does this include effectively user-led content? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Thanks, Stephen. Great question. So we're very excited about some of the new social features we'll be releasing. We have a dedicated team on that, led by a guy named Jordan Mendell, and we're very excited that we'll be able to really be an innovator in this space. I think the idea is to, yes, allow some user-generated content, but obviously there will be moderation. And then the bigger picture is just to allow people to connect specifically around the experience they're having on DraftKings. Obviously, a lot of social platforms out there. This isn't attempting to substitute for what the Facebooks and Twitters and Instagrams the world are doing. It's really more meant to enhance the actual experience on DraftKings. And a lot of requests we get from people, how do I better see what my friends are betting on and what they're playing? How do I interact if I like a bet my friend makes and let them know? How do I understand what my friends are playing so I can play contest against them on our private leagues product? So lots of requests we've gotten and we're trying to do our best to facilitate those interactions in a way that makes users stickier, but more importantly improves the customer experience.\nStephen Grambling: That's great. Thanks. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So we're seeing a big media push by all the sports books in the industry. So, Jason, just a bigger picture question for you. How do you see media transforming Draft? Do you kind of see yourselves eventually becoming more of sports entertainment product? And just how should we view how you look at the media opportunity over the next two to three years?\nJason Robins: It's a great question, Jed. Really, it starts with two important principles. One, there's a ton of synergy between media and content and what our core products offer. We all know this. Clearly, there's a demand that gets driven for content by our products, and then in turn content drives further demand on the gaming product. So tremendous synergy there. Secondly, we have a good track record of being able to launch new product lines and monetize our customer base as well as utilize them to acquire a broader customer base. We've done that with multiple products now. So we think between our data science capabilities and other analytics that we've employed, we're going to be really effective at targeting the right content to the right customers at the right time, and also using what we see consumption on content looking like to be able to better target gaming offers. So that's really the crux of the strategy is to be able to take advantage of those synergies and to be able to add new revenue streams and new sources of user acquisition engagement.\nJed Kelly: And then as a follow up, I guess with the VSiN acquisition, do you plan to create your own channel or put it on more streaming services? I know it's on NESN and a couple of other services. But how do you view VSiN into that overall strategy?\nJason Robins: Well, VSiN provides a really important capability, creating content around sports betting, which is obviously a very core area that our audience focuses on. They do have a channel currently. We're exploring broader distribution and we'll also be creating content for a variety of other services, so lots of plans with them. They have an incredibly talented team and we're really lucky and fortunate to have them on our side now and look forward to collaborating with them to create great content for customers.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Chaiken with Credit Suisse.\nBen Chaiken: Hi. How's it going? Just to follow up on Vegas Sports Network. Is there a plan to work some of that functionality into the sports betting platform itself? So whether it's news, analysis, help making picks, or is it -- or should we think about it as being kind of a separate entity that helps drive traffic?\nJason Robins: I think it will be a little bit of both. I do think that the nice thing about VSiN is that we get a capability. So that capability can be utilized, as you noted, in multiple ways. Some of it can be utilized directly within the gaming experience in order to enhance that. Other ways can be utilized, as you noted, are to drive customer acquisition engagement, adoption of new products through external media and other channels that we'll distribute through. So we're going to use it in both ways. And really the important thing we look at is we got a capability to create great content in an area that's very meaningful and important to our customers and our target customers.\nBen Chaiken: Got it. Is there any like hesitation with adding more functionality to the OSB platform or is it more iGaming or is it more just kind of like on the comp I guess?\nJason Robins: Well, we always test everything. So you never know. I'm routinely surprised at things that I thought would perform in a certain way, good or bad, and don't. And that's why we always let the data do the talking. So we'll test adding different things. And if we find that it's enhancing the customer experience and not distracting people, then we'll add more. And if not, then we'll pare back. And really, it will be an evolution based on what we're seeing in the data.\nBen Chaiken: Thanks. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: Thank you. So just on the revenue, first quarter revenue was obviously really strong. With your fourth quarter earnings, you suggested first quarter revenues would be in the low 20s percent. And now you're saying 28%. Are you more like tempered on the rest of the year because the results you're seeing in the second quarter so far, is it seasonality? Can you just unlock it a little bit more?\nJason Robins: Sure. So I think it really starts with Q1 was an absolutely amazing quarter for us. And some of the reasons why, certainly, there were strong performance in the business and that should carry through for the rest of the year. But there were other reasons such as higher hold than we typically get. That's just random fluctuations in sporting outcomes, really can't count on that for the rest of the year. And also, of course, the Illinois executive order, which ran through Q1 but in the first few days of Q2 was not renewed. Illinois, as we noted, had become our largest state for sports betting handle. And while we think we're continuing to be really well positioned there in terms of market share, I don't expect the overall market to grow as substantially as it could have otherwise in absence of new legislation or a renewal of that executive order. So that's another example of something that we know won't continue through the rest of the year, and that's skewing a little bit how much Q1 will be as a percentage of the overall year. And then just in general, when you have a great quarter like that, we think it's prudent not to assume every single quarter will be a blowout. So, we're taking a cautious approach and saying that we think that other quarters will be more in line with what a typical quarter might look like. Obviously, if some things break our way or just if the underlying business continues to perform as strongly as it has been, then we might see some upside there.\nThomas Allen: Okay. Just a quick one, what was the whole benefit?\nJason Robins: Sorry, the question was on the whole?\nThomas Allen: Yes. How much was it?\nJason Robins: I don't think we've -- no, we haven't shared exactly what those numbers will. But we can consider sharing some more detail there. What we have said is that there is definitely a higher than average hold rate due to random fluctuations in sports outcomes and I think that that's something that generally we've seen evens out over the course of the year, but can definitely month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter sometimes have some lumpiness.\nThomas Allen: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord.\nMichael Graham: Yes. Thanks and impressive results. I wanted to ask about MUP growth. Typically, Q1 would be seasonally a little bit down sequentially and you were able to grow and you have a few things under the hood there between new activations and retention engagement and potentially threading in more iGaming acquisitions. And so I just wanted to ask like if you could deconstruct the MUP performance a little bit? And as a follow on, when you're out there in marketing, especially in digital channels, do you -- can you just make a comment on how crowded some of those channels are from OSB and iGaming competitors, or are you more competing against other types of players or just any color you can provide on that environment would be great?\nJason Robins: Thanks, Mike. So first on the MUPs question. Certainly, we saw a much stronger activation and customer acquisition in Q1, so both had pretty significant contribution to the MUPs increase. I think that what we're seeing is there's just a lot of momentum in the industry right now, and I think that we are finding that our marketing is performing just as it did towards the back half of last year, really at record levels. And our response is incredibly high. Our caps continue to be low despite the fact that we've ramped up our spend and we're just getting excellent return on our marketing, so that's helping to drive a lot of activation of new users as well. So really those are the main drivers. And then -- sorry, what was the second question?\nMichael Graham: Just wanted to ask if you could comment on the marketing environment when you're out there acquiring players in digital channels, like how intense is the competition from your competitors.\nJason Robins: Well, what's interesting on digital channels is, yes, there is certainly competition within our core market. But also a lot of where we were competing previously for impressions was with mobile games, and those games I think have been hurt more so than maybe we would be by the IDFA changes. So we've actually seen some softening in the digital markets due to some of the traditional mobile games companies pulling back a bit. And that's created a favorable environment for us. I wouldn't say it's tremendously favorable. It's really kind of more similar to what it looked like before. But to answer your question directly, we're not really seeing a hyper competitive environment right now relative to anything we've seen before. It looks pretty normal and I think it's kind of an offset of, yes, we are seeing better performance for companies like DraftKings, but it's also offset by maybe some pullback in the traditional mobile gaming companies.\nMichael Graham: Okay. Thanks, Jason.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hi, guys. Thanks and good morning. Appreciating the fact that you guys don't want to disclose the whole benefit in the period. If we can kind of just break down the old guidance midpoint and kind of that low 20s range, it would apply you can kind of beat the implied guidance within the guidance by about $100 million in a quarter. Any chance you guys would be willing to maybe bucket where that outperformance came, if it's iCasino relative to OSB relative to DFS? I'm assuming the two former categories are the lion's share. But maybe even just if you could split out kind of a delta of the upside in relative to that guidance between kind of OSB and iCasino in the period given the very strong start of Michigan?\nJason Robins: Thanks, Carlo. I appreciate the nice words. We are not disclosing any break out of iGaming versus OSB revenue right now. Given some of the trends that have occurred recently with Michigan being so strong on the iGaming side, we certainly saw some benefit from that. I think that really exceeded our expectations. And as we noted in the earnings call, the growth of -- or the revenue per capita in Michigan on the iGaming side greatly outperformed New Jersey in a similar time period in its first year. And OSB did too, but not by nearly as much. So that was certainly a factor. We mentioned the hold rate that drove OSB revenue a little bit higher than what we would normally have seen based on the betting volumes. So we're not breaking it out, but I would say -- I think it's fair to say that really all products across the board, including DFS, we had record numbers for the last several years for DFS if you look at some of the stats that we disclosed from Super Bowl and March Madness and otherwise. We haven't seen growth in that product at these levels since 2015. So really pleased with how everything's performing across the board and everything contributed to the beat.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you. And then if I could, just one follow-up. As it pertains to the integration of the SBTech stuff at the end of the 3Q, will that basically for the 4Q be your functioning back-end for every state, or does it kind of go state by state and you take it slowly?\nJason Robins: Well, we are going state by state, but we're saying by the end of Q3, we will be fully complete with every state. So to answer your question, in fourth quarter, we will be on our own proprietary platform in every state. And between now and then, we will take it on a state-by-state basis. This is, of course, assuming we get all the necessary regulatory approvals. That's obviously a process and that's part of why we are going state by state. But assuming we get all the approvals from just the pure product and tech standpoint, we feel like we're well on track for end of Q3 and maybe even a little bit earlier.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. And then guys, I'm sorry, if you could just take one more? Any commentary around New York and the strategy there given kind of the cloudy regulation as it currently stands?\nJason Robins: Well, first of all, really exciting that New York has moved forward the mobile sports betting legislation. I know for years there's been speculation about it. And it's really great to see that it got done. And not only got done, but has strong support from the legislature, from the governor's office, and really want to thank the legislature and Governor Cuomo for moving that bill through the budget. As far as our strategy, we're going to wait and see when the RFP comes out what it looks like. And we're going to put our best foot forward. And I think we feel, like I said, very excited about the opportunity in New York and we're looking forward to participating in the process. And hopefully, it will be a good outcome.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you very much, guys.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company.\nBernie McTernan: You mentioned the 600,000 unique devices with DISH. I was just wondering how the customer is using this product. Do you think it's going to be an important part of the customer experience long term or more niche? Just because watching TV, everyone already has a second screen next to them with access to the app? And then within that, is the MVPD the more advantageous position to be able to execute this strategy relative to a cable network or is it the other way around?\nJason Robins: I think that there are different ways you can execute the strategy that device makers provide potentially another way in addition to the ones you named. And I think the cable networks are a little more challenging. It would have to be something that we're more directly connected to the device or to the network I would think. The first part of your question, I think really what we're trying to do is to create something that makes the convenience of being able to consume whenever you're watching, sports on the screen as well as playing the games and checking your bets and all that as easy as possible. I think people will have a mix of things they use. Part of the sort of proliferation of devices all around us has been people don't typically just do things one way or another. Even as I think about my own behavior, sometimes I use my phone to turn my TV on because it's connected. Sometimes I just grab the remote and it just sort of whatever feels convenient at the moment. So I think you'll see some people exclusively using that or primarily using that. I think you'll see some people not using it at all. And I think you'll see some people going back and forth. But what we're going to do is just keep looking at the data, keep optimizing the customer experience and listen to what our users are saying and what makes their experience more entertaining and more convenient.\nBernie McTernan: Thanks, Jason.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Good morning. I know we're still a couple of quarters away, but I wondered if there were any testing or any learnings or any interesting surprises one way or the other around that in advance? Thank you.\nJason Robins: Sorry, around what?\nDavid Katz: The SBTech go live, which is still a couple of quarters away.\nJason Robins: Yes. So we have begun the process. We've done a tremendous amount of testing. We test everything internally. And then, of course, as we go state by state, we'll get more and more data. And so far what we're seeing is very encouraging. There's been really only kind of minor things around the edges that we've had to clean up. Otherwise, our internal testing has been really strong at predicting things and we've been able to get everything in order. So, so far, so good. It is still early. And to answer your question, yes, as we get closer to the full migration, we'll have more and more states there migrated over and we'll have more and more data to look at and be able to get a sense of how things are going. But from what we're seeing so far, everything's going great.\nDavid Katz: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen.\nStephen Glagola: Hi. Thanks for the question. I just want to touch base on Illinois a little bit more. It seems like you had a Q1 with the number one market share in terms of handle. With remote registration ending in early April, have you seen any impact in your market share so far? And do you expect to maintain that share throughout the year until it goes back to remote registration in early 2022?\nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question. I think really hard to say for sure but given I don't expect there to be nearly the volume of sign-ups. And I use Iowa, for example, as a comparison and Iowa, where for the first 18 months after going live, there was no mobile registration. And the first thing I think was like five days of January this year when mobile registration was turned on, we exceeded the entire previous year in terms of registering. So I think the volume that comes in when there is mobile registration is just so significant compared to when there's not that. My suspicion would be that market shares sort of stabilize until that returns and hopefully when it returns if it returns. And as you noted, we've been number one in handle I think since August, every month in Illinois so we feel like we're in a great position. Obviously disappointing that we won't be able to take mobile registrants or at least for some time, but I think if we -- if that were to be the case as it is, then I think we could be in a stronger position and feel very good about where we are from a market share standpoint in that state.\nStephen Glagola: All right. Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on your comments about online sports betting and media content converging. So there is a situation developing. I'm sure you're very aware of that between Flutter and Fox Broadcast Corporation, which could lead to all kinds of structural outcomes in the market. So with FanDuel becoming a stand-alone publicly traded company in the U.S., maybe some combinations with PokerStars, Fox Bet and so on. So I was wondering if you are -- if you could share your thoughts with us how that would impact your strategy and your market position?\nJason Robins: Thank you. So, I know there's a lot of rumor and speculation about that right now. One, we don't really have any insight so it's hard for me to really have any opinion but even if I did, we don't really think that what others are doing in terms of corporate structure and how that all plays out, really has much of anything to do with our strategy. We're going to continue to pursue the strategy that we've set out that we believe will position us to have the best long-term value and continue to be able to consistently meet or exceed the expectations that we set. And I think being able to focus internally on driving those types of results has been part of what's driven our previous strong performance. So we're going to continue down that path. And there will be a lot of activity in the market. I think when you have an exciting industry with so much potential, tens of billions of dollars, maybe more potential, you're going to see a lot of different moves by competitors. Obviously, we pay attention to them but it doesn't really change what we're doing.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Stauff with Susquehanna.\nJoe Stauff: Good morning. Jason, I'm wondering if you could comment or on overall engagement maybe thus far in the quarter, second quarter -- April, May -- early May, and the reason I ask obviously is that I realize online sports betting is seasonally softer just given the number of sporting events. And just wondering kind of where engagement is or how it changes, maybe commenting specifically on iCasino engagement in terms of just how that may change?\nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question. You are right that there is seasonality to the sporting calendar. Typically back half of the year is always greater. It's been a little bit disruptive whatever that typical seasonality has been by all the calendar shifts. So it's a little bit of a unique year for sure. And I think as a result of some of that, there's actually quite a bit on the slate for Q2. NBA and NHL regular seasons are ending in the next week or two and that will begin the playoffs. This year, the NBA and NHL playoffs are going to run into July, which I don't think has ever happened before. So that will create some additional content that hasn't been there in previous years. Obviously, baseball is off to a great start. The PGA has two majors in Q2; the PGA Championship in May and the U.S. Open in June. Two majors also on the tennis front with the French Open in May going into early June and then Wimbledon is obviously starting towards the end of the quarter. And then there are some exciting things going on in other sports as well. UFC, who we recently signed a partnership with, has two big fights coming up; one on May 15th and one on June 12th, UFC 262 and 263, respectively. And then this year, there's a lot going on, on the soccer side. Euro Cup is happening. It starts toward the middle of June and obviously run into Q3. Champion's League, Premier League, so lots of exciting stuff on the sports calendar. I think more so maybe this year than the prior years, you're going to get a full quarter because of the season -- the shifting, excuse me, in the sports calendars. And we're going to have to see how that all plays out. Much like last year, we're in a bit of unchartered territory with how the sports are overlapping and obviously a little tough to predict how NBA does in July when -- NBA Finals do I should say in July when that's never happened before. So it will be fun to see and we're just excited. There's a lot of great content out there to provide our customers with.\nJoe Stauff: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask about some of the marketing efficiency in the quarter. It looked like things were a lot more efficient on sort of a per user basis sequentially from the fourth quarter and from what we saw throughout last year. And I'm just wondering, is that a direct product of efficiency gains or is there some seasonality attached to that as we just think about the balance of 2021?\nJason Robins: There's always seasonality to marketing performance. Typically, though, what that results in is us just dialing up or down where we're investing based on the ROI we're seeing. I think Q1 was very similar to Q3 and Q4 where we spent more than we thought and had lower tax than we thought. So it was almost like we couldn't spend enough to hit our cap targets. And I think that efficiency was consistent, but a lot of what you see is that the customers that were acquired in Q3 and Q4 that remained active into Q1 boosted the MUPs numbers. And obviously we continue to add more but more exciting to me is the retention that we're seeing of the customers we acquired in the back half of last year. I think that was the largest driver of what we saw on the MUP front. And as far as future quarters and seasonality go, I think you'll see typical seasonal patterns. But as I mentioned, there is still this wildcard of this shift in the sports calendar. So I think it will be a bit different this year than in previous years. Typically, for example, we've seen good activity during the NBA and NHL playoffs. Having that overlap with baseball should provide better than I think typically what we've seen activity in the July timeframe and late June timeframe. And then I think also we'll have to see in the back half of the year what the leagues do, the NBA and NHL in particular, in terms of when they start their new seasons. Do they try to go back to the typical schedule in early Q4 or do they go with the late December, January schedule that they went with this past year? So I think that will also drive some activity. And then, of course, the NFL, assuming that goes according to plan, which right now we see no reason to believe it won't then that\u2019s obviously going to be a big driver of activity as well.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nJason Robins: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Even with your recent acquisitions of VSiN and Blue Ribbon, which are sub $100 million in the quarter, following your convertible rates, you're still sitting with a ton of cash at the end of the quarter. Based on your projections for 2021 and how you know the business should ramp to become more profitable, how are you thinking about the best use of this cash, whether it be bigger acquisitions, more partnerships, or even considering something like a share repurchase, given the sell off? Thank you.\nJason Robins: That's a great question. I think right now, we're actively exploring multiple opportunities, some of which you mentioned and I think that really we're going to try to do whatever returns best on that capital. That's when you take in the capital even when we get the note at 0%, not a high bar there, but still we have our own internal thresholds for what we want to get return on -- what level of return we want to get on the capital we deploy and we're very disciplined about that. So I think really it's going to come down to us just rigorously evaluating different opportunities. And if we see great uses of capital that drive really strong returns, then we'll do it. If not, we'll be patient and deploy the capital as those things emerge.\nChad Beynon: Thanks. And then separately, I just wanted to revisit Canada. I understand that there's a federal bill that's kind of hung up right now. There's a separate one in Ontario and it seems like from a parental standpoint, they're extremely interested. If the federal bill doesn't pass, is there a path for you guys to be in the Ontario market? I guess from a limited basis, it won't be a comprehensive product but it still could have some type of a parlay, or would you wait for a federal bill to pass for you guys to enter that market? Thank you.\nJason Robins: It's a great question. I think, as you noted, parlays are still possible under current federal law. Obviously, it'd be great to get single event betting were the federal law to change. But parlays are still, obviously, very popular and I think perhaps more importantly, iGaming will be allowable in Canada, or at least -- excuse me, in Ontario. And that does not have any impact from federal law. So I think those two things, both parlay sports betting and iGaming are products we intend to launch regardless of what happens. We're not waiting. And assuming the federal law does change, then we'll also offer single event wagering as well.\nChad Beynon: I appreciate it. Nice results.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Adam with Loop Capital Markets.\nDaniel Adam: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, when you think about the long-term opportunity for DraftKings, does it make sense at some point to start thinking about the global TAM instead of just North America? Just for context, there is a daily fantasy company in India that reported 100 million users in March. So when I think about your 1.5 million MUPs, it would seem that the international opportunity for DraftKings could be massive which no one is really talking about right now. Is that something that factors into your long-term vision?\nJason Robins: Absolutely. It's a great question. So as you noted, there's a huge global opportunity, and as excited as we are in the U.S. and as much as we believe the U.S. will be the largest in the world, the rest of the world will certainly be larger combined. And our ambitions are to be a global company. So we think there's a lot of exciting opportunity out there. We're obviously closely following that daily fantasy company you mentioned and also following regulatory developments in markets around the world. Lots of things are opening up, not just the U.S. So I think that provides a huge runway for our growth and it's something we haven't talked as much about because we have been so focused on the U.S. But I think you're very smart to point out that there's a huge opportunity there that can keep our growth rolling for many years to come.\nDaniel Adam: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital.\nRyan Sigdahl: Good morning, guys. Just curious, you mentioned Michigan and Virginia, they're ramping faster than New Jersey, really strong GGR per capita. But other states haven't ramped quite as well; Indiana, Pennsylvania, Iowa, West Virginia, et cetera. So I guess what gives you confidence that Michigan and Virginia are the better proxies for future states versus the other ones I mentioned? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question. What we showed in our Investor Day is that New Jersey is kind of right around the middle of the pack. So there will be states that grow faster, they will be states that grow slower. But I think what's really interesting with both Michigan and Virginia is it kind of further validates this notion that New Jersey is not some outlier that's just bigger than everything else. And we didn't have those two states on our Investor Day. Even without those two, New Jersey was already slightly below the median for the other states. So this just kind of brings that up even a little bit more and widens that gap more and gives us further confidence that New Jersey is at worst a good proxy and at best maybe a conservative proxy when you're trying to size the rest of the states. And then there\u2019s a few examples where it's hard to compare apples-to-apples. You mentioned Iowa, for example. Iowa's tough to compare because Iowa for the first 18 months had no mobile registration. So, clearly, that would make it get off to a slower start. And I think once we saw mobile registration kick in earlier this year in Iowa, we started to see really strong ramp there. So, I think it will definitely depend. Pennsylvania is another interesting one. Pennsylvania, we have not invested as deeply in from a customer acquisition standpoint due to the tax rates there. It's just not as profitable as the market for us. So that's another one where I think perhaps in a different set up, it might have been the place that we could invest more. But really if you look at it, like I said from the macro standpoint, New Jersey is right around the middle of the pack and that was just a question we used to get a lot in the earlier days when everybody's using New Jersey as a proxy for what the rest of the U.S. could look like and I think the data that we've seen emerge further validates that it's a pretty good proxy and maybe even a conservative one.\nRyan Sigdahl: Thanks. Good luck, guys.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks.\nJason Robins: Thank you. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We really appreciate your questions and look forward to continuing our conversations with you. We had a very strong start to 2021 and continue to be excited about the future.  DraftKings is well positioned with $2.8 billion in cash to enter new states as soon as practicable, to drive continued product innovation, to acquire customers, and to explore opportunistic M&A. I hope you all stay safe and well and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in August.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. To start today's call, I want to touch on a few recent examples of how DraftKings, our employees and our customers are giving back to our communities. In March, DraftKings celebrated International Women's Day, our newest global company holiday and launched a free-to-play pool celebrating female athletes. About 100,000 people participated in each entry and raised money for U.S. and global organization supporting and empowering female leaders and entrepreneurs.  We also recently announced the appointment of Gisele Bu\u0308ndchen, environmental activist and philanthropist as a special advisor to me and our Board of Directors for ESG initiatives. Gisele is a global icon who has utilized the platform she established in fashion entertainment to lead and advocate for vital environmental causes and social causes. The strategic counsel and unique global perspective that Gisele brings to the Board will be indispensable. She is already making an impact as we have collaborated to set a goal of planting 1 million trees by Earth Day 2022.  We launched several opportunities for customers to directly support the effort, including through charity daily fantasy sports contests and free-to-play pools. And in coordination with the Arbor Day Foundation, DraftKings has pledged to plant the first 100,000 trees in several U.S. states. May is Military Appreciation Month in the U.S. During this month, we also recognize Military Spouse Day and Memorial Day. DraftKings is proud to continue to support service members, veterans and their families. We are launching our second Tech for Heroes class of 2021, providing veterans and military spouses with free high tech skills and training to support their post service career goals.  DraftKings customers will also have the opportunity to show their support through charity DFS contests to benefit our Tech for Heroes initiatives. All of these initiatives are part of our overarching CSR program, DraftKings Serves, which is a catalyst to facilitate meaningful relationships between our employees, our customers and the causes they feel passionate about in order to create a better world for everyone.  At DraftKings, we're committed to creating inclusive pathways for people to build, create, imagine and innovate. Through DraftKings Serves, we're advancing that mission with a focus on service, equity, responsibility, vitality, entrepreneurship and sports. I am very proud of these initiatives and our ability to encourage our global community of customers to really make an impact where it is needed.  On today's call, we will cover the following topics; our first quarter results and recent accomplishments, our recent state launches and legalization trends, our product and technology investments as well as the migration to our in-house bet engine. And before turning it over to Jason Park, I will talk about the acquisitions we have completed. DraftKings is off to an outstanding start in 2021. Revenue for the first quarter increased 175% year-over-year to 312 million on a pro forma basis. MUPs grew 114% and ARPMUP grew 48%. These results reflect continued over performance of our core business due to strong customer acquisition and retention as well as the successful launches of mobile sports betting and iGaming in Michigan and mobile sports betting in Virginia.  Our first quarter results also benefited from external factors that once again broke our way, including better than expected online sports betting whole percentage and the extension of an executive order through April 3 that allowed for mobile registration in Illinois, which was our largest online sports betting state and it turns the handle on the first quarter.  Please note that the executive order was not renewed following April 3, which may negatively affect the growth rate of the overall Illinois sports betting market, though we are relatively well positioned given the large number of mobile registrants we have already captured.  In the first quarter, we continue to make progress with the migration to our own in-house bet engine and we are on track to complete the migration by the end of the third quarter of 2021. We expanded our relationships with the NFL and PGA Tour. As an official sports betting partner of the NFL, DraftKings will have the right to integrate relevant sports betting content directly into NFL media properties, including NFL.com and the NFL app. We will also be able to enhance the fan experience with NFL highlights and footage.  We also renewed our rights as the official and exclusive daily fantasy sports partner of the NFL. As part of the continued DFS agreement, we will have exclusive rights to NFL IP and marks with plans to collaborate with the league on a variety of content and product offerings that fans can engage with on the DraftKings DFS.  Following the legalization of sports betting and fantasy sports in Arizona, we expanded our existing commercial relationship with the PGA Tour to provide market access for retail and mobile sports betting in Arizona, pending necessary approvals. We also plan to operate with the PGA Tour premium retail sports book at TPC Scottsdale, home of the Waste Management Phoenix Open pending necessary approvals.  We secured partnerships with the UFC and WWE to reach broader fan bases across sports. DraftKings is UFC's first sports book and daily fantasy partner in the United States and Canada. Combat sports and UFC in particular have grown into a high demand category. While DraftKings and UFC have previously collaborated on specific events, we are proud to become official partners and launch impactful integrations.  We became an official gaming partner of WWE. Our collaboration with WWE centers on our free-to-play pools product and launched with an inaugural free-to-play pools at WrestleMania in April that had over 100,000 combined entries. In March, we raised approximately $1.1 billion in net proceeds by selling 0% coupon convertible notes that will mature in 2028. We will not see any dilution until our stock is at $135.50 per share. This capital raises another example of our proactive approach to ensuring we are well financed to pursue our growth objectives.  In terms of acquisitions, we announced and closed two; Vegas Sports Information Network, Inc. or VSiN, which is a multiplatform broadcast and content company that has delivered trusted sports betting news, analysis and data to U.S. sports bettors since 2017. And Blue Ribbon Software, which is a leading global jackpot and gamification company that provides platform-agnostic, real-time gamification tools that allow for fully customizable jackpot promotions.  I also want to provide a few highlights from three significant sporting events in 2021; the Super Bowl, The Masters and March Madness. For the Super Bowl, DFS entry fees grew 66% and paid active users grew 60% compared to the Super Bowl in 2020. Also for the Super Bowl, New Jersey OSB handle grew 70% and active users grew 44% compared to Super Bowl in 2020.  For The Masters, DFS entry fees grew 21% though there were only five months separating this year's Masters and last year's event in November 2020. Also for The Masters, New Jersey handle grew 30% and active users grew 9% compared to the event held just five months earlier in November of 2020.  For March Madness, New Jersey handle grew 181% in 2021 versus 2019 and active users grew 80%. We are raising our revenue outlook for 2021 due to our expectations for continued growth in the outperformance of our core business. Jason Park will provide more details in a few minutes. Turning to new U.S. states for DraftKings and legalization trends. In the first quarter, we launched mobile sports betting and iGaming in Michigan and we launched mobile sports betting in Virginia. When comparing our mobile sports betting handle in Michigan from our launch on January 22 through March 31, 2021 on a per capita basis with New Jersey mobile sports betting for the same time period in 2019, Michigan outperformed New Jersey by 3% in OSB and 291% in iGaming.  As a reminder, by this time in 2019, we were already live in New Jersey for five months prior to this period, including the entire NFL season, which is a very important time for customer acquisitions.  The same is true for our mobile sports betting handle per capita in Virginia from January 24 to March 31, 2021. The state outperformed New Jersey by 7% for the same time period in 2019. As with Michigan, Virginia had just launched while New Jersey was already live for five months, including the entire NFL season.  When considered with the information we presented at our Investor Day in March, these results in non-New Jersey states further confirmed our view that New Jersey is a reasonable and perhaps conservative proxy for the performance of other states in the U.S. Also, by generating $95 million in only a second full month, the Michigan iGaming market is on an annual run rate of over $1.1 billion in gross revenue, a mark that New Jersey did not hit until December 2020, seven years after its launch.  In Michigan, our cross-selling efforts are also working well with 56% of sports book players in the state also engaging with our iGaming product offering from launch through March 31. It is now just about three years since PASPA was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. 26 jurisdictions representing 44% of the population have legalized sports betting and 18 jurisdictions representing 35% of the population have legalized mobile sports betting, 15 of which are currently live representing 27% of the population. DraftKings is live with online sports betting in 12 states that collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population. Six states representing approximately 11% of the U.S. population have legalized some form of iGaming. DraftKings is live in four states, representing approximately 10% of the U.S. population. We believe the outlook for further legalization is very promising.  In 2021, more than 20 state legislatures have introduced legislation to legalize online sports betting, five state legislators have introduced legislation to expand their existing sports wagering framework, and one state legislature introduced legislation to legalize sports betting limited to retail locations. In addition, four states have introduced iGaming legislation and three states have introduced online poker legislation.  Three of the states that introduced legislation to legalize mobile sports betting this year; Wyoming, Arizona and New York have already enacted mobile sports wagering laws. Maryland has made significant progress in the mobile and retail sports wagering bill passed by the legislature and now pending action from the governor. The three states that have enacted laws this year represent 8% of the U.S. population and bring the percentage of population with legalized mobile sports betting to 35%.  We also continue to believe that Canada represents a very meaningful opportunity for DraftKings. Most progress to date has been made in Ontario, as the government's 2020 provincial budget has been adopted and amends existing laws to remove the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation statutory monopoly on Internet gaming in the province. We look forward to further progress in Ontario and in Canada as a whole.  I'd now like to comment on our progress with the integration and migration to our in-house bet engine and discuss our new product and content initiatives. I continue to be pleased with the progress we are making with our organizational integration and the migration to our proprietary in-house, back-end technology for trading.  We have been testing our in-house bet engine on an ongoing basis. The migration remains on track to be complete by the end of the third quarter in 2021. As we have previously discussed, being vertically integrated is important and will help with innovation, speed to market, site stability and availability. We will also realize gross margin synergies associated with the migration starting in the fourth quarter of this year. In terms of the product innovation, we announced an agreement with DISH Network to bring DraftKings Sportsbook and daily fantasy experiences directly to DISH's customers nationwide. The service launched on March 3 with the first of its kind patent pending DraftKings app integration on the DISH TV Hopper platform. Since launching, more than 600,000 unique devices have used the DraftKings app on a DISH box.  The agreement also provided for the subsequent launch of SLING TV new exclusive sports betting information channels in collaboration with DraftKings. SLING TV subscribers and SLING free users can now view real-time game scores and betting odds on the DraftKings Basketball, Baseball and Hockey channels. SLING TV will continue to bring the DraftKings sports betting experience to customers with more sports and expanded offerings in the future. We continue to build differentiating iGaming content to increase engagement with our customers. In April, we added Spanish 21, a DraftKings-built unique casino game to our product suite. Spanish 21 was available immediately to customers in New Jersey and we plan to expand it to Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, pending regulatory approval. Spanish 21 has always been a popular land-based casino game. We are currently the only operator offering Spanish 21 and are proud to bring the blackjack variant exclusively to our casino products. We are also very excited to announce the upcoming launch of a first-of-its-kind social functionality to both our DFS and Sportsbook app.  The launch of DraftKings Social, which is expected to roll out over the next few weeks, marks an industry first innovation to create an integrated social community across sports betting and daily fantasy sports, as fans can interact with each other within the shared peer-to-peer environment.  With daily fantasy and sports betting already being predominantly online, this launch both enhances the digital engagement possibilities of these products while also leaning further into the inherently social spirit of sports fandom and competition. The product is particularly unique because it amplifies our ability to create an interconnected ecosystem across our consumer products.  In addition to functionality, like shared login and wallets that we already offer, features like universal profiles, friends list, commenting, and loyalty flash rewards will also allow DraftKings to connect users across products in a way that no other company is currently doing.  Turning to M&A. Our acquisition of VSiN allows us to benefit from the explosion and appetite for sports betting content as more states legalize, and to participate in media content creation for this rapidly growing adjacency to the sports betting market.  VSiN not only provides additional revenue streams through subscriptions and advertising, but also has a highly engaged and growing audience that may provide CAC advantages and help with engagement with sports betting customers. We welcome Brian Musburger and his team to the DraftKings family.  We broadened our sports entertainment footprint by completing a content distribution, monetization and sponsorship agreement with Meadowlark Media. As part of the deal, Meadowlark Media and DraftKings will distribute The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz and the Le Batard & Friends Network across a wide range of audio, TV, digital and social channels.  Additionally, the network of shows will prominently feature DraftKings odds, betting trends and general sports book and daily fantasy information. We continue to be big believers in the intersection of content and gaming as the consumption of each benefits the other.  With the hiring of Brian Angiolet as our Chief Media Officer, we are accelerating our plans to establish ourselves as both a product provider and resource for fans. As our media presence grows with the acquisition of VSiN, partnership with Meadowlark Media and integration agreements with Turner Sports and ESPN, Brian's creative ideas will expand the possibilities for DraftKings content. We look forward to sharing more in the coming quarters.  We also completed the acquisition of Blue Ribbon Software. DraftKings will now be able to enhance the customer experience by integrating Blue Ribbon's unique jackpot functionality, including personalized promotions and rewards tailored to the individual customer or jackpots across DraftKings various product offerings.  We expect to launch our jackpot technology in the second half of 2021 in our iGaming product. We are strengthening our capabilities to rapidly integrate these acquisitions while also staying focused on winning in this rapidly growing industry and migrating to our in-house bet engine.  In conclusion, we are off to a great start in 2021. We performed exceptionally well in the first quarter, saw legislative advancements in several states, continued to make progress with the migration to our own in-house bet engine, expanded and initiated relationships with important organizations and advanced new product technology and content initiatives.  I will now turn the call over to DraftKings CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our first quarter results and revised expectations for 2021. Good morning. Thanks, Stephen. Great question. So we're very excited about some of the new social features we'll be releasing. We have a dedicated team on that, led by a guy named Jordan Mendell, and we're very excited that we'll be able to really be an innovator in this space. I think the idea is to, yes, allow some user-generated content, but obviously there will be moderation. And then the bigger picture is just to allow people to connect specifically around the experience they're having on DraftKings. Obviously, a lot of social platforms out there. This isn't attempting to substitute for what the Facebooks and Twitters and Instagrams the world are doing. It's really more meant to enhance the actual experience on DraftKings. And a lot of requests we get from people, how do I better see what my friends are betting on and what they're playing? How do I interact if I like a bet my friend makes and let them know? How do I understand what my friends are playing so I can play contest against them on our private leagues product? So lots of requests we've gotten and we're trying to do our best to facilitate those interactions in a way that makes users stickier, but more importantly improves the customer experience. It's a great question, Jed. Really, it starts with two important principles. One, there's a ton of synergy between media and content and what our core products offer. We all know this. Clearly, there's a demand that gets driven for content by our products, and then in turn content drives further demand on the gaming product. So tremendous synergy there. Secondly, we have a good track record of being able to launch new product lines and monetize our customer base as well as utilize them to acquire a broader customer base. We've done that with multiple products now. So we think between our data science capabilities and other analytics that we've employed, we're going to be really effective at targeting the right content to the right customers at the right time, and also using what we see consumption on content looking like to be able to better target gaming offers. So that's really the crux of the strategy is to be able to take advantage of those synergies and to be able to add new revenue streams and new sources of user acquisition engagement. Well, VSiN provides a really important capability, creating content around sports betting, which is obviously a very core area that our audience focuses on. They do have a channel currently. We're exploring broader distribution and we'll also be creating content for a variety of other services, so lots of plans with them. They have an incredibly talented team and we're really lucky and fortunate to have them on our side now and look forward to collaborating with them to create great content for customers. I think it will be a little bit of both. I do think that the nice thing about VSiN is that we get a capability. So that capability can be utilized, as you noted, in multiple ways. Some of it can be utilized directly within the gaming experience in order to enhance that. Other ways can be utilized, as you noted, are to drive customer acquisition engagement, adoption of new products through external media and other channels that we'll distribute through. So we're going to use it in both ways. And really the important thing we look at is we got a capability to create great content in an area that's very meaningful and important to our customers and our target customers. Well, we always test everything. So you never know. I'm routinely surprised at things that I thought would perform in a certain way, good or bad, and don't. And that's why we always let the data do the talking. So we'll test adding different things. And if we find that it's enhancing the customer experience and not distracting people, then we'll add more. And if not, then we'll pare back. And really, it will be an evolution based on what we're seeing in the data. Sure. So I think it really starts with Q1 was an absolutely amazing quarter for us. And some of the reasons why, certainly, there were strong performance in the business and that should carry through for the rest of the year. But there were other reasons such as higher hold than we typically get. That's just random fluctuations in sporting outcomes, really can't count on that for the rest of the year. And also, of course, the Illinois executive order, which ran through Q1 but in the first few days of Q2 was not renewed. Illinois, as we noted, had become our largest state for sports betting handle. And while we think we're continuing to be really well positioned there in terms of market share, I don't expect the overall market to grow as substantially as it could have otherwise in absence of new legislation or a renewal of that executive order. So that's another example of something that we know won't continue through the rest of the year, and that's skewing a little bit how much Q1 will be as a percentage of the overall year. And then just in general, when you have a great quarter like that, we think it's prudent not to assume every single quarter will be a blowout. So, we're taking a cautious approach and saying that we think that other quarters will be more in line with what a typical quarter might look like. Obviously, if some things break our way or just if the underlying business continues to perform as strongly as it has been, then we might see some upside there. Sorry, the question was on the whole? I don't think we've -- no, we haven't shared exactly what those numbers will. But we can consider sharing some more detail there. What we have said is that there is definitely a higher than average hold rate due to random fluctuations in sports outcomes and I think that that's something that generally we've seen evens out over the course of the year, but can definitely month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter sometimes have some lumpiness. Thanks, Mike. So first on the MUPs question. Certainly, we saw a much stronger activation and customer acquisition in Q1, so both had pretty significant contribution to the MUPs increase. I think that what we're seeing is there's just a lot of momentum in the industry right now, and I think that we are finding that our marketing is performing just as it did towards the back half of last year, really at record levels. And our response is incredibly high. Our caps continue to be low despite the fact that we've ramped up our spend and we're just getting excellent return on our marketing, so that's helping to drive a lot of activation of new users as well. So really those are the main drivers. And then -- sorry, what was the second question? Well, what's interesting on digital channels is, yes, there is certainly competition within our core market. But also a lot of where we were competing previously for impressions was with mobile games, and those games I think have been hurt more so than maybe we would be by the IDFA changes. So we've actually seen some softening in the digital markets due to some of the traditional mobile games companies pulling back a bit. And that's created a favorable environment for us. I wouldn't say it's tremendously favorable. It's really kind of more similar to what it looked like before. But to answer your question directly, we're not really seeing a hyper competitive environment right now relative to anything we've seen before. It looks pretty normal and I think it's kind of an offset of, yes, we are seeing better performance for companies like DraftKings, but it's also offset by maybe some pullback in the traditional mobile gaming companies. Thank you. Thanks, Carlo. I appreciate the nice words. We are not disclosing any break out of iGaming versus OSB revenue right now. Given some of the trends that have occurred recently with Michigan being so strong on the iGaming side, we certainly saw some benefit from that. I think that really exceeded our expectations. And as we noted in the earnings call, the growth of -- or the revenue per capita in Michigan on the iGaming side greatly outperformed New Jersey in a similar time period in its first year. And OSB did too, but not by nearly as much. So that was certainly a factor. We mentioned the hold rate that drove OSB revenue a little bit higher than what we would normally have seen based on the betting volumes. So we're not breaking it out, but I would say -- I think it's fair to say that really all products across the board, including DFS, we had record numbers for the last several years for DFS if you look at some of the stats that we disclosed from Super Bowl and March Madness and otherwise. We haven't seen growth in that product at these levels since 2015. So really pleased with how everything's performing across the board and everything contributed to the beat. Well, we are going state by state, but we're saying by the end of Q3, we will be fully complete with every state. So to answer your question, in fourth quarter, we will be on our own proprietary platform in every state. And between now and then, we will take it on a state-by-state basis. This is, of course, assuming we get all the necessary regulatory approvals. That's obviously a process and that's part of why we are going state by state. But assuming we get all the approvals from just the pure product and tech standpoint, we feel like we're well on track for end of Q3 and maybe even a little bit earlier. Well, first of all, really exciting that New York has moved forward the mobile sports betting legislation. I know for years there's been speculation about it. And it's really great to see that it got done. And not only got done, but has strong support from the legislature, from the governor's office, and really want to thank the legislature and Governor Cuomo for moving that bill through the budget. As far as our strategy, we're going to wait and see when the RFP comes out what it looks like. And we're going to put our best foot forward. And I think we feel, like I said, very excited about the opportunity in New York and we're looking forward to participating in the process. And hopefully, it will be a good outcome. Thank you. I think that there are different ways you can execute the strategy that device makers provide potentially another way in addition to the ones you named. And I think the cable networks are a little more challenging. It would have to be something that we're more directly connected to the device or to the network I would think. The first part of your question, I think really what we're trying to do is to create something that makes the convenience of being able to consume whenever you're watching, sports on the screen as well as playing the games and checking your bets and all that as easy as possible. I think people will have a mix of things they use. Part of the sort of proliferation of devices all around us has been people don't typically just do things one way or another. Even as I think about my own behavior, sometimes I use my phone to turn my TV on because it's connected. Sometimes I just grab the remote and it just sort of whatever feels convenient at the moment. So I think you'll see some people exclusively using that or primarily using that. I think you'll see some people not using it at all. And I think you'll see some people going back and forth. But what we're going to do is just keep looking at the data, keep optimizing the customer experience and listen to what our users are saying and what makes their experience more entertaining and more convenient. Thank you. Sorry, around what? Yes. So we have begun the process. We've done a tremendous amount of testing. We test everything internally. And then, of course, as we go state by state, we'll get more and more data. And so far what we're seeing is very encouraging. There's been really only kind of minor things around the edges that we've had to clean up. Otherwise, our internal testing has been really strong at predicting things and we've been able to get everything in order. So, so far, so good. It is still early. And to answer your question, yes, as we get closer to the full migration, we'll have more and more states there migrated over and we'll have more and more data to look at and be able to get a sense of how things are going. But from what we're seeing so far, everything's going great. Thank you. Yes, it's a great question. I think really hard to say for sure but given I don't expect there to be nearly the volume of sign-ups. And I use Iowa, for example, as a comparison and Iowa, where for the first 18 months after going live, there was no mobile registration. And the first thing I think was like five days of January this year when mobile registration was turned on, we exceeded the entire previous year in terms of registering. So I think the volume that comes in when there is mobile registration is just so significant compared to when there's not that. My suspicion would be that market shares sort of stabilize until that returns and hopefully when it returns if it returns. And as you noted, we've been number one in handle I think since August, every month in Illinois so we feel like we're in a great position. Obviously disappointing that we won't be able to take mobile registrants or at least for some time, but I think if we -- if that were to be the case as it is, then I think we could be in a stronger position and feel very good about where we are from a market share standpoint in that state. Thank you. So, I know there's a lot of rumor and speculation about that right now. One, we don't really have any insight so it's hard for me to really have any opinion but even if I did, we don't really think that what others are doing in terms of corporate structure and how that all plays out, really has much of anything to do with our strategy. We're going to continue to pursue the strategy that we've set out that we believe will position us to have the best long-term value and continue to be able to consistently meet or exceed the expectations that we set. And I think being able to focus internally on driving those types of results has been part of what's driven our previous strong performance. So we're going to continue down that path. And there will be a lot of activity in the market. I think when you have an exciting industry with so much potential, tens of billions of dollars, maybe more potential, you're going to see a lot of different moves by competitors. Obviously, we pay attention to them but it doesn't really change what we're doing. Yes, it's a great question. You are right that there is seasonality to the sporting calendar. Typically back half of the year is always greater. It's been a little bit disruptive whatever that typical seasonality has been by all the calendar shifts. So it's a little bit of a unique year for sure. And I think as a result of some of that, there's actually quite a bit on the slate for Q2. NBA and NHL regular seasons are ending in the next week or two and that will begin the playoffs. This year, the NBA and NHL playoffs are going to run into July, which I don't think has ever happened before. So that will create some additional content that hasn't been there in previous years. Obviously, baseball is off to a great start. The PGA has two majors in Q2; the PGA Championship in May and the U.S. Open in June. Two majors also on the tennis front with the French Open in May going into early June and then Wimbledon is obviously starting towards the end of the quarter. And then there are some exciting things going on in other sports as well. UFC, who we recently signed a partnership with, has two big fights coming up; one on May 15th and one on June 12th, UFC 262 and 263, respectively. And then this year, there's a lot going on, on the soccer side. Euro Cup is happening. It starts toward the middle of June and obviously run into Q3. Champion's League, Premier League, so lots of exciting stuff on the sports calendar. I think more so maybe this year than the prior years, you're going to get a full quarter because of the season -- the shifting, excuse me, in the sports calendars. And we're going to have to see how that all plays out. Much like last year, we're in a bit of unchartered territory with how the sports are overlapping and obviously a little tough to predict how NBA does in July when -- NBA Finals do I should say in July when that's never happened before. So it will be fun to see and we're just excited. There's a lot of great content out there to provide our customers with. There's always seasonality to marketing performance. Typically, though, what that results in is us just dialing up or down where we're investing based on the ROI we're seeing. I think Q1 was very similar to Q3 and Q4 where we spent more than we thought and had lower tax than we thought. So it was almost like we couldn't spend enough to hit our cap targets. And I think that efficiency was consistent, but a lot of what you see is that the customers that were acquired in Q3 and Q4 that remained active into Q1 boosted the MUPs numbers. And obviously we continue to add more but more exciting to me is the retention that we're seeing of the customers we acquired in the back half of last year. I think that was the largest driver of what we saw on the MUP front. And as far as future quarters and seasonality go, I think you'll see typical seasonal patterns. But as I mentioned, there is still this wildcard of this shift in the sports calendar. So I think it will be a bit different this year than in previous years. Typically, for example, we've seen good activity during the NBA and NHL playoffs. Having that overlap with baseball should provide better than I think typically what we've seen activity in the July timeframe and late June timeframe. And then I think also we'll have to see in the back half of the year what the leagues do, the NBA and NHL in particular, in terms of when they start their new seasons. Do they try to go back to the typical schedule in early Q4 or do they go with the late December, January schedule that they went with this past year? So I think that will also drive some activity. And then, of course, the NFL, assuming that goes according to plan, which right now we see no reason to believe it won't then that's obviously going to be a big driver of activity as well. You're welcome. That's a great question. I think right now, we're actively exploring multiple opportunities, some of which you mentioned and I think that really we're going to try to do whatever returns best on that capital. That's when you take in the capital even when we get the note at 0%, not a high bar there, but still we have our own internal thresholds for what we want to get return on -- what level of return we want to get on the capital we deploy and we're very disciplined about that. So I think really it's going to come down to us just rigorously evaluating different opportunities. And if we see great uses of capital that drive really strong returns, then we'll do it. If not, we'll be patient and deploy the capital as those things emerge. It's a great question. I think, as you noted, parlays are still possible under current federal law. Obviously, it'd be great to get single event betting were the federal law to change. But parlays are still, obviously, very popular and I think perhaps more importantly, iGaming will be allowable in Canada, or at least -- excuse me, in Ontario. And that does not have any impact from federal law. So I think those two things, both parlay sports betting and iGaming are products we intend to launch regardless of what happens. We're not waiting. And assuming the federal law does change, then we'll also offer single event wagering as well. Thank you. Absolutely. It's a great question. So as you noted, there's a huge global opportunity, and as excited as we are in the U.S. and as much as we believe the U.S. will be the largest in the world, the rest of the world will certainly be larger combined. And our ambitions are to be a global company. So we think there's a lot of exciting opportunity out there. We're obviously closely following that daily fantasy company you mentioned and also following regulatory developments in markets around the world. Lots of things are opening up, not just the U.S. So I think that provides a huge runway for our growth and it's something we haven't talked as much about because we have been so focused on the U.S. But I think you're very smart to point out that there's a huge opportunity there that can keep our growth rolling for many years to come. Yes, it's a great question. What we showed in our Investor Day is that New Jersey is kind of right around the middle of the pack. So there will be states that grow faster, they will be states that grow slower. But I think what's really interesting with both Michigan and Virginia is it kind of further validates this notion that New Jersey is not some outlier that's just bigger than everything else. And we didn't have those two states on our Investor Day. Even without those two, New Jersey was already slightly below the median for the other states. So this just kind of brings that up even a little bit more and widens that gap more and gives us further confidence that New Jersey is at worst a good proxy and at best maybe a conservative proxy when you're trying to size the rest of the states. And then there's a few examples where it's hard to compare apples-to-apples. You mentioned Iowa, for example. Iowa's tough to compare because Iowa for the first 18 months had no mobile registration. So, clearly, that would make it get off to a slower start. And I think once we saw mobile registration kick in earlier this year in Iowa, we started to see really strong ramp there. So, I think it will definitely depend. Pennsylvania is another interesting one. Pennsylvania, we have not invested as deeply in from a customer acquisition standpoint due to the tax rates there. It's just not as profitable as the market for us. So that's another one where I think perhaps in a different set up, it might have been the place that we could invest more. But really if you look at it, like I said from the macro standpoint, New Jersey is right around the middle of the pack and that was just a question we used to get a lot in the earlier days when everybody's using New Jersey as a proxy for what the rest of the U.S. could look like and I think the data that we've seen emerge further validates that it's a pretty good proxy and maybe even a conservative one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We really appreciate your questions and look forward to continuing our conversations with you. We had a very strong start to 2021 and continue to be excited about the future.  DraftKings is well positioned with $2.8 billion in cash to enter new states as soon as practicable, to drive continued product innovation, to acquire customers, and to explore opportunistic M&A. I hope you all stay safe and well and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in August."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we will be discussing our results on a combined company pro forma basis to improve comparability as if we owned our B2B business starting on January 1, 2020 rather than on April 23, 2020.  We are pleased to announce that we generated 312 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a 175% increase versus Q1 2020 revenue of 113 million. A portion of this amazing growth is due to the sports postponements that occurred in Q1 2020 due to COVID-19.  Our B2C business generated 281 million for the quarter, representing a 217% increase versus prior year. B2C monthly unique payers in the quarter increased 114% year-over-year to 1.5 million. The increase reflects strong unique payer retention and acquisition across VFS, OSB and iGaming as well as the lack of traditional sports in the last three weeks of March 2020.  Average revenue per monthly unique payer, or ARPMUP, was $61 in Q1 representing a 48% increase versus the same period in 2020. Our ARPMUP was positively impacted by increased engagement with our iGaming and online sports book product offerings and our excellent cross-selling capabilities. Our B2B business generated $31 million in the quarter, up 26% versus prior year due to the positive impact of FX as well as last March being impacted by COVID.  First quarter revenue exceeded our expectations due to a number of factors, including the extension of an executive order that allowed for continued mobile registration in Illinois through Q1, higher than forecast OSB hold percentage, over performance in our core business as a result of continued strong customer acquisitions, retention and monetization and strong launches in Michigan and Virginia.  We generated $155 million of gross profit dollars on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the entire business in the quarter, representing a 135% increase versus the prior year period. Gross margin rate on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the business declined as expected to 50% in the quarter.  As we have noted in the past, our gross margin rate has been impacted and will continue to be impacted by a mix shift out of our more mature and thus higher margin VFS product offerings and into higher growth rates and lower margin OSB in iGaming product offerings.  In addition, gross margin rate within a period is impacted by promotional intensity, typically most intense when a new state launches and at the beginning of a major sports season, as we aim to acquire customers. Gross margin rates will be positively impacted by the conversion to our own bet engine which will be complete by the end of Q3 as well as several gross margin rate improvement initiatives.  Our sales and marketing expenses were $220 million, which include our external marketing. External marketing was higher than prior year due to being live in 12 total states versus seven in Q1 2020, including the launch of mobile sports betting and iGaming in Michigan and mobile sports betting in Virginia which occurred in the quarter. The governor of Illinois also extended an executive order that allowed for mobile registration in Illinois through April 3, which allowed us to continue to acquire during that period. Additionally, we continued to see accretive LTV to CAC opportunities, which allowed us to invest deeper in marketing in part due to the stay-at-home nature of COVID.  Our general and administrative and product and technology costs on an adjusted EBITDA basis were 41 million and 34 million, respectively, as we continue to invest to achieve scale in our back office functions such as finance and accounting, legal and human resources as well as adding to our technology team.  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative 139 million as we rolled out our new state playbook in multiple jurisdictions and continued to invest in our product technology and G&A functions.  In the quarter, we expensed $186 million in items that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA but are included in GAAP operating income, notably 152 million for stock-based compensation and 34 million for amortization of acquired intangibles, depreciation and other amortization, as well as transaction-related expenses. Our stock-based compensation expense reflects accruals related to equity awards based on our anticipated revenue performance in 2021.  Moving on to our balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet following our issuance of 0% coupon convertible notes that will mature in 2028. We raised approximately 1.1 billion in net proceeds from this offering.  We are well capitalized to execute our multiyear plan and address our key priorities of taking advantage of this unique time for customer acquisitions, entering new states as they legalize, continuing to lead the market on product innovation, and exploring opportunistic and accretive M&A. Looking at the rest of 2021, on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we provided a range for 2021 revenue of 900 million to 1 billion. Given our strong start to 2021 and underlying acquisition, retention and monetization of players, we are increasing our guidance to 1.05 billion to 1.15 billion of revenue for 2021, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79%, and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance.  The 16% increase in the midpoint of our 2021 revenue guidance reflects strong performance in Q1 which has continued in Q2, continued strong user activation due to our marketing spend, well executed launches of mobile sports betting in Michigan and Virginia and iGaming in Michigan, and a modest impact of VSiN and Blue Ribbon on 2021 revenue.  We assume that all professional and college sports calendars that have been announced come to fruition and that we continue to operate in states in which we are live today. These states collectively represent 25% of the U.S. population for mobile sports betting and 10% of the U.S. population for iGaming. Though Wyoming, Arizona and New York have legalized, we do not know the exact date these states will launch and are not including them in our revenue guidance.  In addition, for the past several quarters, our financial results have benefited from the stay-at-home nature of COVID and the unique sports calendar in the second half of 2020. We expect both MUPs and ARPMUPs to grow in 2021, with MUPs increasing at a higher rate than ARPMUPs.  Regarding our 2021 quarterly revenue cadence, all things being equal, which means no new states launch beyond Michigan and Virginia, we expect Q1 to represent 28% of full year 2021 revenue, Q2 to be slightly more than 20%, and Q3 to be slightly below 20% of full year revenue. We currently expect the fourth quarter to account for slightly more than 30% of our revenue for the year.  While we are not providing guidance for 2021 adjusted EBITDA, sales and marketing expense is a key input. As discussed, sales and marketing in older vintage states will begin to moderate as we continue to invest in accretive LTV to CAC opportunities.  2020 and 2021 vintage states will have increased sales and marketing as we lap partial years for 2020 launches, execute our new state playbook in Michigan and Virginia well into the second quarter and invest in customer acquisition in Iowa, given the launch of mobile registration on January 1.  We have also announced new relationships, including our expanded agreement to become an official sports betting partner of the NFL. The net effect is that we continue to expect to spend significantly more on sales and marketing in 2021 compared to 2020. The significant number of customers we are acquiring also results in an increase in variable costs, such as customer service.  From a quarterly perspective, we continue to expect our Q3 adjusted EBITDA loss to be deepest and meaningfully wider than last year's Q3 loss as we ramp up external marketing substantially for the start of the NFL season, especially since we will have three states in their first full NFL season.  We expect our Q2 loss to be somewhat better than Q1, though still heavily impacted by investments associated with our launches in Michigan and Virginia. In the fourth quarter, we expect a slightly narrower loss than the second quarter as we benefit from higher seasonal revenue. As a reminder, our marketing spend is impacted by the launch of new states. Our spend is also highly flexible and can be reduced or paused altogether if the sports calendar shifts. That concludes our remarks. And we will now open the line for questions."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2022 DraftKings Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Stanton Dodge, Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead.\nStanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, as discussed further in SEC filings that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements, other than as required by law. During this call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings presentation, which can be found on our website and in our filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning and thank you all for joining. First off, I am very excited about 2023. We are more focused than ever on expense management. Since our previous earnings call in November, we have made surgical decisions backed by strong analysis about our expenses and have actioned items that totaled an expected $100 million of adjusted EBITDA relative to our prior guide. Including the impact of the increase in our 2023 revenue guidance, we have improved our adjusted EBITDA guide from a range of negative $475 million to negative $575 million to a range of negative $350 million to negative $450 million, and notably expect to generate more than $100 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2022. As you can see, we are in a great spot and are seeing an acceleration in our contribution profit and adjusted EBITDA. And we will continue to explore ways to drive efficiencies, both in our compensation and non-compensation expense categories. To be clear, the top line is performing very well, and we have strong momentum heading into 2023. We grew revenue 81% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and had an adjusted gross margin rate of 49%. Jason Park will speak more about what drove our strong fourth quarter results. Turning to our product offerings. DraftKings' mobile sportsbook was the number one most downloaded sportsbook app in the United States since Super Bowl Sunday. For sportsbook, one of our key product highlights was the launch of our own in-house live same-game parlay product, making us the first operator to deliver this capacity end to end for the NBA. This continues our focus on enhancing our parlay offering, which drives increased hold rate. And for iGaming, we launched DraftKings Jackpot, a unique type of progressive jackpot that is shared across more than 100 slots in [table] (ph) booking. We also received approval for our first live casino game developed entirely in-house, which we expect to launch in the coming months in New Jersey. I am proud of the team and culture we have in place. In particular, I am proud of our team for their relentless focus on efficiency and expense management over the past 12 months. While our work here is not done, we feel great about our trajectory and the ability the team has shown in driving strong revenue growth, while also managing our expenses better than ever before. I also noted that it is critical for top management to not take their eye off the ball in this area. And I am personally very focused on ensuring that goals, compensation and accountability are all aligned toward this very important objective. With that, I will turn it over to Jason Park.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason. Yes, let me hit on some of the highlights, including our Q4 performance, our new and improved 2023 guidance and some information on our underlying state vintages. Please note that all income statement measures, except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, we have great momentum coming out of Q4. In Q4, we posted $855 million of revenue, which represents 81% growth versus Q4 2021. This brought our full year revenue growth to 73%. Adjusted EBITDA was positive in October and was positive for the entire quarter after adjusting for the roughly $75 million investment we made in our recent launches in Maryland and Ohio. Our revenue was better than our prior guidance, primarily because of structural improvement in our sportsbook hold and fundamentally better customer trends than we expected. Customers are engaging more with our products and are less reliant on promotions. We also managed out approximately $25 million of expenses in Q4. 2023 is off to a great start. This will be a year of continued revenue growth and expense management; strong customer trends, including customer retention, handle per player, hold rate and better promotion reinvestment are enabling us to increase the midpoint of our revenue guidance from $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion. And our expense management programs have already identified $100 million of cost savings for 2023, roughly $50 million from scale marketing efficiencies and another $50 million from people-related costs. These two factors, along with our higher revenue outlook, allow us to confidently increase our adjusted EBITDA guidance range from negative $475 million to negative $575 million to negative $350 million to negative $450 million. I also wanted to spend a bit of time on foundational state economics. At any given point in time, our company results are a reflection of a combination of mature states, newer states and brand new states. Our states are performing very well, and we are seeing faster paths to positive contribution profit than we expected. For example, when we look at our 2018 to 2019 vintages states, which represents roughly 10% of the U.S. population, we are seeing great results. In 2022, those states grew net revenue by 50% versus 2021. This continued growth is due to several factors. We are seeing great customer retention, handle for retained player is growing, promotional reinvestment is coming down and hold percentage is going up. And because much of the net revenue growth is coming from less promotions and higher hold, our adjusted gross margin rate in that vintage was up more than 400 basis points in 2022 versus 2021. Finally, our absolute marketing dollars in those states decreased by more than 15%, these are important statistics and they are the foundational drivers of continued contribution profit expansion and acceleration across our states. This increase in total contribution profit, combined with much slower growth in fixed costs, results in an acceleration of our adjusted EBITDA profitability and clear progress towards achieving our long-term adjusted EBITDA goals. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Jason or Jason, I was wondering if we could just drill down a little bit on some of what you're seeing on the kind of structural hold improvement. That seems to be a really big story and one that you called out, yes, mix shift. Can you just give us a sense about two things? What's the underlying assumption for kind of 2023 as you think about what you saw results wise in the fourth quarter? And then secondarily, what's some of the kind of product road map? How do you think you can kind of continue to migrate customers into those types of products in the medium and long term?\nJason Robins: Great question. So, really, I think it made a ton of progress in this area, which I think has been enabled by having migrated towards the beginning of last NFL -- excuse me, the previous NFL season to our own platform, and really, I think NFL 2022, with the culmination of a year's worth of work, which has continued through. We just launched live SGP for NBA, which I think was the first stop. We were the first operator to do so, and that was an entirely in-house built and traded product. So really, I think we should expect to continue to see more and more effort towards driving a better parlay product offering, and I think that will continue to drive more mix shift. Also, we are making other changes. Certainly, mix shift is the largest driver of what we're referring to as structural hold increase. But we are also making other adjustments to our models, rolling out new and improved models, improving our data environment and doing a lot of other things that are helping us improve our trading performance. So, I do think there's some additional upside. We continue to be able to execute against those things on the product road map.\nJason Park: Yes. And I would add, Shaun, in terms of your question for guidance. As we saw the empirical structural hold flow-through in Q3, late Q3 and Q4, we've embedded that into our 2023 revenue guidance, which is a big part of the increase in our revenue guidance that we provided today.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. That question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: And congrats on the quarter. So with respect to this kind of updated operating platform or the updates that you've made, if hypothetically, we were to see -- and I know we've talked so much about sports betting, if we were to see iGaming hypothetically go live in New York, can you shed a little light on how that might impact what the guide is, both on the loss and the cash flow side?\nJason Robins: Absolutely. So, I think, obviously, there's a lot of moving parts, how big is the market, what's the structure around the tax rate, promotional deductions, those sorts of things. I think in general, what we've said in the past is, we assume roughly 7% to 8% of the U.S. population -- or it was 7% to 9% are new sports betting markets each year, and 3% to 4% for iGaming. So, New York, obviously, would be on the upper end of that. But overall, those assumptions are baked into our 2024 guidance. I don't think even if New York did pass the bill this year, I think it's unlikely that it will go live this year. Remember, they passed the bill the year before they went live. It was early the following year, but it took until the following year to go live for mobile sports betting. So, some states have been faster, but I think most have generally been the following calendar year. So, I think we're looking at 2024, and as I mentioned, we've built in some assumption around that, but this would be a bigger iGaming market than we had assumed.\nDavid Katz: And just to follow that up, if I may. Is it a fair assumption that the negative impact, both to earnings and cash flow from an iGaming state of size would be less than it would be from a sports betting or is that not a correct assumption?\nJason Robins: No, I think that is correct particularly if it is a state that already has sports betting or we\u2019ve already had a lot of customer acquisition investment like New York. So we've acquired hundreds and hundreds of thousands of players in New York already. I think the cross-sell opportunity there would be enormous. We know that some of these players are going to Connecticut, to New Jersey, to Pennsylvania to do iGaming now. So, I do think there is some incremental customer acquisition spend, but it's not the same as a fresh market where we haven't had hundreds of thousands of customers that we've acquired already. So it's an accurate assessment, I think.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment. We have a question from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open.\nJason Bazinet: I just have a high-level question. You guys, obviously, are making a lot of progress improving the operations, and every metric seems to be moving in the right direction. At the highest level, when you think about how these improvements compare to some of the long-term targets that you've laid out at prior Investor Days, is the implication that the goals are the same, but you'll just maybe get there faster? Or do you -- if things keep going as well, is there scope for some of those to move up?\nJason Robins: That's a great question. We will, later this year, be providing an updated long-term outlook at an Investor Day. So stay tuned for that. But speaking to it conceptually, I do think there's some upside there. We certainly have some upside on the hold rate front. I think promotions will probably end up somewhere in line with where we think they'll be long term. And then on the cost side, I think there's always effort that needs to be going. That's something, I think, that really has resonated with the team is, yes, obviously, we're all cognizant of the market environment we're in. But we also understand that to build the most profitable long-term company, we need to be as efficient as we possibly can. And that's a message that everyone on leadership has really taken to. The Board conducted a thorough review of management incentives towards the end of 2021 and starting in '22, it's continued to '23, completely realigned management incentives. So, there was an equivalent focus on EBITDA and profitability to what we previously had on revenue. So I think that when we look at the long term, and like I said, we'll provide more specific updates later this year, I do think there's some upside if we can continue to find the efficiencies that we've been finding over the past 12 months.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Jason, Jason, whoever wants to take this one, as you guys think about kind of the structural hold improvements that you're making and you think about kind of the new parlay product, relative to retention and acknowledging, it's early with a lot of this stuff, but you obviously had some growth over the course of 2022 with your addressable TAM, with new states that have come online. I believe your monthly unique payers, was up high 20s this year. I'm not sure if that is in line with kind of the addressable TAM that you brought up, but it seems similar, at least. As you think about like kind of that retention effort, as holds are rising, how could you kind of comment around the balance between how to retain and kind of how to improve efficiency on a per customer basis?\nJason Robins: I think that's an extremely important question. And really, in the end, it's all about the customer. We start there. What's nice about the parlay product is customers love it. It's something that I think helps with retention if the product offering keeps getting stronger. So we don't view it as a trade-off at all. We look at it and start with the customer, find the products that the customers want and then ideally construct those products in a way that is both really exciting and benefits the customer and also create attractive economics for the Company. And I think parlay is a great example of that. We've had DFS for years. And while certainly, DFS is a skill game, while certainly people do win, it's not as common. But when they win, they have an opportunity in these big tournaments to win very large prices. And I think the parlay product functions the same way. If somebody does a very large parlay with lots of legs, they have an opportunity to turn a very small bet into a large payday. And I think that's really the value prop that's unique about the parlay product relative to the singles bets.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. And then if I could, just one follow-up. In terms of adjusted sales and marketing, I think the external marketing in '22 was a little over $800 million, you guys disclosed. The total was a little over $1.1 billion. Should we expect, as soon as '23, that, that line starts to -- that, that expense starts to come down a little bit this year? Or is that relatively flat this year and maybe you leverage a little bit of the revenue growth? And then maybe in subsequent years is where we start to see that sales and marketing kind of chip away and go lower?\nJason Robins: I think that's right. I think we'll be relatively flat this year. I think that we're -- obviously, some of this will depend on the cadence of state launches. But based on sort of a baseline expectation, I think will be relatively flat this year. And as you noted, I think as more and more states mature, as the market overall matures, you'll start to see it tail down a little bit. But this year, I think we're expecting to be basically flat year-over-year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment. Our next question comes from Ed Young with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nEd Young: And first of all, just to say thank you for some of the extra disclosure in the presentation. It's really very useful and appreciated. I want to ask about the statement you've reiterated really, which is around producing your first adjusted EBITDA positive quarter in the fourth quarter of this year and then how that set up '24. Given as you mentioned that you were there this Q4, except for the new state investment, can you just help us sort of think about that statement? Is that due to the cadence of the cost savings that you mentioned? Is that due to conservatism around the new state launches and not having perfect line of sight to that? Or is there anything else? Is there a reason particularly why that couldn't come earlier, you just maybe just want to commit yourself to that?\nJason Robins: Yes. I think -- so it's a great question, Ed. Certainly, there's seasonality of the business, and there are quarters where there's deeper marketing investment like Q1 and Q3. I think that, for us right now, especially given Ohio, Maryland or brand-new Massachusetts, we expect to launch, hopefully, sometime in March, I do think that, that's really the reason behind us staying with the Q4 message. I think because of those launches, we expect an even better Q4. And what we're seeing is that those states so far, Maryland and Ohio, at least are ramping faster, even in Arizona. Arizona was the fastest-ramping state we had, and some of our more recent states like Maryland and Ohio have really even been faster. So, I think the good news is that, that's going to contribute more contribution profit sooner. I just don't know if Q2 is too soon to expect that. But either way, I think that we'll be continuing to focus on efficiency, continuing to focus on trying to get profitable sooner. That's the goal of the Company. And right now, I think we're comfortable to committing to $100 million plus in EBITDA in Q4. But we're trying to get that number up, and we're trying to get every quarter to do better than what we're thinking right now. And there's a number of efficiency-oriented initiatives around the Company that I think could potentially contribute some upside.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nJed Kelly: Great. Maybe following up on Carlo's question. Can you just talk about your churn rate this football season, I guess, with the higher holds, and you did have a better football outcome, too, versus last year? And what's kind of driving the underlying churn rate? And then just question just on 1Q. Can you talk about sort of some of the dynamics around the first quarter? I think last year, March Madness was a negative or lower than you thought. So can you talk about sort of some of the comps we should be thinking about for 1Q?\nJason Robins: Yes, I think -- so on the first question, we've seen really strong retention rates. Obviously, we've been keeping an eye on this as hold has increased. We have other market comps that we see at even higher hold levels than us that has, I think, had decent retention. So we feel confident there's still room to increase hold without affecting churn. And thus far, we've seen only positive trends on the retention rate side. As far as March Madness, I think it's been a weird last few years. You had the cancellation of March Madness in 2020. And I think college basketball is really coming back in a big way now in terms of popularity. We're seeing more adoption in the regular season than we had in the previous couple of seasons. So, we think it's going to be a great March Madness, and I'm really looking forward to it. It will be -- hopefully, if Massachusetts gets live, it will be the first time that residents in Massachusetts will be able to bet and stay. So, I think that will be a big opportunity, and then obviously, continuing to learn more and get better on figuring out ways to drive better bet mix. That said, college sports, I will say, is one of the tougher ones on the bet mix side because a number of states don't allow player props and also people are generally just less familiar with the players, so they're more likely to combine parlays on multiple teams. So, we'll be focusing there, obviously, still trying to drive the same game parlay product, too, but I think college sports, multi-game parlay is a little bit easier than same-game parlay, given some of the dynamics I described.\nJed Kelly: Great. And then just one quick follow-up. Is there anything to call out from the World Cup in 4Q that won't be in there this year?\nJason Robins: World Cup was great, I mean, no doubt about it. That said, it was low single digits percentage of our revenue. And I think we don't believe that there's anything really that you should adjust accordingly from World Cup. I think that was a nice little boost, but didn't have a tremendously material impact on our financials last quarter.\nJason Park: And I would just add, Ed -- I would just add, on World Cup that was obviously already included in the Q4 guidance that we provided in November. And when we look at the data on a customer-by-customer level, it felt more as much like a handle shift between sports that were very prevalent in Q4 as it was sort of true incrementality.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nRobert Fishman: You called out how you're looking for more efficiencies around not renewing certain team league and media rights going forward. I'm just wondering if you can expand upon these different relationships and maybe how they've changed over the past year or two since you first signed the deals, now that some of the other OSB players have pulled back.\nJason Robins: Yes, I think what you're describing is one of the many efforts around the Company aimed at becoming more efficient. And obviously, marketing being a big expense category, team and league deals being a big expense category, we feel there's room there. We've had a number of partners that have been very constructive and have agreed to reductions that would make these deals efficient in a way that we need them to be. And there's others that we will be discontinuing when the deals come up and have discontinued as they've come up over the past year. So it's really been a mix. There's been a lot of really great partners, though. They recognized that the market's changed, have said, \"Look, we want long term to be in business with DraftKings. And we realize that this is not an efficient part of the portfolio right now, and we need to rework it.\" And there have been others that we've had to unfortunately discontinue the deals with. So it will be a mix of things, but it's really part of an overall effort that we have to be more efficient as a company. And I think there is an opportunity in this category to get even better.\nRobert Fishman: If I could just ask one quick follow-up. Any update you'd care to make about the future partnership with Disney? And whether the relationship has changed at all since the early days since Bob Iger is back?\nJason Robins: No. I mean we've continued to have a great relationship with Disney. ESPN, Jimmy Pitaro and his team have been great partners. So, we've really enjoyed that relationship, gotten a lot out of the partnership. And we always talk to our partners about ways that we can improve and extend and grow the relationship. And Disney and ESPN have been a great partner thus far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Clark Lampen with BTIG. Your line is open.\nClark Lampen: I've got just one for Jason Park. Jason, if we assume you guys are finishing '23 with, I guess, let's just say, it's a wide range, $600 million to $800 million of cash, and you're going to be at that point, a lot closer to breakeven on a cash flow basis, does it make sense to be a little bit more aggressive with cash usage or explore debt financing options in a market where so many of your competitors are now leaning out, at least on the sports betting side and you're past the point of having to illustrate to the market that you won't need to raise capital just to remain a going concern?\nJason Park: Yes, I appreciate the question, Clark. Yes, just to clarify, I would not say that we're like $600 million to $800 million. I would say, greater than $700 million ending 2023. So maybe $700 million plus is probably a better way to think about it. Yes, and look, I think the most important thing is we're in a great place where we can just focus on operating the business, finding efficiencies, not having to worry about any type of financing needs. And in terms of broader questions around debt's role at DraftKings, we'll continue to evaluate the entire capital structure, obviously, the macro environment on potential instruments like that. And we'll come back to you if anything comes to fruition.\nJason Robins: Yes, I'd just add that I think that because of our cash position, were there an opportunity to be aggressive in places, we don't need capital, whether equity or debt financing. So it's something, I think, if there was some strategic opportunity or something like that, perhaps we would explore. But from an organic standpoint, we don't need to. So I think it's unlikely you'll see us take out any debt and any -- I mean, any equity capital at all. And I think it's virtually impossible to imagine a scenario where we do so for organic purposes. As far as leaning in more, we are trying to be surgical, and that means not just cutting and being efficient in places that we know we need to be more efficient, but also leaning in, in places where we have the data and the conviction. That said, you asked the wrong guy in Jason Park. I don't think he's met a cost he's liked in the last year. So sometimes we have to tell Jason, you can't cut everything. But definitely, the team is, I think, as a result of having a great analytically driven culture and a great amount of data, very confident that there are places that, yes, we certainly are cutting, but we also need to be leaning into as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Chaiken with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nBen Chaiken: On the SG&A side, the guide for '23 suggests maybe up 10% or 12% year-over-year, '23 versus '22. I'm kind of bucketing everything between contribution profit and EBITDA. Does that growth rate continue -- and that's relative to a 40% growth rate between '22 and '21. Does that growth rate continue to decelerate even as you add new states?\nJason Robins: The growth rate of fixed costs?\nBen Chaiken: Just the whole SG&A bucket, so everything between contribution profit and EBITDA that's growing in 10% 12% range.\nJason Robins: No. Yes, I think there's really very little fixed cost impact of launching new states. There's some customer service sometimes, but we're also working hard to find ways to be more efficient there. So hopefully, we're able to offset any need to grow there with other efficiencies that we find. So really, it's mostly variable cost COGS that we see with new revenue coming in from new states. There's obviously marketing expense, but not really fixed cost. I think most of our functions are at scale, are pretty close. So that's why you're seeing moderate fixed cost growth this year, a significant reduction in fixed cost growth year-over-year. And I also think that the team is working hard to be more efficient. I think that there's been a real lightbulb that's gone off here that we can do more and actually grow revenue faster if we become more efficient. And there's a connection between being better focused on expense management and efficiency with revenue growth, with doing better for the customer. And I think making that connection and realizing that actually these things feed off of each other, that the better we do to manage our expenses and be more efficient as an organization, the more that we're going to be able to deliver value for the customer. And that will actually lead to market share gains and revenue growth. I think that's been a real rallying cry for the team over the past year, and it continues to be in 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nMichael Graham: I just wanted to ask about some of the disclosures you had around the growth in your mature states, that 2018 to 2019 cohort. You referenced 50% year-over-year growth, and you gave some good reasons for that growth around retention and increased hold. I just wanted to ask about like what you are seeing in terms of customer growth, player growth in some of those mature states? And are you -- do you feel like you're getting close to terminal penetration? Or like what are you learning about the way the model works as you kind of get a little bit deeper into some of these mature states?\nJason Park: Yes, great question. So and thanks for calling that part of the letter out. I'd say if you unpack the 50% revenue growth that we experienced in that 2018, 2019 vintage, probably 70% was from existing customers and, call it, 20% to 30% was from new customers. So point is even though those states were in their third or fourth full year, they were -- we were still acquiring new customers. So, we haven't found a ceiling yet in -- even in those more mature states in terms of total population penetration.\nJason Robins: And I think also, if you look at comps around the world, other markets, I mean growth typically occurs decades. And so obviously, growth rates go down. It's not going to continue growing at 50% forever, but I don't expect we've hit any sort of ceiling there. I know different dynamics, but the iGaming market in New Jersey, which is now coming up on almost a decade, still growing. So, I think lots of comps around really not just the world, but if you look at the U.S. lottery market and other sorts of comparisons, it's just very much a market that I think always has new customers coming into it. And I think there's an expectation that we should have that there will be a pretty steady growth for at least another decade or so.\nJason Park: And just super important, Mike, like the source of growth is -- the point is it's much more than just new customer acquisition. It is existing customer handle growth, that whole improvement and continued promo reduction that drives that net revenue growth.\nJason Robins: And we're still in the phase of the market where we're finding big wins on the product front. We're finding ways that we can be more smart operationally, that we can reach customers in a more effective way. So, I think there's still many years of just innovation that will drive growth in our consumer wallet share. And when we think about wallet share, we don't just think about it within our own industry. We think about our customers' entertainment wallet share. And we believe that customers will be willing to spend more time with us and spend more with us if we create better products that they find more entertaining than other things they could be doing for fun.\nClark Lampen: Thank you, guys. Congrats on all the progress.\nJason Robins: Thank you\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nBernie McTernan: Jason, I want to take your pulse on the M&A market. And just given everything you've talked about in the shareholder letter on profitability, does that impact your philosophy on using your stock as a currency?\nJason Robins: I think they're somewhat independent. Obviously, the more that we can get some momentum behind the stock, the more attractive it becomes as a currency. But I don't think that it's really something that we really are focused on right now. We're very focused on our internal operations, focused on getting more efficient. Obviously, there will be a time in the market -- and hard to predict because we're in such a rapid phase of evolution right now. There will be a time in the market where those things really make sense and we can focus more on it. But right now, there's a lot of focus on just how we can make sure that this company is on a clear path to profitability and that we're operating in the most efficient and cost-effective way we can.\nBernie McTernan: Understood. And then just a follow-up on parlays. I think a big question, just given the success, is where could it go? Do you guys have a sense in terms of just what the U.S. penetration of parlays is relative to the rest of the world or more mature markets?\nJason Robins: I think that's a great question, and it's tough to compare to rest of world. I think the U.S. is a bit unique. My belief is that the U.S. consumer and the gaming market, a lot of the roots of it are in the lotteries where there have been lotteries across states for a lot longer than casinos and other sorts of gaming products. And that lottery mentality of big jackpots, I think, is carried over into other products. We even see it in DFS where our most attractive offerings are the large tournaments that you can enter for anywhere from $3 to $20 and win hundreds of thousands or million plus in prices. So I think that's carrying over into the U.S. market. And I actually think for that reason, parlays have more upside than they would in other parts of the world, not to say that they're not popular in other parts of the world. They call them accumulators in Europe. And certainly, that's been a big growth area overseas. But I think the U.S. customer is uniquely oriented towards the kind of proposition of bet a little to win a lot. So I think there's a lot more upside. And we're still at the infancy stages of this product. I mean there's so much we can do to innovate and make it more exciting and more fun for the consumer.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nRyan Sigdahl: Curious to get your thoughts on the current competitive dynamics. We've seen several operators pulling back more notably on online sports betting and iGaming. But then, you have fanatics with the most notable high profile. I guess, new incumbent coming or entrant coming. How do you think about promotional and marketing intensity from an industry standpoint in 2023, better or worse year-over-year?\nJason Robins: I think it will be better. There will be more mature states. I think that natural kind of promotional reduction that happens as states mature, we'll continue to see a tailwind from that. Obviously, there's always going to be new entrants coming in and out of the market. I think one thing we've seen, though, is that -- and I expect the same would apply to any new entrant. The market competitively has become much more rational. We talked about this in the letter. There was a period of time in 2020 and part of 2021, where there was really a message from the market that market share and revenue growth were all that mattered. And I think you saw some rational behaviors from some of our competition coming about as a result. And I think once the market started to change their tune, and there was more of a demand on accountability for efficiency and profitability, you saw that change. And I don't see that changing again. I think that we're in a new phase of the market where competing on a much more rational playing field is the norm. And I think that you'll continue to see that, whether it be existing operators or any new operators that come into the market.\nOperator: One moment. Our question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDan Politzer: Jason, I was hoping just to clarify on the 2023 revenue guidance. I think for the fourth quarter, you guys had $30 million uptick in revenue from the structural improvement in the hold. I just want to clarify, your 2023 guide that you issued at the same time that did include the hold benefit? And then just for my follow-up, just the pace of the fixed OpEx deceleration, if you could maybe parse that out in terms of the G&A, product and tech and other corporate marketing, and I guess, where you're seeing the most efficiencies.\nJason Park: Yes. So in terms of your first question on hold percentage, yes, that's all embedded within the guide and the H1, H2 revenue split that we provided. So any type of empirical pattern that we're seeing that we have confidence will continue, we'll embed into our guidance. And in terms of further breakdown of P&T, S&M, G&A, fixed cost growth, I think someone earlier mentioned 10% to 12% growth, I would say that, that's pretty similar across all three of those areas.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment. Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandt Montour: I wanted to ask about iGaming. Looks like you guys have had really good success gaining share on the DraftKings side In New Jersey in the fourth quarter, Pennsylvania in the fourth quarter or Michigan in the third quarter. I was just curious if you're able to sort of break down that success between some of the things you mentioned in terms of product, like progressive jackpot or success you've had in cross-selling during this NFL season? Or if there's any sort of cross learnings you're able to -- you're leveraging from GNOG. Any color could be helpful for us.\nJason Robins: Thank you. I appreciate it. Yes, we -- I mean, we are really pleased that in January, we had the number one market share in iGaming in New Jersey for the first time since we launched in December of 2018. So, great culmination of over four years of effort from the team, building products, optimizing our analytics and obviously, on-boarding a new brand in GNOG. And I think the most exciting thing is that we feel the biggest upside is yet to come when we migrate GNOG to the DraftKings' platform and product suite. That's going to hopefully happen later this year. And I think that will be -- give us an additional boost as well as provide ongoing cost savings due to not having to pay revenue share to as many third parties. So lots of benefit there and I think already seeing some great results from the product side. And also, you mentioned, too, I think we've gotten even more effective at cross-sell, I think, especially as we get more data. That's sort of our sweet spot. The more data we have, the more effective and efficient we can become. So not only have we gotten more effective at increasing cross-sell, we've being able to do it more efficiently as well. So that's something that I'm very proud of that the team has been able to make great progress on.\nBrandt Montour: And if I may just quickly follow up on that. Is it fair to assume that 2023 guidance assumes that you're able to hold the share gains that you just recently enjoyed?\nJason Robins: Well, there's always seasonality in the business. So naturally, we're going to do best during heavy sports periods on the cross-sell fronts, more activity in the platform. So, we've embedded that in. But yes, I think as far as like when you adjust for that and look at where we are today, I would say, yes, although the January report is brand new. So I can't say that we necessarily like looked at the implications of that. But more so, what we do is we look at the underlying cohort data, and we bake in adjustments for seasonality as well as any other initiatives or efforts or actions that we plan on taking.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Stauff with SIG. Your line is open.\nJoe Stauff: I wanted to follow up and ask on user growth. Jason, you had mentioned, and certainly, we can observe this that states are -- they're ramping so much faster. And so I guess, what is the right way to think about kind of how long it takes you to reach that sort of golden cohort now it is, I guess, maybe versus a year, 1.5 years ago? And then I had one follow-up, please.\nJason Robins: Well, it's a great question, Joe. I think this is a tricky one because as we compare states, there's differences in time of year. So, we talk about Arizona ramping quickly. That was in September. And then you try to compare that to a state like Ohio or Maryland that launched Maryland towards the end of the year, Ohio Jan 1, or Massachusetts that we expect to launch in March. And you have to -- there's only a limited number of data points when you have all those different variables to really be able to say. But I think that's sort of a big-picture level. The implication is, one, there's probably some deeper investment upfront. So I think that what we've been really happy to see is that we've actually, at least through 2022, been able to absorb that by finding efficiencies throughout the rest of the business. If you look at the letter, we basically funded all of the state launches in 2022 through finding cost efficiencies elsewhere in the business. But then the other implication of it is that the inflection towards contribution profit positive happens sooner. You get greater operating leverage sooner, which means more upside from a revenue and profitability standpoint sooner. So, I think that's kind of the way to think about it. Exactly how it ends up netting out over the course of the year, I think we need a little bit more data to see. But at a macro level, that's kind of how I describe it. And it is -- no matter what, whether you take seasonality, anything else, it is unequivocally observably true that states are ramping much faster than they were three, four years ago.\nJoe Stauff: That makes sense. And then maybe just a follow-up on structural hold in general. You certainly mentioned that the new in-house NBA same-game parlay sort of capabilities that you had launched, and I was wondering I know at least for part of your NFL product, you do outsource same-game parlay. I'm wondering if your '23 guide includes bringing that in-house.\nJason Robins: So, the team is working at bringing that in-house now. As far as our '23 guide, we do expect, at some point in 2023, that, that will be the case and that is built into the guide, but it won't affect the entirety of 2023. And I noted this earlier, we have already started to roll out some of our own in-house SGP -- most recently, the live SGP MBA product we rolled out, which was the first in the industry to -- we were the first in the industry to have it. So, I think that's a good signal that we're reaching a period where we have now with over a 1.5 years under our belt, lots of data to build out some of these new models. We've gotten to a point where we feel like we can put out models that are as good or better than what we can get off the shelf from third parties.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.\nChad Beynon: First, just wanted to ask about opportunities or aspirations in non-North American markets. Given your data science and kind of all the learnings that you've had in the past couple of years, it seems like you're in a pretty good position to make it then in some of those markets, obviously, a lot to do still here in North America, but wondering if anything has changed in other markets.\nJason Robins: I do think you're right that the technology we've built is going to be very portable to the global gaming market. And we believe that when we do decide to expand overseas, we'll have advantages over incumbent competition when it comes to product, when it comes to hold rate, things like that. That said, we are laser-focused on the U.S. and on Ontario right now. I think that the opportunity here remains very significant and growing. We have a lot of work to do to become more efficient as an organization that we need to focus on. There will be a time and a place to focus on international expansion, but it's not going to be right now. Doesn't mean that we won't look at it and start to do some exploratory work this year behind the scenes. I think we have to always be thinking about what future things we want to do and start laying some of the research and groundwork for that. But on the whole, the team is very focused on how do we continue to make progress and do better for the customer in the U.S. and how do we continue to become more efficient and cost effective as an organization.\nChad Beynon: And then a follow-up to that, just on the iGaming, iCasino legislation, I know you and your competitors on the mobile side are doing a lot of work communicating the story, but it also seems like a lot of the land-based operators are as well, as they've seen probably lower cannibalization than they may have feared. So do you think there will be more momentum? Do you think that's more based on kind of what happens in the economy? What's really going to start kind of the rolling stone for more iCasino discussions?\nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question. And I think that there are -- you noted one. I think, certainly, the opportunity for tax revenue, and should states find themselves more in need of that, that could have an effect. I also think that as an industry, we need to do a better job getting the story out there. There's a lot of great work that's been done by the EGA and other groups to really put the data out there about just how significant and large the illegal sports betting market is. And I think that's been a big driver of policymakers saying, \"Look, we got to do something here.\" I don't think there's been nearly as much coverage of the illegal iGaming market, even though it exists. I mean if you go to pretty much any of the mobile sportsbooks and online sports books that you see overseas that are operating illegally, they -- almost all of them have an online casino. It's just not talked about as much. I think inherently, it's a less social product. People talk about it less. And then like I said, the industry probably just hasn't focused as much as we could have on really making that data clear. So I think it's a combination of those two things of states that see the tax opportunity and realize that there's a real way to take something that's happening already, just like sports betting is in the illegal market and bring it into the light and protect consumers and also generate revenue for the state.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: I wonder, if you could give us a little bit of color on your guidance for states that are contribution positive? It was 11 states getting to $105 million last year. For the $500 million this year, how many states will that be to generate that $500 million? And is it still -- at one point, you talked about a three-year payback period for when a new state legalizes until it's profitable. Is that faster now, given the ramp-up in Arizona? What would you say that time line is? And then last, little clarification. You talked about the percent of population that your long-term guidance is 7% to 9% of new OSB every year. It's fair to say, though, right, that your '23 and '24 guidance, doesn't rely on your '24 guidance, doesn't rely on any states that haven't already actually legalized just not operational yet, right? In other words, no new legislation needs to happen for that to be hit?\nJason Robins: That last point is correct. The only state that's not even live yet that we did assume in the guidance is Massachusetts. And the reason is it's pretty far down the line. So we felt it was more helpful to investors to get a view with Massachusetts included. But we have not assumed any other state launches from new legalization that happens this year. As far as -- I'm going to try to remember that. I think the first one, on a sort of state-by-state basis, we have not disclosed which states are contribution profit positive for '23 yet. We plan on covering that in more detail at our Investor Day later this year. So, we will be providing additional disclosure and data on that. We had to save something for that to keep -- to get you to show up, Robin. And then on -- I'm sorry, what was your second question? Oh speed and inflection.\nRobin Farley: Oh just the speed.\nJason Robins: And proximity inflection. Yes, yes. So I think you're absolutely correct. One of the implications of faster ramping with new states, that the inflection to profitability and the degree of operating leverage that you get earlier is greater than what we had seen in some of the earlier states that launched in more of the 2018, '19, '20 time frame. So, there is that implication, and I think that could potentially have an effect not just with the states we're seeing launch in recent months as well as Massachusetts, but with future states that launched that again, something I think we'll address at the Investor Day. But in a nutshell, to answer your question directly, I do think it brings in the time line to path to profitability for a new state. And we'll be providing a more specific update on that later this year.\nJason Park: I just want to be clear, Robin, that 2024 EBITDA does include an assumption of more states legalized.\nJason Robins: Yes. Sorry. So, '23 does not. '24, we have assumed 7% to 9% or 7% to 8%, I forget, if the population launches for sports betting and 3% to 4% for iGaming.\nRobin Farley: Okay. So, that would be some new states in this legislative session, right, would have to...\nJason Robins: That would be, yes. And the implication, if that comes in high or low or if it's less so, while it may mean less TAM, it actually means we're probably going to have faster profitability ramp. So, I think either way, it's a good story for the Company. But obviously, we're pushing hard to get more legislation passed.\nRobin Farley: And then also, that would mean that your 2023 guidance includes the losses from those new states, right? If the profitability is in your '24 guidance, the losses would be in the '23 guidance already. In theory, that would be the part of it.\nJason Robins: No, no, sorry. We did not -- no. We assumed, other than Massachusetts, no more state launches in '23. So there will be no effect in '23 if that occurs. If we do see more states launch in '23, yes, that will happen. But what I was referring to was launches in '24. So what that would mean is that the investment period for those states would be in '24. And it would have a downward -- sorry, if there were not launches, would have a positive impact on EBITDA in 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJoe Greff: Just with regard to the incremental benefit in '23 -- or '23 updated guidance versus three months ago and the benefit coming from more efficient promotional activity and more efficient promotional reinvestment, how broad-based is that? Or how market concentrated is that? And then how much of a benefit from a market like New York is driving that improvement?\nJason Robins: Well, the bulk of our guidance increase on the EBITDA side came from direct management. So about half of it came -- or about $50 million of it, I should say, came from compensation expense, about $50 million came from marketing. So, definitely a big impact there, some of the revenue increase was hold rate and promotion optimization. Some of it was some underlying handle/retention metrics we're seeing in our cohorts. As far as state by state, I don't think there's anything in particular at the state level that's different. States are maturing as expected. And the increases we're seeing, the hold rate are happening across the board. We do see in some of the newer states that we've launched that we have faster adoption of parlays and same-game parlays. I think that's largely because our product offering is in such a better place than it was a couple of years ago. But that, I think, is probably the one example. Other than that, I think the increases that we're making to hold rate and other things that are driving underlying performance on the retention and monetization front are really across state vintages.\nOperator: Thank you. And that's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Jason Robbins for closing remarks.\nJason Robins: Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We had a really great finish to 2022 and are excited about 2023 and beyond. I look forward to speaking with you over the next few weeks and hope you all stay safe and well. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you all for joining. First off, I am very excited about 2023. We are more focused than ever on expense management. Since our previous earnings call in November, we have made surgical decisions backed by strong analysis about our expenses and have actioned items that totaled an expected $100 million of adjusted EBITDA relative to our prior guide. Including the impact of the increase in our 2023 revenue guidance, we have improved our adjusted EBITDA guide from a range of negative $475 million to negative $575 million to a range of negative $350 million to negative $450 million, and notably expect to generate more than $100 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2022. As you can see, we are in a great spot and are seeing an acceleration in our contribution profit and adjusted EBITDA. And we will continue to explore ways to drive efficiencies, both in our compensation and non-compensation expense categories. To be clear, the top line is performing very well, and we have strong momentum heading into 2023. We grew revenue 81% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and had an adjusted gross margin rate of 49%. Jason Park will speak more about what drove our strong fourth quarter results. Turning to our product offerings. DraftKings' mobile sportsbook was the number one most downloaded sportsbook app in the United States since Super Bowl Sunday. For sportsbook, one of our key product highlights was the launch of our own in-house live same-game parlay product, making us the first operator to deliver this capacity end to end for the NBA. This continues our focus on enhancing our parlay offering, which drives increased hold rate. And for iGaming, we launched DraftKings Jackpot, a unique type of progressive jackpot that is shared across more than 100 slots in [table] (ph) booking. We also received approval for our first live casino game developed entirely in-house, which we expect to launch in the coming months in New Jersey. I am proud of the team and culture we have in place. In particular, I am proud of our team for their relentless focus on efficiency and expense management over the past 12 months. While our work here is not done, we feel great about our trajectory and the ability the team has shown in driving strong revenue growth, while also managing our expenses better than ever before. I also noted that it is critical for top management to not take their eye off the ball in this area. And I am personally very focused on ensuring that goals, compensation and accountability are all aligned toward this very important objective. With that, I will turn it over to Jason Park. Great question. So, really, I think it made a ton of progress in this area, which I think has been enabled by having migrated towards the beginning of last NFL -- excuse me, the previous NFL season to our own platform, and really, I think NFL 2022, with the culmination of a year's worth of work, which has continued through. We just launched live SGP for NBA, which I think was the first stop. We were the first operator to do so, and that was an entirely in-house built and traded product. So really, I think we should expect to continue to see more and more effort towards driving a better parlay product offering, and I think that will continue to drive more mix shift. Also, we are making other changes. Certainly, mix shift is the largest driver of what we're referring to as structural hold increase. But we are also making other adjustments to our models, rolling out new and improved models, improving our data environment and doing a lot of other things that are helping us improve our trading performance. So, I do think there's some additional upside. We continue to be able to execute against those things on the product road map. Absolutely. So, I think, obviously, there's a lot of moving parts, how big is the market, what's the structure around the tax rate, promotional deductions, those sorts of things. I think in general, what we've said in the past is, we assume roughly 7% to 8% of the U.S. population -- or it was 7% to 9% are new sports betting markets each year, and 3% to 4% for iGaming. So, New York, obviously, would be on the upper end of that. But overall, those assumptions are baked into our 2024 guidance. I don't think even if New York did pass the bill this year, I think it's unlikely that it will go live this year. Remember, they passed the bill the year before they went live. It was early the following year, but it took until the following year to go live for mobile sports betting. So, some states have been faster, but I think most have generally been the following calendar year. So, I think we're looking at 2024, and as I mentioned, we've built in some assumption around that, but this would be a bigger iGaming market than we had assumed. No, I think that is correct particularly if it is a state that already has sports betting or we've already had a lot of customer acquisition investment like New York. So we've acquired hundreds and hundreds of thousands of players in New York already. I think the cross-sell opportunity there would be enormous. We know that some of these players are going to Connecticut, to New Jersey, to Pennsylvania to do iGaming now. So, I do think there is some incremental customer acquisition spend, but it's not the same as a fresh market where we haven't had hundreds of thousands of customers that we've acquired already. So it's an accurate assessment, I think. That's a great question. We will, later this year, be providing an updated long-term outlook at an Investor Day. So stay tuned for that. But speaking to it conceptually, I do think there's some upside there. We certainly have some upside on the hold rate front. I think promotions will probably end up somewhere in line with where we think they'll be long term. And then on the cost side, I think there's always effort that needs to be going. That's something, I think, that really has resonated with the team is, yes, obviously, we're all cognizant of the market environment we're in. But we also understand that to build the most profitable long-term company, we need to be as efficient as we possibly can. And that's a message that everyone on leadership has really taken to. The Board conducted a thorough review of management incentives towards the end of 2021 and starting in '22, it's continued to '23, completely realigned management incentives. So, there was an equivalent focus on EBITDA and profitability to what we previously had on revenue. So I think that when we look at the long term, and like I said, we'll provide more specific updates later this year, I do think there's some upside if we can continue to find the efficiencies that we've been finding over the past 12 months. I think that's an extremely important question. And really, in the end, it's all about the customer. We start there. What's nice about the parlay product is customers love it. It's something that I think helps with retention if the product offering keeps getting stronger. So we don't view it as a trade-off at all. We look at it and start with the customer, find the products that the customers want and then ideally construct those products in a way that is both really exciting and benefits the customer and also create attractive economics for the Company. And I think parlay is a great example of that. We've had DFS for years. And while certainly, DFS is a skill game, while certainly people do win, it's not as common. But when they win, they have an opportunity in these big tournaments to win very large prices. And I think the parlay product functions the same way. If somebody does a very large parlay with lots of legs, they have an opportunity to turn a very small bet into a large payday. And I think that's really the value prop that's unique about the parlay product relative to the singles bets. I think that's right. I think we'll be relatively flat this year. I think that we're -- obviously, some of this will depend on the cadence of state launches. But based on sort of a baseline expectation, I think will be relatively flat this year. And as you noted, I think as more and more states mature, as the market overall matures, you'll start to see it tail down a little bit. But this year, I think we're expecting to be basically flat year-over-year. Yes. I think -- so it's a great question, Ed. Certainly, there's seasonality of the business, and there are quarters where there's deeper marketing investment like Q1 and Q3. I think that, for us right now, especially given Ohio, Maryland or brand-new Massachusetts, we expect to launch, hopefully, sometime in March, I do think that, that's really the reason behind us staying with the Q4 message. I think because of those launches, we expect an even better Q4. And what we're seeing is that those states so far, Maryland and Ohio, at least are ramping faster, even in Arizona. Arizona was the fastest-ramping state we had, and some of our more recent states like Maryland and Ohio have really even been faster. So, I think the good news is that, that's going to contribute more contribution profit sooner. I just don't know if Q2 is too soon to expect that. But either way, I think that we'll be continuing to focus on efficiency, continuing to focus on trying to get profitable sooner. That's the goal of the Company. And right now, I think we're comfortable to committing to $100 million plus in EBITDA in Q4. But we're trying to get that number up, and we're trying to get every quarter to do better than what we're thinking right now. And there's a number of efficiency-oriented initiatives around the Company that I think could potentially contribute some upside. Yes, I think -- so on the first question, we've seen really strong retention rates. Obviously, we've been keeping an eye on this as hold has increased. We have other market comps that we see at even higher hold levels than us that has, I think, had decent retention. So we feel confident there's still room to increase hold without affecting churn. And thus far, we've seen only positive trends on the retention rate side. As far as March Madness, I think it's been a weird last few years. You had the cancellation of March Madness in 2020. And I think college basketball is really coming back in a big way now in terms of popularity. We're seeing more adoption in the regular season than we had in the previous couple of seasons. So, we think it's going to be a great March Madness, and I'm really looking forward to it. It will be -- hopefully, if Massachusetts gets live, it will be the first time that residents in Massachusetts will be able to bet and stay. So, I think that will be a big opportunity, and then obviously, continuing to learn more and get better on figuring out ways to drive better bet mix. That said, college sports, I will say, is one of the tougher ones on the bet mix side because a number of states don't allow player props and also people are generally just less familiar with the players, so they're more likely to combine parlays on multiple teams. So, we'll be focusing there, obviously, still trying to drive the same game parlay product, too, but I think college sports, multi-game parlay is a little bit easier than same-game parlay, given some of the dynamics I described. World Cup was great, I mean, no doubt about it. That said, it was low single digits percentage of our revenue. And I think we don't believe that there's anything really that you should adjust accordingly from World Cup. I think that was a nice little boost, but didn't have a tremendously material impact on our financials last quarter. Yes, I think what you're describing is one of the many efforts around the Company aimed at becoming more efficient. And obviously, marketing being a big expense category, team and league deals being a big expense category, we feel there's room there. We've had a number of partners that have been very constructive and have agreed to reductions that would make these deals efficient in a way that we need them to be. And there's others that we will be discontinuing when the deals come up and have discontinued as they've come up over the past year. So it's really been a mix. There's been a lot of really great partners, though. They recognized that the market's changed, have said, \"Look, we want long term to be in business with DraftKings. And we realize that this is not an efficient part of the portfolio right now, and we need to rework it.\" And there have been others that we've had to unfortunately discontinue the deals with. So it will be a mix of things, but it's really part of an overall effort that we have to be more efficient as a company. And I think there is an opportunity in this category to get even better. No. I mean we've continued to have a great relationship with Disney. ESPN, Jimmy Pitaro and his team have been great partners. So, we've really enjoyed that relationship, gotten a lot out of the partnership. And we always talk to our partners about ways that we can improve and extend and grow the relationship. And Disney and ESPN have been a great partner thus far. Yes, I'd just add that I think that because of our cash position, were there an opportunity to be aggressive in places, we don't need capital, whether equity or debt financing. So it's something, I think, if there was some strategic opportunity or something like that, perhaps we would explore. But from an organic standpoint, we don't need to. So I think it's unlikely you'll see us take out any debt and any -- I mean, any equity capital at all. And I think it's virtually impossible to imagine a scenario where we do so for organic purposes. As far as leaning in more, we are trying to be surgical, and that means not just cutting and being efficient in places that we know we need to be more efficient, but also leaning in, in places where we have the data and the conviction. That said, you asked the wrong guy in Jason Park. I don't think he's met a cost he's liked in the last year. So sometimes we have to tell Jason, you can't cut everything. But definitely, the team is, I think, as a result of having a great analytically driven culture and a great amount of data, very confident that there are places that, yes, we certainly are cutting, but we also need to be leaning into as well. The growth rate of fixed costs? No. Yes, I think there's really very little fixed cost impact of launching new states. There's some customer service sometimes, but we're also working hard to find ways to be more efficient there. So hopefully, we're able to offset any need to grow there with other efficiencies that we find. So really, it's mostly variable cost COGS that we see with new revenue coming in from new states. There's obviously marketing expense, but not really fixed cost. I think most of our functions are at scale, are pretty close. So that's why you're seeing moderate fixed cost growth this year, a significant reduction in fixed cost growth year-over-year. And I also think that the team is working hard to be more efficient. I think that there's been a real lightbulb that's gone off here that we can do more and actually grow revenue faster if we become more efficient. And there's a connection between being better focused on expense management and efficiency with revenue growth, with doing better for the customer. And I think making that connection and realizing that actually these things feed off of each other, that the better we do to manage our expenses and be more efficient as an organization, the more that we're going to be able to deliver value for the customer. And that will actually lead to market share gains and revenue growth. I think that's been a real rallying cry for the team over the past year, and it continues to be in 2023. And I think also, if you look at comps around the world, other markets, I mean growth typically occurs decades. And so obviously, growth rates go down. It's not going to continue growing at 50% forever, but I don't expect we've hit any sort of ceiling there. I know different dynamics, but the iGaming market in New Jersey, which is now coming up on almost a decade, still growing. So, I think lots of comps around really not just the world, but if you look at the U.S. lottery market and other sorts of comparisons, it's just very much a market that I think always has new customers coming into it. And I think there's an expectation that we should have that there will be a pretty steady growth for at least another decade or so. And we're still in the phase of the market where we're finding big wins on the product front. We're finding ways that we can be more smart operationally, that we can reach customers in a more effective way. So, I think there's still many years of just innovation that will drive growth in our consumer wallet share. And when we think about wallet share, we don't just think about it within our own industry. We think about our customers' entertainment wallet share. And we believe that customers will be willing to spend more time with us and spend more with us if we create better products that they find more entertaining than other things they could be doing for fun. Thank you I think they're somewhat independent. Obviously, the more that we can get some momentum behind the stock, the more attractive it becomes as a currency. But I don't think that it's really something that we really are focused on right now. We're very focused on our internal operations, focused on getting more efficient. Obviously, there will be a time in the market -- and hard to predict because we're in such a rapid phase of evolution right now. There will be a time in the market where those things really make sense and we can focus more on it. But right now, there's a lot of focus on just how we can make sure that this company is on a clear path to profitability and that we're operating in the most efficient and cost-effective way we can. I think that's a great question, and it's tough to compare to rest of world. I think the U.S. is a bit unique. My belief is that the U.S. consumer and the gaming market, a lot of the roots of it are in the lotteries where there have been lotteries across states for a lot longer than casinos and other sorts of gaming products. And that lottery mentality of big jackpots, I think, is carried over into other products. We even see it in DFS where our most attractive offerings are the large tournaments that you can enter for anywhere from $3 to $20 and win hundreds of thousands or million plus in prices. So I think that's carrying over into the U.S. market. And I actually think for that reason, parlays have more upside than they would in other parts of the world, not to say that they're not popular in other parts of the world. They call them accumulators in Europe. And certainly, that's been a big growth area overseas. But I think the U.S. customer is uniquely oriented towards the kind of proposition of bet a little to win a lot. So I think there's a lot more upside. And we're still at the infancy stages of this product. I mean there's so much we can do to innovate and make it more exciting and more fun for the consumer. I think it will be better. There will be more mature states. I think that natural kind of promotional reduction that happens as states mature, we'll continue to see a tailwind from that. Obviously, there's always going to be new entrants coming in and out of the market. I think one thing we've seen, though, is that -- and I expect the same would apply to any new entrant. The market competitively has become much more rational. We talked about this in the letter. There was a period of time in 2020 and part of 2021, where there was really a message from the market that market share and revenue growth were all that mattered. And I think you saw some rational behaviors from some of our competition coming about as a result. And I think once the market started to change their tune, and there was more of a demand on accountability for efficiency and profitability, you saw that change. And I don't see that changing again. I think that we're in a new phase of the market where competing on a much more rational playing field is the norm. And I think that you'll continue to see that, whether it be existing operators or any new operators that come into the market. Thank you. I appreciate it. Yes, we -- I mean, we are really pleased that in January, we had the number one market share in iGaming in New Jersey for the first time since we launched in December of 2018. So, great culmination of over four years of effort from the team, building products, optimizing our analytics and obviously, on-boarding a new brand in GNOG. And I think the most exciting thing is that we feel the biggest upside is yet to come when we migrate GNOG to the DraftKings' platform and product suite. That's going to hopefully happen later this year. And I think that will be -- give us an additional boost as well as provide ongoing cost savings due to not having to pay revenue share to as many third parties. So lots of benefit there and I think already seeing some great results from the product side. And also, you mentioned, too, I think we've gotten even more effective at cross-sell, I think, especially as we get more data. That's sort of our sweet spot. The more data we have, the more effective and efficient we can become. So not only have we gotten more effective at increasing cross-sell, we've being able to do it more efficiently as well. So that's something that I'm very proud of that the team has been able to make great progress on. Well, there's always seasonality in the business. So naturally, we're going to do best during heavy sports periods on the cross-sell fronts, more activity in the platform. So, we've embedded that in. But yes, I think as far as like when you adjust for that and look at where we are today, I would say, yes, although the January report is brand new. So I can't say that we necessarily like looked at the implications of that. But more so, what we do is we look at the underlying cohort data, and we bake in adjustments for seasonality as well as any other initiatives or efforts or actions that we plan on taking. Well, it's a great question, Joe. I think this is a tricky one because as we compare states, there's differences in time of year. So, we talk about Arizona ramping quickly. That was in September. And then you try to compare that to a state like Ohio or Maryland that launched Maryland towards the end of the year, Ohio Jan 1, or Massachusetts that we expect to launch in March. And you have to -- there's only a limited number of data points when you have all those different variables to really be able to say. But I think that's sort of a big-picture level. The implication is, one, there's probably some deeper investment upfront. So I think that what we've been really happy to see is that we've actually, at least through 2022, been able to absorb that by finding efficiencies throughout the rest of the business. If you look at the letter, we basically funded all of the state launches in 2022 through finding cost efficiencies elsewhere in the business. But then the other implication of it is that the inflection towards contribution profit positive happens sooner. You get greater operating leverage sooner, which means more upside from a revenue and profitability standpoint sooner. So, I think that's kind of the way to think about it. Exactly how it ends up netting out over the course of the year, I think we need a little bit more data to see. But at a macro level, that's kind of how I describe it. And it is -- no matter what, whether you take seasonality, anything else, it is unequivocally observably true that states are ramping much faster than they were three, four years ago. So, the team is working at bringing that in-house now. As far as our '23 guide, we do expect, at some point in 2023, that, that will be the case and that is built into the guide, but it won't affect the entirety of 2023. And I noted this earlier, we have already started to roll out some of our own in-house SGP -- most recently, the live SGP MBA product we rolled out, which was the first in the industry to -- we were the first in the industry to have it. So, I think that's a good signal that we're reaching a period where we have now with over a 1.5 years under our belt, lots of data to build out some of these new models. We've gotten to a point where we feel like we can put out models that are as good or better than what we can get off the shelf from third parties. I do think you're right that the technology we've built is going to be very portable to the global gaming market. And we believe that when we do decide to expand overseas, we'll have advantages over incumbent competition when it comes to product, when it comes to hold rate, things like that. That said, we are laser-focused on the U.S. and on Ontario right now. I think that the opportunity here remains very significant and growing. We have a lot of work to do to become more efficient as an organization that we need to focus on. There will be a time and a place to focus on international expansion, but it's not going to be right now. Doesn't mean that we won't look at it and start to do some exploratory work this year behind the scenes. I think we have to always be thinking about what future things we want to do and start laying some of the research and groundwork for that. But on the whole, the team is very focused on how do we continue to make progress and do better for the customer in the U.S. and how do we continue to become more efficient and cost effective as an organization. Yes, it's a great question. And I think that there are -- you noted one. I think, certainly, the opportunity for tax revenue, and should states find themselves more in need of that, that could have an effect. I also think that as an industry, we need to do a better job getting the story out there. There's a lot of great work that's been done by the EGA and other groups to really put the data out there about just how significant and large the illegal sports betting market is. And I think that's been a big driver of policymakers saying, \"Look, we got to do something here.\" I don't think there's been nearly as much coverage of the illegal iGaming market, even though it exists. I mean if you go to pretty much any of the mobile sportsbooks and online sports books that you see overseas that are operating illegally, they -- almost all of them have an online casino. It's just not talked about as much. I think inherently, it's a less social product. People talk about it less. And then like I said, the industry probably just hasn't focused as much as we could have on really making that data clear. So I think it's a combination of those two things of states that see the tax opportunity and realize that there's a real way to take something that's happening already, just like sports betting is in the illegal market and bring it into the light and protect consumers and also generate revenue for the state. That last point is correct. The only state that's not even live yet that we did assume in the guidance is Massachusetts. And the reason is it's pretty far down the line. So we felt it was more helpful to investors to get a view with Massachusetts included. But we have not assumed any other state launches from new legalization that happens this year. As far as -- I'm going to try to remember that. I think the first one, on a sort of state-by-state basis, we have not disclosed which states are contribution profit positive for '23 yet. We plan on covering that in more detail at our Investor Day later this year. So, we will be providing additional disclosure and data on that. We had to save something for that to keep -- to get you to show up, Robin. And then on -- I'm sorry, what was your second question? Oh speed and inflection. And proximity inflection. Yes, yes. So I think you're absolutely correct. One of the implications of faster ramping with new states, that the inflection to profitability and the degree of operating leverage that you get earlier is greater than what we had seen in some of the earlier states that launched in more of the 2018, '19, '20 time frame. So, there is that implication, and I think that could potentially have an effect not just with the states we're seeing launch in recent months as well as Massachusetts, but with future states that launched that again, something I think we'll address at the Investor Day. But in a nutshell, to answer your question directly, I do think it brings in the time line to path to profitability for a new state. And we'll be providing a more specific update on that later this year. Yes. Sorry. So, '23 does not. '24, we have assumed 7% to 9% or 7% to 8%, I forget, if the population launches for sports betting and 3% to 4% for iGaming. That would be, yes. And the implication, if that comes in high or low or if it's less so, while it may mean less TAM, it actually means we're probably going to have faster profitability ramp. So, I think either way, it's a good story for the Company. But obviously, we're pushing hard to get more legislation passed. No, no, sorry. We did not -- no. We assumed, other than Massachusetts, no more state launches in '23. So there will be no effect in '23 if that occurs. If we do see more states launch in '23, yes, that will happen. But what I was referring to was launches in '24. So what that would mean is that the investment period for those states would be in '24. And it would have a downward -- sorry, if there were not launches, would have a positive impact on EBITDA in 2024. Well, the bulk of our guidance increase on the EBITDA side came from direct management. So about half of it came -- or about $50 million of it, I should say, came from compensation expense, about $50 million came from marketing. So, definitely a big impact there, some of the revenue increase was hold rate and promotion optimization. Some of it was some underlying handle/retention metrics we're seeing in our cohorts. As far as state by state, I don't think there's anything in particular at the state level that's different. States are maturing as expected. And the increases we're seeing, the hold rate are happening across the board. We do see in some of the newer states that we've launched that we have faster adoption of parlays and same-game parlays. I think that's largely because our product offering is in such a better place than it was a couple of years ago. But that, I think, is probably the one example. Other than that, I think the increases that we're making to hold rate and other things that are driving underlying performance on the retention and monetization front are really across state vintages. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We had a really great finish to 2022 and are excited about 2023 and beyond. I look forward to speaking with you over the next few weeks and hope you all stay safe and well. Thank you."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Yes, let me hit on some of the highlights, including our Q4 performance, our new and improved 2023 guidance and some information on our underlying state vintages. Please note that all income statement measures, except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, we have great momentum coming out of Q4. In Q4, we posted $855 million of revenue, which represents 81% growth versus Q4 2021. This brought our full year revenue growth to 73%. Adjusted EBITDA was positive in October and was positive for the entire quarter after adjusting for the roughly $75 million investment we made in our recent launches in Maryland and Ohio. Our revenue was better than our prior guidance, primarily because of structural improvement in our sportsbook hold and fundamentally better customer trends than we expected. Customers are engaging more with our products and are less reliant on promotions. We also managed out approximately $25 million of expenses in Q4. 2023 is off to a great start. This will be a year of continued revenue growth and expense management; strong customer trends, including customer retention, handle per player, hold rate and better promotion reinvestment are enabling us to increase the midpoint of our revenue guidance from $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion. And our expense management programs have already identified $100 million of cost savings for 2023, roughly $50 million from scale marketing efficiencies and another $50 million from people-related costs. These two factors, along with our higher revenue outlook, allow us to confidently increase our adjusted EBITDA guidance range from negative $475 million to negative $575 million to negative $350 million to negative $450 million. I also wanted to spend a bit of time on foundational state economics. At any given point in time, our company results are a reflection of a combination of mature states, newer states and brand new states. Our states are performing very well, and we are seeing faster paths to positive contribution profit than we expected. For example, when we look at our 2018 to 2019 vintages states, which represents roughly 10% of the U.S. population, we are seeing great results. In 2022, those states grew net revenue by 50% versus 2021. This continued growth is due to several factors. We are seeing great customer retention, handle for retained player is growing, promotional reinvestment is coming down and hold percentage is going up. And because much of the net revenue growth is coming from less promotions and higher hold, our adjusted gross margin rate in that vintage was up more than 400 basis points in 2022 versus 2021. Finally, our absolute marketing dollars in those states decreased by more than 15%, these are important statistics and they are the foundational drivers of continued contribution profit expansion and acceleration across our states. This increase in total contribution profit, combined with much slower growth in fixed costs, results in an acceleration of our adjusted EBITDA profitability and clear progress towards achieving our long-term adjusted EBITDA goals. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line for questions. Yes. And I would add, Shaun, in terms of your question for guidance. As we saw the empirical structural hold flow-through in Q3, late Q3 and Q4, we've embedded that into our 2023 revenue guidance, which is a big part of the increase in our revenue guidance that we provided today. And I would just add, Ed -- I would just add, on World Cup that was obviously already included in the Q4 guidance that we provided in November. And when we look at the data on a customer-by-customer level, it felt more as much like a handle shift between sports that were very prevalent in Q4 as it was sort of true incrementality. Yes, I appreciate the question, Clark. Yes, just to clarify, I would not say that we're like $600 million to $800 million. I would say, greater than $700 million ending 2023. So maybe $700 million plus is probably a better way to think about it. Yes, and look, I think the most important thing is we're in a great place where we can just focus on operating the business, finding efficiencies, not having to worry about any type of financing needs. And in terms of broader questions around debt's role at DraftKings, we'll continue to evaluate the entire capital structure, obviously, the macro environment on potential instruments like that. And we'll come back to you if anything comes to fruition. Yes, great question. So and thanks for calling that part of the letter out. I'd say if you unpack the 50% revenue growth that we experienced in that 2018, 2019 vintage, probably 70% was from existing customers and, call it, 20% to 30% was from new customers. So point is even though those states were in their third or fourth full year, they were -- we were still acquiring new customers. So, we haven't found a ceiling yet in -- even in those more mature states in terms of total population penetration. And just super important, Mike, like the source of growth is -- the point is it's much more than just new customer acquisition. It is existing customer handle growth, that whole improvement and continued promo reduction that drives that net revenue growth. Yes. So in terms of your first question on hold percentage, yes, that's all embedded within the guide and the H1, H2 revenue split that we provided. So any type of empirical pattern that we're seeing that we have confidence will continue, we'll embed into our guidance. And in terms of further breakdown of P&T, S&M, G&A, fixed cost growth, I think someone earlier mentioned 10% to 12% growth, I would say that, that's pretty similar across all three of those areas. I just want to be clear, Robin, that 2024 EBITDA does include an assumption of more states legalized."

You may begin.\nStanton Dodge : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed further in our SEC filings that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements other than as required by law.

Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings presentation, which can be found on our website and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, everyone. I hope you've all enjoyed the first two months of NFL and college football as much as I have and are excited about all of the other sporting events going on, including the MLB playoffs in the first few weeks season for the NBA and NHL. We're also ready for the start of college basketball and the World Cup later this month. As you know, the fall is always a very exciting time of the year for DraftKings of the packed sports calendar featuring the four major North American sports active at the same time as well as many other exciting events. I want to discuss a few topics today starting off with our very strong third quarter. In short, our product and technology, trading, customer service and marketing teams all executed extremely well, which resulted in the best multistate NFL kickoff in our history based on our September handle and gross revenue share. We are very well prepared, and I'm very proud of the team for executing so effectively. Customers have enjoyed the new features that we rolled out around the start of NFL season such as quick parlay, quick same-game parlays and the ability to combine most of the same-game parlays. Our parlay handle mix increased 500 basis points year-over-year in Q3. And our parlay bet mix increased 1,500 basis points. And our innovative early payout capability, otherwise known as 7 up or 10 up, engaged both new and existing customers. We had an excellent launch in Kansas on September 1 with more rapid customer acquisition on a population-adjusted basis than we have with any other state launch, resulting in very attractive CAC. For the month of September, we led the state and handle share with more than twice that of the second largest operator. And based on the states that reported operator-level handle and GGR data through September, we are capturing GGR share that is at or above our long-term target as industry activity continues to coalesce towards a very limited number of operators. We announced in September that Amazon selected DraftKings as a sponsor and exclusive pregame odds provider for Thursday Night Football and Prime Video. This is a unique opportunity to engage with customers in a true digital environment. Our multiyear collaboration with Amazon will deliver fans engaging pregame content and unique betting offers on Thursday throughout the NFL season. As part of our agreement with Amazon, Thursday Night Football features DraftKings integrations in its live pregame show, including odds and additional sports betting insights. DraftKings and Amazon will also collaborate on TNF-themed offerings, including same-game parlays, which are available on the DraftKings Sportsbook app. Our content will be featured in all 15 Thursday Night Football games on Prime Video during the 2022 NFL season. In terms of financials, our third quarter revenue was $502 million, much higher than expected, supported by favorable sport outcomes as well as the aforementioned excellent execution across product technology, trading, customer service and marketing. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $264 million, also much better than anticipated due to flow-through from higher revenue and expenses shifting out of Q3 into Q4 despite marketing investments into our Kansas launch that had not been included in the expectations that we provided in early August. 2022 has been a transformative year for DraftKings. We have shifted more attention towards cost controls in our path to profitability. We identified over $100 million of annual cost savings and have significantly slowed year-over-year fixed cost growth as evidenced by our Q3 results. What I am most proud of though is that we've been able to do all of this while continuing to focus heavily on top line growth, winning competitively, and most importantly, on retaining and growing engagement with our customers. We are also seeing a benefit to our marketing efficiency from shifting towards national advertising and away from local spending, considering we're now live with mobile sports betting in 18 states that collectively represent 37% of the U.S. population. In the third quarter, we acquired more new customers at a 10% lower average CAC relative to the third quarter of 2021. And looking ahead, we'd expect CAC to decline as our state footprint continues to expand. The progress we have made over the past year on our products, customer service and internal operations has been tremendous. And our Q3 results demonstrate all of these points with both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly exceeding our expectations. It is evident that the hard work of our team this year is paying off. And we believe we are striking a great balance between maintaining an aggressive and customer-focused growth plan, while simultaneously working to manage expenses. This combination of revenue growth and expense management creates a clear path of profitability that is consistent with the long-term gross margins and adjusted EBITDA margins that we have consistently articulated. Now I'd like to move on to our financial outlook. For 2022, we are excited to be raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $45 million. We are also increasing the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million. Our guidance now includes our launching Kansas as well as our expected launch in Maryland in Q4 and pre-launch marketing investment for Ohio that we expect to launch on January 1, 2023, with both Maryland and Ohio pending licensure and regulatory approval. These three states were not included in our prior adjusted EBITDA guidance. Therefore, we are improving our guidance despite the addition of these additional marketing investments. We are also excited to share our initial 2023 outlook today, which reflects our core principles of maintaining strong growth and customer engagement while also continuing on our path to profitability as well as having a cost structure that supports our long-term margin goals. For 2023, we are introducing revenue guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of negative $575 million to $475 million. Unlike our prior guidance, our outlook now reflects our existing state footprint, including Kansas, as well as expected launches subject to licensure regulatory approvals in Maryland, Ohio and Massachusetts as well as Puerto Rico. As we've stated previously, we expect that the fourth quarter of 2023, only one year away from now, will be our first quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, as previously stated, we are well positioned from a balance sheet standpoint to reach profitability under most reasonable legalization scenarios without needing to raise any additional capital. We expect to end 2022 with a cash balance that is roughly double the high end of our guidance for our adjusted EBITDA loss in 2023. And while it's too early to guide full year 2024, our current multiyear plan suggests that we'll be approximately breakeven on a full year adjusted EBITDA basis in 2024, assuming legalization and launch trends to remain consistent with prior years. Looking ahead, the outlook for state launches continues to be positive. We anticipate launching OSB in Maryland in the fourth quarter of 2022; and Ohio, Massachusetts and Puerto Rico in 2023, which would bring our penetration of the U.S. population to 45%. Californians will vote on whether to legalize OSB on November 8. We are still deploying grassroots efforts, but the most recent polling suggests a likely unfavorable outcome for our coalition. The DraftKings has discontinued additional cash investment in the campaign. Please note that DraftKings' 2022 cash investment in California was approximately $17 million. And lastly, while it's still too early to know which states may pass OSB and iGaming legislation in 2023, we expect that several states will actively consider legislation. So there's a lot to be excited about on the regulatory front. We remain confident in our long-term outlook that states comprising 65% of the U.S. population will ultimately permit legalized OSB, and states comprising 30% of the U.S. population will ultimately permit legalized iGaming. Now I'd like to spend a few more minutes providing additional detail on our recent product enhancements. We have continued to expand the content and functionality of our Sportsbook product, which drives efficient customer acquisition as well as long-term engagement retention. The wagering content we launched for the 2022 NFL season included head-to-head matchups, several new multiplayer props and flash player market and full time and anytime squares. Head-to-head matchups include spreads, moneylines and totals on all our player subcategories to improve the depth our derivative player offering. Multiplayer props include game and highest total from a list of options to increase the variety of player-propped bet types. Player flash costs include player-specific next-drive and next-play markets to increase the depth of our player performance offering. And full-time and anytime squares is our model-driven squares product, which we've now extended to every game in the season. DraftKings also added new functionality such as early payoffs for moneyline wagers, quick parlay and quick same-game parlay as well as the ability for users to combine multiple same game parlays. Early payout is a newly introduced mechanic to settle moneyline bets once the team reaches a certain point lead. Quick parlay is a new interface for customers to build larger parlays with more cross-port play as well. Quick SGP features dozens of prepackaged same-game parlay bets per game for all same-game parlay sports. And SGPx allows customers parlay same-game parlays with other same-game parlays and singles from different games, which increases the size and average leg count of parlays. It has been an exciting 12 months of product and technology innovation enabled by our vertical integration with much more to come. For iGaming, we recently introduced player contributed jackpots in response to customer demand and are the only operator in the U.S. with its in-house capability. Players can opt in for an additional modest wager for a chance to win potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars. We believe this product functionality will increase customer engagement and demonstrates our continued differentiation from competition. And now I'll turn the call over to DraftKings' CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our third quarter results and refreshed outlook.\nJason Park: Thanks, Jason, and hello, everyone. I'll start off by providing more granularity pertaining to Q3, and then I'll shift to the outlook for Q4 and 2023. Please note that all income statement measures discussed, except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. We executed very well in Q3. Customer activity was robust, supported by new product functionality that we rolled out around the start of the NFL season. We have continued to look at detailed cohort data and are not seeing any discernible indication that the macroeconomic environment is impacting our overall customer engagement. In Q3, we generated $502 million of revenue and negative $264 million of adjusted EBITDA, both significantly outperformed the expectations that we provided on our Q2 call in August. Our B2C segment revenue increased 161% versus Q3 of 2021 as compared to Q2 2022's year-over-year growth rate of 68%. Sport outcomes certainly were favorable to our operators this quarter, lapping unfavorable outcomes last year. Our strong execution across acquisition, retention and monetization initiatives for our core product offerings was also a driver of our outperformance. In Q3, favorable sport outcomes contributed approximately $70 million of revenue. On our call in August, we provided a rule of thumb for you to understand potential revenue volatility in Q3. As most of you are well aware, it was an operator-friendly quarter. NFL underdogs generally did well in September. For example, three of the biggest underdogs won in week one, including the Seahawks, Steelers and Bears. In addition, several Sunday night, Monday night and Thursday night football games fell in our favor. These games tend to attract higher handle per game relative to other NFL games. And isolating just these 11 primetime games in the third quarter, our hold rate was greater than 10%. It's important to note we launched Kansas on September 1, and we had not included that in our prior guidance due to significant uncertainty about that launch date. Kansas generated negative $8 million of net revenue in the quarter, consistent with our standard new state launch playbook. Kansas is off to a fantastic start. Net revenue growth also benefited from a less promotional environment than in Q3 of 2021. For the industry as a whole, we saw more rational behavior, which we expect to persist. And within the DraftKings business, we deployed more surgical promotions based on player-specific gross profit profile and as we have consistently reiterated are reinvesting less as cohorts mature. We had 1.6 million monthly unique payers in Q3, which is 22% higher than the prior year period. It's important to remember that Q3 2021 included the conclusion of the NBA playoffs, while the NBA playoffs were completed before Q3 in 2022. Notably, in September alone, MUPs increased 27% year-over-year to 2.7 million, which is typically our seasonally strongest month of the year for MUPs due to the kickoff of the NFL season. Average revenue per monthly unique payer or ARPMUP more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $100 with solid gross margin flow-through. This balance of player growth and revenue per player growth is very healthy as promotional intensity naturally declines as states mature.  Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was negative $264 million, which is $50 million better than the negative $314 million of adjusted EBITDA in the prior year period and significantly outperformed the expectations for Q3 that we provided on our August call primarily due to the higher-than-anticipated revenue. Our Q3 performance was especially impressive, given that it included investment in our Kansas launch, which was not included in our previous guidance. Additionally, certain expenses, principally within our marketing and G&A line items, shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. As a reminder, revenue upside driven by favorable outcomes and revenue downside driven by unfavorable outcomes typically flows through to our adjusted EBITDA at a high incremental margin, given certain expenses within our cost of revenues are tied to deposits in handle rather than gross or net revenue. Gross margin rate for Q3 was 34% and increased 100 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. On a year-over-year basis, the inclusion of New York and our continued mix shift out of our DFS product into our growing Sportsbook and iGaming products significantly limited our gross margin rate improvement. However, I was pleased that the OSB in iGaming states where we were live prior to Q3 2021 saw an increase in gross profit of over $110 million primarily due to revenue growth as well as a meaningful reduction in promotional intensity. We continue to expect our gross margin rate to be approximately 40% for full year 2022 and to improve in 2023 into the low to mid-40% range as our promotional intensity naturally declines across our portfolio of states. Sales and marketing expense was up 8% versus Q3 of 2021. For our states that have been live for more than a year, external marketing spend was down 20% on a year-over-year basis. And we generated significant contribution profit from these states in Q3 2022 compared to a deep loss in Q3 2021, which was largely driven by unfavorable outcomes. We continue to be pleased with our LTV-to-CAC ratios and continue to be on track for a three-year gross profit payback. As we mentioned on our Q2 call, our fixed expense growth began to moderate meaningfully in the third quarter with products and technology, and general and administrative expenses up 37% and 28%, respectively, compared to the prior year period. The growth in P&T expenses is primarily the result of the additional engineering and product management resources we've added over the past year to help build the best product in the industry and to continuously strengthen our data science capabilities. For G&A expense, the growth is largely a reflection of the increased investment in our customer experience capabilities, which we expect will continue to grow as we add new customers but at a slower pace than previous quarters as we reach scale and lap the significant investments we made late in the second half of 2021 and early in 2022. Moving into guidance. Please note that unlike the guidance that we have provided in the past, we are now guiding 2022 and 2023 inclusive of states that have legalized and in which it is reasonably foreseeable that we will launch during the guided period. Specifically, our 2022 guidance now includes Kansas, which launched in September as well as Maryland, which we expect to launch in the fourth quarter and prelaunch marketing spend related to Ohio, which we expect to launch on January 1, 2023, both pending licensure and regulatory approvals. Looking at 2022, we are pleased to be raising our full year revenue outlook to a range of $2.16 billion to $2.19 billion from a range of $2.08 billion to $2.18 billion, which increases the midpoint of our guidance to $2.175 billion from $2.13 billion. The midpoint of our increased revenue guidance implies 68% growth compared to the full year 2021. We are increasing our revenue guidance due to the strength we saw in our online gaming verticals in Q3. For newly included states, we expect Maryland to contribute negative revenue as we invest in the state in the early weeks following its launch. In Q4, we expect to generate about $790 million in revenue based on the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance, which represents substantial year-over-year growth and planned reinvestment in customers who have significant unlucky outcomes early in the football season. Our Q4 expectations also reflect continued softness in the broader NFT market, which has impacted our new Reignmakers vertical. Looking at MUPs and ARPMUP, we expect ARPMUP growth to be higher than MUP growth for the full year. Moving on to our adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are improving the midpoint of our full year 2022 guidance by $10 million to negative $790 million despite now including Kansas, which launched in September as well as investments in expected state launches for Maryland and Ohio. The significant improvement in our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance on a comparable basis was primarily driven by higher revenue combined with cost discipline, particularly in the marketing and G&A expense lines. I'm proud that we expect to land materially better than where we thought at the beginning of the year despite launching in new states. There has been an ongoing effort throughout the year to drive and capture efficiencies, which has resulted in more than $100 million of in-year cost savings in 2022. We will continue to focus diligently on this area of the business for the remainder of this year and beyond. Finally, I want to reiterate that we continue to expect at least 10 states to be contribution profit positive for full year 2022. Today, we are also introducing 2023 guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue for full year 2023 to be between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion and adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023 to be negative $575 million to negative $475 million. For our full year 2023 guidance, we are assuming that Maryland launches in Q4 2022, Ohio and Massachusetts launch in Q1 2023 and Puerto Rico launches in Q3 2023. We expect launches in new jurisdictions on a combined basis to generate less than 5% of full year 2023 revenue and to account for approximately 25% of our full year 2023 negative adjusted EBITDA. In 2023, we expect gross margin to improve slightly relative to 2022 as we reduced promotional intensity in more mature states, partially offset by new state launches and continued mix shift out of DFS. Our population weighted average state age will be 2.6 years exiting 2023 versus 1.8 years exiting 2022. And if that number appreciates, the gross margin rate is expected to improve dramatically. We expect fixed cost growth to slow meaningfully, while variable marketing will largely depend upon how many new users we acquire. Last, I'll touch on our liquidity position. With close to $1.4 billion in cash as of September 30 and our guided adjusted EBITDA range for the fourth quarter combined with expected other usages, we are poised to exit the year with between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of cash. Based on our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance and other expected cash usages next year, we expect to end 2023 with more than $500 million in cash on the balance sheet. It's important to note that a significant amount of our 2022 cash outflows such as $97 million in net cash paid for GNOG are not expected to recur in 2023. Looking out to 2024, we would expect adjusted EBITDA to be roughly breakeven on a full year basis under most reasonable legalization and launch scenarios.  So, in summary, we believe we are well capitalized to become free cash flow positive with existing resources. And the business is on a clear path to achieve our long-term gross margin and EBITDA margin targets. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz : I wanted to just touch on Golden Nugget for a minute. And I realize it's not right down the middle and probably why it isn't necessarily core of the discussion. But iGaming becomes discussed more and more, its profit potential, its long-term growth, et cetera. How are you doing with that, what are you doing with that? What can you share with us? And how should we look at its prospects, please?\nJason Robins : Thank you. Great question. So everything is going really well with the integration. We started to realize some synergies, particularly on the marketing side. Really, the biggest synergies will come next year when we migrate the entire Golden Nugget operation onto our platform. So very excited about that. That should hopefully be in the back half of the year, we'll complete that migration. So everything is on track, teams are gelling nicely and really excited about the future of Golden Nugget as a way to penetrate deeper into the iGaming market.\nDavid Katz : Can I follow up, please, on that? Is it in and of itself? And are we able to tell, is it profitable today? Is it offsetting some of the investments that you're making on the OSB side? And is it large enough to do that?\nJason Robins : We haven't broken out Golden Nugget separately, but I believe we said that we expect any impact to the bottom line to be de minimis.\nDavid Katz : Understood.\nJason Robins : For 2022.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley : Jason or Jason, just wanted to ask a little bit more about kind of hold versus product mix. Obviously, Jason Robins, you outlined a bunch of new product initiatives and your parlay mix being materially higher in the quarter. I imagine a lot of those changes are here to stay. So we're sort of trying to wrap our minds around go-forward hold rates as some of these new product initiatives take hold and sort of what's the ability to push that percentage higher relative to what we saw in the quarter, which is obviously a lot of luck-based outcomes as well. So if you could just talk about some of those trade-offs and how you thought about it or what's baked into 2023.\nJason Robins : Yes. Great question. I think that a lot of progress has been made on the whole front primarily driven by our improvement in bet mix year-over-year. That's largely been product as well as merchandising and marketing. So as mentioned, we launched a whole host of parlay, same-game parlay as well as combinations of multiple same-game parlays, launched prepacks, many other features. And I think the team has done a great job merchandising and marketing those two, including through our NFL Thursday Night Football relationship with Amazon. So lots of, I think, parts of the company executing to drive that mix, and it's definitely improved hold rate. And I think we should continue to see improvement. We feel like there's a lot of tailwind there. As far as what's baked in, we've been pretty cautious about baking in improvement. I think as usually is the case with our guidance, we typically only include things that we have clear line of sight to. I think 2022 has been a great example of that. In February, we guided to minus $875 million in EBITDA. Now we're guiding to minus $790 million, and that's with the inclusion of Ontario, Maryland, Ohio and Kansas, which were not in the $875 million. So almost $100 million better on the bottom line with the absorption of four state flash province launches. And that was because at the time, that's what we had line of sight to. But we rallied the team around a number of different cost initiatives throughout the year. We're able to over -- save over $100 million in year savings. So that's typically how we approach guidance. And I think it's the same thing here where we're guiding to what we feel like we currently have line of sight to and can make a commitment to. We very much view our credibility as the most important thing, and I want to make sure we're never signing up to a number that we don't think we can achieve. But we always go out there and try to do better, too. And I think 2022 is a great example of that, where we continually throughout the year, we're able to improve guidance despite the launch of new states each and every quarter. And so that's our goal every year, and that's what we're going to try to do again in '23.\nShaun Kelley : And then maybe as my follow-up, could you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about sort of some of these fixed marketing investments relative or -- and sponsorship deals relative to variable going forward? Obviously, the big Amazon partnership you outlined for Thursday Night Football, ESPN is another one where you have a relationship, but there could potentially be more. So just maybe strategically, how are you thinking about investing in these types of deals where maybe there's more committed spend relative to things that could be more variable and more directly tied to top line outcomes.\nJason Robins : The majority of our marketing spend is not committed. It's completely controllable. We're pretty selective with deals, but we feel really good about the Amazon deal. I think it's one of the better deals that we've had in recent years and very excited about the results we've seen through the first several weeks of Thursday Night Football with that one. But no, most of our marketing spend is not committed. We like to keep flexibility so that we can optimize in and out of things.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Young with Morgan Stanley.\nEdward Young : My first question is just a clarification really. You touched on it, Jason Park, in the comments, but I wonder if you could quantify the EBITDA impact from Kansas and the Q4 investments in Maryland and Ohio just to give us a sense of your underlying assumptions you're making in this year's guidance? And then my broader question, again, any sort of quantification would be useful about how you think about operating leverage into next year. So could you give some color on the moving parts, particularly around promotions of your sort of GGR, NGR conversion around the marketing ratio and your kind of OpEx growth versus cost out for next year?\nJason Park : Yes. Yes, absolutely. Our full year 2022 and the 2023 guide that we provided today includes Kansas, which has obviously already launched as well as the expected imminent launch in Maryland, Ohio. And we've also included Massachusetts and Puerto Rico. In terms of Q4, what you're seeing there is a little bit of flow-through from the slightly lower revenue outlook in Q4. And that slightly revenue -- lower revenue outlook is due to the planned reinvestment in a very surgical way for players who had unlucky hold in Q3 as well as some headwinds from the Reignmakers NFT product. So that's impacting the Q4 EBITDA. But the major change in the Q4 EBITDA is the inclusion of Maryland and Ohio, which we are now including in Q4 EBITDA guide. And then in terms of 2023, again, we are including Massachusetts, Maryland, Ohio, Puerto Rico. And as I mentioned on the call, about 5% of the revenue guide comes from those new states and 25% of the EBITDA loss comes from those new states. So if you think about the implied flow-through with and without new states, I think you're well north of a 60% implied flow-through on the incremental revenue in 2023 on a no-new state basis.\nJason Robins : Yes. I think that's an important takeaway. One of the things, I think, that is very different this year and this quarter, I should say, is that we guided with new states in. We've never done that before. We realize that's a shift. And it's a response to investors saying, listen, if you have line of sight with relative certainty to state launch dates, and we do in that we received our license in Maryland. It's not a certainty, but it's a pretty narrow window. We expect to launch there. Same -- pending, of course, additional approvals that we require. Same thing in Ohio. Pending approvals, they've set Jan 1 as a launch date. In Massachusetts, the Gaming Commission voted to launch in March. So felt like those were sufficiently close enough around the quarter and had sufficient certainty around at least a narrow range of timing. Obviously, if something changes, we'll come back and update. But that is a change, and I think may have muddied the waters a little bit on some of the comparisons that did not include those states. And as Jason Park noted, if you take out those states, we're guiding to under $400 million loss in 2023. So I think that at least some of the analyst numbers out there that might be a more apples-to-apples comparison versus the guide we just provided, which was for the first time, including several new states.\nJason Park : And then, Ed, on your question just broadly on cost going into 2023, the -- I think the right way to think about it as you look at the 2023 guide, the commentary on gross margin rate, if you look at the implied total operating expense growth, I think you're looking at single-digit growth rate going into 2023. We've talked about on the last few quarters a meaningfully slower fixed cost growth next year. So on a total OpEx, you're looking at single digits. And we're not breaking out how much of that is variable marketing versus fixed marketing, but certainly a meaningful slowdown in cost. And I've also mentioned that we're continuing to look for more and more opportunities on that front.\nEdward Young : And I appreciate all the detail there. And I think the [525] split for the new launches next year is particularly useful to give us the like-for-like comparison. But just on the Q4, are you able to -- are you not able to give us a quantification of the investment for Maryland and Ohio, the cost shift Reignmakers to get just an idea. You've obviously beaten quite decent in Q3 and not much has been passed on to the full year guide in terms of EBITDA. So just trying to think about what the underlying dynamic looks like there?\nJason Park : I mean, what I do is I think you can flow through the revenue decline and that the revenue sort of a slightly lower revenue outlook in Q4 to the Q4 EBITDA. And you can basically say the rest due to the new states.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet : I just had a quick question on, I think, are pretty significant share gains that you've had across a number of states. And I was just wondering if you can confirm that, that's true. And then B, is that sort of tethered to the lower promotional activity that's going on? Or would you pin that on some of the enhancements that you've made?\nJason Robins : Thank you. Yes, we did see a nice share increase to start NFL. We typically do very well in NFL relative to other sports. So there's a little bit of seasonality in there. But if I had to point to it, I would say the two things you touched on are the biggest drivers, the product enhancements, which have been substantial. We shipped a lot of stuff right before NFL. And I think that created some real interesting points of differentiation as well as closed all material competitive gaps. And then secondly is the lower sort of promotion, which is a larger story, really. It's a subset of the more rational competitive environment we're seeing this year versus last year was truly night and day. As far as the competitive environment and the rationality behind it, there was still certainly some aggressive investments by some of our competitors, but nothing that was, I think, out of the ordinary. And I think certainly, the change in that promotion environment as well as in the external marketing spend of some of the competitors helped us gain some share as well.  But if I had to, like I said, point to anything, I'd say it's the product enhancements that we made, probably number one. Number two would be the more rationalizing competitive environment. And then number three would be that this is seasonally typically a better time of year for us, given our strength in NFL.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly : Great. Just circling back on MUPs. Given your, I guess, the higher hold, did you see elevated churn in September and October? And I think, Jason, you mentioned MUPs grew 27% in September. Can you give us the October growth rate? And then just a follow-up question. Just on Amazon, Jason, you mentioned strong customer engagement. Can you sort of speak to some of the metrics you're seeing around engagement with the Amazon Thursday Night Football deal?\nJason Robins : Sure. I'll start on the second one. So really, there's two things that have been, I think, the primary kind of benefits of that relationship. One are just the new customers that we've acquired; and two, is by really pushing same-game parlay on Thursday Night Football, which is a perfect setup for it, it's the one game on. So it's a great time to do that. We've seen real material movement in bet mix. So those have been two real positive stories from that partnership. And as far as MUPs, I think the key thing with MUPs has been that last year, if you're looking at the -- this is why we broke out September because it is a little bit neater of a -- cleaner of a comparison. But if you look at 2021, July had -- I think it was a few games of NBA. So that drove up that July MUPs number quite substantially, whereas this year, NBA ended in Q2. So we didn't get any Q3 NBA. July, obviously, given the way the MUPs calculation is doing is done is 1/3 of the calculation. So that definitely was a -- I think the biggest kind of story in why the Q3 MUPs growth was less than the September MUPs growth. And then on the flip side of that, the really significant growth in ARPMUP, part of that was the same thing because the denominator for last year included only some players that only participated in a handful of days in July. They were primarily NBA players that didn't come back until September. For NFL, that revenue number per player look, it's a numerator, denominator thing looked a little bit better this year, I think. So always hard to tell, given that the sport calendar changes year-over-year. So it's a bit of a complex thing. It's always hard to kind of tell, which is why we don't guide some MUPs and ARPMUP. It's a nice KPI and a good measure of the health of the business. But you add into things like predicting is the NBA playoffs going to go into July when you start thinking about guiding to MUPs or ARPMUP. So we've just sort of stayed away from it because it's a little volatile, given the sport calendar changes.\nJed Kelly : Got it. But churn has sort of been in line with what we thought it would be, given the above-average holds?\nJason Robins : Yes. I mean, I think that when we look at churn, we look at it on a player-by-player basis. So there have certainly been some optimizations we've made year-to-year to pare back bonus hunters and other sorts of things that, I think, is good churn. But as far as the underlying health of the cohorts, we're seeing the same thing that we've seen in previous quarters and continue to see no real impact from anything micro like higher hold, nor in terms of churn, nor are we seeing any impact from the macroeconomic environment either. So we continue to keep an eye on that. That's something we monitor very closely, but the cohorts from all respects, look very healthy to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli : Just back on that point, Jason Park, you mentioned earlier that the 3Q unfavorable loss kind of led to some tactical reinvestment in the 4Q or that you're programming for the 4Q. I'm assuming most of that was in October. But as you think about your experience to date with players whose accounts have basically gone to zero, what does the retention look like on that customer once they've already kind of gone through their funding?\nJason Robins : Yes. I mean we -- it's a good question. I think that's probably a little granular for what we'd like to cover on an earnings call. But what I will say is that we have quite a few model-based trigger campaigns set up to try to reach players before their balances go down to zero. And I think that also reinvestment, and you noted that's part of why you're seeing the Q3 to Q4 -- or excuse me, Q4 into Q3 revenue shift. We actually last quarter did it the other way around. But then given the outcomes came in, we flipped it this time. That's the result of us trying to make sure that our players are staying active that when there are negative sport outcomes, we're giving them good promotions to get them to reactivate. And that there's an overall sort of amount of return to player that we're still -- I mean it's the ultimate question. But every day, we get a little smarter in understanding what that should look like to maximize long-term lifetime value. So that's really how we look at it is there's a number of different levers between some that are uncontrollable like sport outcomes, some that are controllable like promotional intensity. And there's probably an optimal total return to player that needs to be reached. And it's probably different for different segments of players, and we're constantly trying to optimize that equation.\nCarlo Santarelli : Great. And then if I could, just one follow-up as it pertains to the balance sheet. The cash used in the period was about -- I think, about $132 million. You guys spent, I think, somewhere in kind of software costs, et cetera, $22 million or so in the period and had the $264 million EBITDA loss. So that $150 million gap, it looks like a source of cash, could you kind of bridge that for me? Is there something that I'm missing in there?\nJason Park : Yes, Carlo. So basically, the major part of the bridge is the working capital use -- source of cash in Q3. So if you recall back in Q1, Q2, we had slight uses of cash and Q3 as the source of cash. And I would just comment that on a full year basis, we don't -- I don't anticipate working capital being a meaningful source or use of cash, consistent with businesses of our type.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord Genuity.\nMichael Graham : The first question is just you mentioned the national advertising mix. And I just wonder if you could give us an update on where you are in the arc of transforming that mix? And what do you expect kind of the terminal mix between national and local to be? And then I just wanted to ask Jason about how you're thinking about the probability, I guess, that the U.S. economy will go into a recession next year? How would you expect that to impact your business? And how is it affecting your planning?\nJason Robins : Yes. Good question. So on the first one, we've, over the last few years, said that as we get to north of around 35% of the population having legal online sports betting, that would be a turning point where national advertising would start to become, in many cases, more efficient than local advertising. We're just crossing that threshold now. We are in states that represent about 37% of population. So just starting to see some small impacts and favorability from that. As I think we noted on the call, we had CACs that were 10% better than we expected, and we actually beat our total forecast for new customers acquired. So we were able to get scale and efficiency. And I think part of that is starting to get a little bit of benefit from this national advertising shift. That should only continue to increase. We have states right now that represent 8% of the population that are in the next five months or so projected to launch, the ones that we mentioned, Maryland, Ohio and Massachusetts pending licensure and regulatory approvals, of course. That will really start to add additional tailwind. And then it really just continues to go from there because as each new state comes on, you're reaching customers that already are seeing those national ads. You don't have to advertise locally as much anymore. So really, I think, a big tailwind behind our back now, and you're starting to see that in some of the Q3 results. And then I'm sorry, what was the second question?\nMichael Graham: Just how you're thinking about a recession -- a possible recession.\nJason Robins : Yes. So we've definitely looked at different scenarios where if there were some kind of recession and if it were impactful to consumer behavior of our segment of customers that what could that look like? What would that mean for revenue next year? What would that mean for how we have to manage costs? So we're well prepared for that. And right now, we're not seeing any sign of that. So we're managing to the environment that we are seeing. But we are prepared to shift pretty quickly if we do start to see anything that concerns us. And fortunately, right now, we're not seeing that, but always good to be prepared.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham.\nBernie McTernan: Since you last struck the partnership deal with ESPN, even though it's just a short time ago, the landscape of U.S. sports betting has changed a lot. So thinking about key priorities with any media partnership now as we sit here versus a couple of years ago, are there any major changes that you would look for now that maybe weren't a key priority a couple of years ago?\nJason Robins: I think with anything we're doing, we're looking at it the same way, which is what is the impact of any partnership we might establish on our financials over the course of the partnership and if relevant beyond. And does that check out against what we view as the expense of the partnership? So really, that's how we evaluate everything. If you look at it kind of down to some of the more specific KPIs, as noted in the past, we look at gross profit payback of three years or less for new customers. And I think that's something that always comes into play because many partnerships with media companies are mostly about customer acquisition. So that's really how we've always looked at it. Nothing's changed too much there. I will say that the environment has improved dramatically year-over-year and that some of the deals that really at that time, I think last year, we had to pass on. I think in today's environment, would be more rationally priced. So we're always keeping an eye out for opportunities. But also, as I noted earlier, we have more than half of our marketing spend and actually substantial -- excuse me, more than 2/3 of our marketing spend as variable. And we like to keep flexibility around being able to optimize in and out of things. So always very careful before doing any partnership that we have historical data from testing on those channels, and feel very good about the commitments we're making in light of the benefits that we expect to receive.\nBernie McTernan: Great. That's really helpful. And then as a follow-up, you spoke about the same profitability framework for 4Q '23 irrespective of California passing. Now that it doesn't seem like California is going to pass and you're not going to have those customer acquisition costs in the quarter, are those going to be redeployed into anywhere else that maybe now you have the luxury you're spending on that you didn't -- that there's a chance you wouldn't have prior?\nJason Robins : That's a great question. The answer is yes. So we had a California plan and a non-California plan. Obviously, anything can happen. If we all wake up on Tuesday and Wednesday, I guess, and find out it passed, and we'll give it back to the California plan, but it wasn't the same plan. It wasn't as simple as saying we tack on California to what we just guided to now. There are definitely trade-offs that would have needed to be made and that we were prepared to make if California were to launch. So great question. And I think really, what we've continuously said is that we are absolutely committed to controlling our own destiny that we have a clear path to profitability with cushion on the cash balance that we have today. And that was irrespective of whether California launched or not. And so we had two different plans, one with and one without California. Right now, we're planning on executing it without since that looks like where it's going, but we're ready to pivot on a dime if we get a pleasant surprise, although that's certainly not what I'm expecting next week.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum.\nRyan Sigdahl : Two questions for us. First one, curious that parlay is a big focus, obviously, for everybody and you guys. But what about in-game betting? How has that trended as a percent of sales the last few quarters and then expectations going forward?\nJason Robins : So in-game betting is definitely also an area of focus. We've seen since we've launched continued improvement in mix of live betting. I think one of the really interesting things about the early win promo that we ran this year is that part of the design behind it was you're paying out in game and can we use that to then merchandise and drive more live betting. And we've seen really good, I think, impact from when we've had those early payouts on driving up live betting. So it definitely continues to be a focus. I know we've talked about parlay a lot, but that's just because we felt like that was where the biggest gap was competitively on the bet mix side and why we are holding below at least FanDuel. So I think that, that's really why we've talked a lot about that, but it doesn't mean internally that live betting hasn't been a big focus and it continues to be. It's a great way of keeping the customer engaged throughout the game.\nRyan Sigdahl : And then just as I think about DraftKings relative to FanDuel, it seems like you guys are a bit more aggressive speaking on you mentioned early win and some of those other creative promotions and reinvestment in some temporary or short-term unlucky players, et cetera, outcomes, but a little bit less on the national advertising. How do you think about balancing new player bonuses versus existing player retention loyalty versus national and kind of brand building marketing?\nJason Robins : Yes, that's a very important question. It's one of those along with the kind of return to your question, and I mentioned earlier that really important for us to continue to optimize what's the right balance of -- if you think of all of it as sort of this broad category of marketing, what's the right balance of advertising spend versus promotional spend. And I think we're still along our journey of figuring that out, but definitely gets smarter every day. And I think this year, we were able to improve how we've optimized against both such that the overall rate of promotion was lower for us this year. Our advertising spend on a per customer basis, our CAC, I should say, has improved. We mentioned 10% better than expected in Q3 this year. And we've been able to do all that while still hitting or exceeding our new customer targets. So I feel like we've made great progress there, but there's still a lot of work to be done to figure out the right balance of where those investments are made.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Stauff with Susquehanna.\nJoseph Stauff : First question, I just wanted maybe to follow up on kind of users. I think you said for the full year, Jason Park, that the relationship between MUPs and monetization -- or will be more monetization. But I was wondering to what degree? I mean, obviously, in the third quarter, you had 22% MUP growth and significant monetization. Just wondering if you can, say, tighten up sort of expectations in terms of that relationship in the fourth quarter. And really, how you think about it based on your 2023 guide.\nJason Robins : Yes. So great question. I think some of it is controllable. Most of it's not. So a big reason why you saw substantially more ARPMUP than MUP growth in this quarter or in Q3, I should say, was the NBA bleed into July last year and this year, you didn't. So that obviously drove the denominator up last year, drove it down this year, but then in turn, also increased the ARPMUP. So I think some of that is sort of just sport calendar-dependent. For us, we're trying to maximize total long-term player LTV regardless of how -- of what form that comes in. So we don't really look at it as one is better than the other. It's more how do we maximize the LTV that we're generating from the players that we acquire. So that's really what guides us. And I think in the short term, we look at maximizing revenue but also making sure that we're not doing that at the expense of future revenue either. So really, we look at it more holistically. And I think those KPIs are more just a measure for us to understand underlying what's going on in the business.\nJoseph Stauff : Makes sense. And then as a follow-up, I was wondering what your expectations were for World Cup relative to your 4Q guide?\nJason Robins : Yes. World Cup will be interesting. We haven't really talked too much about it. We're not breaking it out separately as we don't with any other sports. So it will be interesting to see what kind of engagement we get. And I think that's probably one of the examples of something that if it significantly outperforms our expectations could be a positive catalyst for the quarter. But we don't have a ton of data on World Cup. So it's really tough to say what to expect from it.\nJason Park : And certainly, Joe, not a lot of data of World Cup in Q4.\nJason Robins : Yes. Yes, exactly. Makes a big difference.\nJoseph Stauff : And could I just squeeze a last one in just in terms of your DFS. Is -- how did DFS, I guess, perform in the third quarter? Is it kind of still like low single-digit type grower?\nJason Robins : Yes, that's about right. DFS continues to be a slow grower for us, but one that's very important because in addition to providing revenue that flows through at a very high margin, it also is really a huge source of new customers for us every time we enter a new state for OSB or iGaming.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jordan Bender with JMP Securities.\nJordan Bender : On the iGaming side, can you talk about the pace of new content coming on to your platform? And then maybe any improvements you've made on that end?\nJason Robins : Yes. The biggest thing that we just launched -- and this was a big one that was a lot of work in the making, very proud of the product team was our jackpot functionality. It's totally unique to the market. No one else -- no other operators have it. It allowed players to opt in to a separate jackpot pool, which then once it hits gets paid out, usually very high sums. So really appealing, interesting, attractive product that I think gets at a lot of what players are looking for, which is the opportunity to put a small amount of money to work and potentially get a big payday. So very excited about that. That's the most significant thing we've launched. For the year though, we've been launching tons of new content, lots of games, some of which are homegrown and unique, some of which are through third-party integrations, but always looking to build out the content and make sure that we have both the best and most popular titles out there but also unique and differentiated offerings like our rocket game or like this jackpot functionality that we just recently launched.\nOperator: I'd like to turn the call back over to Jason Robins, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nJason Robins : Thank you for all joining us today on the call. We had an excellent third quarter, really excited about performance there. And we feel we're really well positioned for a very strong finish to 2022 and really well set up for 2023 going into 2024, which we expect to be roughly breakeven, potentially our first full profitable year and then, of course, Q4 of 2023, which we expect to be our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. So very excited about the future, only one year away, we think, from our first positive adjusted EBITDA quarter. I look forward to speaking with you all over the next few weeks. And hope everybody stays safe and well and enjoys a very exciting time on the sports calendar through the remainder of the year. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I hope you've all enjoyed the first two months of NFL and college football as much as I have and are excited about all of the other sporting events going on, including the MLB playoffs in the first few weeks season for the NBA and NHL. We're also ready for the start of college basketball and the World Cup later this month. As you know, the fall is always a very exciting time of the year for DraftKings of the packed sports calendar featuring the four major North American sports active at the same time as well as many other exciting events. I want to discuss a few topics today starting off with our very strong third quarter. In short, our product and technology, trading, customer service and marketing teams all executed extremely well, which resulted in the best multistate NFL kickoff in our history based on our September handle and gross revenue share. We are very well prepared, and I'm very proud of the team for executing so effectively. Customers have enjoyed the new features that we rolled out around the start of NFL season such as quick parlay, quick same-game parlays and the ability to combine most of the same-game parlays. Our parlay handle mix increased 500 basis points year-over-year in Q3. And our parlay bet mix increased 1,500 basis points. And our innovative early payout capability, otherwise known as 7 up or 10 up, engaged both new and existing customers. We had an excellent launch in Kansas on September 1 with more rapid customer acquisition on a population-adjusted basis than we have with any other state launch, resulting in very attractive CAC. For the month of September, we led the state and handle share with more than twice that of the second largest operator. And based on the states that reported operator-level handle and GGR data through September, we are capturing GGR share that is at or above our long-term target as industry activity continues to coalesce towards a very limited number of operators. We announced in September that Amazon selected DraftKings as a sponsor and exclusive pregame odds provider for Thursday Night Football and Prime Video. This is a unique opportunity to engage with customers in a true digital environment. Our multiyear collaboration with Amazon will deliver fans engaging pregame content and unique betting offers on Thursday throughout the NFL season. As part of our agreement with Amazon, Thursday Night Football features DraftKings integrations in its live pregame show, including odds and additional sports betting insights. DraftKings and Amazon will also collaborate on TNF-themed offerings, including same-game parlays, which are available on the DraftKings Sportsbook app. Our content will be featured in all 15 Thursday Night Football games on Prime Video during the 2022 NFL season. In terms of financials, our third quarter revenue was $502 million, much higher than expected, supported by favorable sport outcomes as well as the aforementioned excellent execution across product technology, trading, customer service and marketing. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $264 million, also much better than anticipated due to flow-through from higher revenue and expenses shifting out of Q3 into Q4 despite marketing investments into our Kansas launch that had not been included in the expectations that we provided in early August. 2022 has been a transformative year for DraftKings. We have shifted more attention towards cost controls in our path to profitability. We identified over $100 million of annual cost savings and have significantly slowed year-over-year fixed cost growth as evidenced by our Q3 results. What I am most proud of though is that we've been able to do all of this while continuing to focus heavily on top line growth, winning competitively, and most importantly, on retaining and growing engagement with our customers. We are also seeing a benefit to our marketing efficiency from shifting towards national advertising and away from local spending, considering we're now live with mobile sports betting in 18 states that collectively represent 37% of the U.S. population. In the third quarter, we acquired more new customers at a 10% lower average CAC relative to the third quarter of 2021. And looking ahead, we'd expect CAC to decline as our state footprint continues to expand. The progress we have made over the past year on our products, customer service and internal operations has been tremendous. And our Q3 results demonstrate all of these points with both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly exceeding our expectations. It is evident that the hard work of our team this year is paying off. And we believe we are striking a great balance between maintaining an aggressive and customer-focused growth plan, while simultaneously working to manage expenses. This combination of revenue growth and expense management creates a clear path of profitability that is consistent with the long-term gross margins and adjusted EBITDA margins that we have consistently articulated. Now I'd like to move on to our financial outlook. For 2022, we are excited to be raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $45 million. We are also increasing the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million. Our guidance now includes our launching Kansas as well as our expected launch in Maryland in Q4 and pre-launch marketing investment for Ohio that we expect to launch on January 1, 2023, with both Maryland and Ohio pending licensure and regulatory approval. These three states were not included in our prior adjusted EBITDA guidance. Therefore, we are improving our guidance despite the addition of these additional marketing investments. We are also excited to share our initial 2023 outlook today, which reflects our core principles of maintaining strong growth and customer engagement while also continuing on our path to profitability as well as having a cost structure that supports our long-term margin goals. For 2023, we are introducing revenue guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of negative $575 million to $475 million. Unlike our prior guidance, our outlook now reflects our existing state footprint, including Kansas, as well as expected launches subject to licensure regulatory approvals in Maryland, Ohio and Massachusetts as well as Puerto Rico. As we've stated previously, we expect that the fourth quarter of 2023, only one year away from now, will be our first quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, as previously stated, we are well positioned from a balance sheet standpoint to reach profitability under most reasonable legalization scenarios without needing to raise any additional capital. We expect to end 2022 with a cash balance that is roughly double the high end of our guidance for our adjusted EBITDA loss in 2023. And while it's too early to guide full year 2024, our current multiyear plan suggests that we'll be approximately breakeven on a full year adjusted EBITDA basis in 2024, assuming legalization and launch trends to remain consistent with prior years. Looking ahead, the outlook for state launches continues to be positive. We anticipate launching OSB in Maryland in the fourth quarter of 2022; and Ohio, Massachusetts and Puerto Rico in 2023, which would bring our penetration of the U.S. population to 45%. Californians will vote on whether to legalize OSB on November 8. We are still deploying grassroots efforts, but the most recent polling suggests a likely unfavorable outcome for our coalition. The DraftKings has discontinued additional cash investment in the campaign. Please note that DraftKings' 2022 cash investment in California was approximately $17 million. And lastly, while it's still too early to know which states may pass OSB and iGaming legislation in 2023, we expect that several states will actively consider legislation. So there's a lot to be excited about on the regulatory front. We remain confident in our long-term outlook that states comprising 65% of the U.S. population will ultimately permit legalized OSB, and states comprising 30% of the U.S. population will ultimately permit legalized iGaming. Now I'd like to spend a few more minutes providing additional detail on our recent product enhancements. We have continued to expand the content and functionality of our Sportsbook product, which drives efficient customer acquisition as well as long-term engagement retention. The wagering content we launched for the 2022 NFL season included head-to-head matchups, several new multiplayer props and flash player market and full time and anytime squares. Head-to-head matchups include spreads, moneylines and totals on all our player subcategories to improve the depth our derivative player offering. Multiplayer props include game and highest total from a list of options to increase the variety of player-propped bet types. Player flash costs include player-specific next-drive and next-play markets to increase the depth of our player performance offering. And full-time and anytime squares is our model-driven squares product, which we've now extended to every game in the season. DraftKings also added new functionality such as early payoffs for moneyline wagers, quick parlay and quick same-game parlay as well as the ability for users to combine multiple same game parlays. Early payout is a newly introduced mechanic to settle moneyline bets once the team reaches a certain point lead. Quick parlay is a new interface for customers to build larger parlays with more cross-port play as well. Quick SGP features dozens of prepackaged same-game parlay bets per game for all same-game parlay sports. And SGPx allows customers parlay same-game parlays with other same-game parlays and singles from different games, which increases the size and average leg count of parlays. It has been an exciting 12 months of product and technology innovation enabled by our vertical integration with much more to come. For iGaming, we recently introduced player contributed jackpots in response to customer demand and are the only operator in the U.S. with its in-house capability. Players can opt in for an additional modest wager for a chance to win potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars. We believe this product functionality will increase customer engagement and demonstrates our continued differentiation from competition. And now I'll turn the call over to DraftKings' CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our third quarter results and refreshed outlook. Thank you. Great question. So everything is going really well with the integration. We started to realize some synergies, particularly on the marketing side. Really, the biggest synergies will come next year when we migrate the entire Golden Nugget operation onto our platform. So very excited about that. That should hopefully be in the back half of the year, we'll complete that migration. So everything is on track, teams are gelling nicely and really excited about the future of Golden Nugget as a way to penetrate deeper into the iGaming market. We haven't broken out Golden Nugget separately, but I believe we said that we expect any impact to the bottom line to be de minimis. For 2022. Yes. Great question. I think that a lot of progress has been made on the whole front primarily driven by our improvement in bet mix year-over-year. That's largely been product as well as merchandising and marketing. So as mentioned, we launched a whole host of parlay, same-game parlay as well as combinations of multiple same-game parlays, launched prepacks, many other features. And I think the team has done a great job merchandising and marketing those two, including through our NFL Thursday Night Football relationship with Amazon. So lots of, I think, parts of the company executing to drive that mix, and it's definitely improved hold rate. And I think we should continue to see improvement. We feel like there's a lot of tailwind there. As far as what's baked in, we've been pretty cautious about baking in improvement. I think as usually is the case with our guidance, we typically only include things that we have clear line of sight to. I think 2022 has been a great example of that. In February, we guided to minus $875 million in EBITDA. Now we're guiding to minus $790 million, and that's with the inclusion of Ontario, Maryland, Ohio and Kansas, which were not in the $875 million. So almost $100 million better on the bottom line with the absorption of four state flash province launches. And that was because at the time, that's what we had line of sight to. But we rallied the team around a number of different cost initiatives throughout the year. We're able to over -- save over $100 million in year savings. So that's typically how we approach guidance. And I think it's the same thing here where we're guiding to what we feel like we currently have line of sight to and can make a commitment to. We very much view our credibility as the most important thing, and I want to make sure we're never signing up to a number that we don't think we can achieve. But we always go out there and try to do better, too. And I think 2022 is a great example of that, where we continually throughout the year, we're able to improve guidance despite the launch of new states each and every quarter. And so that's our goal every year, and that's what we're going to try to do again in '23. The majority of our marketing spend is not committed. It's completely controllable. We're pretty selective with deals, but we feel really good about the Amazon deal. I think it's one of the better deals that we've had in recent years and very excited about the results we've seen through the first several weeks of Thursday Night Football with that one. But no, most of our marketing spend is not committed. We like to keep flexibility so that we can optimize in and out of things. Yes. I think that's an important takeaway. One of the things, I think, that is very different this year and this quarter, I should say, is that we guided with new states in. We've never done that before. We realize that's a shift. And it's a response to investors saying, listen, if you have line of sight with relative certainty to state launch dates, and we do in that we received our license in Maryland. It's not a certainty, but it's a pretty narrow window. We expect to launch there. Same -- pending, of course, additional approvals that we require. Same thing in Ohio. Pending approvals, they've set Jan 1 as a launch date. In Massachusetts, the Gaming Commission voted to launch in March. So felt like those were sufficiently close enough around the quarter and had sufficient certainty around at least a narrow range of timing. Obviously, if something changes, we'll come back and update. But that is a change, and I think may have muddied the waters a little bit on some of the comparisons that did not include those states. And as Jason Park noted, if you take out those states, we're guiding to under $400 million loss in 2023. So I think that at least some of the analyst numbers out there that might be a more apples-to-apples comparison versus the guide we just provided, which was for the first time, including several new states. Thank you. Yes, we did see a nice share increase to start NFL. We typically do very well in NFL relative to other sports. So there's a little bit of seasonality in there. But if I had to point to it, I would say the two things you touched on are the biggest drivers, the product enhancements, which have been substantial. We shipped a lot of stuff right before NFL. And I think that created some real interesting points of differentiation as well as closed all material competitive gaps. And then secondly is the lower sort of promotion, which is a larger story, really. It's a subset of the more rational competitive environment we're seeing this year versus last year was truly night and day. As far as the competitive environment and the rationality behind it, there was still certainly some aggressive investments by some of our competitors, but nothing that was, I think, out of the ordinary. And I think certainly, the change in that promotion environment as well as in the external marketing spend of some of the competitors helped us gain some share as well.  But if I had to, like I said, point to anything, I'd say it's the product enhancements that we made, probably number one. Number two would be the more rationalizing competitive environment. And then number three would be that this is seasonally typically a better time of year for us, given our strength in NFL. Sure. I'll start on the second one. So really, there's two things that have been, I think, the primary kind of benefits of that relationship. One are just the new customers that we've acquired; and two, is by really pushing same-game parlay on Thursday Night Football, which is a perfect setup for it, it's the one game on. So it's a great time to do that. We've seen real material movement in bet mix. So those have been two real positive stories from that partnership. And as far as MUPs, I think the key thing with MUPs has been that last year, if you're looking at the -- this is why we broke out September because it is a little bit neater of a -- cleaner of a comparison. But if you look at 2021, July had -- I think it was a few games of NBA. So that drove up that July MUPs number quite substantially, whereas this year, NBA ended in Q2. So we didn't get any Q3 NBA. July, obviously, given the way the MUPs calculation is doing is done is 1/3 of the calculation. So that definitely was a -- I think the biggest kind of story in why the Q3 MUPs growth was less than the September MUPs growth. And then on the flip side of that, the really significant growth in ARPMUP, part of that was the same thing because the denominator for last year included only some players that only participated in a handful of days in July. They were primarily NBA players that didn't come back until September. For NFL, that revenue number per player look, it's a numerator, denominator thing looked a little bit better this year, I think. So always hard to tell, given that the sport calendar changes year-over-year. So it's a bit of a complex thing. It's always hard to kind of tell, which is why we don't guide some MUPs and ARPMUP. It's a nice KPI and a good measure of the health of the business. But you add into things like predicting is the NBA playoffs going to go into July when you start thinking about guiding to MUPs or ARPMUP. So we've just sort of stayed away from it because it's a little volatile, given the sport calendar changes. Yes. I mean, I think that when we look at churn, we look at it on a player-by-player basis. So there have certainly been some optimizations we've made year-to-year to pare back bonus hunters and other sorts of things that, I think, is good churn. But as far as the underlying health of the cohorts, we're seeing the same thing that we've seen in previous quarters and continue to see no real impact from anything micro like higher hold, nor in terms of churn, nor are we seeing any impact from the macroeconomic environment either. So we continue to keep an eye on that. That's something we monitor very closely, but the cohorts from all respects, look very healthy to us. Yes. I mean we -- it's a good question. I think that's probably a little granular for what we'd like to cover on an earnings call. But what I will say is that we have quite a few model-based trigger campaigns set up to try to reach players before their balances go down to zero. And I think that also reinvestment, and you noted that's part of why you're seeing the Q3 to Q4 -- or excuse me, Q4 into Q3 revenue shift. We actually last quarter did it the other way around. But then given the outcomes came in, we flipped it this time. That's the result of us trying to make sure that our players are staying active that when there are negative sport outcomes, we're giving them good promotions to get them to reactivate. And that there's an overall sort of amount of return to player that we're still -- I mean it's the ultimate question. But every day, we get a little smarter in understanding what that should look like to maximize long-term lifetime value. So that's really how we look at it is there's a number of different levers between some that are uncontrollable like sport outcomes, some that are controllable like promotional intensity. And there's probably an optimal total return to player that needs to be reached. And it's probably different for different segments of players, and we're constantly trying to optimize that equation. Yes. Good question. So on the first one, we've, over the last few years, said that as we get to north of around 35% of the population having legal online sports betting, that would be a turning point where national advertising would start to become, in many cases, more efficient than local advertising. We're just crossing that threshold now. We are in states that represent about 37% of population. So just starting to see some small impacts and favorability from that. As I think we noted on the call, we had CACs that were 10% better than we expected, and we actually beat our total forecast for new customers acquired. So we were able to get scale and efficiency. And I think part of that is starting to get a little bit of benefit from this national advertising shift. That should only continue to increase. We have states right now that represent 8% of the population that are in the next five months or so projected to launch, the ones that we mentioned, Maryland, Ohio and Massachusetts pending licensure and regulatory approvals, of course. That will really start to add additional tailwind. And then it really just continues to go from there because as each new state comes on, you're reaching customers that already are seeing those national ads. You don't have to advertise locally as much anymore. So really, I think, a big tailwind behind our back now, and you're starting to see that in some of the Q3 results. And then I'm sorry, what was the second question? Yes. So we've definitely looked at different scenarios where if there were some kind of recession and if it were impactful to consumer behavior of our segment of customers that what could that look like? What would that mean for revenue next year? What would that mean for how we have to manage costs? So we're well prepared for that. And right now, we're not seeing any sign of that. So we're managing to the environment that we are seeing. But we are prepared to shift pretty quickly if we do start to see anything that concerns us. And fortunately, right now, we're not seeing that, but always good to be prepared. I think with anything we're doing, we're looking at it the same way, which is what is the impact of any partnership we might establish on our financials over the course of the partnership and if relevant beyond. And does that check out against what we view as the expense of the partnership? So really, that's how we evaluate everything. If you look at it kind of down to some of the more specific KPIs, as noted in the past, we look at gross profit payback of three years or less for new customers. And I think that's something that always comes into play because many partnerships with media companies are mostly about customer acquisition. So that's really how we've always looked at it. Nothing's changed too much there. I will say that the environment has improved dramatically year-over-year and that some of the deals that really at that time, I think last year, we had to pass on. I think in today's environment, would be more rationally priced. So we're always keeping an eye out for opportunities. But also, as I noted earlier, we have more than half of our marketing spend and actually substantial -- excuse me, more than 2/3 of our marketing spend as variable. And we like to keep flexibility around being able to optimize in and out of things. So always very careful before doing any partnership that we have historical data from testing on those channels, and feel very good about the commitments we're making in light of the benefits that we expect to receive. That's a great question. The answer is yes. So we had a California plan and a non-California plan. Obviously, anything can happen. If we all wake up on Tuesday and Wednesday, I guess, and find out it passed, and we'll give it back to the California plan, but it wasn't the same plan. It wasn't as simple as saying we tack on California to what we just guided to now. There are definitely trade-offs that would have needed to be made and that we were prepared to make if California were to launch. So great question. And I think really, what we've continuously said is that we are absolutely committed to controlling our own destiny that we have a clear path to profitability with cushion on the cash balance that we have today. And that was irrespective of whether California launched or not. And so we had two different plans, one with and one without California. Right now, we're planning on executing it without since that looks like where it's going, but we're ready to pivot on a dime if we get a pleasant surprise, although that's certainly not what I'm expecting next week. So in-game betting is definitely also an area of focus. We've seen since we've launched continued improvement in mix of live betting. I think one of the really interesting things about the early win promo that we ran this year is that part of the design behind it was you're paying out in game and can we use that to then merchandise and drive more live betting. And we've seen really good, I think, impact from when we've had those early payouts on driving up live betting. So it definitely continues to be a focus. I know we've talked about parlay a lot, but that's just because we felt like that was where the biggest gap was competitively on the bet mix side and why we are holding below at least FanDuel. So I think that, that's really why we've talked a lot about that, but it doesn't mean internally that live betting hasn't been a big focus and it continues to be. It's a great way of keeping the customer engaged throughout the game. Yes, that's a very important question. It's one of those along with the kind of return to your question, and I mentioned earlier that really important for us to continue to optimize what's the right balance of -- if you think of all of it as sort of this broad category of marketing, what's the right balance of advertising spend versus promotional spend. And I think we're still along our journey of figuring that out, but definitely gets smarter every day. And I think this year, we were able to improve how we've optimized against both such that the overall rate of promotion was lower for us this year. Our advertising spend on a per customer basis, our CAC, I should say, has improved. We mentioned 10% better than expected in Q3 this year. And we've been able to do all that while still hitting or exceeding our new customer targets. So I feel like we've made great progress there, but there's still a lot of work to be done to figure out the right balance of where those investments are made. Yes. So great question. I think some of it is controllable. Most of it's not. So a big reason why you saw substantially more ARPMUP than MUP growth in this quarter or in Q3, I should say, was the NBA bleed into July last year and this year, you didn't. So that obviously drove the denominator up last year, drove it down this year, but then in turn, also increased the ARPMUP. So I think some of that is sort of just sport calendar-dependent. For us, we're trying to maximize total long-term player LTV regardless of how -- of what form that comes in. So we don't really look at it as one is better than the other. It's more how do we maximize the LTV that we're generating from the players that we acquire. So that's really what guides us. And I think in the short term, we look at maximizing revenue but also making sure that we're not doing that at the expense of future revenue either. So really, we look at it more holistically. And I think those KPIs are more just a measure for us to understand underlying what's going on in the business. Yes. World Cup will be interesting. We haven't really talked too much about it. We're not breaking it out separately as we don't with any other sports. So it will be interesting to see what kind of engagement we get. And I think that's probably one of the examples of something that if it significantly outperforms our expectations could be a positive catalyst for the quarter. But we don't have a ton of data on World Cup. So it's really tough to say what to expect from it. Yes. Yes, exactly. Makes a big difference. Yes, that's about right. DFS continues to be a slow grower for us, but one that's very important because in addition to providing revenue that flows through at a very high margin, it also is really a huge source of new customers for us every time we enter a new state for OSB or iGaming. Yes. The biggest thing that we just launched -- and this was a big one that was a lot of work in the making, very proud of the product team was our jackpot functionality. It's totally unique to the market. No one else -- no other operators have it. It allowed players to opt in to a separate jackpot pool, which then once it hits gets paid out, usually very high sums. So really appealing, interesting, attractive product that I think gets at a lot of what players are looking for, which is the opportunity to put a small amount of money to work and potentially get a big payday. So very excited about that. That's the most significant thing we've launched. For the year though, we've been launching tons of new content, lots of games, some of which are homegrown and unique, some of which are through third-party integrations, but always looking to build out the content and make sure that we have both the best and most popular titles out there but also unique and differentiated offerings like our rocket game or like this jackpot functionality that we just recently launched. Thank you for all joining us today on the call. We had an excellent third quarter, really excited about performance there. And we feel we're really well positioned for a very strong finish to 2022 and really well set up for 2023 going into 2024, which we expect to be roughly breakeven, potentially our first full profitable year and then, of course, Q4 of 2023, which we expect to be our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. So very excited about the future, only one year away, we think, from our first positive adjusted EBITDA quarter. I look forward to speaking with you all over the next few weeks. And hope everybody stays safe and well and enjoys a very exciting time on the sports calendar through the remainder of the year. Thank you."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason, and hello, everyone. I'll start off by providing more granularity pertaining to Q3, and then I'll shift to the outlook for Q4 and 2023. Please note that all income statement measures discussed, except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. We executed very well in Q3. Customer activity was robust, supported by new product functionality that we rolled out around the start of the NFL season. We have continued to look at detailed cohort data and are not seeing any discernible indication that the macroeconomic environment is impacting our overall customer engagement. In Q3, we generated $502 million of revenue and negative $264 million of adjusted EBITDA, both significantly outperformed the expectations that we provided on our Q2 call in August. Our B2C segment revenue increased 161% versus Q3 of 2021 as compared to Q2 2022's year-over-year growth rate of 68%. Sport outcomes certainly were favorable to our operators this quarter, lapping unfavorable outcomes last year. Our strong execution across acquisition, retention and monetization initiatives for our core product offerings was also a driver of our outperformance. In Q3, favorable sport outcomes contributed approximately $70 million of revenue. On our call in August, we provided a rule of thumb for you to understand potential revenue volatility in Q3. As most of you are well aware, it was an operator-friendly quarter. NFL underdogs generally did well in September. For example, three of the biggest underdogs won in week one, including the Seahawks, Steelers and Bears. In addition, several Sunday night, Monday night and Thursday night football games fell in our favor. These games tend to attract higher handle per game relative to other NFL games. And isolating just these 11 primetime games in the third quarter, our hold rate was greater than 10%. It's important to note we launched Kansas on September 1, and we had not included that in our prior guidance due to significant uncertainty about that launch date. Kansas generated negative $8 million of net revenue in the quarter, consistent with our standard new state launch playbook. Kansas is off to a fantastic start. Net revenue growth also benefited from a less promotional environment than in Q3 of 2021. For the industry as a whole, we saw more rational behavior, which we expect to persist. And within the DraftKings business, we deployed more surgical promotions based on player-specific gross profit profile and as we have consistently reiterated are reinvesting less as cohorts mature. We had 1.6 million monthly unique payers in Q3, which is 22% higher than the prior year period. It's important to remember that Q3 2021 included the conclusion of the NBA playoffs, while the NBA playoffs were completed before Q3 in 2022. Notably, in September alone, MUPs increased 27% year-over-year to 2.7 million, which is typically our seasonally strongest month of the year for MUPs due to the kickoff of the NFL season. Average revenue per monthly unique payer or ARPMUP more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $100 with solid gross margin flow-through. This balance of player growth and revenue per player growth is very healthy as promotional intensity naturally declines as states mature.  Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was negative $264 million, which is $50 million better than the negative $314 million of adjusted EBITDA in the prior year period and significantly outperformed the expectations for Q3 that we provided on our August call primarily due to the higher-than-anticipated revenue. Our Q3 performance was especially impressive, given that it included investment in our Kansas launch, which was not included in our previous guidance. Additionally, certain expenses, principally within our marketing and G&A line items, shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. As a reminder, revenue upside driven by favorable outcomes and revenue downside driven by unfavorable outcomes typically flows through to our adjusted EBITDA at a high incremental margin, given certain expenses within our cost of revenues are tied to deposits in handle rather than gross or net revenue. Gross margin rate for Q3 was 34% and increased 100 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. On a year-over-year basis, the inclusion of New York and our continued mix shift out of our DFS product into our growing Sportsbook and iGaming products significantly limited our gross margin rate improvement. However, I was pleased that the OSB in iGaming states where we were live prior to Q3 2021 saw an increase in gross profit of over $110 million primarily due to revenue growth as well as a meaningful reduction in promotional intensity. We continue to expect our gross margin rate to be approximately 40% for full year 2022 and to improve in 2023 into the low to mid-40% range as our promotional intensity naturally declines across our portfolio of states. Sales and marketing expense was up 8% versus Q3 of 2021. For our states that have been live for more than a year, external marketing spend was down 20% on a year-over-year basis. And we generated significant contribution profit from these states in Q3 2022 compared to a deep loss in Q3 2021, which was largely driven by unfavorable outcomes. We continue to be pleased with our LTV-to-CAC ratios and continue to be on track for a three-year gross profit payback. As we mentioned on our Q2 call, our fixed expense growth began to moderate meaningfully in the third quarter with products and technology, and general and administrative expenses up 37% and 28%, respectively, compared to the prior year period. The growth in P&T expenses is primarily the result of the additional engineering and product management resources we've added over the past year to help build the best product in the industry and to continuously strengthen our data science capabilities. For G&A expense, the growth is largely a reflection of the increased investment in our customer experience capabilities, which we expect will continue to grow as we add new customers but at a slower pace than previous quarters as we reach scale and lap the significant investments we made late in the second half of 2021 and early in 2022. Moving into guidance. Please note that unlike the guidance that we have provided in the past, we are now guiding 2022 and 2023 inclusive of states that have legalized and in which it is reasonably foreseeable that we will launch during the guided period. Specifically, our 2022 guidance now includes Kansas, which launched in September as well as Maryland, which we expect to launch in the fourth quarter and prelaunch marketing spend related to Ohio, which we expect to launch on January 1, 2023, both pending licensure and regulatory approvals. Looking at 2022, we are pleased to be raising our full year revenue outlook to a range of $2.16 billion to $2.19 billion from a range of $2.08 billion to $2.18 billion, which increases the midpoint of our guidance to $2.175 billion from $2.13 billion. The midpoint of our increased revenue guidance implies 68% growth compared to the full year 2021. We are increasing our revenue guidance due to the strength we saw in our online gaming verticals in Q3. For newly included states, we expect Maryland to contribute negative revenue as we invest in the state in the early weeks following its launch. In Q4, we expect to generate about $790 million in revenue based on the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance, which represents substantial year-over-year growth and planned reinvestment in customers who have significant unlucky outcomes early in the football season. Our Q4 expectations also reflect continued softness in the broader NFT market, which has impacted our new Reignmakers vertical. Looking at MUPs and ARPMUP, we expect ARPMUP growth to be higher than MUP growth for the full year. Moving on to our adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are improving the midpoint of our full year 2022 guidance by $10 million to negative $790 million despite now including Kansas, which launched in September as well as investments in expected state launches for Maryland and Ohio. The significant improvement in our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance on a comparable basis was primarily driven by higher revenue combined with cost discipline, particularly in the marketing and G&A expense lines. I'm proud that we expect to land materially better than where we thought at the beginning of the year despite launching in new states. There has been an ongoing effort throughout the year to drive and capture efficiencies, which has resulted in more than $100 million of in-year cost savings in 2022. We will continue to focus diligently on this area of the business for the remainder of this year and beyond. Finally, I want to reiterate that we continue to expect at least 10 states to be contribution profit positive for full year 2022. Today, we are also introducing 2023 guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue for full year 2023 to be between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion and adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023 to be negative $575 million to negative $475 million. For our full year 2023 guidance, we are assuming that Maryland launches in Q4 2022, Ohio and Massachusetts launch in Q1 2023 and Puerto Rico launches in Q3 2023. We expect launches in new jurisdictions on a combined basis to generate less than 5% of full year 2023 revenue and to account for approximately 25% of our full year 2023 negative adjusted EBITDA. In 2023, we expect gross margin to improve slightly relative to 2022 as we reduced promotional intensity in more mature states, partially offset by new state launches and continued mix shift out of DFS. Our population weighted average state age will be 2.6 years exiting 2023 versus 1.8 years exiting 2022. And if that number appreciates, the gross margin rate is expected to improve dramatically. We expect fixed cost growth to slow meaningfully, while variable marketing will largely depend upon how many new users we acquire. Last, I'll touch on our liquidity position. With close to $1.4 billion in cash as of September 30 and our guided adjusted EBITDA range for the fourth quarter combined with expected other usages, we are poised to exit the year with between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of cash. Based on our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance and other expected cash usages next year, we expect to end 2023 with more than $500 million in cash on the balance sheet. It's important to note that a significant amount of our 2022 cash outflows such as $97 million in net cash paid for GNOG are not expected to recur in 2023. Looking out to 2024, we would expect adjusted EBITDA to be roughly breakeven on a full year basis under most reasonable legalization and launch scenarios.  So, in summary, we believe we are well capitalized to become free cash flow positive with existing resources. And the business is on a clear path to achieve our long-term gross margin and EBITDA margin targets. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions. Yes. Yes, absolutely. Our full year 2022 and the 2023 guide that we provided today includes Kansas, which has obviously already launched as well as the expected imminent launch in Maryland, Ohio. And we've also included Massachusetts and Puerto Rico. In terms of Q4, what you're seeing there is a little bit of flow-through from the slightly lower revenue outlook in Q4. And that slightly revenue -- lower revenue outlook is due to the planned reinvestment in a very surgical way for players who had unlucky hold in Q3 as well as some headwinds from the Reignmakers NFT product. So that's impacting the Q4 EBITDA. But the major change in the Q4 EBITDA is the inclusion of Maryland and Ohio, which we are now including in Q4 EBITDA guide. And then in terms of 2023, again, we are including Massachusetts, Maryland, Ohio, Puerto Rico. And as I mentioned on the call, about 5% of the revenue guide comes from those new states and 25% of the EBITDA loss comes from those new states. So if you think about the implied flow-through with and without new states, I think you're well north of a 60% implied flow-through on the incremental revenue in 2023 on a no-new state basis. And then, Ed, on your question just broadly on cost going into 2023, the -- I think the right way to think about it as you look at the 2023 guide, the commentary on gross margin rate, if you look at the implied total operating expense growth, I think you're looking at single-digit growth rate going into 2023. We've talked about on the last few quarters a meaningfully slower fixed cost growth next year. So on a total OpEx, you're looking at single digits. And we're not breaking out how much of that is variable marketing versus fixed marketing, but certainly a meaningful slowdown in cost. And I've also mentioned that we're continuing to look for more and more opportunities on that front. I mean, what I do is I think you can flow through the revenue decline and that the revenue sort of a slightly lower revenue outlook in Q4 to the Q4 EBITDA. And you can basically say the rest due to the new states. Yes, Carlo. So basically, the major part of the bridge is the working capital use -- source of cash in Q3. So if you recall back in Q1, Q2, we had slight uses of cash and Q3 as the source of cash. And I would just comment that on a full year basis, we don't -- I don't anticipate working capital being a meaningful source or use of cash, consistent with businesses of our type. And certainly, Joe, not a lot of data of World Cup in Q4."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Mr. Stanton Dodge, Chief Legal Officer. Sir, you may begin.\nStanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, as discussed further in our SEC filings, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements other than as required by law. During this call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings presentation, which can be found on our website in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to DraftKings Q2 earnings call. I want to touch on a few topics today. Let me start off with my thoughts on Q2. I'm really pleased with how we performed in the quarter. We generated $466 million in revenue, which exceeded the midpoint of the guidance we provided on our Q1 earnings call by $33 million and we outperformed the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance by almost 40%. Our core B2C revenue grew 68% versus Q2 of last year. Our organization is executing very well. We have struck a great balance of continuing to drive top line growth, while also capturing meaningful efficiencies that are helping our bottom line. From a top line perspective, our customers are playing more frequently than we expected, and we're seeing great success driving parlay mix in our sportsbook product. In fact, our parlay bet mix increased by 1,700 basis points in the quarter compared to Q2 of 2021. I really love how we are merchandising our same game parlays, which I think have great personality. Hopefully, you have seen our new parley merchandising in the app, which gives our customers fun ways to engage with these types of wager. We're also making great strides on improving the customer experience, such as ease of getting money on and off the platform and many other areas related to overall app usability and experience. We expect to continue to make these investments on an ongoing basis. And on the costs side, we continue to drive efficiencies during Q2. We captured $40 million of 2022 cost opportunities on top of the $50 million we captured in Q1. These efficiencies are in a variety of non-compensation areas and are a great demonstration of how our organization rallied around an important initiative and delivered great results. Looking forward to the back half of the year, we are geared up and ready to go. For online sports betting, the NFL season is right around the corner and our sports betting app is in fantastic shape with many new features and markets. Enhancing our parlay offering has been a top priority. We rolled out Parlay Insurance, which allows customers to avoid an outright loss of one of the legs in their parlay. We developed the capability for customers to void an individual leg of the same game parlay bet without voiding the entire parlay. And finally, we will be launching a feature that allows multiple same game parlay to be combined into one. Turning to new markets. We are seeing the benefits of the migration to our own bet engine, which gives us the speed and flexibility to offer differentiated North American focused market. We were the first to release look-ahead lines for all 272 NFL games. We also introduced new markets for Major League Baseball, such as wagers based on pitch speeds and pitch counts for plate appearance, and same game parlays for UFC fights. We will have more markets for the NFL that we plan to roll out when the season starts. Our social functionality is continuing to develop. Engagement with our feature that allows the customer to tailor fade their friends that has been growing rapidly. We also launched Betting Group, which makes it easier for group friends to engage together on the platform. While our social features are still very early in their life cycle, engagement has been very encouraging, and we are continuing to invest in developing the functionality as a differentiator for DraftKings. Turning to our iGaming product. Performance continues to be very strong. Gross revenues for the DraftKings brand on a same-state basis grew 35% year-over-year in the quarter. We are also focused on capturing the marketing, gross margin and G&A synergies from the Golden Nugget Online Gaming transaction that we outlined in the past. We understand the GNOG target customer better than ever and have already started tests around cross-marketing the Landry's and Golden Nugget online gaming databases and optimizing marketing mix, marketing messages, keyword optimization and other tactics to grow our overall iGaming business. In addition, we began our efforts to migrate the GNOG guest to the DraftKings platform, which we estimate will be complete in the back half of 2023. I'm also quite excited about how our recent investments in Web3 technology and DraftKings marketplace have positioned us over the past year to launch major new and disruptive Fantasy Sports games, Reignmakers football. In preparation for the NFL season kickoff, our customers are currently building up their collection of player card NFTs, which are officially licensed digital collectibles through our exclusive multiyear agreement with the NFLPA. As the season starts, Reignmakers football customers will be able to use their player cards to build fantasy lineup and compete in no fee contest for over $1 million in prices every week. We will even crown a world champion this season at the $1 million Reignmakers Football World Championship live in New Orleans. Beyond our NFLPA licensing agreement, we have also agreed to terms with the UFC to go Reignmakers UFC, featuring officially licensed NFT cards from their active roster. Our UFC relationship in this new Reignmakers game have already been announced, including the pre-launch Heatwave and NFT collection. The full Reignmakers UFC game is expected to go live in late Q4 this year, and we'll continue the momentum we've built around this new game franchise. We believe that nobody else in our industry is driving innovation in this way. And we think it's a great example of how DraftKings is forward thinking in sports entertainment. Our Web3 strategy implements use cases for blockchain and NFT technology that are endemic to our core business, disrupt the sports fan experience and create differentiation for DraftKings that helps separate us from the pack. We look forward to deepening our long-term customer relationships with this new experience. Moving to our outlook. Most importantly, our online gaming business is very healthy, and we are continuing to execute on operating efficiencies. As a result, we are improving the midpoint of our full year 2022 guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. I now want to spend a few minutes discussing Q3. As many of you know, our Q3 revenue and adjusted EBITDA have the potential for high upside or downside volatility for two primary reasons. First, a significant amount of the quarter's expected revenue comes in the final three weeks of September due to the beginning of the NFL season. Hold rate tends to normalize over the course of a full NFL season, but it can vary significantly over the course of a few weeks. This can have a pronounced impact on Q3 considering July and August are amongst the lightest months of the year from a sports calendar perspective. Second, the last few weeks of September are heavy in terms of promotional activity, which is driven by customer acquisition and reactivation. While some of the promotions we run have predictable numbers behind them, there are others that depend on game outcomes, which amplifies potential volatility in Q3. In a few minutes, Jason Park will provide additional color on our guidance, as well as more detail on how to estimate DraftKings financial performance after game outcomes from the first three weeks of the NFL earnout. Looking ahead to the longer-term, the outlook for new state launches next year and beyond continues to be excellent. We are preparing for OSB launches in Maryland, Ohio, Kansas and Puerto Rico, which will make our sportsbook app available to 44% of the U.S. population pending licensure and regulatory approvals. In Massachusetts, the legislature passed the bill that is now pending executive action that would legalize retail and online wagering in professional and collegiate sports. Massachusetts represents an additional 2% of the U.S. population and California is a huge opportunity with 12% of the U.S. population. Online sports betting is officially on the ballot with Proposition number 27. And on November 8, Californians will vote on whether they want regulated online sports betting, while simultaneously helping solve issues such as homelessness, mental health and addiction, while providing funding and economic opportunity for all of the state's tribe. Even assuming all of these states, including California, launched in late 2022 or in 2023, we have more conviction than ever in our ability to reach positive free cash flow with our current capital reserves. Despite that conviction, we are still making a concerted effort this year to drive efficiency opportunities and early GNOG synergies and have already identified approximately $100 million of cost reductions for this year. As I mentioned earlier, I am very proud of the team for striking a great balance through the first half of the year by driving strong revenue growth while also making improvements to our long-term cost structure. We look forward to continuing to balance these dual objectives. In addition, we are finalizing our plans for 2023. We expect our fixed cost growth next year to be much more moderate than over the past few years as we have reached scale across many of our departments. As it pertains to state level economics, we continue to be on track to have at least 10 states that will be contribution profit positive this year. As these states mature further in 2023 and beyond, we expect them to generate meaningful free cash flow. Even assuming California launches next year, we expect that 2022 will be the year of peak adjusted EBITDA losses. We will share more specifics on our expectations for 2023 from both a revenue and adjusted EBITDA perspective on our next quarterly earnings call. I'm also focused on several other areas that are worth sharing with you. First, we are doubling down on our strategy and cultural approach to customer-centricity. At DraftKings, the customer is at the center of everything we do. As we have grown our organization, we are actively putting mechanisms in place to ensure that this continues to be a defining element of our culture and how we make decisions. Second, we're focused on strong talent management, with an emphasis on retaining and developing our top performers, building out world-class management, and building a culture where we manage underperformance efficiently and effectively. As we have slowed hiring, we have also used this as an opportunity to reemphasize how critical it is to hold comp at high. I've been very pleased to see how our team has rallied around the importance of these areas as well as the team has rallied around the other cost initiatives that we previously mentioned. Third, responsible gaming remains a big focal point for us as we continue to grow our footprint. We are laser-focused on creating best-in-class practices through research, training and education. For example, we became the first US operator to provide customers with access to BetBlocker software in July. BetBlocker is a leading responsible gaming and safer play not-for-profit charity. As a result of this collaboration, when DraftKings customers set restrictions on their gaming activity, those restrictions will apply across thousands of gaming sites, whether regulated or unregulated globally. Our responsible gaming team is doing a great job, and I am very proud to see their efforts being noticed externally as well. Our RG team took on three awards at this year's National Council on Problem Gambling Conference. The awards recognize the team's outstanding commitment to social responsibility as it relates to problem of gaming as well as the efforts of two of our team members specifically who won individual awards at the conference for the work they do at DraftKings to promote and institute strong responsible gaming practices and culture. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings' CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our second quarter results and updated 2022 guidance.\nJason Park: Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'll start off by providing color on Q2 and then I'll shift into our outlook for the back half of the year and beyond. Please note that all income statement measures discussed below, except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. We executed very well in Q2. And our customer activity continued to be very robust, with no indication that the macroeconomic environment is impacting engagement. In Q2, we generated $466 million of revenue and negative $118 million of adjusted EBITDA. Both of which outperformed the guidance we provided on our Q1 earnings call. Our B2C segment grew 68% versus Q2 of 2021 compared to Q1's year-over-year growth of 44%. Our customers responded well to our improved merchandising of bet types, in particular, our prepackaged same game parlay. Hold percentage was in line with our expectations, which was great to see. And customers were less reliant on promotions as Q2 saw a low overall promo reinvestment rate compared to prior quarters. We had 1.5 million monthly unique payers, which is 30% higher than the prior year period. And our average revenue per monthly unique payer was a record high $103, which is also 30% higher than the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA of negative $118 million was $72 million better than the midpoint of our guidance due to several factors. First, we had flow-through of our higher-than-expected revenue. Second, some expenses shifted out of Q2 into the back half of the year, notably marketing as we continue to optimize our overall marketing approach. Please note that this category of expenses will not improve our 2022 full year EBITDA since it was simply due to timing. Finally, we have continued to make great progress on driving cost efficiencies throughout the business, including some early wins on achieving GenOn synergy. We expect these cost efficiencies will drive $40 million of savings in 2022 on top of the approximately $60 million we had previously identified in Q1. I am very proud of our team for rallying around several internal initiatives, which have now resulted in approximately $100 million of in-year savings. Touching specifically on the $40 million of opportunities we identified in Q2, these were across a variety of areas up and down the P&L. Gross margin rate for Q2 was 41%, which is up roughly 900 basis points compared to the first quarter of this year. On a year-over-year basis, the 550 basis point decline was due to continued mix shift out of our DFS product and the inclusion of New York where gross margin is a rate headwind. I was pleased that the OSB and iGaming states where we were live prior to Q2 2021 saw rate improvement of approximately 700 basis points due to reduced promotional intensity. We continue to expect our gross margin rate to be roughly 40% for 2022 and then improve over the coming years as our promotional intensity naturally declines across our portfolio of states and we continue to improve our cost structure. Sales and marketing was up 18% versus Q2 of 2021. And external marketing spend was down on a year-over-year basis for the states that have been live for more than a year. We are very pleased with our LTV to CAC ratios and continue to be on track for three-year gross profit payback for our existing and new cohorts. Product and technology and general and administrative costs were up 39% and 83%, respectively, compared to the prior year period. The growth in P&T expenses is primarily the result of the additional engineering and product management resources we've added over the past year to ensure we are building the best product in the industry and to continuously strengthen our data science capabilities. For G&A, the growth is largely a reflection of the increased investment in our customer experience capabilities, which will continue to grow as we add new customer but at a slower pace given our current scale. Going forward, we are planning for meaningfully slower fixed cost growth for 2023. We will have reached staffing scale in many of our departments by the end of this year. And the focus now is on delivering more with existing resources. Moving into guidance. We are pleased to be raising our full year revenue outlook to a range of $2.0 billion to $2.18 billion from a range of $2.055 billion to $2.175 billion, which increases the midpoint from $2.115 billion to $2.13 billion. The midpoint of our increased revenue guidance implies 64% growth compared to last year and H2 revenue of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We are increasing our revenue guidance due to the strength we are seeing across our online gaming verticals with no foreseeable degradation due to the macroeconomic backdrop. This is partially offset by a decrease in our 2022 outlook for marketplace, primarily due to our updated understanding of how revenue will be recognized across the entire NFL season for our gamified NFPs as well as some overall softness in the crypto markets. Looking at MUPs and ARPMUP, we expect ARPMUP growth to be modestly higher than MUP growth for the full year. In terms of quarterly seasonality, it holds as we expect, Q3 revenue should grow nearly 100% year-over-year, assuming no new jurisdictions launched. But if we see favorites winning consistently and large underdogs rarely winning, big parlays exceeding or certain promotions paying out in full due to game outcomes, that Q3 figure could come down meaningfully. The opposite is also true. I'll provide a few points of reference so that you all can understand the potential revenue volatility for Q3. First, we expect approximately $1 billion of OSB handle on NFL games in Q3. Second, last season, the average of our bottom 3 NFL hold weeks was approximately negative 10%. And third, as a rule of thumb, you can look at the five widest money line spreads for each week of the NFL season. If the underdog loses in each of those games, we would expect to have a negative hold in that week. If the underdog wins in one or two of those five games, we would expect to have close to normal hold. And if the underdog wins in three, four, or five of the games, we would expect to have better than expected hold. This rule of thumb is simplistic considering that specific spreads, over unders, parlays and relative game exposures impacted, too, but it should give you a general sense of how revenue for the quarter is trending for OSB. Moving on to our adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are pleased to be improving our full year 2022 guidance to a range of negative $765 million to $835 million from a range of negative $810 million to $910 million, an improvement of the midpoint from negative $860 to negative $800 million. The roughly $60 million improvement in the midpoint primarily reflects the flow-through from our improved revenue outlook from the core business, the $40 million of additional cost efficiencies and early Geno [ph] synergy wins that we have captured, and the timing shift in expenses from Q2 into the back half of the year. These items are partially offset by the high flow-through from lower marketplace revenue. From a quarterly perspective, we expect our adjusted EBITDA loss in Q3 to be modestly wider than our adjusted EBITDA loss in Q3 of 2021, assuming normal hold. As a reminder, revenue variance caused by favorable or unfavorable sport outcomes would also impact our adjusted EBITDA at a high incremental margin. We expect Q4 to be our best adjusted EBITDA quarter for the year as we benefit from higher seasonal revenue. Please note that our updated 2022 guidance includes only the jurisdictions in which we are live today. As you think about the rest of 2022, any states to launch would have minimal to negative top-line impact initially as we promote in those states and a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA as we spend on external marketing to drive early customer engagement at tax that are consistent with our two-year to three-year gross profit payback period target. With $1.5 billion in cash as of June 30, our liquidity position remains strong, and we believe we are well-capitalized to become free cash flow positive with existing resources. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Graham. Your line is open. Michael Graham, your line is open.\nMichael Graham: Sorry. Cut off for a second. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. Tons of great proof points in there. I wanted to focus in on the MUP growth of 30%. And just wondering if you could comment a little bit on the mix between gross adds and retention, sort of what were some of the factors that drove each of those. And I thought it was really great that in your pre-2021 markets, your promotional intensity is coming down so much. Can you just talk a little bit about some of the dynamics there? And are you confident that with less promotional intensity, you're still optimizing your customer growth?\nJason Robins: Thanks, Mike. So first, on the MUPs question. We were really happy with MUPs growth. Historically, Q2 is a relatively slower quarter from a sports calendar perspective. This year, it was actually a tough comp because last year, there were over 200 NBA games in May and June. This year, there were only about 40 something. So real big difference there on the schedule side for one of the most popular sports. So definitely we were really happy with 30%, which is one of our strongest quarters of growth in a while. As far as like looking at how we got there and some of your questions on marketing and promotion, we continue to optimize there. And I think that, that -- it's just been always an area of focus for the company. And the more data that we get, the better we can do. We're also continuing to shift more into national marketing, as we've said in the past, once you get to, kind of, mid-30s percent of the population, that starts to make more sense. But, yes, a lot of it's optimization that has been the result of many years of testing and lots of data and analytics. We also started to see some early synergies with GNOG, which is great where we were able to continue to have the same kind of active customer base, while optimizing our marketing across both of those brands. .\nMichael Graham: Thank you, Jason.\nJason Park: Yes. I would add Mike, as J Rob just said, MUP growth was right on with our expectations. The underlying retention rates that are an important part of the LTV outlook for each customer cohort right on a s well and consistent with what we've disclosed in the past during our Investor Day. So good retention. And we've always had the promotional intensity for existing cohorts, decreases over time as those new \u2013 as the promotional offers for brand-new customers is different than what is given to an existing customer and that is all coming to fruition.\nMichael Graham: All right. Thank you, Jason and Jason. \nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask generally just to kind of probably a little bit clarify. But on the customer acquisition environment, I think it was pretty clear from your comments in the outlook that you're not actually changing your external marketing spend. A lot of that has to do with timing when it comes to the broader guidance that you provided. So just could you sort of clarify that? And maybe just talk to us a little bit more broadly because we have heard from some others that have reported thus far that, the promotional environment actually has rationalized pretty dramatically in the last couple of months, and maybe how that is also playing through your strategic opportunities? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yes. So I think it's a bit of both. We definitely are finding some marketing optimization, both through the shift into national from local as well as some early wins on the GNOG synergy side. So those are things that we view as just pure optimization. Part of also what we look at as optimization is how we time our spending throughout the year. And I think that because of that, there are also some optimizations that have come from shifts that won't actually lower the overall amount of spend. But we'll make it such that the performance is better because we've timed it better. So yes, there is a reduction, but there is also some timing shift. It's a combination of both.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nJason Robins: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet at Citi. Your line is open. Jason Bazinet, your line is open.\nJason Bazinet: Thanks, sorry. I just had a quick question. Are you guys surprised at the resiliency of the consumer? And if you aren't, are there any sort of details that you\u2019re willing to share about what\u2019s happening underneath the hood? In other words, are there any sort of dynamics that are happening between new customer spending and sort of more loyal customers that have been with you for a while? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yes. Great question. I think, I wouldn't say we're surprised. I think gaming has always sort of been known to be resilient. There's been a lot of research done on it in the U.S., in particular on the lottery, but throughout the world. And gaming has always been resilient to a variety of macroeconomic conditions. So, I wouldn't say we're surprised. Of course, like even despite that, we're all not taking that for granted. So, it's nice to see, and we're happy. And I think we're still obviously not taking anything for granted.  But I don't think I would go as far to say we're surprised because I'd say that was our baseline expectation going in. And it's consistent with what's been seen through many decades of research across both brick-and-mortar and online. As far as what's going on under the hood, it's really across the board. We're just continuing to see really strong retention numbers. Our average revenue per player, as noted, went up 30% year-over-year. So, it's really kind of across the board. There's nothing in particular I can point towards to say this segment is outperforming that one.\nJason Park: Yes, I would agree. We had at least three different teams try to unpack any trends in consumer behavior versus prior year, versus expectations, looking at bet frequency, average bet size, a variety of other factors. Different teams had different hypotheses. And the net result was, wow, there's no discernible impact.\nJason Bazinet: Well, okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Katz of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Thanks for taking my questions. Number one, I wanted to just unpack the cost base a little bit. You've obviously done well of trimming some things. When we look at advertising in particular, can you talk a bit about the base of advertising contracts that may be a bit more temporarily fixed or multiyear versus those that you can put your hands on the dials of more immediately and flex in and out as you move forward?\nJason Robins: Yeah. So that's disclosed in our Q. You can look that up. We have a list of commitments. We don't break out which ones are marketing versus things like rent, lease agreements and other things. But you could see what our overall long-term commitments are. What I would tell you is the majority of our spend is flexible. We certainly have some deals. We like those deals for the most part. There's a few that, we'll probably optimize out of, and all of them are in relatively short-term contracts for the most part. But the majority of our spend is flexible, and we like it that way. And certainly, with the right strategic deals, we've leaned in. And we think that, that can be something that gives us a true differentiator on the marketing front. But we also like having an opportunity to be flexible and to test and move things around. I will note that, even within deals, we can do that. Marketing partners that we have deals with, we test all sorts of different things. So it's not like the media itself is fixed. We can optimize within that partner. So partners with large footprints, there's a lot of different things we can do. And I expect the performance of the deals to improve as we continue to optimize across the years.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. And if I can follow-up quickly on how you would sort of gauge the targeted parlay mix at maturity and sort of where we are today? And what that does to your sort of overall hold rate as you approach it?\nJason Robins: Well, I think we all don't know what it can get to. I mean, it's been increasing rapidly, as noted on our call. We had about a 1,700 basis point increase year-over-year in terms of percentage of bets made as parlay. So that's a pretty big gain. We're obviously not done. And I think we can hopefully see it continue to go up. Right now, I think a good ceiling \u2013 minimum ceiling, I would say, is where handle is, which you can see in the reports from some of the states. But we continue to close that gap, and I think that, they're continuing to increase, too. So it feels like there's a pretty high ceiling there. As far as that does hold \u2013 the way you could think of it is it's not even just parlay mix. It's number of legs. Every leg of a parlay is like its own bet. So the percentage that you would take would be taken off of each leg. So the more legs you can get, obviously, more parlays. But more legs you can get on parlays is also another really good thing. And it can increase hold quite a bit. Obviously, it depends on a number of different factors, like the underlying holes of the market, but it definitely can increase hold quite a bit, if you can get more parlays and more legs on those parlays.\nDavid Katz: Thank you very much.\nJason Robins: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: I wanted to talk a little bit about promotions. We've heard several times that the promotional intensity has waned a little bit. When you look at kind of the data that we all construed, from a year-over-year perspective, and obviously, the data isn\u2019t perfect, I'll be the first to acknowledge that it doesn't necessarily appear that that's the case, whether you're looking at it as a percentage of handle, on an absolute dollar basis or whatnot, in some of the states where it's trackable. So, would you guys kind of maybe comment on what you're actually seeing out there with respect to promotions or if there's things within the promotional numbers that maybe we can't see and different ways people go about enacting the business that's making -- that's giving the impression that promotions are kind of taming, to show the numbers that maybe we can't see in different ways people go about enacting the business that's making -- that's giving the impression that promotions are kind of taming?\nJason Robins: I think sometimes, when people say promotions, they're also talking about advertising. And the mix in is part of what sometimes people are saying. As far as actual like customer giveaway promotions, I think New York is a good case study where it's pretty clearly come back. Hard to tell, to your point, on the macro side because depending on the nature of the promotion, it can show up in areas of the state reported numbers in different areas of the P&L. So, it is tough to tell. I can tell you, on our end, we've seen in existing states a decline each year since launch year. That's been consistent. That hasn't been a recent thing since we launched OSB. And we expect that to continue to be the case. And obviously, the mix of new states coming in, I'm sure, for example, if California is up and running before next NFL season, you're going to see an uptick in promotions in that state, and that might drive some overall lifting. So, it, kind of -- there's a lot of moving variables. But the way we like to look at it is in a state, year one should be the highest promotion year. And then it should decline until it reaches a steady state, which we've outlined in our Investor Day, what we expect that to be. And so that's really how we look at it on a state-by-state basis. And when we look at what competitors are doing, to your point, it's hard to tell. We obviously, have a lot of qualitative evidence from our team going and looking at what's in the market. We have a detailed competitive intelligence team that goes through and catalogs everything. But the impact on the actual revenue or other metrics in the P&L, it's tough to tell because there's a lot of moving parts. And the state reports, as we've noted in the past, are not necessarily capturing things consistently operator to operator.\nCarlo Santarelli: Thank you, Jason. That's helpful. And then if I could, just one follow-up. I think the cash you used in the field was about $260 million. Obviously, you have the operating loss in there. And then I think it was $96 million of cash paid for acquisitions that kind of bridge the majority of that gap along with the software cost and the traditional PPE. The $96 million, is that related to GNOG or is that something incremental?\nJason Park: No, that's absolutely a one-time cash usage in the quarter, Carlo, related to the GNOG acquisition. It was a pay down. And we took the option to prepay a term loan that came with the GNOG asset.\nCarlo Santarelli: Okay, got it. Because that -- the funding of the acquisition was an all capacity deal, right? That was just something separate? Its an all-stock deal, I apologize.\nJason Robins: Yes, it was an all-stock deal. We chose to pay down the term loan just to keep our balance sheet healthier.\nCarlo Santarelli: Understood. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Young of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nEd Young: Taking my question, I want to ask about ARPMUP, which was very strong in the quarter. And I presume that was on stronghold. But you said the hold was in line with your expectations. Were your expectations that it will be up on -- I guess I'm referring to you saying, you've got very good traction to increasing your product mix. So what kind of proportion of the growth was driven by maybe hold and structural gains from product? Thanks.\nJason Robins : Yes. It's a great question, and I'm glad you asked, because it gives us a chance to unpack it a little bit. So when we say, it was in line with expectations, what we mean is based on sport outcome. That's typically what we like to share, is, hey -- just because those are things that aren't fundamental to the business. They're more just randomness of sport outcomes. So if we have a quarter where there was a shift positive negative on the sport outcome side, of course, Q3 is the one where that's most likely to happen given only three weeks of NFL having such an outsized impact on the quarter. However, exactly as you said, we did see parlay mix increase. We've been seeing that. That was a year-over-year comparison for a couple of quarters now since we launched our own same-game parlays and started promoting it more heavily back in Q3 of last year. So, we did expect an increase in hold that would result from that. And that was in line with our expectations as well.\nJason Park : I would just add, Ed, two more components of the unpacking of ARPMUP. First, you've got the promotional decline, which is impacting your ARPMUP growth, which I alluded to in the script. And then the other thing is product mix. So, Q2 with -- especially with this year, lapping last year's heavy NBA sport mix in the quarter and this year, the playoffs ending earlier. Just as a reminder, remember the 2020 to 2021 NBA season started late, so it ended late, versus this year, it started more normal, so ended earlier than last year. So what you're seeing also is a little bit of a product mix shift between iGaming and OSB in the quarter.\nEd Young: Useful. Thank you.\nJason Robins : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nJed Kelly: Question, two, if I may. One, can you just talk about your merchandising strategies around same-day parlay and how you think that compares to some of your other competitors? And then can you give us any update on how your launches in Canada is going? Thank you.\nJason Robins : Sure. So we recently launched some new merchandising zones in the app. I think that first step for us is to build the product. And then obviously, as we continue to enhance that product, add more markets, bring more in-house, we also are focusing on how we market it and merchandise it in the app better. Really, for us, it's about having it feel native, not feel like we're pushing something on the customer. We use fun names that are in line with the sorts of things that we would name our daily fantasy contest, that sports fans we think would find enjoyable and at times humorous and just try to give them some personality. And really, it's all database. So we test things to see what works. We're working on updating our data science engine so that those things become fully personalized. They're not yet, but we're working on that. So there's a lot of, I think, behind the scenes work too that really optimizes getting the right thing in front of the right customer at the right time. As far as Canada goes, I think Ontario is kind of what we expected. We always said that we didn't think we'd be able to achieve quite the same share as we believe we will be able to achieve in the US. We have projected 10% to 20% in Ontario as opposed to 20% to 30% in US states. We also always had said pretty consistently that we thought it would be more of a slower grind given the nature of the market where there was just a lot of continuity between the gray market and now versus, I think, US states, which when they open up, it's really more greenfield. So I think that those are some real key differences. And for those reasons, we always sort of felt like, Canada, we can achieve strong share, but probably wouldn't have quite the same ceiling that we believe we have in the US and don't have the same expectation that we would have in the US. That said, we've always had a very strong DFS database there. We have a brand that's fairly well known in Canada. And I think for those reasons, we do feel like we can do well there.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Stauff. [Technical Difficulty] Your line is open.\nJoe Stauff: And then maybe just a follow-up on costs. I wanted to...\nJason Robins: You got cut off at the beginning. We missed the first part. Can you start again?\nJoe Stauff: Yes. Sorry about that. I had a question on users and then maybe a follow-up on costs. In the quarter, I wanted to check to see what user growth look like in some of your older states, whether it be New Jersey and so forth. And then on the cost side, I'm wondering, if we look at your historical CAC, I'm wondering what's the right way to think about your increased use of network advertising, and how that could flex it down?\nJason Robins: Sure. So first, we continue to see growth across pretty much every state. I know that some of the older states we've had, we've looked and still see growth year-over-year in users there. So that's been really encouraging. This is really exactly what we hope for, that we can dial back on promotions and marketing spend and continue to see user growth. And that's what we're seeing. As far as the CAC optimization question, I think what you're describing is exactly what we've also been talking about for the last couple of years, that early on, there was some inefficiency on the marketing side because you had to localize everything, and the rates are more expensive on a local basis, particularly on things like television. So being able to go to national networks certainly will help us optimize. And the nice thing about that is that it becomes a continuous tailwind because there's more states get added, those same advertisements are reaching people that previously were not able to eligible to play the product. So you don't have to do -- I mean, we obviously will do some local heavy ups at the very start of a state launch. But they'll be shorter imbursed and less intense because we have such a strong national footprint that we're starting to build.\nJoe Stauff: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Politzer of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDaniel Politzer: I have a two-part question on OpEx. Your sales and marketing, I know was meaningfully lower in the quarter, with some shift out. Is there also an opportunity to benefit from lower media costs just given maybe a softening advertising market or as your competitors maybe offload some of their supply of traditional media spend? And then the other part, just in terms of the engineers in terms of the FTEs, where are you in terms of that? And where do you maybe look to get to as you continue to ramp there? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's a good question. I think on \u2013 I break it down a couple of ways. First, when it comes to television, particularly things like in-game advertising, the leagues, and in some cases, the networks are still putting limitations on the number of spots that can be featured from our category in a given game, for example. So unfortunately, that doesn't really \u2013 if you see auto and other sorts of large insurance categories dialing back at all, I don't know if they are or not, but just as an example, that wouldn't really help us as much. But I think as time evolves, we'll have to see where that goes. And in other channels, we do benefit a little bit, but not maybe as much as you would think from things like IDFA. Because, for example, on the app side, what we've really just seen is a shift away from iOS and into Android. So iOS has gotten a little cheaper, which is good because we have more iOS customers. But I think that overall, the market hasn't really changed a whole lot. It's just been more of a shift into Android. So some softening, but not too much. And then probably where the biggest softening on the macro side is, which is television, unfortunately, we're not benefiting from our categories, not benefiting from the \u2013 for the reason I described earlier. That said, we continue to be able to optimize, as you noted on the quarter. I think that in some ways, I'm actually very happy that it wasn't just due to rate reductions because it means we're finding meaningful synergies with GNOG and real optimization opportunities. And we'll have to see what happens with rates over time.\nDaniel Politzer: And then just on the \u2013 the FTEs, in terms of the ramp there?\nJason Robins: Sorry. Say one more time?\nDaniel Politzer: As you continue to hire the engineers and ramp your full-time employees there, like where are you in terms of that ramp as you think about that?\nJason Robins: Yeah. I mean, we're still definitely adding engineers. But as we noted, we are meaningfully slowing fixed cost growth in 2023, which means less hiring in 2022. And certainly in 2023, obviously, heavy hiring, in 2022 would lead to meaningful fixed cost growth in 2023. So we are slowing quite a bit. And I think that is, because we're reaching scale in a number of our different departments, which is great to see. Engineering, we are still hiring, but we've slowed the pace there as well. So I think across the board, we've slowed down and in some departments are really starting to reach full scale.\nDaniel Politzer: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJoe Greff: Hey, guys. Jason Park, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments about taking out a meaningful amount of fixed costs. I guess, that was more of a forward year commentary and elaborating on this year. But of the $2.9 billion of adjusted operating expenses this year, how much of that would you characterize as fixed? Obviously, G&A is going to be a big component of that. You disclosed that. And does that comment about costs coming \u2013 fixed costs coming down next year on an absolute basis, is that inclusive of new state launches, such as Maryland, Ohio, Kansas, Puerto Rico, Massachusetts, and potentially California? Thank you.\nJason Park: Yeah. Great question. So yeah, absolutely, looking into 2023, we've been consistent in saying that the fixed cost growth will slow down meaningfully into next year. In terms of more specifics, we are working through our detailed budgeting process now. We'll be in a position to provide more color on what 2023 will look like likely in our November earnings call. On your question around sort of incorporating new state thinking into our fixed cost growth, I would say, we think about new states really down to the contribution profit level, gross profit minus dedicated advertising within each new state. I would say that, new states at this point won't drive additional fixed cost growth.\nJoe Greff: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Your line is open.\nChad Beynon: Just in terms of the competition that you're seeing out there, I know there were a few competitors that kind of had a half baked product last NFL season, and they have at least a strategy in place to attempt to gain market share this year. Do you expect that there will be any market share shifts this fourth quarter into NFL, or do you think the big three, obviously, including you guys, will be kind of stable as we see it? Thanks.\nJason Robins: I feel very good about our NFL plan. And I think that, we've kind of gotten used to each year for one reason or another. We hear chatter of this or that competitor that are going to make some big moves. And we feel like we've held pretty well through all of that. And I think we're just continuing to focus on our own plans and making sure that we're being very customer-centric and doing the things that we think will help us have the strongest market share over the long term. And my hope certainly is that, we gain share. I can't really speak for others. I know you were asking about some of our competitors and whether they'd hold or gain or not. I don't know. We're not privy to some of the plans they have. But I think on our end, we feel pretty excited about the plans we have for NFL season. We feel really good about the plans we have for activating around Star as well as continuing to maintain strong engagement, both customer acquisition, driving more parlays, and better bet mix and all the key metrics. And I think, if we execute that plan, then we're hopeful that we'll actually gain some share in the back half of the year.\nChad Beynon: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nJason Robins: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: Thanks. I wonder for California, if you could remind us, what you're expecting. What that could be on a full year basis in terms of potential EBITDA loss initially? And then what your expectations are for maybe timing? Assuming a referendum would pass, what timing for that would be? Thanks. : Thank you. It's a good question. Obviously, we're a little ways from \u2013 away from there. We got to pass it first. And then I think as far as what the potential impact to the P&L could be next year, both top and bottom line, that's largely dependent on if it passes, of course, but then also timing of launch. So, really hard to say, I think once we have more clarity, hopefully, after the ballot initiative passes, within a little bit of time, there'll start to be some clarity if it passes on when the launch might occur. And at that point, I think we'll feel comfortable providing some estimates. But right now, there's just too many moving variables for us to do that.\nJason Park: Yeah. I would add, Robin, it's not just California. It's the pipeline, including Kansas, Maryland, Ohio, Puerto Rico, and it's knock-on wood, Massachusetts. There is a lead time between the formal utilization of the launch, which is regulation writing and licensing process. But -- so it's always a little hard to tell on exactly what the launch date will be. In terms of the economics of a new state, we did provide some color in our March 2022 Investor Day on what percentage of the population we would expect to acquire over the first six months and the effect of CAC. So that at least helps you understand what the marketing investment would be in the early period were a state to launch in the beginning of an NFL season.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up. I think you alluded to in your remarks. Your withhold in the quarter as expected. I don't think it was specifically said in the slides or anything. But I guess in your comments, is that what we should conclude on the hold impact in Q2? Thanks.\nJason Park: Yes. We were very pleased with hold. It was as expected in the quarter.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan of Needham. Your line is open.\nBernie McTernan: For me. First, just keeping on California. Jason, you sound pretty bullish on the potential for the ballot [ph] initiative to pass last quarter. I just wanted to give you gauge your temperature to see if anything's changed in your thoughts on the probability there. And then for Jason Park, can you just put some context around the $100 million of cost reductions this year? Is that the run rate we should expect for the end of the year? And how long should it take to get to that run rate level? And which line item should we expect to see it then?\nJason Robins: So first, on California, I think really nothing has changed. We are where we expected to be. Right now, we're very focused on educating voters about what the benefits to homelessness, mental health, also having a legal and regulated online sports betting market will help keep customers who are betting through a legal sites right now safe. So I think there's quite a few benefits for California. And we're focused on trying to articulate that to the voters. So we'll see where it goes. But we feel just as optimistic as we did a quarter ago, and I continue to believe that we'll get this over the line. But still a long way to the election, so lots can happen. We're certainly not celebrating yet, and things could swing either way. Jason, do you want to take the\u2026\nJason Park: Yeah. In terms -- just to reiterate, we had alluded to about $60 million of 2022 opportunity -- cost opportunity that we talked about back in May and another $40 million in 2022 opportunity that we were able to find in the quarter. So a couple of things, Bernie, A, that $100 million is not on a full year basis. So going into 2023, that would improve just looking at it on a full year basis, I do feel like those are permanent improvements in our cost structure. B, some of those items -- I mean, it was up and down the P&L, ranging from vendors that fit in our COGS, vendors in sales and marketing, product and technology and G&A. And so to the extent that some of the savings were in COGS, you would expect the quantum to increase as revenue increases too as we negotiate better rates on some of those folks. So that's a little bit more color. In terms of specifically where the $100 million came out from COGS versus P&T versus G&A versus S&M, it was really across everything. I would say this was a really dedicated initiative that we drove to the company. It's been a great mindset shift across the employee base to balance top line growth with finding efficiencies. I think there's just a ton of buy-in company-wide that we can do this type of thing without impacting the customer. And so we're really proud of the outcome here, and we'll always be looking for more opportunities like that.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thank you both.\nJason Robins: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandt Montour of Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandt Montour : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just on GNOG, a few months in now after gaining full control of that asset. I was just wondering if you guys have an updated view on where you think your market share can get on that on the combined iGaming business?\nJason Robins : Yes. I think a lot of that obviously remains to be seen. But right now, we feel it's very consistent with what we've shared in the past and our Investor Day presentations. And perhaps there's a little upside there. But I think it's early to -- for us to sit here and say it's going to be better than what we've previously shared. So I think that's a good number to go off of. And we feel like that's the right target for now. And you're right. We've had it for a quarter. It's still a very short period of time. We haven't migrated the platform yet. We haven't really been able to see the realization of some of the revenue synergies that we believe will occur from that. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can improve even beyond what we've said in the past. But we're still too early to be saying, we think, it's going to be any different than what we said previously.\nBrandt Montour : Great. Thanks so much.\nJason Robins : No problem.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bender of JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nJordan Bender: Hi. It\u2019s Jordan. Thanks for taking my question. The guidance raise for the full year was slightly less than the beat in the quarter. Outside of the marketplace revenues, is there kind of anything to call out in that guidance raise? Thanks.\nJason Robins : Well, I think, there's a couple of things. One, really, the OSB and iGaming business are actually up. So we are increasing the outlook there. Marketplace, the primary reason that changed is as we got closer to launching Reignmakers. We updated our assessment of the way revenue needs to be recognized given that the games are played throughout the quarter -- excuse me, throughout the season. So not only does that shift some Q3 into Q4. It also shifts from H2 into 2023. Importantly, those cash flows are received in year. So that is consistent with what we thought in the past. But from a GAAP accounting standpoint, some of the revenue will need to be recognized at later points in the season. That was the primary driver of why we didn't 100% flow through to beat. Last time, we hadn't quite completed our assessment of revenue recognition, and the update was baked into this one. But I do want to reemphasize that we actually took up the forecast for OSB and iGaming.\nJordan Bender: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Okay. This does conclude the conference portion of the call. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jason Robins, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nJordan Bender: Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We had an excellent second quarter. We continue to be excited about 2022. And we look forward to speaking with you over the next few weeks. I hope you all stay safe and well and are enjoying your summers. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to DraftKings Q2 earnings call. I want to touch on a few topics today. Let me start off with my thoughts on Q2. I'm really pleased with how we performed in the quarter. We generated $466 million in revenue, which exceeded the midpoint of the guidance we provided on our Q1 earnings call by $33 million and we outperformed the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance by almost 40%. Our core B2C revenue grew 68% versus Q2 of last year. Our organization is executing very well. We have struck a great balance of continuing to drive top line growth, while also capturing meaningful efficiencies that are helping our bottom line. From a top line perspective, our customers are playing more frequently than we expected, and we're seeing great success driving parlay mix in our sportsbook product. In fact, our parlay bet mix increased by 1,700 basis points in the quarter compared to Q2 of 2021. I really love how we are merchandising our same game parlays, which I think have great personality. Hopefully, you have seen our new parley merchandising in the app, which gives our customers fun ways to engage with these types of wager. We're also making great strides on improving the customer experience, such as ease of getting money on and off the platform and many other areas related to overall app usability and experience. We expect to continue to make these investments on an ongoing basis. And on the costs side, we continue to drive efficiencies during Q2. We captured $40 million of 2022 cost opportunities on top of the $50 million we captured in Q1. These efficiencies are in a variety of non-compensation areas and are a great demonstration of how our organization rallied around an important initiative and delivered great results. Looking forward to the back half of the year, we are geared up and ready to go. For online sports betting, the NFL season is right around the corner and our sports betting app is in fantastic shape with many new features and markets. Enhancing our parlay offering has been a top priority. We rolled out Parlay Insurance, which allows customers to avoid an outright loss of one of the legs in their parlay. We developed the capability for customers to void an individual leg of the same game parlay bet without voiding the entire parlay. And finally, we will be launching a feature that allows multiple same game parlay to be combined into one. Turning to new markets. We are seeing the benefits of the migration to our own bet engine, which gives us the speed and flexibility to offer differentiated North American focused market. We were the first to release look-ahead lines for all 272 NFL games. We also introduced new markets for Major League Baseball, such as wagers based on pitch speeds and pitch counts for plate appearance, and same game parlays for UFC fights. We will have more markets for the NFL that we plan to roll out when the season starts. Our social functionality is continuing to develop. Engagement with our feature that allows the customer to tailor fade their friends that has been growing rapidly. We also launched Betting Group, which makes it easier for group friends to engage together on the platform. While our social features are still very early in their life cycle, engagement has been very encouraging, and we are continuing to invest in developing the functionality as a differentiator for DraftKings. Turning to our iGaming product. Performance continues to be very strong. Gross revenues for the DraftKings brand on a same-state basis grew 35% year-over-year in the quarter. We are also focused on capturing the marketing, gross margin and G&A synergies from the Golden Nugget Online Gaming transaction that we outlined in the past. We understand the GNOG target customer better than ever and have already started tests around cross-marketing the Landry's and Golden Nugget online gaming databases and optimizing marketing mix, marketing messages, keyword optimization and other tactics to grow our overall iGaming business. In addition, we began our efforts to migrate the GNOG guest to the DraftKings platform, which we estimate will be complete in the back half of 2023. I'm also quite excited about how our recent investments in Web3 technology and DraftKings marketplace have positioned us over the past year to launch major new and disruptive Fantasy Sports games, Reignmakers football. In preparation for the NFL season kickoff, our customers are currently building up their collection of player card NFTs, which are officially licensed digital collectibles through our exclusive multiyear agreement with the NFLPA. As the season starts, Reignmakers football customers will be able to use their player cards to build fantasy lineup and compete in no fee contest for over $1 million in prices every week. We will even crown a world champion this season at the $1 million Reignmakers Football World Championship live in New Orleans. Beyond our NFLPA licensing agreement, we have also agreed to terms with the UFC to go Reignmakers UFC, featuring officially licensed NFT cards from their active roster. Our UFC relationship in this new Reignmakers game have already been announced, including the pre-launch Heatwave and NFT collection. The full Reignmakers UFC game is expected to go live in late Q4 this year, and we'll continue the momentum we've built around this new game franchise. We believe that nobody else in our industry is driving innovation in this way. And we think it's a great example of how DraftKings is forward thinking in sports entertainment. Our Web3 strategy implements use cases for blockchain and NFT technology that are endemic to our core business, disrupt the sports fan experience and create differentiation for DraftKings that helps separate us from the pack. We look forward to deepening our long-term customer relationships with this new experience. Moving to our outlook. Most importantly, our online gaming business is very healthy, and we are continuing to execute on operating efficiencies. As a result, we are improving the midpoint of our full year 2022 guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. I now want to spend a few minutes discussing Q3. As many of you know, our Q3 revenue and adjusted EBITDA have the potential for high upside or downside volatility for two primary reasons. First, a significant amount of the quarter's expected revenue comes in the final three weeks of September due to the beginning of the NFL season. Hold rate tends to normalize over the course of a full NFL season, but it can vary significantly over the course of a few weeks. This can have a pronounced impact on Q3 considering July and August are amongst the lightest months of the year from a sports calendar perspective. Second, the last few weeks of September are heavy in terms of promotional activity, which is driven by customer acquisition and reactivation. While some of the promotions we run have predictable numbers behind them, there are others that depend on game outcomes, which amplifies potential volatility in Q3. In a few minutes, Jason Park will provide additional color on our guidance, as well as more detail on how to estimate DraftKings financial performance after game outcomes from the first three weeks of the NFL earnout. Looking ahead to the longer-term, the outlook for new state launches next year and beyond continues to be excellent. We are preparing for OSB launches in Maryland, Ohio, Kansas and Puerto Rico, which will make our sportsbook app available to 44% of the U.S. population pending licensure and regulatory approvals. In Massachusetts, the legislature passed the bill that is now pending executive action that would legalize retail and online wagering in professional and collegiate sports. Massachusetts represents an additional 2% of the U.S. population and California is a huge opportunity with 12% of the U.S. population. Online sports betting is officially on the ballot with Proposition number 27. And on November 8, Californians will vote on whether they want regulated online sports betting, while simultaneously helping solve issues such as homelessness, mental health and addiction, while providing funding and economic opportunity for all of the state's tribe. Even assuming all of these states, including California, launched in late 2022 or in 2023, we have more conviction than ever in our ability to reach positive free cash flow with our current capital reserves. Despite that conviction, we are still making a concerted effort this year to drive efficiency opportunities and early GNOG synergies and have already identified approximately $100 million of cost reductions for this year. As I mentioned earlier, I am very proud of the team for striking a great balance through the first half of the year by driving strong revenue growth while also making improvements to our long-term cost structure. We look forward to continuing to balance these dual objectives. In addition, we are finalizing our plans for 2023. We expect our fixed cost growth next year to be much more moderate than over the past few years as we have reached scale across many of our departments. As it pertains to state level economics, we continue to be on track to have at least 10 states that will be contribution profit positive this year. As these states mature further in 2023 and beyond, we expect them to generate meaningful free cash flow. Even assuming California launches next year, we expect that 2022 will be the year of peak adjusted EBITDA losses. We will share more specifics on our expectations for 2023 from both a revenue and adjusted EBITDA perspective on our next quarterly earnings call. I'm also focused on several other areas that are worth sharing with you. First, we are doubling down on our strategy and cultural approach to customer-centricity. At DraftKings, the customer is at the center of everything we do. As we have grown our organization, we are actively putting mechanisms in place to ensure that this continues to be a defining element of our culture and how we make decisions. Second, we're focused on strong talent management, with an emphasis on retaining and developing our top performers, building out world-class management, and building a culture where we manage underperformance efficiently and effectively. As we have slowed hiring, we have also used this as an opportunity to reemphasize how critical it is to hold comp at high. I've been very pleased to see how our team has rallied around the importance of these areas as well as the team has rallied around the other cost initiatives that we previously mentioned. Third, responsible gaming remains a big focal point for us as we continue to grow our footprint. We are laser-focused on creating best-in-class practices through research, training and education. For example, we became the first US operator to provide customers with access to BetBlocker software in July. BetBlocker is a leading responsible gaming and safer play not-for-profit charity. As a result of this collaboration, when DraftKings customers set restrictions on their gaming activity, those restrictions will apply across thousands of gaming sites, whether regulated or unregulated globally. Our responsible gaming team is doing a great job, and I am very proud to see their efforts being noticed externally as well. Our RG team took on three awards at this year's National Council on Problem Gambling Conference. The awards recognize the team's outstanding commitment to social responsibility as it relates to problem of gaming as well as the efforts of two of our team members specifically who won individual awards at the conference for the work they do at DraftKings to promote and institute strong responsible gaming practices and culture. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings' CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our second quarter results and updated 2022 guidance. Thanks, Mike. So first, on the MUPs question. We were really happy with MUPs growth. Historically, Q2 is a relatively slower quarter from a sports calendar perspective. This year, it was actually a tough comp because last year, there were over 200 NBA games in May and June. This year, there were only about 40 something. So real big difference there on the schedule side for one of the most popular sports. So definitely we were really happy with 30%, which is one of our strongest quarters of growth in a while. As far as like looking at how we got there and some of your questions on marketing and promotion, we continue to optimize there. And I think that, that -- it's just been always an area of focus for the company. And the more data that we get, the better we can do. We're also continuing to shift more into national marketing, as we've said in the past, once you get to, kind of, mid-30s percent of the population, that starts to make more sense. But, yes, a lot of it's optimization that has been the result of many years of testing and lots of data and analytics. We also started to see some early synergies with GNOG, which is great where we were able to continue to have the same kind of active customer base, while optimizing our marketing across both of those brands. . Thank you. Yes. So I think it's a bit of both. We definitely are finding some marketing optimization, both through the shift into national from local as well as some early wins on the GNOG synergy side. So those are things that we view as just pure optimization. Part of also what we look at as optimization is how we time our spending throughout the year. And I think that because of that, there are also some optimizations that have come from shifts that won't actually lower the overall amount of spend. But we'll make it such that the performance is better because we've timed it better. So yes, there is a reduction, but there is also some timing shift. It's a combination of both. You're welcome. Yes. Great question. I think, I wouldn't say we're surprised. I think gaming has always sort of been known to be resilient. There's been a lot of research done on it in the U.S., in particular on the lottery, but throughout the world. And gaming has always been resilient to a variety of macroeconomic conditions. So, I wouldn't say we're surprised. Of course, like even despite that, we're all not taking that for granted. So, it's nice to see, and we're happy. And I think we're still obviously not taking anything for granted.  But I don't think I would go as far to say we're surprised because I'd say that was our baseline expectation going in. And it's consistent with what's been seen through many decades of research across both brick-and-mortar and online. As far as what's going on under the hood, it's really across the board. We're just continuing to see really strong retention numbers. Our average revenue per player, as noted, went up 30% year-over-year. So, it's really kind of across the board. There's nothing in particular I can point towards to say this segment is outperforming that one. Yeah. So that's disclosed in our Q. You can look that up. We have a list of commitments. We don't break out which ones are marketing versus things like rent, lease agreements and other things. But you could see what our overall long-term commitments are. What I would tell you is the majority of our spend is flexible. We certainly have some deals. We like those deals for the most part. There's a few that, we'll probably optimize out of, and all of them are in relatively short-term contracts for the most part. But the majority of our spend is flexible, and we like it that way. And certainly, with the right strategic deals, we've leaned in. And we think that, that can be something that gives us a true differentiator on the marketing front. But we also like having an opportunity to be flexible and to test and move things around. I will note that, even within deals, we can do that. Marketing partners that we have deals with, we test all sorts of different things. So it's not like the media itself is fixed. We can optimize within that partner. So partners with large footprints, there's a lot of different things we can do. And I expect the performance of the deals to improve as we continue to optimize across the years. Well, I think we all don't know what it can get to. I mean, it's been increasing rapidly, as noted on our call. We had about a 1,700 basis point increase year-over-year in terms of percentage of bets made as parlay. So that's a pretty big gain. We're obviously not done. And I think we can hopefully see it continue to go up. Right now, I think a good ceiling \u2013 minimum ceiling, I would say, is where handle is, which you can see in the reports from some of the states. But we continue to close that gap, and I think that, they're continuing to increase, too. So it feels like there's a pretty high ceiling there. As far as that does hold \u2013 the way you could think of it is it's not even just parlay mix. It's number of legs. Every leg of a parlay is like its own bet. So the percentage that you would take would be taken off of each leg. So the more legs you can get, obviously, more parlays. But more legs you can get on parlays is also another really good thing. And it can increase hold quite a bit. Obviously, it depends on a number of different factors, like the underlying holes of the market, but it definitely can increase hold quite a bit, if you can get more parlays and more legs on those parlays. You're welcome. I think sometimes, when people say promotions, they're also talking about advertising. And the mix in is part of what sometimes people are saying. As far as actual like customer giveaway promotions, I think New York is a good case study where it's pretty clearly come back. Hard to tell, to your point, on the macro side because depending on the nature of the promotion, it can show up in areas of the state reported numbers in different areas of the P&L. So, it is tough to tell. I can tell you, on our end, we've seen in existing states a decline each year since launch year. That's been consistent. That hasn't been a recent thing since we launched OSB. And we expect that to continue to be the case. And obviously, the mix of new states coming in, I'm sure, for example, if California is up and running before next NFL season, you're going to see an uptick in promotions in that state, and that might drive some overall lifting. So, it, kind of -- there's a lot of moving variables. But the way we like to look at it is in a state, year one should be the highest promotion year. And then it should decline until it reaches a steady state, which we've outlined in our Investor Day, what we expect that to be. And so that's really how we look at it on a state-by-state basis. And when we look at what competitors are doing, to your point, it's hard to tell. We obviously, have a lot of qualitative evidence from our team going and looking at what's in the market. We have a detailed competitive intelligence team that goes through and catalogs everything. But the impact on the actual revenue or other metrics in the P&L, it's tough to tell because there's a lot of moving parts. And the state reports, as we've noted in the past, are not necessarily capturing things consistently operator to operator. Yes, it was an all-stock deal. We chose to pay down the term loan just to keep our balance sheet healthier. Yes. It's a great question, and I'm glad you asked, because it gives us a chance to unpack it a little bit. So when we say, it was in line with expectations, what we mean is based on sport outcome. That's typically what we like to share, is, hey -- just because those are things that aren't fundamental to the business. They're more just randomness of sport outcomes. So if we have a quarter where there was a shift positive negative on the sport outcome side, of course, Q3 is the one where that's most likely to happen given only three weeks of NFL having such an outsized impact on the quarter. However, exactly as you said, we did see parlay mix increase. We've been seeing that. That was a year-over-year comparison for a couple of quarters now since we launched our own same-game parlays and started promoting it more heavily back in Q3 of last year. So, we did expect an increase in hold that would result from that. And that was in line with our expectations as well. Thank you. Sure. So we recently launched some new merchandising zones in the app. I think that first step for us is to build the product. And then obviously, as we continue to enhance that product, add more markets, bring more in-house, we also are focusing on how we market it and merchandise it in the app better. Really, for us, it's about having it feel native, not feel like we're pushing something on the customer. We use fun names that are in line with the sorts of things that we would name our daily fantasy contest, that sports fans we think would find enjoyable and at times humorous and just try to give them some personality. And really, it's all database. So we test things to see what works. We're working on updating our data science engine so that those things become fully personalized. They're not yet, but we're working on that. So there's a lot of, I think, behind the scenes work too that really optimizes getting the right thing in front of the right customer at the right time. As far as Canada goes, I think Ontario is kind of what we expected. We always said that we didn't think we'd be able to achieve quite the same share as we believe we will be able to achieve in the US. We have projected 10% to 20% in Ontario as opposed to 20% to 30% in US states. We also always had said pretty consistently that we thought it would be more of a slower grind given the nature of the market where there was just a lot of continuity between the gray market and now versus, I think, US states, which when they open up, it's really more greenfield. So I think that those are some real key differences. And for those reasons, we always sort of felt like, Canada, we can achieve strong share, but probably wouldn't have quite the same ceiling that we believe we have in the US and don't have the same expectation that we would have in the US. That said, we've always had a very strong DFS database there. We have a brand that's fairly well known in Canada. And I think for those reasons, we do feel like we can do well there. You got cut off at the beginning. We missed the first part. Can you start again? Sure. So first, we continue to see growth across pretty much every state. I know that some of the older states we've had, we've looked and still see growth year-over-year in users there. So that's been really encouraging. This is really exactly what we hope for, that we can dial back on promotions and marketing spend and continue to see user growth. And that's what we're seeing. As far as the CAC optimization question, I think what you're describing is exactly what we've also been talking about for the last couple of years, that early on, there was some inefficiency on the marketing side because you had to localize everything, and the rates are more expensive on a local basis, particularly on things like television. So being able to go to national networks certainly will help us optimize. And the nice thing about that is that it becomes a continuous tailwind because there's more states get added, those same advertisements are reaching people that previously were not able to eligible to play the product. So you don't have to do -- I mean, we obviously will do some local heavy ups at the very start of a state launch. But they'll be shorter imbursed and less intense because we have such a strong national footprint that we're starting to build. Yeah. It's a good question. I think on \u2013 I break it down a couple of ways. First, when it comes to television, particularly things like in-game advertising, the leagues, and in some cases, the networks are still putting limitations on the number of spots that can be featured from our category in a given game, for example. So unfortunately, that doesn't really \u2013 if you see auto and other sorts of large insurance categories dialing back at all, I don't know if they are or not, but just as an example, that wouldn't really help us as much. But I think as time evolves, we'll have to see where that goes. And in other channels, we do benefit a little bit, but not maybe as much as you would think from things like IDFA. Because, for example, on the app side, what we've really just seen is a shift away from iOS and into Android. So iOS has gotten a little cheaper, which is good because we have more iOS customers. But I think that overall, the market hasn't really changed a whole lot. It's just been more of a shift into Android. So some softening, but not too much. And then probably where the biggest softening on the macro side is, which is television, unfortunately, we're not benefiting from our categories, not benefiting from the \u2013 for the reason I described earlier. That said, we continue to be able to optimize, as you noted on the quarter. I think that in some ways, I'm actually very happy that it wasn't just due to rate reductions because it means we're finding meaningful synergies with GNOG and real optimization opportunities. And we'll have to see what happens with rates over time. Sorry. Say one more time? Yeah. I mean, we're still definitely adding engineers. But as we noted, we are meaningfully slowing fixed cost growth in 2023, which means less hiring in 2022. And certainly in 2023, obviously, heavy hiring, in 2022 would lead to meaningful fixed cost growth in 2023. So we are slowing quite a bit. And I think that is, because we're reaching scale in a number of our different departments, which is great to see. Engineering, we are still hiring, but we've slowed the pace there as well. So I think across the board, we've slowed down and in some departments are really starting to reach full scale. I feel very good about our NFL plan. And I think that, we've kind of gotten used to each year for one reason or another. We hear chatter of this or that competitor that are going to make some big moves. And we feel like we've held pretty well through all of that. And I think we're just continuing to focus on our own plans and making sure that we're being very customer-centric and doing the things that we think will help us have the strongest market share over the long term. And my hope certainly is that, we gain share. I can't really speak for others. I know you were asking about some of our competitors and whether they'd hold or gain or not. I don't know. We're not privy to some of the plans they have. But I think on our end, we feel pretty excited about the plans we have for NFL season. We feel really good about the plans we have for activating around Star as well as continuing to maintain strong engagement, both customer acquisition, driving more parlays, and better bet mix and all the key metrics. And I think, if we execute that plan, then we're hopeful that we'll actually gain some share in the back half of the year. You're welcome. So first, on California, I think really nothing has changed. We are where we expected to be. Right now, we're very focused on educating voters about what the benefits to homelessness, mental health, also having a legal and regulated online sports betting market will help keep customers who are betting through a legal sites right now safe. So I think there's quite a few benefits for California. And we're focused on trying to articulate that to the voters. So we'll see where it goes. But we feel just as optimistic as we did a quarter ago, and I continue to believe that we'll get this over the line. But still a long way to the election, so lots can happen. We're certainly not celebrating yet, and things could swing either way. Jason, do you want to take the... You're welcome. Yes. I think a lot of that obviously remains to be seen. But right now, we feel it's very consistent with what we've shared in the past and our Investor Day presentations. And perhaps there's a little upside there. But I think it's early to -- for us to sit here and say it's going to be better than what we've previously shared. So I think that's a good number to go off of. And we feel like that's the right target for now. And you're right. We've had it for a quarter. It's still a very short period of time. We haven't migrated the platform yet. We haven't really been able to see the realization of some of the revenue synergies that we believe will occur from that. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can improve even beyond what we've said in the past. But we're still too early to be saying, we think, it's going to be any different than what we said previously. No problem. Well, I think, there's a couple of things. One, really, the OSB and iGaming business are actually up. So we are increasing the outlook there. Marketplace, the primary reason that changed is as we got closer to launching Reignmakers. We updated our assessment of the way revenue needs to be recognized given that the games are played throughout the quarter -- excuse me, throughout the season. So not only does that shift some Q3 into Q4. It also shifts from H2 into 2023. Importantly, those cash flows are received in year. So that is consistent with what we thought in the past. But from a GAAP accounting standpoint, some of the revenue will need to be recognized at later points in the season. That was the primary driver of why we didn't 100% flow through to beat. Last time, we hadn't quite completed our assessment of revenue recognition, and the update was baked into this one. But I do want to reemphasize that we actually took up the forecast for OSB and iGaming."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'll start off by providing color on Q2 and then I'll shift into our outlook for the back half of the year and beyond. Please note that all income statement measures discussed below, except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. We executed very well in Q2. And our customer activity continued to be very robust, with no indication that the macroeconomic environment is impacting engagement. In Q2, we generated $466 million of revenue and negative $118 million of adjusted EBITDA. Both of which outperformed the guidance we provided on our Q1 earnings call. Our B2C segment grew 68% versus Q2 of 2021 compared to Q1's year-over-year growth of 44%. Our customers responded well to our improved merchandising of bet types, in particular, our prepackaged same game parlay. Hold percentage was in line with our expectations, which was great to see. And customers were less reliant on promotions as Q2 saw a low overall promo reinvestment rate compared to prior quarters. We had 1.5 million monthly unique payers, which is 30% higher than the prior year period. And our average revenue per monthly unique payer was a record high $103, which is also 30% higher than the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA of negative $118 million was $72 million better than the midpoint of our guidance due to several factors. First, we had flow-through of our higher-than-expected revenue. Second, some expenses shifted out of Q2 into the back half of the year, notably marketing as we continue to optimize our overall marketing approach. Please note that this category of expenses will not improve our 2022 full year EBITDA since it was simply due to timing. Finally, we have continued to make great progress on driving cost efficiencies throughout the business, including some early wins on achieving GenOn synergy. We expect these cost efficiencies will drive $40 million of savings in 2022 on top of the approximately $60 million we had previously identified in Q1. I am very proud of our team for rallying around several internal initiatives, which have now resulted in approximately $100 million of in-year savings. Touching specifically on the $40 million of opportunities we identified in Q2, these were across a variety of areas up and down the P&L. Gross margin rate for Q2 was 41%, which is up roughly 900 basis points compared to the first quarter of this year. On a year-over-year basis, the 550 basis point decline was due to continued mix shift out of our DFS product and the inclusion of New York where gross margin is a rate headwind. I was pleased that the OSB and iGaming states where we were live prior to Q2 2021 saw rate improvement of approximately 700 basis points due to reduced promotional intensity. We continue to expect our gross margin rate to be roughly 40% for 2022 and then improve over the coming years as our promotional intensity naturally declines across our portfolio of states and we continue to improve our cost structure. Sales and marketing was up 18% versus Q2 of 2021. And external marketing spend was down on a year-over-year basis for the states that have been live for more than a year. We are very pleased with our LTV to CAC ratios and continue to be on track for three-year gross profit payback for our existing and new cohorts. Product and technology and general and administrative costs were up 39% and 83%, respectively, compared to the prior year period. The growth in P&T expenses is primarily the result of the additional engineering and product management resources we've added over the past year to ensure we are building the best product in the industry and to continuously strengthen our data science capabilities. For G&A, the growth is largely a reflection of the increased investment in our customer experience capabilities, which will continue to grow as we add new customer but at a slower pace given our current scale. Going forward, we are planning for meaningfully slower fixed cost growth for 2023. We will have reached staffing scale in many of our departments by the end of this year. And the focus now is on delivering more with existing resources. Moving into guidance. We are pleased to be raising our full year revenue outlook to a range of $2.0 billion to $2.18 billion from a range of $2.055 billion to $2.175 billion, which increases the midpoint from $2.115 billion to $2.13 billion. The midpoint of our increased revenue guidance implies 64% growth compared to last year and H2 revenue of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We are increasing our revenue guidance due to the strength we are seeing across our online gaming verticals with no foreseeable degradation due to the macroeconomic backdrop. This is partially offset by a decrease in our 2022 outlook for marketplace, primarily due to our updated understanding of how revenue will be recognized across the entire NFL season for our gamified NFPs as well as some overall softness in the crypto markets. Looking at MUPs and ARPMUP, we expect ARPMUP growth to be modestly higher than MUP growth for the full year. In terms of quarterly seasonality, it holds as we expect, Q3 revenue should grow nearly 100% year-over-year, assuming no new jurisdictions launched. But if we see favorites winning consistently and large underdogs rarely winning, big parlays exceeding or certain promotions paying out in full due to game outcomes, that Q3 figure could come down meaningfully. The opposite is also true. I'll provide a few points of reference so that you all can understand the potential revenue volatility for Q3. First, we expect approximately $1 billion of OSB handle on NFL games in Q3. Second, last season, the average of our bottom 3 NFL hold weeks was approximately negative 10%. And third, as a rule of thumb, you can look at the five widest money line spreads for each week of the NFL season. If the underdog loses in each of those games, we would expect to have a negative hold in that week. If the underdog wins in one or two of those five games, we would expect to have close to normal hold. And if the underdog wins in three, four, or five of the games, we would expect to have better than expected hold. This rule of thumb is simplistic considering that specific spreads, over unders, parlays and relative game exposures impacted, too, but it should give you a general sense of how revenue for the quarter is trending for OSB. Moving on to our adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are pleased to be improving our full year 2022 guidance to a range of negative $765 million to $835 million from a range of negative $810 million to $910 million, an improvement of the midpoint from negative $860 to negative $800 million. The roughly $60 million improvement in the midpoint primarily reflects the flow-through from our improved revenue outlook from the core business, the $40 million of additional cost efficiencies and early Geno [ph] synergy wins that we have captured, and the timing shift in expenses from Q2 into the back half of the year. These items are partially offset by the high flow-through from lower marketplace revenue. From a quarterly perspective, we expect our adjusted EBITDA loss in Q3 to be modestly wider than our adjusted EBITDA loss in Q3 of 2021, assuming normal hold. As a reminder, revenue variance caused by favorable or unfavorable sport outcomes would also impact our adjusted EBITDA at a high incremental margin. We expect Q4 to be our best adjusted EBITDA quarter for the year as we benefit from higher seasonal revenue. Please note that our updated 2022 guidance includes only the jurisdictions in which we are live today. As you think about the rest of 2022, any states to launch would have minimal to negative top-line impact initially as we promote in those states and a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA as we spend on external marketing to drive early customer engagement at tax that are consistent with our two-year to three-year gross profit payback period target. With $1.5 billion in cash as of June 30, our liquidity position remains strong, and we believe we are well-capitalized to become free cash flow positive with existing resources. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for question. Yes. I would add Mike, as J Rob just said, MUP growth was right on with our expectations. The underlying retention rates that are an important part of the LTV outlook for each customer cohort right on a s well and consistent with what we've disclosed in the past during our Investor Day. So good retention. And we've always had the promotional intensity for existing cohorts, decreases over time as those new \u2013 as the promotional offers for brand-new customers is different than what is given to an existing customer and that is all coming to fruition. Yes, I would agree. We had at least three different teams try to unpack any trends in consumer behavior versus prior year, versus expectations, looking at bet frequency, average bet size, a variety of other factors. Different teams had different hypotheses. And the net result was, wow, there's no discernible impact. No, that's absolutely a one-time cash usage in the quarter, Carlo, related to the GNOG acquisition. It was a pay down. And we took the option to prepay a term loan that came with the GNOG asset. I would just add, Ed, two more components of the unpacking of ARPMUP. First, you've got the promotional decline, which is impacting your ARPMUP growth, which I alluded to in the script. And then the other thing is product mix. So, Q2 with -- especially with this year, lapping last year's heavy NBA sport mix in the quarter and this year, the playoffs ending earlier. Just as a reminder, remember the 2020 to 2021 NBA season started late, so it ended late, versus this year, it started more normal, so ended earlier than last year. So what you're seeing also is a little bit of a product mix shift between iGaming and OSB in the quarter. Yeah. Great question. So yeah, absolutely, looking into 2023, we've been consistent in saying that the fixed cost growth will slow down meaningfully into next year. In terms of more specifics, we are working through our detailed budgeting process now. We'll be in a position to provide more color on what 2023 will look like likely in our November earnings call. On your question around sort of incorporating new state thinking into our fixed cost growth, I would say, we think about new states really down to the contribution profit level, gross profit minus dedicated advertising within each new state. I would say that, new states at this point won't drive additional fixed cost growth. Yeah. I would add, Robin, it's not just California. It's the pipeline, including Kansas, Maryland, Ohio, Puerto Rico, and it's knock-on wood, Massachusetts. There is a lead time between the formal utilization of the launch, which is regulation writing and licensing process. But -- so it's always a little hard to tell on exactly what the launch date will be. In terms of the economics of a new state, we did provide some color in our March 2022 Investor Day on what percentage of the population we would expect to acquire over the first six months and the effect of CAC. So that at least helps you understand what the marketing investment would be in the early period were a state to launch in the beginning of an NFL season. Yes. We were very pleased with hold. It was as expected in the quarter. Yeah. In terms -- just to reiterate, we had alluded to about $60 million of 2022 opportunity -- cost opportunity that we talked about back in May and another $40 million in 2022 opportunity that we were able to find in the quarter. So a couple of things, Bernie, A, that $100 million is not on a full year basis. So going into 2023, that would improve just looking at it on a full year basis, I do feel like those are permanent improvements in our cost structure. B, some of those items -- I mean, it was up and down the P&L, ranging from vendors that fit in our COGS, vendors in sales and marketing, product and technology and G&A. And so to the extent that some of the savings were in COGS, you would expect the quantum to increase as revenue increases too as we negotiate better rates on some of those folks. So that's a little bit more color. In terms of specifically where the $100 million came out from COGS versus P&T versus G&A versus S&M, it was really across everything. I would say this was a really dedicated initiative that we drove to the company. It's been a great mindset shift across the employee base to balance top line growth with finding efficiencies. I think there's just a ton of buy-in company-wide that we can do this type of thing without impacting the customer. And so we're really proud of the outcome here, and we'll always be looking for more opportunities like that."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Stanton Dodge, Chief Legal Officer.\nStanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, as discussed further in our SEC filings that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical risks or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements, other than as required by law. During this call, management will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings presentation, which can be found on our website and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open up the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will cover the following topics. First, we are very excited to welcome the Golden Nugget Online Gaming team to DraftKings. Since the announcement of the proposed acquisition in August 2021, our excitement around bringing these companies together has only increased. The acquisition closed yesterday, and we are well prepared to integrate our respective businesses, begin executing on our multi-brand strategy and capture adjusted EBITDA synergies, which we expect to reach approximately $300 million long-term. Second, we'll discuss our first quarter financial achievements. Revenue for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $7 million, and adjusted EBITDA significantly outperformed our expectations, finishing more than 12% better than the midpoint of our guidance. Third, we see a stronger top and bottom line outlook for the year and are raising both our 2022 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. Despite broader concerns around the macroeconomic environment and inflation, our cohort level data has remained very healthy and our path to profitability has become more clear. Legislative momentum has remained robust as well. Looking forward, we see strong top line growth continuing through the remainder of the year and beyond, coupled with continued optimization of our margin profile overall cost structure. Finally, I will touch on recent product developments in adjacent growth verticals. We are continuing to innovate and improve the customer experience by consistently adding new games and features, which we believe will ultimately support customer acquisition, retention and by extension player LTV. Additionally, we continue to make progress in media and marketplace, and we are very excited about the future prospects for both. Let's start with our acquisition of Golden Nugget Online Gaming. We are very excited to welcome the Golden Nugget Online Gaming team to DraftKings and have a well-designed integration plan that is already being implemented. The acquisition will allow DraftKings to leverage Golden Nugget's established brand to broaden our reach in new customer segments, particularly within iGaming. It will also enhance the combined company's iGaming product offerings through DraftKings' vertically integrated tech stack and Golden Nugget Online Gaming's unique live dealer capabilities. In addition, the transaction increases DraftKings customer database size through access to the more than 5.5 million members in the databases of the Golden Nugget 24k Club and Landry Select Club on top of the current DraftKings' database of more than 20 million accounts. We continue to have confidence that the combination of our businesses will result in long-term adjusted EBITDA synergies of approximately $300 million. Now let's turn to our first quarter results. DraftKings generated $417 million of revenue in the first quarter, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $7 million. Revenue growth was primarily driven by our B2C business, which increased 44% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA of negative $290 million in the quarter also outperformed our expectations by $40 million compared to the midpoint of our guidance. Part of the reason why we are outperforming our own expectations markets such as New Jersey have turned highly profitable and continuing to grow at an attractive rate. We have also identified efficiency opportunities and executed on them, which drove some of the outperformance in first quarter adjusted EBITDA. These efficiencies were up and down the income statement, including in our COGS, marketing and corporate fixed costs. The primary driver of these cost opportunities was faster growth in state expansion, which has allowed us to accelerate progress towards our plans for our long-term cost structure. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA also benefited from corporate costs that shifted from Q1 to the remainder of the year. Consequently, some of the reduced costs in Q1 will continue to positively impact DraftKings going forward, while others are simply due to timing. Suffice it to say, we will continue to look for opportunities to accelerate the realization of cost efficiencies as DraftKings continues to grow at scale. Our key performance metrics, including user acquisition, retention and engagement, also continued to trend well. Q1 includes two marquee sporting events: the Super Bowl and March Madness. Basketball, both the NBA and college, also drew increased attention and interest throughout the quarter. The NBA has been strong, including when the NFL was still in play, while the Super Bowl saw tremendous customer engagement. For the Super Bowl, we set a single day record for first-time OSB betters, which increased 77% year-over-year. For the first weekend of March Madness, our first-time LSB betters increased 42% year-over-year. March Madness this year featured various player-friendly results overall, especially the exciting run by Saint Peters to the Elite Eight. Betters across the country backed the Peacock during their surprise run. This run contributed to our lower-than-forecasted OSB hold. Whole variance due to game outcomes resulted in approximately $25 million of reduced revenue in the quarter. First quarter monthly unique payers increased to approximately 2 million, up 29% versus Q1 2021. Average revenue per monthly unique player increased 11% year-over-year to $67. Notably, average revenue per monthly unique player would have grown approximately 26% if we adjusted both Q1 2022 and Q1 2021 for OSB hold. Cost of goods sold and marketing spend were both elevated in the first quarter, primarily due to our launch in New York on January 8. Gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted by sports betting hold during the quarter. With that, I will turn to our updated outlook for the business. We have several unique capabilities, including our growing DFS database, which is a great source of OSB customer acquisition; a decade of marketing know-how to acquire sports fans; our sophisticated data science and analytics organizations; our vertically integrated tech stack; top-rated products across all categories in which we operate; and single account and wallet. These capabilities are very difficult to replicate by other operators and are the reasons for a very attractive tax and strong share, which support our growth outlook for 2022 and beyond. We are raising the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance from $1.925 billion to $1.975 billion and improving our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of negative $760 million to negative $840 million. This increased guidance does not include the contribution of the Golden Nugget Online Gaming business nor does it include our contemplated launch in Ontario. Jason Park will touch on our preliminary expectations for GNOG in Ontario. I also want to spend a few minutes discussing the outlook beyond 2022. As a starting point, the pipeline for new states remains robust. As you know, following our launches in New York and Louisiana, DraftKings is currently live with online sports betting in 17 states that collectively represent approximately 36% of the U.S. population. Additionally, DraftKings is live with iGaming in five states, representing approximately 11% of the U.S. population. We also expect to go live in Ontario in the near future, pending life insure and regulatory approval. Ontario represents about 40% of Canada's population, and Ontario will be the fifth largest U.S. state by population if it were in the U.S. However, due to the presence of gray market operators, many of which have been present in Ontario for several years, we do not believe that the timing of our launch will have any impact on the share we are able to achieve in that province. There are three U.S. jurisdictions that have legalized mobile sports betting in which we are preparing to launch upon licensure and approval from regulators: Maryland, Ohio and Puerto Rico. These three jurisdictions represent approximately 7% of the U.S. population, and we'll bring the percentage of the population where Draftkings expects to offer legalized mobile sports betting to approximately 43%. In Kansas, which is about 1% of the U.S. population, a mobile and retail sports wagering bill has passed the legislature and is now pending executive action. We are also very excited by momentum in California. The approximately 1.6 million signatures submitted by Californians for solutions to homelessness and mental health support will likely allow us to qualify the ballot measure for the 2022 November ballot. This is a really important step. Once the signatures are verified, then the initiative will be placed on the ballot in November. And if the initiative passes with a simple majority, then it becomes law. From there, regulators will implement the framework, and we are hopeful that we can get live sometime in 2023, pending licensure and regulatory approval. California, of course, represents a significant revenue and adjusted EBITDA opportunity, with approximately 12% of the United States population. In fact, if California were a country, it would be the fifth largest economy in the world ranked by GDP. In short, from a legalization perspective, there is a lot to look forward to. Finally, I will touch on recent product developments in adjacent growth verticals. Our sports betting app continues to score very well in third-party surveys. Eilers & Krejcik recently published its quarterly report on U.S. sports betting and app rank. The firm tested 41 sports betting apps and rated each on user experience, betting interface, features, core and esthetics. DraftKings' app was tied for number one overall and was the top three for user experience, betting interface and features. We continue to believe that product innovation and quality of customer experience will create strong customer acquisition, retention and LTVs, giving DraftKings as a sustainable competitive advantage over the long term. Q1 was only the second full quarter since migrating to our own proprietary in-house technology platform, and we are pleased with the progress we have made not just with our sports betting app, but across our entire product portfolio. In the first quarter, we continued to deepen our content offer for OSB. For example, we added next field goal micro markets for the NBA and college basketball, which offers the ability to wager on the next field go type, next go team and whether the next two- or three-point shot will be made by the home or away team. We also added several player markets to our college basketball same-game parlay offering, including point score, assist, rebounds and three pointers made as well as combinations of these markets. In iGaming, our focus on cross-selling and in-house content development continued to pay dividends. In the first quarter, 43% of mobile sports betting users in our iGaming space also engaged with our iGaming product, and 54% of iGaming handle came from DraftKings' developed game. And in April, we launched our first DraftKings' developed slot scheme in New Jersey. With DraftKings Social, we have created an integrated and highly engaged community that allows fans to interact with each other within a peer-to-peer environment. In April, we launched betting groups, which are a seamless way to collaborate on a sports betting experience. Users can create a group and distribute the link for others to join. Once the group is created, all actions of the members who elected to share their best will be dropped into the group in real time, notifying group members with a link directly to that new bet. In fact, anyone in a league can remake their league as a sports betting group in our mobile sports book. And one task invite everyone in the league to their betting group. Imagine a group of friends watch March Madness or the World Cup from wherever they might be around a country, all engaged in all with the rooting interest and all of it happening via DraftKings. For Daily Fantasy Sports, in March, we added international auto racing lead, Formula One, to our portfolio of sport offer. This offering leverages the experience and success of our NASCAR Daily Fantasy product as well as the popular Netflix series. Turning to DraftKings Marketplace. We now offer options for NFTs in the marketplace in addition to regular drops. We introduced this additional mechanism for participants to access NFTs to broaden our appeal to a wider audience. We also now have a proprietary end-to-end in-house NFT factory, where we create our own content distributed on our marketplace through primary drops in auction. Users can buy, sell and collect NFTs on our secondary market to add to their collection sets and receive promotions and utility associated with certain NFT. Prior to March's NCAA basketball tournament, DraftKings Marketplace introduced the Primetime NFT Series, which is designed to deepen engagement with DraftKings during these defining moments. DraftKings' Primetime NFT Series collection includes proprietary and homegrown DraftKings NFTs that receive cross-product utility and bonuses only available at the DraftKings dressings ecosystem such as DFS tickets, BK dollars, crowns, automatic gold status tier in our loyalty program and sportsbook free back. We will continue to look for opportunities to develop our own content and work with high-quality third-party content suppliers, such as our relationship with Autograph and our recently announced deal with Metabilia. We also continue to build out our media vertical through content agreements with prominent voices within the sports industry, such as former ESPN and a hosting commentator, Mike Golic Sr.; Meadowlark Media personality, Jessica Smetana; and a championship-winning NFL executive, Michael Lombardi. Most recently, popular baseball personality and content creator, Jared Carrabis and former Notre Dame footfall player and television personality, Mike Golic Jr. joined DraftKings. Each of these agreements brings exclusive content such as podcast and in-depth commentary, which can only be found at DraftKings. I look forward to updating you on additional product development throughout the year. Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to note that we recently marked our 10-year anniversary as a company. I want to thank my cofounders, Paul Liberman, and Matt Kalish; and all of our stakeholders, including our employees, both past and present; our customers; and our investors who help make all of our achievements possible. We also recently published our second ESG report. You can find the report on our Investor Relations website. The report focuses on our ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance issues, including responsible gaming, the well-being and vitality of our employees and the communities in which they work and environmental sustainability. We believe our long-term success is sustained by our attentiveness to each and every one of our customers, employees, shareholders and communities, and we look forward to continuing to achieve meaningful ESG progress. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings' CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our first quarter results and updated 2022 guidance.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We are really pleased to announce our Q1 results of $417 million of revenue and negative $290 million of adjusted EBITDA. Our B2C revenue grew 44% versus prior year as we saw a strong performance across our states. Our customers are very strong, with handle per active up in every single state versus prior year and no discernible sign of macroeconomic factors impacting our customers' engagement with our products. It's worth noting our revenue would have been roughly $25 million better, if not for some customer-friendly sport outcomes. MUPs increased by 29% to 2.0 million and ARPMUP increased 11% to $67. MUPs were up in all states with mobile registration available in both Q1 2021 and Q1 2022 as we continue to retain well and acquire new customers, and we're buoyed by new states we've launched since Q1 2021. ARPMUP was strong as well and would have been $71 were it not for tough hold. As most of you saw in the state data and in press reports, hold was lower than typical for the industry in Q1 due to sport outcomes. B2B was as expected, generating $13 million in the quarter due to the termination of our Asian reseller agreement. Gross margin rate on an adjusted EBITDA basis was 32%. Q1 gross margin rate was heavily impacted by the launch of New York, which had negative gross margin in the quarter due to Q1 being its launch quarter and, of course, the state having the highest tax rate in the country. New York accounted for more than half of our year-over-year decline in gross margin rate. Continued mix shift out of high-margin daily fantasy sports also impacted our year-over-year change in gross margin rate. Looking forward, I expect gross margin rate to settle at roughly 40% for the full year 2022 as promotional intensity declines in our more mature states, and we continue to reap the benefits from bringing our bet engine in-house. On adjusted EBITDA, I am pleased that we posted negative $290 million, which was $40 million better than the midpoint of our guidance range. Our better-than-expected Q1 adjusted EBITDA was driven by a combination of timing of expenses as well as true cost efficiencies, which will permanently improve our underlying cost structure. Sales and marketing expenses were up 40% versus prior year, due primarily to the additional states in which we operated versus Q1 of 2021. Tax continue to be very attractive and in line with our goal of acquiring customers for an amount less than their cumulative three-year gross profit generation. Product and technology and general and administrative expenses were up 53% and 56%, respectively, versus prior year, mostly due to higher compensation expense. As I mentioned last quarter, we have clear plans in place to have meaningfully slower growth in our fixed costs starting in 2023, which supports our overall path to profitability. During the quarter, we refreshed our multiyear plan and continue to have a strong conviction that under any realistic scenario state-launch timing, we have sufficient capital to achieve positive free cash flow comfortably. As a reminder, we continue to believe that at least 10 states will be contribution-profit positive in 2022, meaning those states would generate significant positive contribution profit in 2023. This trend, combined with a meaningfully slower growth rate in our fixed costs, sets us up for improved cash flow in 2023 and to not need additional capital. Looking forward, on our earnings call in February, we increased our 2022 revenue guidance to a range of $1.85 billion to $2.0 billion. Today, we are raising our revenue guidance to a range of $1.925 billion to $2.025 billion for 2022. The $50 million increase of the midpoint to $1.975 billion equates to year-over-year revenue growth of 52%, largely due to B2C revenue growth of approximately 60%. This guidance is based on the strong fundamental customer trends we are seeing and a return to normal hold for the remainder of the year. This guidance is only for the states in which we are currently live. We expect MUPs and ARPMUP to grow at a roughly equal rate in 2022 as in 2021. Our outlook for Marketplace in B2B is unchanged at approximately $70 million and $40 million, respectively. Regarding our 2022 quarterly revenue cadence, we expect Q2 revenue to be between $400 million and $420 million, which is slightly higher than the implied guidance we provided in February. We expect Q3 revenue to also be between $400 million and $420 million and Q4 to be $730 million to $750 million. You'll notice that cadence implies a relatively higher percentage of revenue being generated in the second half of this year compared to 2021. This is due to our expectation that New York and Louisiana will ramp up throughout the year and DraftKings Marketplace will hit its stride at the beginning of football season. Today, we are also meaningfully improving our adjusted EBITDA guidance from a range of negative $825 million to $925 million to a range of negative $760 million to $840 million, which represents a $75 million improvement in the midpoint. We performed $40 million better than our expectations in Q1 as a result of the timing of expenses that we now expect to recognize through the remainder of the year and efficiency opportunities that we have identified and captured across the P&L. The net impact of these efficiencies as well as flow-through of our increased 2022 revenue guidance results in the $75 million improvement in the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guide. From a quarterly perspective for 2022, we expect our adjusted EBITDA in Q2 to be between negative $140 million and $160 million due to the timing shift of expenses, offset by efficiencies. We expect adjusted EBITDA in Q3, which is impacted by the start of the NFL season, to be about double Q2, and we expect our Q4 performance to be the best for the year as we benefit from higher seasonal revenue. It is very important to note that our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2022 includes all states in which we were live as of May 6, including New York and Louisiana, but does not include the impact of our acquisition of GNOG or any other new jurisdiction launches such as Ontario. For the full year, we expect that the acquisition of GNOG, combined with our expected launch in Ontario in the second quarter, would contribute $130 million to $150 million in revenue and negative $50 million to $70 million in adjusted EBITDA. For Q2, we expect that the GNOG business, combined with our launch in Ontario, would contribute between $20 million and $25 million in revenue and negative $35 million to $45 million in adjusted EBITDA, assuming Ontario launches in May. We are very pleased that underlying customer trends continue to be very positive and that we have identified and captured efficiency opportunities that, together, have allowed us to improve our 2022 adjusted EBITDA forecast. We feel terrific about our customer cohort gross profit paybacks as well as state profitability and thus, our trajectory for revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the short and long term. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: So in the first quarter, revenue came a little bit ahead of expectations while marketing was much lower. Can you just talk about what's going on with marketing? Where you're finding efficiencies? Where you're seeing opportunities?\nJason Robins: Thanks, Tom. It's a great question. I think we're starting to enter the phase where national advertising is going to be more and more of our mix and we are able to, through a series of tests that we've been conducting over the past few quarters, optimize out of some of the local television and other local marketing that we're doing. So, I think that's been a big source of efficiency there, and we expect it to increase, of course, as more states launch.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Just circling back to GNOG and in some of their remarks, how should we think about what GNOG is going to do for MUPs and ARPMUP? And then Jason, I appreciate the commentary on all the state legislation. You didn't mention Massachusetts. I know, there's two competing bills. Could you give us an update on what you think about what's going on there as well?\nJason Robins: Sure. So on GNOC, just to remind everybody, the rationale -- strategic rationale behind the deal was really for us to be able to increase the audience that we'd be able to reach. What we found is that the DraftKings brand is very strong with a certain demographic of customers, particularly those that are sports fans. It's really more as a sports brand. We have had some success getting casino-first customers on, and we feel really good about the state of the product and have really great LTVs once we do get those customers on, but we think there might be a more efficient way to do it. And we also think there might be audience that we're not getting to right now. So that's really the goal is to go after that other segment to the iGaming market. And I think having a strong brand like Golden Nugget that really appeals to that segment of audience will help us increase our MUPs. As far as Massachusetts goes, we continue to be hopeful that there will be something done. This is obviously our backyard. So having our products be legal in the Commonwealth is very important to us. And just like any legislative process, even one in our backyard, it's always impossible to predict what's going to happen. And we continue to be hopeful and we continue to be ready and available to work with lawmakers should we be able to be of assistance.\nJed Kelly: And just following up on Golden Nugget. The gross margin guidance you called out, that does not include any impacts from Golden Nugget.\nJason Robins: No. We separately are guiding to the combined impact of Golden Nugget and Ontario. We want to provide more of an apples-to-apples view, so that we could highlight some of the cost efficiencies and also revenue outperformance we're seeing in the core business. And we -- separately, Jason Park shared some numbers around what we expect the combined effect of Golden Nugget and Ontario to be this year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: I just want to go back to some of the comments around gross margin. Obviously, some clear one-time impacts in this quarter due to New York, and it sounds like hold as well. But Jason, if I caught the comment correctly, I think you mentioned 40% for the full year. I think your longer-term target, how's that number getting into the mid or even high 50s? Could you help us think about like the bridge and some of the pieces to see that step function or improve materially in the medium to long-term?\nJason Robins: Sure. So I think the biggest factor will be the lowering of promotional intensity, promotional intensity as both an impact to net revenue and margin because a lot of the costs that we see in the COGS lines come as a function of gross revenue. So naturally, having less contra revenue will bring up margin. Also, there are a number of other cost initiatives that we have underway, some focused on COGS, some focused on other parts of the P&L that we believe will improve COGS over time. So we think between the internal initiatives that we have as well as just the natural change to gross margin, due to lower in promotional intensity, you'll see us reach the long-term targets that we've set out.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bernie McTernan from Needham & Company.\nBernard McTernan: Jason, I was just wondering, are you seeing any change in the promotional or competitive intensity in the U.S.? And is that impacting your strategy at all? And would love -- if intensity is falling off, just how you think about kind of like the diminishing terms of advertising spend, whether it's an opportunity for you guys to be more aggressive or keep your spend and keep share? Or is the opportunity to pull back and have more flow through to the bottom line?\nJason Robins: I think that's a great question. I would separate that into two things. One would be new user offers and the second would be tentpole events, such as start of NFL or Super Bowl. I think we'll always run promotions around those events. Those events are great for reactivating people. They're great for acquiring. I think that will always be a part of our strategy. And what we see is that a lot of the promotional dollars end up being put back into play, which increases the longevity of a customer, which is great. And it also is just really great for activating people during key times. So, that I think will continue. I do think that some of the very aggressive new user offers have started to taper off significantly. And we always stay disciplined. We never went nearly as far as we saw some of our competitors going with the aggression of new user offers. But certainly, a softening there will help, I think, the overall market and could lead to faster-than-expected reduction in promotional intensity versus previous -- previously what we may have thought.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Stauff from Susquehanna.\nJoe Stauff: Two questions, if I could. One is on Golden Nugget. And just wondering, it's always a well-managed company. As you suggested, it gives you access to a new consumer demographic and a high proportion of digital slots. They did rent all three pieces of their tech stack. And I'm wondering how quickly that software integration would take? And then maybe the second question is just on sports hold kind of going forward and maybe some of the product mix changes that you have and how to think about that the rest of the year.\nJason Robins: Can you repeat the second question, please?\nJoe Stauff: Sure. I was just wondering for your OSB product offering and the product mix that you've realized to date, some of maybe the newer products that you would have that could move the sports margin higher going forward.\nJason Robins: Great. Thank you. So on your first question around Golden Nugget and the integration plan, one of the nice things about having a bit of a period between the announcement and the close of the deal is we have a really strong integration plan. So everybody knows exactly what they need to do to perform that migration.\n--: But certainly, by the time of our next earnings call in August, we will be able to do that and intend to do so. And we expect that there will be a lot of synergy realized once we complete that migration. On the product side, I think it continues to be about pushing parlay and same-game parlays. We've only had the same-game parlay product for about six months or so now. It's been doing very well. We've added a lot to that offering. So, we're going to continue to find ways to improve that product and also continue to find ways to introduce it to our audience and ensure that they know how fun it can be. And I think that will be the biggest driver of upward hold. When we look at where we see some opportunities based on observations of competitors, almost all of the opportunity, we believe, is in driving higher parlay mix.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Bazinet from Citi.\nJason Bazinet: I just had a quick question on the 10 states contributing or generating positive contribution margin this year. But is there -- would those just be the states that we would expect based on the launch date? And then given the lower promotions, the faster customer ramp you talked about on the last earnings call in advertising efficiency, has the rule of thumb sort of tightened in terms of how long it takes the state to generate contribution profits?\nJason Robins: That's a great question. On the first topic, we specifically list the states out in our March Investor Day presentation, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. I must confess, I will probably lose track if I try to cite all 10 off memory here, but we list them out. So I encourage you to go take a look there. On the second question, I think it's a great point. We are seeing faster ramp, which has resulted in more meaningful marketing and promotional investment upfront in some of our earlier states, but also appears to be leading to a faster path to profitability. So, we haven't put a new sort of game plan out there yet, but we are seeing that. And in the coming months, we may be able to say something about what that path to profitability time line can look like, but it certainly is moving in a positive direction.\nOperator: Our next question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: I just want to go back to -- Jason Park, something you talked about a little bit about the growth rates on products and technology and G&A expenses. Obviously, in the quarter, and I'm making the adjustments for some of the noncash items, but core G&A was down fairly nicely sequentially. I'm assuming that's where some of the timing stuff lies?\nJason Park: Yes. On a sequential basis, Q4 versus Q1, I think the G&A reduction is more about the accrual of annual bonuses for the employees. That's going to be the big driver. In terms of timing shift, that was probably a bit more than half of the Q1 beat. And you'll see that come back in as recognized costs throughout the remainder of the year. It was throughout multiple cost categories, Carlo. It wasn't any -- it wasn't sort of disproportionately focused on any one category.\nCarlo Santarelli: Okay. Great. And then just as you talked about kind of moving into '23, the comment was we would see kind of meaningfully slower expense growth. At some point in this year, do we anticipate perhaps some of those items start to level off on a sequential basis at least, and then you start to kind of straight line from there?\nJason Robins: So -- that's a great question, Carlo. Thank you. I think that we will see that start to happen a bit, but a lot of the growth that we're seeing year-over-year and, for example, compensation costs, comes from hires that were made throughout '21, which didn't have a full year of salary and benefits in '21, but due in '22. We already are focusing on leveling off headcount expense and also looking for other areas that we can manage expense better. So there are a number of initiatives underway. We don't have anything yet that we are ready to say is going to yield results, but there's a lot of effort focused there, and we'll have more to say on that in the coming quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Graham from Canaccord.\nMichael Graham: Jason, you mentioned the New Jersey profitability profile, it was improving. And I just wonder if you could give a little more depth around like is that more on the revenue side or the marketing side? Or just kind of what are some of the moving pieces there? And sort of a related question, you're seeing nice ARPMUP expansion, and maybe just it'd be interesting to learn a little bit of kind of about the components of that ARPMUP expansion, like our players engaging across more sports? Are there wager sizes going up? Just sort of what are you seeing in terms of player behavior there?\nJason Robins: Thanks. I'll take the first question and Jason Park can take the second. So, on your New Jersey question, it's really up and down the P&L. We're seeing strong revenue growth that's a bit better than our expectations. And we're also seeing some of the cost initiatives that we've put in place play out throughout all the states, particularly the national advertising efficiencies that we're achieving. So, it's really up and down the P&L. And JP, do you want to take the second question?\nJason Park: Yes. Great question on ARPMUP deconstruction. First off, I'd just remind you that, that Q1 ARPMUP was impacted by that roughly $25 million sport outcome hold results. So when I think about normalized ARPMUP year-over-year, I adjust for last year's hold and this year's hold in terms of a growth rate. In terms of deconstructing it a bit more in terms of frequency or bet size, we're seeing it in both places. We're seeing our existing players, which give you a great baseline on a true full quarter versus full quarter, improving -- increasing frequency. Every customer is a little bit different, but we're seeing health in both frequency and average bet size.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo.\nDan Politzer: Just a couple of state-specific questions. I was wondering if you can maybe quantify the drag New York was in the quarter. What would EBITDA have been at New York? And also one in Illinois, to the extent you can talk about any impact from the mobile registration restriction being lifted.\nJason Robins: You are right that those two things were EBITDA headwinds in the quarter. We think that both will lead to revenue outperformance down the road. So both are good things, but in the quarter certainly had negative EBITDA impact. At this time, we're not quantifying that specifically. We think that sharing how much we're investing in individual states would be of a competitively sensitive nature. So, we haven't done that. But you can certainly conclude that they were meaningful, and that our adjusted EBITDA would have been meaningfully better if we had not had those two events.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chad Beynon from Macquarie.\nChad Beynon: Wondering, if you could touch broadly on trends within DFS either growth or contribution. I believe, in the back half of the year, you noted that it was still growing. I think it's probably more of a growth business during the NFL. But wondering how that business has changed and kind of how that's contributing to your 2022 guidance.\nJason Robins: It's a good question. So what we sometimes see with DFS is when state launches, there's so much excitement around sports betting that there's a bit of cannibalization. And we did see that in New York. Now in other states, we've seen that level off or even come back, which is why Daily Fantasy Sports continues to be a growing product, but too early to say whether that will continue in New York. We have no reason to think it will be different than other states though. But certainly, given the size of the DFS customer base and revenue in New York, it did have a meaningful impact on the quarter. And I think going forward, we're not necessarily assuming it will come back, but both, based on historical trends as well as innovations and expansion of that product such as the F1 racing games that we added, we do think there's no reason to believe that DFS will not continue to grow. But certainly, based on cadence of state launch timing, there can be in-quarter impacts to DFS, which are meaningfully cannibalistic because the new state often comes with lots of excitement over sports betting. And it also depends on the time of the year. As you noted, football is really great time for DFS, early NBA season. Back half of the NBA season tends to be a little lighter. So, I think that New York launch, coupled with that, led to a little bit of softness in DFS in the quarter, which, again, we're not assuming will come back. But based on historical trends, we believe it will.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Glagola from Cowen.\nStephen Glagola: Jason, following four NFL seasons, the industry remains concentrated around you, FanDuel and BetMGM, with some fragmentation largely around the remaining operators on a state-by-state basis. With the backdrop of depressed share prices, do you see further consolidation in the industry coming near term? And given the scrutiny around your EBITDA losses and to reach profitability, how does DraftKings balance exploring further M&A with executing on your current playbook?\nJason Robins: It's a great question. I think that certainly, it is quite possible that there will be further consolidation. I think that from our standpoint, we just made a very significant acquisition in Golden Nugget Online Gaming. We're very excited about that. And I think that's a template that fits the profile of what types of things we'd look for, something that's strategically complementary, not just a pure consolidation play, something that comes with a great team, which we're very excited about, Thomas and Warren and the team as well as, of course, Tillman and the contributions that he'll make and then also a strong business, a healthy business. Golden Nugget Online gaming is not one of these businesses that was burning a tremendous amount of cash. So it didn't come with a drag on our EBITDA of any significance. So those are the types of things that we would look for. I obviously can't speak to what other operators, who might be considering themselves consolidators, would look for, but that's the type of thing that we would look for.\nStephen Glagola: I appreciate that. And then if I can squeeze in one more. Could you provide any update on what you're seeing on iGaming legislation? Or do you see any catalyst to increase states going live with iGaming over the next 12 to 24 months?\nJason Robins: Yes. That's another great question. So we've obviously seen tremendous momentum in the sports betting legislative world. iGaming, we've seen several bills introduced but haven't seen much movement since Connecticut legalized back in Q4 of last year, so -- or launched, I should say, back in Q4 of last year. So we are continuing to press forward there. But as we've always said, we expect sports betting to be the main focus for legislators. And then as those states get more comfortable, I think, more iGaming bills will come through. And that's been a pretty consistent view we've had for a while. And we actually have been pleased to see that there's been some acceleration there given that several states have just decided to do sports betting and iGaming together. But we continue to believe that it will be sports betting-led for the next year or two and that more and more momentum will begin to build around iGaming over the coming years.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robert Fishman from MoffettNathanson.\nRobert Fishman: Can you expand on how building out your media vertical with the new personalities and the exclusive content that they bring helps drive the incremental engagement to your platform? And maybe how you measure the return on this investment? And then on a related note, is your preference to keep building out your media strategy organically? Or are you open to new formal partnerships with media companies or even expanding the existing ones?\nJason Robins: Thank you for asking. So I think we've always thought there were strong synergies between media and what we traditionally do on the gaming side. It's no secret that a lot of our customer acquisition comes from the marketing we do on media channels. So being able to drive some of that traffic organically, I think, is of great interest to us. And at the same time, we want the business to be able to stand on its own and to be able to make a profit. So that's the media business. So that's really how we're looking at it as can we build a business that works on both ends, both as a business that makes money and generate positive cash flow, as well as a business that will help create great synergies for us on the customer acquisition and retention side. As far as how we are exploring and are actively partaking in all those routes, some of what we do is organic. We also have great partnerships with several media outlets. We also have content partnerships with companies like Meadowlark Media. And I think for us, we recognize that there's a large world out there, and there's a lot of value in cross-pollination with content. So we remain very flexible on that front. I think there are certainly large scale, all the way down to medium-scale partnerships that we would consider that would add to some of the organic efforts that we're putting into this space.\nOperator: Our next question is from Noah Naparst from Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Naparst: This is on Noah Naparst for Stephen Grambling. As we look towards this summer and fall, are there any differences in the sports calendar we should be aware of when that comes to mind as the World Cup, which you touched on a bit? Any color on what those events could look like in terms of betting activity or hold? And then I have one follow-up.\nJason Robins: Sure. Yes, it's a great question. So I think the World Cup is the big one. I think there should be some decent betting on it. Obviously, around the world, soccer is a much more popular sport at this point than in the U.S., but it's been growing with popularity in the U.S., and I think that the World Cup often spikes that interest. So, we do have some hope that we'll see an increased volume there this year, and we'll just have to see. But naturally, there are other things that are a little bit different here and there, extra weeks of seasons and days and games, but nothing else that I see is very material.\nNoah Naparst: Got it. And can you remind us of the NOLs you're carrying forward at this point in time?\nJason Robins: Do you want to take that one, Jason?\nJason Park: Yes. I'll have to get back to you on the latest and greatest number.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Sigdahl from Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\nRyan Sigdahl: Looking at guidance for Ontario and GNOG, it seems to imply minimal net revenue from Ontario. One, is that right? And then two, if you can deconstruct the two on revenue and loss expectations, that would be great.\nJason Robins: I think at this point, we are not planning to deconstruct it to because particularly, with GNOG, I mean we just closed it yesterday. And while we've certainly done a lot of diligence, there is some variance there. And so we felt it was better to kind of manage the two together as far as impact. I do want to point out that even when you take the most conservative end of our guidance for those two, we are still -- even with those impacts, which were not contemplated in our guidance last quarter, we're still better with our new guidance plus those impacts than we were last quarter. So great to see that some of the cost efficiencies that we're identifying are able to effectively fund new state or, in this case, province launches as well as the absorption of an acquisition. So we're going to continue to look for ways to try to neutralize the impact of new state launches through identification of further cost efficiencies up and down the business.\nRyan Sigdahl: Great. One more, if I may. New York, I would assume it was decremental to average ARPMUP. Are you able to quantify that?\nJason Robins: So New York, we are not quantifying any specific state impacts at this point. I do think you are correct that, due to it being a launch quarter and having promotional investment, that there was some negative impact. That said, we've also seen a fairly high level of handle per active come from New York as well. So, it may not have been as significant as you think, but it certainly did have some impact.\nOperator: And our next question is from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.\nBarry Jonas: Jason, how are you thinking about DraftKings entering Nevada retail and OSB now?\nJason Robins: Well, we've been very interested in Nevada. And right now, we're exploring opportunities there. It's obviously a state that attracts a lot of attention because of its association with gaming. There's a decent-sized market there in terms of online sports betting. That said, there's also some things that make it a little bit less integrated with our business, such as the need to have in-person registration to open a mobile account as well as some processes that make it difficult to connect wallets and apps with the rest of the country. But we are certainly interested in Nevada. We are looking into it. And I think that if the opportunity presents itself, we'd love to be able to offer customers in Nevada, our products.\nJason Park: Just to jump in on the question on NOLs, I was just checking ensuring that we did not disclose the latest NOL number for the Q. But if you refer back to our 10-K filed in mid-February that was just around $800 million.\nOperator: Our next question is from Clark Lampen from BTIG.\nClark Lampen: I have one on Marketplace. Jason, you talked about Marketplace really hitting its stride around the NFL season. I'm going to guess that, that's not because you expect an inflection in sort of more memorabilia-oriented NFTs. So maybe it's the utility focused ones that you were talking about. So, could you give us a sense of maybe, one, whether that factors it; two, the way in which some of those utility-oriented NFPs could actually integrate with the gaming-focused businesses?\nJason Robins: Thank you. Yes, I think you're exactly right. So a few things. One, we just recently developed some in-house content creation capabilities and also built some back-end infrastructure to be able to tie benefits on sports betting and Daily Fantasy and even iGaming to ownership of NFT content we create. And the way we're seeing the market move, it really is important to have utility. There are certainly some that are working purely as collectibles, and that will continue to be a segment of the market. But I think a lot of the growth will be in utility-based NFTs. The second thing is, in addition to our in-house content we're producing, we also, just a little while ago, announced a partnership with the NFLPA to create NFT-based Fantasy games. So we think given the size of our Fantasy audience and the success we've had early on with NFT, that will be a really big product for us and could be something that really opens up to a much larger audience.\nOperator: And our next question is from Robin Farley from UBS.\nRobin Farley: I was wondering if there's a way to quantify how much of the lower hold was maybe kind of marketing like offering more favorable odds rather than just purely the sport outcomes, if you could give us a sense of that?\nJason Robins: Sure. What we've shared is that about $25 million of revenue hit came from purely sport outcome. So that's the number we've shared. And I think other things you can attribute if you are identifying any other questions around hold to other factors. But $25 million was the impact that came from game outcomes, which interestingly was the other way in Q1 last year. So, as you look at year-over-year comps, it's affected not only by that $25 million hit in game outcomes this year, but also favorable game outcomes in Q1 of 2021 that had a positive impact on hold.\nRobin Farley: So, you're not breaking out anything withhold that's related to kind of marketing costs, anything like that?\nJason Robins: No. We typically don't share those types of details as some of the promotional and marketing tactics we've tested into over many years are things that we deem to be very competitively advantaged for us. So, we don't typically get into breaking down that element of the business.\nRobin Farley: Great. And then also the comment on the call, I think you talked about handle per active was up in every state. And I know your ARPMUP is up, but just going back to the states where it was in both periods. Can [Technical Difficulty] amounts of that for net gaming revenue per user on that sort of comparable like same-state basis?\nJason Robins: Sorry, you broke up a little at the end there. Can you repeat that last part of the question?\nRobin Farley: Sure. In the opening comments, there was a mention that handle per active was up in every state, right? In other words, states that were legal in both periods. And so, we're just wondering how that would look for net gaming revenue. Just thinking about there are some states that had net NGR declines, even though handle and GGR was up. And so just wondering if that's showing up on a per user basis as well for you.\nJason Robins: The reason that we saw -- ARPMUP, one of our KPIs, is based on net revenue. So the increase we saw there year-over-year is definitely reflective of the positive momentum we see in growth of net gaming revenue in each state. Of course, with anything, there's always places where one or two here or there may be up or down. But usually, those are for explainable reasons. So for example, in Illinois, where we had the re-launch of mobile registration, there was a much more aggressive new user push with contra revenue-generated promotions that didn't exist in Q1 of last year. But for the most part, the ARPMUP increase, which is NGR, is cross forward and cost base.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff: You mentioned that the year-over-year growth in MUP was driven by retention. I was hoping you can help quantify that on everything, excluding DFS in the quarter and how that trended in 1Q relative to the past few quarters? And then, my second question is probably more for Jason Park. Can you talk about the relationship between EBITDA losses and cash burn? I know this quarter the cash burn was a little bit higher than EBITDA loss. Some of that can be explained by CapEx and some other investing activities. How do you see that trending over the next year?\nJason Robins: So on the first question, ARPMUP was definitely up due to both retention and an increase in player handle growth. So, it was both that contributed to that. And we haven't, at this time, deconstructed those, but we can share that both contributed. As far as the product level question, same story, all products were generally up. But DFS, as we noted earlier, did see some cannibalization. So you can infer based on that, that if we excluded DFS, ARPMUP growth would have been higher.\nJason Park: Yes. And in terms of your question on EBITDA to free cash flow conversion, I think you listed out a few of the buckets. Capitalized software, which is really DraftKings' primary CapEx, should be fairly steady, if you look at the quarter quarterly trends for the last few years, I think that's a very extrapolatable number going forward. Other than that, you'll see some one-time upfront state licenses impact free cash flow and any significant vesting of employee stock, which you saw around the low-teen million impact in Q1, but that will purely depend on timing of vesting. I would say that those are the three big things to look for EBITDA to free cash flow conversion.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn it back over to Jason Robins for final remarks.\nJason Robins: Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We had an excellent first quarter. We continue to be very excited about 2022 and look forward to speaking with you all over the next few weeks. The Company continues to be focused on strong top line growth and also on cost optimization, and we're really excited about a number of initiatives we have underway in both those categories and look forward to sharing more with you in the coming quarter. I hope you all stay safe and well, and thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will cover the following topics. First, we are very excited to welcome the Golden Nugget Online Gaming team to DraftKings. Since the announcement of the proposed acquisition in August 2021, our excitement around bringing these companies together has only increased. The acquisition closed yesterday, and we are well prepared to integrate our respective businesses, begin executing on our multi-brand strategy and capture adjusted EBITDA synergies, which we expect to reach approximately $300 million long-term. Second, we'll discuss our first quarter financial achievements. Revenue for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $7 million, and adjusted EBITDA significantly outperformed our expectations, finishing more than 12% better than the midpoint of our guidance. Third, we see a stronger top and bottom line outlook for the year and are raising both our 2022 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. Despite broader concerns around the macroeconomic environment and inflation, our cohort level data has remained very healthy and our path to profitability has become more clear. Legislative momentum has remained robust as well. Looking forward, we see strong top line growth continuing through the remainder of the year and beyond, coupled with continued optimization of our margin profile overall cost structure. Finally, I will touch on recent product developments in adjacent growth verticals. We are continuing to innovate and improve the customer experience by consistently adding new games and features, which we believe will ultimately support customer acquisition, retention and by extension player LTV. Additionally, we continue to make progress in media and marketplace, and we are very excited about the future prospects for both. Let's start with our acquisition of Golden Nugget Online Gaming. We are very excited to welcome the Golden Nugget Online Gaming team to DraftKings and have a well-designed integration plan that is already being implemented. The acquisition will allow DraftKings to leverage Golden Nugget's established brand to broaden our reach in new customer segments, particularly within iGaming. It will also enhance the combined company's iGaming product offerings through DraftKings' vertically integrated tech stack and Golden Nugget Online Gaming's unique live dealer capabilities. In addition, the transaction increases DraftKings customer database size through access to the more than 5.5 million members in the databases of the Golden Nugget 24k Club and Landry Select Club on top of the current DraftKings' database of more than 20 million accounts. We continue to have confidence that the combination of our businesses will result in long-term adjusted EBITDA synergies of approximately $300 million. Now let's turn to our first quarter results. DraftKings generated $417 million of revenue in the first quarter, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $7 million. Revenue growth was primarily driven by our B2C business, which increased 44% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA of negative $290 million in the quarter also outperformed our expectations by $40 million compared to the midpoint of our guidance. Part of the reason why we are outperforming our own expectations markets such as New Jersey have turned highly profitable and continuing to grow at an attractive rate. We have also identified efficiency opportunities and executed on them, which drove some of the outperformance in first quarter adjusted EBITDA. These efficiencies were up and down the income statement, including in our COGS, marketing and corporate fixed costs. The primary driver of these cost opportunities was faster growth in state expansion, which has allowed us to accelerate progress towards our plans for our long-term cost structure. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA also benefited from corporate costs that shifted from Q1 to the remainder of the year. Consequently, some of the reduced costs in Q1 will continue to positively impact DraftKings going forward, while others are simply due to timing. Suffice it to say, we will continue to look for opportunities to accelerate the realization of cost efficiencies as DraftKings continues to grow at scale. Our key performance metrics, including user acquisition, retention and engagement, also continued to trend well. Q1 includes two marquee sporting events: the Super Bowl and March Madness. Basketball, both the NBA and college, also drew increased attention and interest throughout the quarter. The NBA has been strong, including when the NFL was still in play, while the Super Bowl saw tremendous customer engagement. For the Super Bowl, we set a single day record for first-time OSB betters, which increased 77% year-over-year. For the first weekend of March Madness, our first-time LSB betters increased 42% year-over-year. March Madness this year featured various player-friendly results overall, especially the exciting run by Saint Peters to the Elite Eight. Betters across the country backed the Peacock during their surprise run. This run contributed to our lower-than-forecasted OSB hold. Whole variance due to game outcomes resulted in approximately $25 million of reduced revenue in the quarter. First quarter monthly unique payers increased to approximately 2 million, up 29% versus Q1 2021. Average revenue per monthly unique player increased 11% year-over-year to $67. Notably, average revenue per monthly unique player would have grown approximately 26% if we adjusted both Q1 2022 and Q1 2021 for OSB hold. Cost of goods sold and marketing spend were both elevated in the first quarter, primarily due to our launch in New York on January 8. Gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted by sports betting hold during the quarter. With that, I will turn to our updated outlook for the business. We have several unique capabilities, including our growing DFS database, which is a great source of OSB customer acquisition; a decade of marketing know-how to acquire sports fans; our sophisticated data science and analytics organizations; our vertically integrated tech stack; top-rated products across all categories in which we operate; and single account and wallet. These capabilities are very difficult to replicate by other operators and are the reasons for a very attractive tax and strong share, which support our growth outlook for 2022 and beyond. We are raising the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance from $1.925 billion to $1.975 billion and improving our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of negative $760 million to negative $840 million. This increased guidance does not include the contribution of the Golden Nugget Online Gaming business nor does it include our contemplated launch in Ontario. Jason Park will touch on our preliminary expectations for GNOG in Ontario. I also want to spend a few minutes discussing the outlook beyond 2022. As a starting point, the pipeline for new states remains robust. As you know, following our launches in New York and Louisiana, DraftKings is currently live with online sports betting in 17 states that collectively represent approximately 36% of the U.S. population. Additionally, DraftKings is live with iGaming in five states, representing approximately 11% of the U.S. population. We also expect to go live in Ontario in the near future, pending life insure and regulatory approval. Ontario represents about 40% of Canada's population, and Ontario will be the fifth largest U.S. state by population if it were in the U.S. However, due to the presence of gray market operators, many of which have been present in Ontario for several years, we do not believe that the timing of our launch will have any impact on the share we are able to achieve in that province. There are three U.S. jurisdictions that have legalized mobile sports betting in which we are preparing to launch upon licensure and approval from regulators: Maryland, Ohio and Puerto Rico. These three jurisdictions represent approximately 7% of the U.S. population, and we'll bring the percentage of the population where Draftkings expects to offer legalized mobile sports betting to approximately 43%. In Kansas, which is about 1% of the U.S. population, a mobile and retail sports wagering bill has passed the legislature and is now pending executive action. We are also very excited by momentum in California. The approximately 1.6 million signatures submitted by Californians for solutions to homelessness and mental health support will likely allow us to qualify the ballot measure for the 2022 November ballot. This is a really important step. Once the signatures are verified, then the initiative will be placed on the ballot in November. And if the initiative passes with a simple majority, then it becomes law. From there, regulators will implement the framework, and we are hopeful that we can get live sometime in 2023, pending licensure and regulatory approval. California, of course, represents a significant revenue and adjusted EBITDA opportunity, with approximately 12% of the United States population. In fact, if California were a country, it would be the fifth largest economy in the world ranked by GDP. In short, from a legalization perspective, there is a lot to look forward to. Finally, I will touch on recent product developments in adjacent growth verticals. Our sports betting app continues to score very well in third-party surveys. Eilers & Krejcik recently published its quarterly report on U.S. sports betting and app rank. The firm tested 41 sports betting apps and rated each on user experience, betting interface, features, core and esthetics. DraftKings' app was tied for number one overall and was the top three for user experience, betting interface and features. We continue to believe that product innovation and quality of customer experience will create strong customer acquisition, retention and LTVs, giving DraftKings as a sustainable competitive advantage over the long term. Q1 was only the second full quarter since migrating to our own proprietary in-house technology platform, and we are pleased with the progress we have made not just with our sports betting app, but across our entire product portfolio. In the first quarter, we continued to deepen our content offer for OSB. For example, we added next field goal micro markets for the NBA and college basketball, which offers the ability to wager on the next field go type, next go team and whether the next two- or three-point shot will be made by the home or away team. We also added several player markets to our college basketball same-game parlay offering, including point score, assist, rebounds and three pointers made as well as combinations of these markets. In iGaming, our focus on cross-selling and in-house content development continued to pay dividends. In the first quarter, 43% of mobile sports betting users in our iGaming space also engaged with our iGaming product, and 54% of iGaming handle came from DraftKings' developed game. And in April, we launched our first DraftKings' developed slot scheme in New Jersey. With DraftKings Social, we have created an integrated and highly engaged community that allows fans to interact with each other within a peer-to-peer environment. In April, we launched betting groups, which are a seamless way to collaborate on a sports betting experience. Users can create a group and distribute the link for others to join. Once the group is created, all actions of the members who elected to share their best will be dropped into the group in real time, notifying group members with a link directly to that new bet. In fact, anyone in a league can remake their league as a sports betting group in our mobile sports book. And one task invite everyone in the league to their betting group. Imagine a group of friends watch March Madness or the World Cup from wherever they might be around a country, all engaged in all with the rooting interest and all of it happening via DraftKings. For Daily Fantasy Sports, in March, we added international auto racing lead, Formula One, to our portfolio of sport offer. This offering leverages the experience and success of our NASCAR Daily Fantasy product as well as the popular Netflix series. Turning to DraftKings Marketplace. We now offer options for NFTs in the marketplace in addition to regular drops. We introduced this additional mechanism for participants to access NFTs to broaden our appeal to a wider audience. We also now have a proprietary end-to-end in-house NFT factory, where we create our own content distributed on our marketplace through primary drops in auction. Users can buy, sell and collect NFTs on our secondary market to add to their collection sets and receive promotions and utility associated with certain NFT. Prior to March's NCAA basketball tournament, DraftKings Marketplace introduced the Primetime NFT Series, which is designed to deepen engagement with DraftKings during these defining moments. DraftKings' Primetime NFT Series collection includes proprietary and homegrown DraftKings NFTs that receive cross-product utility and bonuses only available at the DraftKings dressings ecosystem such as DFS tickets, BK dollars, crowns, automatic gold status tier in our loyalty program and sportsbook free back. We will continue to look for opportunities to develop our own content and work with high-quality third-party content suppliers, such as our relationship with Autograph and our recently announced deal with Metabilia. We also continue to build out our media vertical through content agreements with prominent voices within the sports industry, such as former ESPN and a hosting commentator, Mike Golic Sr.; Meadowlark Media personality, Jessica Smetana; and a championship-winning NFL executive, Michael Lombardi. Most recently, popular baseball personality and content creator, Jared Carrabis and former Notre Dame footfall player and television personality, Mike Golic Jr. joined DraftKings. Each of these agreements brings exclusive content such as podcast and in-depth commentary, which can only be found at DraftKings. I look forward to updating you on additional product development throughout the year. Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to note that we recently marked our 10-year anniversary as a company. I want to thank my cofounders, Paul Liberman, and Matt Kalish; and all of our stakeholders, including our employees, both past and present; our customers; and our investors who help make all of our achievements possible. We also recently published our second ESG report. You can find the report on our Investor Relations website. The report focuses on our ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance issues, including responsible gaming, the well-being and vitality of our employees and the communities in which they work and environmental sustainability. We believe our long-term success is sustained by our attentiveness to each and every one of our customers, employees, shareholders and communities, and we look forward to continuing to achieve meaningful ESG progress. I will now turn the call over to DraftKings' CFO, Jason Park, who will discuss our first quarter results and updated 2022 guidance. Thanks, Tom. It's a great question. I think we're starting to enter the phase where national advertising is going to be more and more of our mix and we are able to, through a series of tests that we've been conducting over the past few quarters, optimize out of some of the local television and other local marketing that we're doing. So, I think that's been a big source of efficiency there, and we expect it to increase, of course, as more states launch. Sure. So on GNOC, just to remind everybody, the rationale -- strategic rationale behind the deal was really for us to be able to increase the audience that we'd be able to reach. What we found is that the DraftKings brand is very strong with a certain demographic of customers, particularly those that are sports fans. It's really more as a sports brand. We have had some success getting casino-first customers on, and we feel really good about the state of the product and have really great LTVs once we do get those customers on, but we think there might be a more efficient way to do it. And we also think there might be audience that we're not getting to right now. So that's really the goal is to go after that other segment to the iGaming market. And I think having a strong brand like Golden Nugget that really appeals to that segment of audience will help us increase our MUPs. As far as Massachusetts goes, we continue to be hopeful that there will be something done. This is obviously our backyard. So having our products be legal in the Commonwealth is very important to us. And just like any legislative process, even one in our backyard, it's always impossible to predict what's going to happen. And we continue to be hopeful and we continue to be ready and available to work with lawmakers should we be able to be of assistance. No. We separately are guiding to the combined impact of Golden Nugget and Ontario. We want to provide more of an apples-to-apples view, so that we could highlight some of the cost efficiencies and also revenue outperformance we're seeing in the core business. And we -- separately, Jason Park shared some numbers around what we expect the combined effect of Golden Nugget and Ontario to be this year. Sure. So I think the biggest factor will be the lowering of promotional intensity, promotional intensity as both an impact to net revenue and margin because a lot of the costs that we see in the COGS lines come as a function of gross revenue. So naturally, having less contra revenue will bring up margin. Also, there are a number of other cost initiatives that we have underway, some focused on COGS, some focused on other parts of the P&L that we believe will improve COGS over time. So we think between the internal initiatives that we have as well as just the natural change to gross margin, due to lower in promotional intensity, you'll see us reach the long-term targets that we've set out. I think that's a great question. I would separate that into two things. One would be new user offers and the second would be tentpole events, such as start of NFL or Super Bowl. I think we'll always run promotions around those events. Those events are great for reactivating people. They're great for acquiring. I think that will always be a part of our strategy. And what we see is that a lot of the promotional dollars end up being put back into play, which increases the longevity of a customer, which is great. And it also is just really great for activating people during key times. So, that I think will continue. I do think that some of the very aggressive new user offers have started to taper off significantly. And we always stay disciplined. We never went nearly as far as we saw some of our competitors going with the aggression of new user offers. But certainly, a softening there will help, I think, the overall market and could lead to faster-than-expected reduction in promotional intensity versus previous -- previously what we may have thought. Can you repeat the second question, please? Great. Thank you. So on your first question around Golden Nugget and the integration plan, one of the nice things about having a bit of a period between the announcement and the close of the deal is we have a really strong integration plan. So everybody knows exactly what they need to do to perform that migration. That's a great question. On the first topic, we specifically list the states out in our March Investor Day presentation, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. I must confess, I will probably lose track if I try to cite all 10 off memory here, but we list them out. So I encourage you to go take a look there. On the second question, I think it's a great point. We are seeing faster ramp, which has resulted in more meaningful marketing and promotional investment upfront in some of our earlier states, but also appears to be leading to a faster path to profitability. So, we haven't put a new sort of game plan out there yet, but we are seeing that. And in the coming months, we may be able to say something about what that path to profitability time line can look like, but it certainly is moving in a positive direction. So -- that's a great question, Carlo. Thank you. I think that we will see that start to happen a bit, but a lot of the growth that we're seeing year-over-year and, for example, compensation costs, comes from hires that were made throughout '21, which didn't have a full year of salary and benefits in '21, but due in '22. We already are focusing on leveling off headcount expense and also looking for other areas that we can manage expense better. So there are a number of initiatives underway. We don't have anything yet that we are ready to say is going to yield results, but there's a lot of effort focused there, and we'll have more to say on that in the coming quarter. Thanks. I'll take the first question and Jason Park can take the second. So, on your New Jersey question, it's really up and down the P&L. We're seeing strong revenue growth that's a bit better than our expectations. And we're also seeing some of the cost initiatives that we've put in place play out throughout all the states, particularly the national advertising efficiencies that we're achieving. So, it's really up and down the P&L. And JP, do you want to take the second question? You are right that those two things were EBITDA headwinds in the quarter. We think that both will lead to revenue outperformance down the road. So both are good things, but in the quarter certainly had negative EBITDA impact. At this time, we're not quantifying that specifically. We think that sharing how much we're investing in individual states would be of a competitively sensitive nature. So, we haven't done that. But you can certainly conclude that they were meaningful, and that our adjusted EBITDA would have been meaningfully better if we had not had those two events. It's a good question. So what we sometimes see with DFS is when state launches, there's so much excitement around sports betting that there's a bit of cannibalization. And we did see that in New York. Now in other states, we've seen that level off or even come back, which is why Daily Fantasy Sports continues to be a growing product, but too early to say whether that will continue in New York. We have no reason to think it will be different than other states though. But certainly, given the size of the DFS customer base and revenue in New York, it did have a meaningful impact on the quarter. And I think going forward, we're not necessarily assuming it will come back, but both, based on historical trends as well as innovations and expansion of that product such as the F1 racing games that we added, we do think there's no reason to believe that DFS will not continue to grow. But certainly, based on cadence of state launch timing, there can be in-quarter impacts to DFS, which are meaningfully cannibalistic because the new state often comes with lots of excitement over sports betting. And it also depends on the time of the year. As you noted, football is really great time for DFS, early NBA season. Back half of the NBA season tends to be a little lighter. So, I think that New York launch, coupled with that, led to a little bit of softness in DFS in the quarter, which, again, we're not assuming will come back. But based on historical trends, we believe it will. It's a great question. I think that certainly, it is quite possible that there will be further consolidation. I think that from our standpoint, we just made a very significant acquisition in Golden Nugget Online Gaming. We're very excited about that. And I think that's a template that fits the profile of what types of things we'd look for, something that's strategically complementary, not just a pure consolidation play, something that comes with a great team, which we're very excited about, Thomas and Warren and the team as well as, of course, Tillman and the contributions that he'll make and then also a strong business, a healthy business. Golden Nugget Online gaming is not one of these businesses that was burning a tremendous amount of cash. So it didn't come with a drag on our EBITDA of any significance. So those are the types of things that we would look for. I obviously can't speak to what other operators, who might be considering themselves consolidators, would look for, but that's the type of thing that we would look for. Yes. That's another great question. So we've obviously seen tremendous momentum in the sports betting legislative world. iGaming, we've seen several bills introduced but haven't seen much movement since Connecticut legalized back in Q4 of last year, so -- or launched, I should say, back in Q4 of last year. So we are continuing to press forward there. But as we've always said, we expect sports betting to be the main focus for legislators. And then as those states get more comfortable, I think, more iGaming bills will come through. And that's been a pretty consistent view we've had for a while. And we actually have been pleased to see that there's been some acceleration there given that several states have just decided to do sports betting and iGaming together. But we continue to believe that it will be sports betting-led for the next year or two and that more and more momentum will begin to build around iGaming over the coming years. Thank you for asking. So I think we've always thought there were strong synergies between media and what we traditionally do on the gaming side. It's no secret that a lot of our customer acquisition comes from the marketing we do on media channels. So being able to drive some of that traffic organically, I think, is of great interest to us. And at the same time, we want the business to be able to stand on its own and to be able to make a profit. So that's the media business. So that's really how we're looking at it as can we build a business that works on both ends, both as a business that makes money and generate positive cash flow, as well as a business that will help create great synergies for us on the customer acquisition and retention side. As far as how we are exploring and are actively partaking in all those routes, some of what we do is organic. We also have great partnerships with several media outlets. We also have content partnerships with companies like Meadowlark Media. And I think for us, we recognize that there's a large world out there, and there's a lot of value in cross-pollination with content. So we remain very flexible on that front. I think there are certainly large scale, all the way down to medium-scale partnerships that we would consider that would add to some of the organic efforts that we're putting into this space. Sure. Yes, it's a great question. So I think the World Cup is the big one. I think there should be some decent betting on it. Obviously, around the world, soccer is a much more popular sport at this point than in the U.S., but it's been growing with popularity in the U.S., and I think that the World Cup often spikes that interest. So, we do have some hope that we'll see an increased volume there this year, and we'll just have to see. But naturally, there are other things that are a little bit different here and there, extra weeks of seasons and days and games, but nothing else that I see is very material. Do you want to take that one, Jason? I think at this point, we are not planning to deconstruct it to because particularly, with GNOG, I mean we just closed it yesterday. And while we've certainly done a lot of diligence, there is some variance there. And so we felt it was better to kind of manage the two together as far as impact. I do want to point out that even when you take the most conservative end of our guidance for those two, we are still -- even with those impacts, which were not contemplated in our guidance last quarter, we're still better with our new guidance plus those impacts than we were last quarter. So great to see that some of the cost efficiencies that we're identifying are able to effectively fund new state or, in this case, province launches as well as the absorption of an acquisition. So we're going to continue to look for ways to try to neutralize the impact of new state launches through identification of further cost efficiencies up and down the business. So New York, we are not quantifying any specific state impacts at this point. I do think you are correct that, due to it being a launch quarter and having promotional investment, that there was some negative impact. That said, we've also seen a fairly high level of handle per active come from New York as well. So, it may not have been as significant as you think, but it certainly did have some impact. Well, we've been very interested in Nevada. And right now, we're exploring opportunities there. It's obviously a state that attracts a lot of attention because of its association with gaming. There's a decent-sized market there in terms of online sports betting. That said, there's also some things that make it a little bit less integrated with our business, such as the need to have in-person registration to open a mobile account as well as some processes that make it difficult to connect wallets and apps with the rest of the country. But we are certainly interested in Nevada. We are looking into it. And I think that if the opportunity presents itself, we'd love to be able to offer customers in Nevada, our products. Thank you. Yes, I think you're exactly right. So a few things. One, we just recently developed some in-house content creation capabilities and also built some back-end infrastructure to be able to tie benefits on sports betting and Daily Fantasy and even iGaming to ownership of NFT content we create. And the way we're seeing the market move, it really is important to have utility. There are certainly some that are working purely as collectibles, and that will continue to be a segment of the market. But I think a lot of the growth will be in utility-based NFTs. The second thing is, in addition to our in-house content we're producing, we also, just a little while ago, announced a partnership with the NFLPA to create NFT-based Fantasy games. So we think given the size of our Fantasy audience and the success we've had early on with NFT, that will be a really big product for us and could be something that really opens up to a much larger audience. Sure. What we've shared is that about $25 million of revenue hit came from purely sport outcome. So that's the number we've shared. And I think other things you can attribute if you are identifying any other questions around hold to other factors. But $25 million was the impact that came from game outcomes, which interestingly was the other way in Q1 last year. So, as you look at year-over-year comps, it's affected not only by that $25 million hit in game outcomes this year, but also favorable game outcomes in Q1 of 2021 that had a positive impact on hold. No. We typically don't share those types of details as some of the promotional and marketing tactics we've tested into over many years are things that we deem to be very competitively advantaged for us. So, we don't typically get into breaking down that element of the business. Sorry, you broke up a little at the end there. Can you repeat that last part of the question? The reason that we saw -- ARPMUP, one of our KPIs, is based on net revenue. So the increase we saw there year-over-year is definitely reflective of the positive momentum we see in growth of net gaming revenue in each state. Of course, with anything, there's always places where one or two here or there may be up or down. But usually, those are for explainable reasons. So for example, in Illinois, where we had the re-launch of mobile registration, there was a much more aggressive new user push with contra revenue-generated promotions that didn't exist in Q1 of last year. But for the most part, the ARPMUP increase, which is NGR, is cross forward and cost base. So on the first question, ARPMUP was definitely up due to both retention and an increase in player handle growth. So, it was both that contributed to that. And we haven't, at this time, deconstructed those, but we can share that both contributed. As far as the product level question, same story, all products were generally up. But DFS, as we noted earlier, did see some cannibalization. So you can infer based on that, that if we excluded DFS, ARPMUP growth would have been higher. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We had an excellent first quarter. We continue to be very excited about 2022 and look forward to speaking with you all over the next few weeks. The Company continues to be focused on strong top line growth and also on cost optimization, and we're really excited about a number of initiatives we have underway in both those categories and look forward to sharing more with you in the coming quarter. I hope you all stay safe and well, and thank you for joining us today."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We are really pleased to announce our Q1 results of $417 million of revenue and negative $290 million of adjusted EBITDA. Our B2C revenue grew 44% versus prior year as we saw a strong performance across our states. Our customers are very strong, with handle per active up in every single state versus prior year and no discernible sign of macroeconomic factors impacting our customers' engagement with our products. It's worth noting our revenue would have been roughly $25 million better, if not for some customer-friendly sport outcomes. MUPs increased by 29% to 2.0 million and ARPMUP increased 11% to $67. MUPs were up in all states with mobile registration available in both Q1 2021 and Q1 2022 as we continue to retain well and acquire new customers, and we're buoyed by new states we've launched since Q1 2021. ARPMUP was strong as well and would have been $71 were it not for tough hold. As most of you saw in the state data and in press reports, hold was lower than typical for the industry in Q1 due to sport outcomes. B2B was as expected, generating $13 million in the quarter due to the termination of our Asian reseller agreement. Gross margin rate on an adjusted EBITDA basis was 32%. Q1 gross margin rate was heavily impacted by the launch of New York, which had negative gross margin in the quarter due to Q1 being its launch quarter and, of course, the state having the highest tax rate in the country. New York accounted for more than half of our year-over-year decline in gross margin rate. Continued mix shift out of high-margin daily fantasy sports also impacted our year-over-year change in gross margin rate. Looking forward, I expect gross margin rate to settle at roughly 40% for the full year 2022 as promotional intensity declines in our more mature states, and we continue to reap the benefits from bringing our bet engine in-house. On adjusted EBITDA, I am pleased that we posted negative $290 million, which was $40 million better than the midpoint of our guidance range. Our better-than-expected Q1 adjusted EBITDA was driven by a combination of timing of expenses as well as true cost efficiencies, which will permanently improve our underlying cost structure. Sales and marketing expenses were up 40% versus prior year, due primarily to the additional states in which we operated versus Q1 of 2021. Tax continue to be very attractive and in line with our goal of acquiring customers for an amount less than their cumulative three-year gross profit generation. Product and technology and general and administrative expenses were up 53% and 56%, respectively, versus prior year, mostly due to higher compensation expense. As I mentioned last quarter, we have clear plans in place to have meaningfully slower growth in our fixed costs starting in 2023, which supports our overall path to profitability. During the quarter, we refreshed our multiyear plan and continue to have a strong conviction that under any realistic scenario state-launch timing, we have sufficient capital to achieve positive free cash flow comfortably. As a reminder, we continue to believe that at least 10 states will be contribution-profit positive in 2022, meaning those states would generate significant positive contribution profit in 2023. This trend, combined with a meaningfully slower growth rate in our fixed costs, sets us up for improved cash flow in 2023 and to not need additional capital. Looking forward, on our earnings call in February, we increased our 2022 revenue guidance to a range of $1.85 billion to $2.0 billion. Today, we are raising our revenue guidance to a range of $1.925 billion to $2.025 billion for 2022. The $50 million increase of the midpoint to $1.975 billion equates to year-over-year revenue growth of 52%, largely due to B2C revenue growth of approximately 60%. This guidance is based on the strong fundamental customer trends we are seeing and a return to normal hold for the remainder of the year. This guidance is only for the states in which we are currently live. We expect MUPs and ARPMUP to grow at a roughly equal rate in 2022 as in 2021. Our outlook for Marketplace in B2B is unchanged at approximately $70 million and $40 million, respectively. Regarding our 2022 quarterly revenue cadence, we expect Q2 revenue to be between $400 million and $420 million, which is slightly higher than the implied guidance we provided in February. We expect Q3 revenue to also be between $400 million and $420 million and Q4 to be $730 million to $750 million. You'll notice that cadence implies a relatively higher percentage of revenue being generated in the second half of this year compared to 2021. This is due to our expectation that New York and Louisiana will ramp up throughout the year and DraftKings Marketplace will hit its stride at the beginning of football season. Today, we are also meaningfully improving our adjusted EBITDA guidance from a range of negative $825 million to $925 million to a range of negative $760 million to $840 million, which represents a $75 million improvement in the midpoint. We performed $40 million better than our expectations in Q1 as a result of the timing of expenses that we now expect to recognize through the remainder of the year and efficiency opportunities that we have identified and captured across the P&L. The net impact of these efficiencies as well as flow-through of our increased 2022 revenue guidance results in the $75 million improvement in the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guide. From a quarterly perspective for 2022, we expect our adjusted EBITDA in Q2 to be between negative $140 million and $160 million due to the timing shift of expenses, offset by efficiencies. We expect adjusted EBITDA in Q3, which is impacted by the start of the NFL season, to be about double Q2, and we expect our Q4 performance to be the best for the year as we benefit from higher seasonal revenue. It is very important to note that our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2022 includes all states in which we were live as of May 6, including New York and Louisiana, but does not include the impact of our acquisition of GNOG or any other new jurisdiction launches such as Ontario. For the full year, we expect that the acquisition of GNOG, combined with our expected launch in Ontario in the second quarter, would contribute $130 million to $150 million in revenue and negative $50 million to $70 million in adjusted EBITDA. For Q2, we expect that the GNOG business, combined with our launch in Ontario, would contribute between $20 million and $25 million in revenue and negative $35 million to $45 million in adjusted EBITDA, assuming Ontario launches in May. We are very pleased that underlying customer trends continue to be very positive and that we have identified and captured efficiency opportunities that, together, have allowed us to improve our 2022 adjusted EBITDA forecast. We feel terrific about our customer cohort gross profit paybacks as well as state profitability and thus, our trajectory for revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the short and long term. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions. Yes. On a sequential basis, Q4 versus Q1, I think the G&A reduction is more about the accrual of annual bonuses for the employees. That's going to be the big driver. In terms of timing shift, that was probably a bit more than half of the Q1 beat. And you'll see that come back in as recognized costs throughout the remainder of the year. It was throughout multiple cost categories, Carlo. It wasn't any -- it wasn't sort of disproportionately focused on any one category. Yes. Great question on ARPMUP deconstruction. First off, I'd just remind you that, that Q1 ARPMUP was impacted by that roughly $25 million sport outcome hold results. So when I think about normalized ARPMUP year-over-year, I adjust for last year's hold and this year's hold in terms of a growth rate. In terms of deconstructing it a bit more in terms of frequency or bet size, we're seeing it in both places. We're seeing our existing players, which give you a great baseline on a true full quarter versus full quarter, improving -- increasing frequency. Every customer is a little bit different, but we're seeing health in both frequency and average bet size. Yes. I'll have to get back to you on the latest and greatest number. Just to jump in on the question on NOLs, I was just checking ensuring that we did not disclose the latest NOL number for the Q. But if you refer back to our 10-K filed in mid-February that was just around $800 million. Yes. And in terms of your question on EBITDA to free cash flow conversion, I think you listed out a few of the buckets. Capitalized software, which is really DraftKings' primary CapEx, should be fairly steady, if you look at the quarter quarterly trends for the last few years, I think that's a very extrapolatable number going forward. Other than that, you'll see some one-time upfront state licenses impact free cash flow and any significant vesting of employee stock, which you saw around the low-teen million impact in Q1, but that will purely depend on timing of vesting. I would say that those are the three big things to look for EBITDA to free cash flow conversion."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Stanton Dodge, Chief Legal Officer. You may begin.\nStanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, as discussed further in our SEC filings, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecasts. We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements other than as required by law. During this call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings release and presentation, which can be found on our website and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and update on our business, and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, and thank you all for joining. Last year at this time, we shared our first end of year letter. In that letter, I described DraftKings as a company that would thrive when business conditions became more challenging. I wrote that our culture and people positioned us well to execute, which effectively made 2023 a proven year for DraftKings. As you've seen, our team rose to the occasion. Revenue increased 64% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023, even with very customer-friendly outcomes in late November. More importantly, we improved adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2023 by nearly $600 million year-over-year and posted our first two adjusted EBITDA positive quarters in company history. Beyond our financial highlights, we improved our product and customer experience and also made a number of operational improvements to better serve our customers and operate more efficiently. We gained share, including taking the number one position in combined OSB and iGaming gross gaming revenue share in the US for the third quarter. We focused on our core value drivers and empowered our leaders to set aspirational goals and drive their teams to meet and exceed those goals. We lean heavily on data and analytics, giving us the confidence to cut expenses in some areas and double down in others. This year, our focus will largely be on essentially the same items. We are still in the early innings of the US online gaming industry, and there is still share that can be gained through innovation and operational excellence. We will continue to focus on product and customer experience as key differentiators. We will continue to leverage our scale to invest in important areas, while also focusing heavily on efficiency and optimization. And we will continue to focus on the core value drivers of our business. Having superior lifetime values and customer acquisition costs is the ultimate competitive advantage. And we have a number of initiatives planned to enhance both in 2024 and beyond. We also continue to face new competition as we consistently have over the years. In the past, we've been able to drive growth and gain share, while simultaneously becoming more efficient. But importantly, we do not take any of our recent success for granted. We have the right team in place and are working hard to maintain our edge. Going into 2024, there are three main opportunities on my mind. The first is continuing to foster our entrepreneurial culture and empower our great people to pursue big opportunities. The second is developing our next crop of leaders and giving them opportunities that allow them to stretch, grow, and contribute at higher levels. The third is leveraging our free cash flow which we expect to generate in order to maximize value for our shareholders. We are excited to have an agreement to bring Jackpocket into the DraftKings family and enter the rapidly growing US digital lottery vertical. Importantly, this is not just a new product for our customers to enjoy, but really a way to strengthen our core OSB and iGaming position in the US by optimizing our overall LTV and CAC. We look forward to working together to provide tremendous and differentiated value to the combined customer base. In closing, 2023 is a fantastic year for DraftKings, yet I believe that 2024 will be even better. I am unbelievably excited about the plans we have in place to continue serving our customers and growing our business. Most importantly, I am excited about the quality of the team we have in place, and I have no doubt that we will continue to execute very effectively against our key priorities this year. We will work tirelessly to produce great results and build on the incredible momentum we generated in 2023. With that, I will turn it over to Jason Park.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason. I'll hit the highlights, including our full year 2023 and fourth quarter performance and our updated guidance for 2024. Please note, that all income statement measures discussed except for revenue are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, the organization is executing very well, and that is showing up in our results. In fiscal year 2023, revenue grew 64% versus 2022, and adjusted EBITDA improved year-over-year by nearly $600 million versus 2022, which resulted in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA flow through percentage of 40%. Adjusted gross margin increased nearly 200 basis points as we delivered higher sportsbook hold percentage and improved our promotional reinvestment for OSB and iGaming. Adjusted sales and marketing expense grew 3% as we reduced marketing in our more mature states and transitioned further into more efficient national marketing. In the fourth quarter, we continued to generate great performance across our core value drivers and produced more than $1.2 billion of revenue and $151 million of positive adjusted EBITDA. Better customer acquisition, retention, and engagement resulted in higher than expected handle for the quarter and positively impacted revenue and adjusted EBITDA by $93 million and $42 million, respectively. Structural sportsbook hold percentage was 10.4% and well ahead of expectations as we continued to improve our parlay mix and optimize our trading capabilities. This trend positively impacted revenue and adjusted EBITDA by $53 million and $38 million, respectively. As you are well aware of by now, sport outcomes were very customer friendly in the fourth quarter, primarily in the final two weeks of November, while December was consistent with expectations. Our actual sportsbook hold percentage for the fourth quarter was 9.2% due to sport outcomes, which were a headwind to revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $175 million and $126 million, respectively, compared to our expectations. Moving on to our full year 2024 guidance, we are poised for a rapid increase in adjusted EBITDA due to continued strong revenue growth coupled with a scaled fixed cost structure. In November of 2023, we guided fiscal year 2024 revenue of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $350 million to $450 million. Today, we are improving our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance range to $4.65 billion to $4.9 billion and our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $410 million to $510 million. Customer acquisition, retention, and engagement in Q4 and Q1 to date has continued to exceed expectations due to ongoing product innovation and marketing optimization initiatives. These trends account for $90 million of the revenue improvement and $35 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. Higher structural sportsbook hold percentage as a result of continued year-over-year bet mix improvement, as well as improvements in trading and risk management accounts for $35 million of the revenue improvement and $25 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. From an intra-year perspective in 2024, we expect first quarter revenue to increase approximately 45% year-over-year and second through fourth quarter revenue to each grow year-over-year in the 20% to 30% range. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately breakeven in the first quarter, nearly $150 million in the second quarter, and above $300 million in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we are also now guiding free cash flow. We expect to generate between $310 million and $410 million in free cash flow in 2024 based on approximately $120 million of annual CapEx and capitalized software development costs, as well as a modest source of cash from changes in networking capital and interest income. Therefore, we will end the year with approximately $1.6 billion of cash before using approximately $413 million to fund our proposed acquisition of Jackpocket. Looking further ahead, as discussed at our Investor Day and the letter we released last night, we expect to generate positive and increasing free cash flow starting this year and are beginning to explore ways to optimize our capital structure. Our expectation for sustainable revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion over the next several years offers us a number of options to maximize long-term returns for our shareholders. That concludes our remarks and we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.\nJason Robins: Good morning.\nDavid Katz: What I wanted to do -- Good morning. And congrats on the quarter. So I wanted to delve a little further into sort of what the next phase really looks like. And if you could talk about the kinds of product advancement, the kinds of features and functionality where your focus is in play, part of what's next for domestic sports betting, where is it all going to come from, I suppose?\nJason Robins: It's a very good question, very big picture. I think it sounds like product is sort of part of your question. I definitely think in play is a huge opportunity, as you noted. Still very early stages of that developing, and I think there's a lot, both on the product side and also on the broadcast side that can be done to make that experience better and more accessible to -- or at least more interesting to a larger audience. I still think there's a lot of room to move on just organic growth of parlays and other sorts of things. I mean, remember we just launched progressive parlay recently, so that product is still very early in its development and should continue to drive strong parlay mix increase. And then there's a number of other initiatives that we have that we'll be rolling out throughout the year that I'm not going to steal my product team's thunder on, but we have lots of good stuff planned. I think really key thing to remember is, it's still super early days. A lot of the things that we think will happen over the coming years will greatly change the way that the product and the customer experience works. It's going to evolve quite a bit. I think it's a pretty exciting time and still very early stages, so lots of room to grow.\nDavid Katz: Thank you. And if I may just follow up quickly, with respect to Jackpocket, seems like a nice business that generates a little bit of return, but more as a customer acquisition vehicle. As we think about these cash allocation decisions going forward are there more things like this that are contemplated or is it more a function of capital structure and returns? And that's it for me. Thank you.\nJason Robins: Yes, I think it's more the latter. There's all sorts of different options that we're looking at for how to maximize shareholder return with the capital we'll be accumulating on our balance sheet. I think what you will see though is, we're going to stay very squarely on strategy. We talked about how priority A is winning in the US and I think Jackpocket is absolutely in line with that. Lottery is the oldest form of gaming in the US. It's been around forever. The audience is massive. And as you noted, it's a very efficient way to acquire customers in mass at extraordinarily lower CACs than what we see in the other forms of online gaming. And we know from overlap analysis that we did that those customers will cross sell very effectively too. And from the overlap analysis we did, we saw that the customers that overlapped were about 50% higher spend on DraftKings OSB and iGaming products than customers who didn't. So lots of reason to believe that not only is there cheap acquisition, but there's also high LTV customers that we can cross over. And I think that's a really core thing that DFS provided for us as an advantage too. So if you look at kind of the playbook that's worked for us, entering new states, having a built-up database, having an active base of customers that we can cross-sell. I think this is doubling down on that.\nDavid Katz: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. Jason or Jason, I was hoping you'd comment a little bit on just how the fourth quarter played out from a promotional activity perspective. So overall, we didn't see quite the sequential improvement in promotions that we saw a year ago between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So what are we seeing as the business level is off there? And just if you could characterize a little bit, given plenty of nail biting out there strategically about new customers, launches, sport mix changes obviously between NFL and NBA. Just help us kind of characterize the landscape as you saw it and we move through 4Q and into January.\nJason Robins: Yes. So, I mean, there's a couple things to play here. First, for a fixed amount of promotions, obviously lower hold due to sport outcomes. And I mean, we had the worst two-week stretch of sport outcomes from a dollar cost basis that we've ever had as a public company. So that's going to just naturally make up. But if you look at sort of the adjusted for outcomes numbers, it was down to 300 basis points year-over-year. I think also, we had a blowout quarter from a customer acquisition perspective. So you're going to have a little bit higher promotion rate when that happens. And if you isolate to the retention side, to existing customer promotions, those were down even more significantly year-over-year. So we're actually seeing really good trends on that front, playing out pretty much exactly as we expected. And I think where you're seeing some noise is just from some of the outcomes and also a blowout quarter from customer acquisition. But even despite all that, when you adjust just for the outcomes and leave the acquisition numbers in there, it was still 200 bps to 300 bps lower year-over-year.\nShaun Kelley: Very helpful. And just for my follow-up, if we could talk about Jackpocket, the business today, our belief of this is probably is losing a little bit. Just trying to kind of get a sense of contribution as we move out and you actually consolidate this business probably more in 2025. What's your sort of risk tolerance around what you'd be willing to invest or commit to this business, again, from a capital or loss perspective for those couple of years, while you want to ramp it? Because it seems like at least in the forecast that you've given, there's a heck of a lot of organic growth that you can also attribute to this business. So help us balance those two and maybe losses or potential investment in 2025.\nJason Robins: Yes. First of all, regardless of when this closes, if it closes in 2024, it will not have a material impact. It will not cause us to change our guide, so let me be clear on that. We're talking low single digit losses this year, and I think next year will be a positive year. I think the real question is how much, depending on timing of close, synergy can we realize next year and how much upside is there. But I don't expect this to be any sort of drag. If anything, it'll be, I think some pleasant upside, but we're just hesitant to kind of commit to timing of synergies given that we don't have a definitive date of close yet. So really, I think that's the question for 2025 is, is it going to be slightly positive or are we going to be able to capture real meaningful synergies and start to accelerate some of the expected synergies that we have pegged for 2026 currently? And that's currently not something that we really can peg given we're not certain of the closing timing. But just to be completely clear, this will not change our guide regardless of when we close in 2024, and this should be, if anything, a positive, certainly not a drag on EBITDA in 2025.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Our next question comes from Joe Greff with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Greff: This is Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Good morning, guys. Depending on how you want to answer this, what was the parlay mix in the fourth quarter, if you want to look at it by handle or GGR or a number of bets? What's the assumption for parlay mix growth for 2024? And then maybe another way to answer the question too, if we look at Illinois, the only state that really details parlay activity, no matter how you cut it, you had a huge spike in what was reported for parlay bet mix or parlay handle mix in December versus November. Specifically, what's going on there and is that representative of other states with respect to parlay activity?\nJason Robins: Yes, so for the fourth quarter, we were around 30%. We think there may have been an error in the Illinois report for December that overstated it, so that's something we're still digging into. But it was around 30% for the fourth quarter, and we expect continued increase this year. We haven't put any exact numbers out for what we are forecasting parlay mix to be. I think some of this -- somebody mentioned in-game betting earlier. There's so many moving parts and people have to remember, as different levers for monetization are increasingly being adopted by consumers, you're going to see lots of things moving. In-game betting, of course, is going to have less parlay mix just because of the rapid nature of it and therefore may have lower hold, but it's still a very good thing for monetization. So this is something we have to always keep in mind. Obviously, hold and parlay mix are big levers, but it's not the only lever. Those are not the only levers that we have to increase monetization. But to answer your question, for Q4 is 30%, and we're going to dig in and figure out what's going on with the Illinois data, but that looks a little off to me.\nJoe Greff: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. I wanted to go back to the Jackpocket acquisition for a moment. Just to kind of understand the opportunity, it sounds like there is already pretty significant overlap between the two customer bases. So is the idea that it's the opportunity to penetrate even more than that significant amount or is it more in new states where Jackpockets operating and you're not there yet, although that would seem like a relatively small number of states? So just wondering if you could help us think about, since there's already so much overlap, where the incremental comes from. Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question. I mean, first, the fact that there's overlap shows us that the customers are very similar type of customer. And we looked at a number of different data points to verify that from demographic data to other behavioral and psychographical stuff. I think the idea is that overlap was with zero CRM or actual effort put towards cross sell. And it's nowhere near the cross sell that we've been able to achieve from OSB to iGaming. So we think there's a ton of upside there with real meaningful effort put towards that. And that's something we do best. We feel like we have the best in the industry cross-sell rates. And I think whether it's BFS to OSB and iGaming or OSB to iGaming or any of the above, we've been able to achieve much higher cross-sell rates through our efforts. So I have to imagine there's a ton of upside there. And the other thing is, if we're seeing natural overlap with our audience, probably many of those are still using competitor products and not us. So I think there's also an opportunity to market more effectively to customers in our database that may still be playing OSB and iGaming, but with competitors, maybe in the Jackpocket database, I should say. So I think that's number one. And then number two is, you're right, absolutely, every new state that opens, this is just like DFS has been for us. We have this built-in customer base. We know that there's tons of people around the nation that play lotteries. One of the great things about this, too, is unlike OSB and iGaming, you don't need legislative action in most states in order to get lottery, courier lottery, digital courier lottery launch. You need to get usually some kind of approval through the lottery director and the executive branch, but you don't need legislative action, which makes it a much lower hurdle to get up and running in new states. And this is something, of course, that every state lottery we think would want. It'll grow the lottery market, bring new customers in. So I think it's a great opportunity to get a product potentially in the vast majority of US states. And you're absolutely right. I think as time goes on, if you like us believe that more and more states will continue to launch OSB and iGaming then it'll be the gift that keeps on giving.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Thanks very much and just a follow-up in terms of your acquisition philosophy overall. Are you more likely to do things related to technology for your product, or are you looking more for things like this that have to do with customer acquisition? Thanks.\nJason Robins: I think we feel pretty good about our technology stack. I think that there may be small bolt-ons here and there that we think are helpful to enhance. But I really think it's more about these kind of strategic moves that are going to help us win in US online gaming. And you know I think we're going to be super disciplined on M&A. I don't think you'll see us go in this rash of buying companies left and right. This is one we did a ton of diligence on. We underwrote it very carefully with very conservative, I think, assumptions. And we feel like it has high potential to be a real home run. So I think you're going to see us pursuing things like that that really make a lot of sense when you think about it. And I think you're going to see us continue to be super disciplined and you're going to see us look at all sorts of different ways to take the capital that we're accumulating, create shareholder value. This is -- M&A is not the only way to do it, there are many others. So, I think that's the best way I'd describe it. And I think it fits with how we're disciplined in general as a company. If you look at the deals we do on the business development and partnership side, it's the same thing. We use a lot of discretion. We're very careful and we underwrite with a very strong analytic process and that's exactly how we approach this M&A deal.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks very much. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDaniel Politzer: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. First one, just wanted to touch on structural hold. I think you guided the 10% to 10.5% for 2024, And I think that's about 50 basis points up year-over-year versus over 200 basis points in 2023. Now, I get you're coming off a higher base, but I guess to what extent does this reflect some degree of conservatism? And are you seeing more casual bettors come into your system just as another competitor has launched and recently you talked about growing the market there?\nJason Robins: I think, first, I'm glad that you feel that there's some upside there. I do too. I noted this earlier, I think one of the reasons that we're a little cautious with holes is that, there are other things you can do to improve modernization, like pushing live betting more that might actually not increase hole but still be very good from an LTV standpoint. So we want to make sure that we leave some flexibility for all sorts of different levers. And at the same time, I do think you're right, there's probably some upside there. Really for us, we've always had a nice mix of customers across the spectrum. And I do think in the last few months, there's been more casual customers coming in, but there's been more customers of all sorts of spend and sort of across the spectrum of spend. So really not seeing anything tremendously different other than just really strong customer acquisition across the board, but I can't look at it and say it's skewing more cash flow or anything like that. It just seems like overall customer acquisition is just really strong right now.\nJason Park: I would just add Dan, our philosophy on guiding to hold rate has been that we should commit to something that we have empirically realized. So as you saw, structural hold in Q4 was better than we thought, and that gave us conviction to increase the embedded hold rate in our 2024 guide. But to Jason's point, we've got a lot of work going on to improve that, but our philosophy has been only to commit to what we've empirically actualized.\nDaniel Politzer: Got it. That's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, you alluded to some comments in the prepared remarks on optimizing capital structure. I mean, how should we interpret that? Are you kind of referring to maybe incurring some debt and maybe long-term as you think about the company and maturing and becoming cash flow positive, how do you think about a healthy leverage ratio and what that might look like?\nJason Robins: Yes, I mean, that is something that we're actively looking at right now. So we're still doing our work, but we'll have more to say on that in the coming months.\nDaniel Politzer: Thanks so much.\nJason Park: Yes, I would just add. I mean, if you look at our cash balance that we forecasted, $1.6 billion at the end of this year, including the $400 million, roughly, for the acquisition of Jackpocket, and then our multi-year plan that we outlined in November, we're obviously going to be accumulating cash very quickly. So it's a great position to be in and we're exploring all those options in.\nDaniel Politzer: Appreciate all the detail. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nRobert Fishman: Good morning. I'm curious, can you talk about the recent hiring of Marie Donoghue as Chief Business and Growth Officer? I'm wondering, how does her prior experience at Amazon Sports potentially impact DraftKings appetite to explore sports rights down the road?\nJason Robins: Yes, we're really excited that Marie on board, I mean she not only was at Amazon, she's at ESPN for many years and has an incredible reputation and really strong relationships throughout our ecosystem and industry. So very excited to bring her on. I wouldn't say this is any way a signal that we're looking at live sports rights. That's not something that right now is on our mind. But I think she brings a number of different experiences and skill sets that will help us understand all parts of the ecosystem. And we do a lot of business with folks who own live sports rights. So having that understanding from the other side of the table, I think, will be very helpful in future opportunities that we explore and future negotiations. So very excited to bring her on, and I think she's going to bring a lot of real depth of experience as well as a unique perspective to the team.\nRobert Fishman: Cool, and maybe just switching gears, can you discuss any more detail around the growth that you mentioned in increased bet frequency versus the bet size averages in 2023? And how you're prioritizing one over the other to drive the 2024 results? Thank you.\nJason Robins: We really look at both. I mean, for us, it's about how do we first engage the customer? If we have the customer engaged, that's table stakes. You can't do anything if you don't have that. So we start there, and then we really try to meet them where they're at. If they're looking for new types of bets, and that makes it more interesting than great. If they're looking to try new sports, then we try to provide that to them. And really, I think for us, it's about taking that customer and personalizing the experience, so they're sticky and they feel like it's easy and comfortable to use the app. So if you're always betting on basketball, we're going to show you basketball, but we might also show you other interesting basketball bets that we think you might find intriguing. So it's really something that I think starts with the customer. And there's all sorts of different levers that you can pull. And the important thing is not to force anything, to try to just get the right products in front of the right customers. And I think we've done a good job doing that.\nRobert Fishman: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Stauff with SIG. Your line is open.\nJoe Stauff: Thanks. Good morning. Jason, I was wondering if you could size or discuss the North Carolina opportunity. Do you see that similar to maybe in Ohio or Massachusetts, or do you see it maybe at one of the maybe smaller new state launches? And then the second question I had was, I'm wondering if you could discuss just the differences in parlay penetration, right, between the new and, say. older states? And especially with that parlay penetration being lower in the older states, how easy is that to ratchet that higher and is it reasonable that it can get to those same levels that you see in the newer states? Hopefully that makes sense.\nJason Robins: Yes, so on the first question, I mean, I think you're right, North Carolina will be similar. It's a little smaller population-wise in Ohio, but it's a top 10 state, and we expect it to be a great launch and contribute in a meaningful way. And it'll be pretty standard. I mean, at this point, our playbook's honed, so we're not going to approach North Carolina any differently, other than a few optimizations that we always make around the edges. But I think you're going to see North Carolina be a very similar state launch to the ones that you mentioned that we did last year. And as far as parlay mix, yes, you're absolutely right, newer states. I think it's always easier when you have a product that you're introducing customers to for the first time to get them to try new things and harder to get them if they've been using the product in a certain way for years to change behavior. So it's more of a grind, but the trends are absolutely continuing every single year in the oldest states that we have. From a parlay mix perspective, the trends are continuing to move in the right direction. So I think that's another one that'll just be a continuous tailwind for us over time and eventually it'll converge what we're seeing in the new states. It'll just take a little longer.\nJoe Stauff: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling: Hey there, can you hear me?\nJason Robins: We can hear you.\nStephen Grambling: Excellent. Thank you. Apologies for that. So on [Jackpot] (ph), I guess 1 question. Is that going to stay a single app or be folded into the DraftKings app or both? And does the ramp to $60 million to $100 million in 2026 assume any new states get approved?\nJason Robins: So for us, a lot of the questions around branding and product were still in the early stages. But the current plan is to keep it as its own brand and app. I think they've built a strong audience and a good brand, and I think that we want to keep it, but obviously we're going to explore opportunities to integrate ecosystems, have all products available across all brands, just like we do with GNOG. And I think Jackpocket has a casino that they -- so there's a lot to do there, I think, with their brand, and we'll see how that all evolves over time, but that's the current plan. And then I'm sorry, what was the second question?\nStephen Grambling: Does the target -- as you look out to 2026 on [Multiple Speakers] including states.\nJason Robins: Yes. So no new OSB and iGaming states are included in our synergy or any other assumptions. So we're just assuming current footprint. So a lot of upside if there's more OSB and iGaming states and cross-selling more customers, we do assume that some more lottery states launch. As I noted earlier, it's a lot more seamless to launch a lottery state. You don't need to go through the legislative process. It's really more of going and working out a deal directly with the state. So I think that, that's something that we feel a lot of confidence in and if you look at their ramp over the last few years, they've launched a number of different states. And I think the hardest part really is -- because there's no legislative process. The hardest part is, one they've already solved, which is, building a technology solution that will scale and we'll be able to service multiple states and lots of customers at the same time. And of course, remember, there's already states that they're in, that are big states. I mean, Texas is a huge revenue state for them. And as we know, Texas came very close last year to passing OSB, and we're very hopeful they will this year. New York is a huge state for them. I think New York could do iGaming in the next year or so. So that's another big opportunity. So really, I think the best is yet to come. And as I said earlier, this is an asset that we believe will just continue to increase in value, because if you're a believer, which I hope we all are, that there will be more and more OSB and iGaming states, none of that is baked into any of our synergy assumptions, that's just all upside.\nStephen Grambling: That's super helpful. And maybe looping in Jason Park here on free cash flow. As we look further out, how do you generally anticipate free cash flow conversion evolving?\nJason Park: Yes. So we outlined that for 2024, the free cash flow -- the delta between adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, net impact of CapEx, cap software plus some cumulative good guides across working capital and interest income. It's about $100 million. So that's a free cash flow yield on the adjusted EBITDA. I think about the components between adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as being more steady over time. So as adjusted EBITDA grows, the free cash flow conversion percentage is going to go up, Stephen.\nStephen Grambling: Perfect. Thanks so much. We are going to be back in.\nJason Robins: You got it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nBernard McTernan: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just to start, Jason, in the letter, you said 87% customer retention over a five year period on average. I think that was better than what was quoted in the Investor Day a couple of years ago. Is that true that retention is improving that much? Or the numbers not apples-to-apples?\nJason Robins: Yes, I think that is true. I mean I'm not sure if it's exactly apples to apples, I have to go back and check. But absolutely, retention is improving.\nBernard McTernan: Okay. Any drivers to call specifically.\nJason Robins: Yes. I mean I think it's largely product. That's the biggest one. I also think that you're just seeing more and more natural organic growth as customers adopt more sports and things like that, which just keeps them more sticky and active on the product. But it's really just the product advancement more than anything else. We also are constantly optimizing our CRM. So that's a big lever too. I should mention we're testing all the time and finding wins. So I think between the product improving greatly over the last couple of years and our marketing and team continuing to test and learn the biggest drivers. But there's a lot of things, right? I think our customer service has improved. We're -- I think there's so many different dimensions across the products and across the entire customer experience that have helped us improve our retention.\nBernard McTernan: Great. And I know it's early days, but just wanted to get your thoughts on [Barstool] (ph) and what that could be as a customer acquisition and retention vehicle for you guys.\nJason Robins: We're very excited about that when we worked with Barstool many times over the years and really thrilled to be working with them again. It's a partner that we know very well and I have a ton of data on. So we felt really -- I mean, this is about as good as it gets in terms of us having historical data and being able to underwrite this deal. So it's really exciting, and we believe it will be a strong performer for us.\nBernard McTernan: Great. Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With respect to the gross margin guidance improvement for 2024, should we think about the 250 basis point to 450 basis point improvement, more of just kind of a factor of the scale and the growth that you're going to have? Or are some of the, I guess, variable fees coming down and we should expect for that to continue just given some of your partnerships and what you're able to do with payment processing and the like. Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yes. I mean I think it's a number of different things that come with scale. Certainly, their discounts that come with volume and scale and things like payment processing. Also, promotional mix continues to trend down as we increase the ratio of existing to new customers. And -- those things, I think, are the largest drivers.\nJason Park: Yes, I agree. I think it's all of the above, Chad, where the improving promotional reinvestment rate due to our mix of existing versus new customers, our improving hold rate and then just ongoing optimization of our COGS vendors are all driving that improvement in gross margin rate.\nChad Beynon: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then we'll probably see the public release, at least from New York, I believe, later today. With respect to the Super Bowl outcome and kind of the hold rates there, but could you maybe give us a little preview in terms of how that fit into the Q1 guidance? How you guys did in the Super Bowl from a hold standpoint?\nJason Robins: Yes. So I think this speaks to the power of our work that we've done over the last few years to build out the same game parlay product and improve player props and really diversify the bets that despite the fact that the game outcome did not go our way at all with the cheese winning, we ended up actually holding right in line with what we thought we would from a hold rate perspective. So that was really, I think, a testament to the great work the team has done over the last few years to drive more diversified bets and more parlays.\nChad Beynon: Impressive. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nBarry Jonas: Thanks. Can you talk about whole trends in iGaming? Do you think there's maybe a path to hire structural hold over time there?\nJason Robins: Yes. I think iGaming is a little bit different because it's so high frequency. It's really -- whole rate matters, of course, if you look at the math. But if you think about kind of a customer and how they behave. Most people sit and they play for some period of time, and they have a budget and I think that hold rate generally doesn't move more than 100 bps or 200 bps up or down in any given day, it's much more stable than sports hold rate because it's not outcome dependent at all. So it's always something to look at, but I think it's just a fundamentally different product. And it's same thing with like live betting and game. If somebody is betting on every play of a game, taking a super high margin doesn't necessarily make that person stick for as long as he can. So it's very different than, I think, somebody who's making one or two bets pregame or maybe they're making a lot of bets pregame, but they're getting sort of on a much longer cycle and the money isn't churning as quickly.\nBarry Jonas: That makes sense. Then just a follow-up on Jackpocket. I guess, I'm trying to understand the risks to Jackpocket and the broader courier model. How do you see the potential for more states to legalize iLottery over time, which would effectively remove the need for service fees.\nJason Robins: Well, I think that the real question is, what can Jackpocket contribute to the overall lottery ecosystem. And regardless of how it evolves, I think their products, their customers are going to have a role to play. And this is something that any lottery would want, right? I mean it would certainly make any -- I would think -- I shouldn't say any. I'm sure there's some around the country that, for whatever reason don't, but it increases the lottery market and increases sales. So it should be a no-brainer, I would think, for the vast majority of state lotteries. And I think Jackpocket is very well positioned for however it evolves in iLottery and other things. I mean they have an incredible customer base, a brand. This is, I think, something that actually could be a real tailwind for them depending on how it evolves. But whether it continues to be the current model or whether it changes, I think that Jackpocket is extremely well positioned and is a very unique asset.\nChad Beynon: Thanks so much.\nJason Robins: Yes. One other thing worth noting too is, iLottery requires legislative action unlike what Jackpocket does. So I think while it could happen, it's going to be a much slower burn. And I think the ability to get the digital lottery products that Jackpocket offers up and running in a number of states quickly is just much more seamless.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Bender with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.\nJordan Bender: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So the Barstool partnership kind of highlights it seen a past years of using your marketing budget and your ad spend. Can you maybe help us think about some of the higher cost legacy partnerships that are going to roll off this year versus some of the opportunity for incremental marketing agreements like a Barstool maybe into 2024 and into 2025. And the positive ROI you might see off of those? Thank you.\nJason Robins: Sure. I mean, as you know, our relationship with ESPN ended late last year, so that is certainly one. But I wouldn't say there's like any one thing. We're constantly optimizing it out. And actually, most of our spend is not committed. Most of our spend is done through buying that we can pull in and out of at any various points of time. So there's a ton of different levers that we can pull as we think about funding different agreements. And right now, I think given sort of the pace and cadence of what we expect state launches to be in 2024 barring some big surprise. I don't think you're going to see an increase in marketing this year. It's going to be much more of a focus on deploying our dollars much more effectively. And I think Barstool is a great example of that.\nJordan Bender: Great. And then on the follow-up on Jackpocket, with CAC going down and LTVs going up, does the acquisition help your margin targets long term just for the core business, I think it's around 30% still. Like should we expect any incremental lift through this acquisition?\nJason Robins: It's a great question. At this point, we haven't dug in as much on that, but I think it's certainly something that you could see. I think that what we get with Jackpocket is the ability to acquire a lot of customers at a fraction. It's about 10% to 15% of our current customer acquisition costs. And that's something that, obviously, will provide a lot of levers for being able to optimize margin over the long run, assuming that we can continue to do that, which I have no reason to believe we can. And I think on the other side of it, being able to cross-sell, it will provide some revenue lift. We don't view this necessarily. It's more like DFS, right? DFS is a nice little product, makes money for us. But it's not something that is going to drive the massive top line growth. That's really the OSB and iGaming, and it's more of a vehicle to be able to continue to acquire customers and engage customers in states that don't have that yet. And I think Jackpocket, much like DFS, will do the same thing. And also, I think in states that do have OSB and iGaming, it will provide us another vehicle to acquire cheaply. And one of the cool things, I think, is if you look at sort of where a lot of customer acquisition happens now, it's during these big moments, whether that's the Super Bowl or March Madness coming up or any of those things. It's those big tentpole moments. And what Jackpocket does is, it creates more of those big mass, cheap customer acquisition opportunities during the year. And it could be any time, right? It could be the middle of August when there's suddenly a $1 billion jackpot and we're the only ones who are able to actually acquire in mass right before the NFL season starts. So it's those types of advantages, I think, that you're going to see really pay off over time.\nJordan Bender: Great. Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.\nJed Kelly: Hey, great, great. Thanks for taking my question. Has your structural holds improve, theoretically, you're going to be able to promote at a higher incremental gross dollar. So can you talk about what that does for retention? And then my follow-up is, we're seeing these new streaming services start to pop up. Can you talk about where the category leading gaming companies are going to be in terms of in this new streaming wave and sort of helping around the distribution. Thanks.\nJason Robins: Great question. So I think on the first one, it gives you the ability to do that. It doesn't mean we will. I think for us right now, we feel there's a lot of room to just continue to drive engagement through product and customer service and other things. But certainly having a little bit more cushion to be able to find other new sorts of promotions that works is another advantage. And doesn't necessarily mean that, that's going to be something we're looking to do. But I do think it provides an ability to do so, which is certainly an advantage over time. And then on the streaming side, I think it's early to say. There's a lot of moving parts right now. And at the same time, we know, obviously, that there's a lot of disruption going on in sports media. Obviously, we've seen a ton of disruption and have seen kind of how the evolution of non-sports media and sports is still very much right in the thick of the evolution that's occurring and it will be interesting to see how it plays out and no doubt there'll be opportunities created, and we're always looking for new partners and interesting ways that we can take advantage of any disruption happening in an adjacent market to us.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandt Montour: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So the first one, another one on Jackpocket. I'm just thinking about the non-overlap portion of the database. I mean I think we think about lottery and think of sort of a very wide diversified range of demographic and income levels. And I'm just curious if you've done any work on the nonoverlapping piece, give us a sense on who those folks are. Is it older people? Is it men or women. And is that a richer cross-sell opportunity for iGaming or OSB in your mind? And how do you compare that?\nJason Robins: Yes, great questions. I mean, so we did a ton of work on the overall customer base and also on the general lottery market. And what we find is that, the people that are buying lottery tickets on Jackpocket, they're using mobile devices to do so. They're younger. They're a more tech-savvy customer, it's a different demographic, I think, than the average lottery customer, and that's part of why it's growing the market, which is great. So similar to kind of the online better versus the retail better, it's just -- it's a different person that's willing and also that has an iPhone and that sort of thing. And I think really, that's kind of what the appeal is, is that, this is a disruptive new thing in a market that really -- the customer wants this, right? I mean people don't buy lottery tickets today, sometimes, I think, due to convenience. And just like being able to make a bet on your phone, shooting, I mean if you look at anywhere right now that's legalized betting, online betting makes up a much larger portion of the handles than retail betting. It just makes sense when you give people a digital and mobile option that you're going to grow the market and also reach a new demographic of person. So that's really what we found when we dug in there. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question?\nBrandt Montour: iGaming or OSB\nJason Robins: iGaming or OSB. So actually another interesting thing we saw, I had gone in thinking this was going to be much more propensity to cross-sell to iGaming this type of customer. But when we did the overlap analysis, it was actually quite similar -- the overlap between OSB customers and iGaming customers. So that gave us great confidence that -- which makes sense in some ways, right, because the overlap between iGaming and OSB and the cross-sell rates are so high. So it kind of makes sense when you think about it, but I would have gone in and probably think it would skew a little more iGaming and it was actually very similar.\nBrandt Montour: That's really interesting. Thanks for that. And then maybe more on the sort of maybe competitive landscape. This is a disruptive technology service that is growing based on penetration. And I think this is the number one player in the space, but you guys mentioned that regulatory -- the regulatory structure wasn't exactly high problem. And so, maybe we wonder about barrier to entry and if that's sort of low. And so -- are there sort of second, third, fourth sort of apps out there nipping at the heels of this one? And what's the competitive landscape look like?\nJason Robins: Well, no doubt, I think there will be more. And I think what, you really have to think about is -- you're right, from a regulatory perspective, there are other -- it's not as hard. But I think that what really is hard is the technology side. It's a very complicated fulfillment process, and every state is a little bit different. So you have to build a solution that can be flexible and it's actually quite similar to what we've built in terms of our multistate regulatory structure in OSB and iGaming. But I think the added piece for them is the fulfillment, and that's very complicated to do that at scale in a cost-effective manner and have a technology system, they have patents as well on various pieces that they've created -- to have a technology system that can support rapid launch of states is not something that you can build right overnight. So no doubt there will be more competition over time, but I think these guys have a big head start. And while the barriers to entry may not be super high, I think that head start is real.\nBrandt Montour: Helpful. Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Thanks you. Our next question comes from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\nRyan Sigdahl: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just staying on Jackpocket. Curious get all the cross synergies you mentioned. But are there any features that Jackpocket has that could potentially be useful, whether it be OSB or iGaming. Thinking pool play, where they split winnings? There's an auto play feature, so on?\nJason Robins: Yes. I haven't really thought as much about that. They do have a lot of interesting things they've worked. I know they have a bingo product that were -- that they recently launched. So there could be some leverageable things there for sure. Definitely, I've thought about it more is they're building out a great lottery experience and by plugging in the iGaming experience that we've been able to build out in the OSB experience that we've been able to build out, to the lottery experience they've been able to build out. I think that's where the real power is. But there also might be -- you're right, some good nuggets there in terms of features and other things that are repurposeful across other products. So that's something that we'll have to look into a little bit more.\nRyan Sigdahl: Great. And then just as a follow-up on DFS, any early metrics and thoughts on the [Pix6] (ph) product? And then how should we think about the take rate, gross margins, et cetera, relative to your traditional DFS business?\nJason Robins: Well, that's a product we're very excited about. We haven't talked as much about it because it just launched, but it's something that we think could really reinvigorate DFS growth in a real meaningful way. Right now, we're seeing really good early signal, very strong retention numbers, good monetization. The fees that we take, they are guaranteed price pools are actually higher than the average DFS fee. So that's good, too. So a lot of things to like about that product, and I think it's something that we could really see be a meaningful contributor in the future.\nRyan Sigdahl: Thanks, Jason. Good luck, guys.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE. Your line is open.\nJohn DeCree: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Your covered a lot of ground, but maybe a high-level question on iGaming. So a lot of success for you over the past year. Can you talk a little bit about if we talk sports and Jackpocket. But about some of the stuff you have planned for iGaming, I think your proprietary content has been a big driver of some of your success. But as we think about 2024 and where you're going in iGaming, high level, what should we think about?\nJason Robins: Yes. I mean, first, we are just in the process of completing the migration on GNOG. So that's going to be a real exciting one and really just at the very early stages of deploying our multi-brand strategy and I think that's going to be a real tailwind for us. We also have a number of product features and new games that we're working on as well as things that we're working to increase and build out like our jackpots offering, which I think, is a real differentiator for us. So there's a lot going on in that space. We're working on a lot of new gamification stuff. There's a lot. And I think really front and center is that GNOG migration and having those products become on the same platform, I think, will allow us to really get even more leverage out of each additional feature and game that we launch.\nJohn DeCree: Got it. Thanks. You touched on a little earlier, iGaming, your view on New York perhaps getting close and we probably feel the same way. There's quite a few bills circulating out for gaming this session. But curious if you have a view or if your team has a view on, at least directionally, over the last couple of months or quarters, if you've seen greater progress at the state legislative level or if there's maybe anything out there that people aren't thinking about it's not major headlines like New York that might be interesting over the next kind of one or two years on the iGaming regulatory front?\nJason Robins: Yes. There's a few states that I think are getting momentum on iGaming now, and it will be hard to say, but I think we're going to get at least one or two this year, if I had to guess. Some of the states, I'm hearing some momentum in include Maryland, Wyoming is one. So I think there's a few states that could consider it. I think a dark course is Illinois. Really, what I think you saw and there's kind of two things that I think are playing out here. One is, a number of different states wanted to do OSB first and see how that went, and that's still ramping for them. And so the draw for that reason of new tax revenues from online gaming isn't as strong if you just launched online sports betting and you're waiting to see how it's ramping and you're still getting more and more accustomed to and comfortable with it. The second thing is that, we talked a few years ago about post-COVID and how that was going to be a real catalyst given states would need tax revenue. What we ended up seeing was that, so much federal money was pumped into the state's coffers that that really dragged -- over the next few years, it kind of extended that time line a bit. But now that's, I think, coming to an end in many states, they're starting to see budgets that really look a lot like the budgets four or five years ago in many states and the surpluses in some of these states are no longer there. And so I think that's going to also just sort of change the dynamic in the coming years between people getting comfortable that regulatory and responsible gaming pieces that we can put in place are robust and really do a great job protecting, people understanding there actually isn't a legal online casino market, iGaming market and that much like with sports betting, disrupting that illegal market that had no consumer protections, paying no tax revenue, actually a real priority that states should have. And then, of course, the amount of programs, whether it be educational or otherwise, that the revenues can find, I think, are also going to be real catalyst behind. And it's kind of as we expected, maybe not exactly as we expected, but we thought there'd be a lot of momentum initially on OSB. I was actually pleasantly surprised as many states as they did ended up doing iGaming at the same time. And I think as OSB legislation continues to move through the states, I think you're going to see a wave of iGaming legislation start to materialize over the course of the next year or two.\nJohn DeCree: Thanks, Jason. We agree. That's all helpful commentary. And congratulations to you and the team on a great 2023.\nJason Robins: Thank you so much. Really appreciate it.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jason Robins for any closing remarks.\nJason Robins: Well, first, thank you all for joining us on today's call. Really, 2023 was an excellent year for DraftKings, and we're so excited about the opportunities in 2024 and beyond. I think 2024 is going to be even a bigger year for us. I hope everyone stays safe and well and look forward to chatting with you in the future. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you all for joining. Last year at this time, we shared our first end of year letter. In that letter, I described DraftKings as a company that would thrive when business conditions became more challenging. I wrote that our culture and people positioned us well to execute, which effectively made 2023 a proven year for DraftKings. As you've seen, our team rose to the occasion. Revenue increased 64% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023, even with very customer-friendly outcomes in late November. More importantly, we improved adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2023 by nearly $600 million year-over-year and posted our first two adjusted EBITDA positive quarters in company history. Beyond our financial highlights, we improved our product and customer experience and also made a number of operational improvements to better serve our customers and operate more efficiently. We gained share, including taking the number one position in combined OSB and iGaming gross gaming revenue share in the US for the third quarter. We focused on our core value drivers and empowered our leaders to set aspirational goals and drive their teams to meet and exceed those goals. We lean heavily on data and analytics, giving us the confidence to cut expenses in some areas and double down in others. This year, our focus will largely be on essentially the same items. We are still in the early innings of the US online gaming industry, and there is still share that can be gained through innovation and operational excellence. We will continue to focus on product and customer experience as key differentiators. We will continue to leverage our scale to invest in important areas, while also focusing heavily on efficiency and optimization. And we will continue to focus on the core value drivers of our business. Having superior lifetime values and customer acquisition costs is the ultimate competitive advantage. And we have a number of initiatives planned to enhance both in 2024 and beyond. We also continue to face new competition as we consistently have over the years. In the past, we've been able to drive growth and gain share, while simultaneously becoming more efficient. But importantly, we do not take any of our recent success for granted. We have the right team in place and are working hard to maintain our edge. Going into 2024, there are three main opportunities on my mind. The first is continuing to foster our entrepreneurial culture and empower our great people to pursue big opportunities. The second is developing our next crop of leaders and giving them opportunities that allow them to stretch, grow, and contribute at higher levels. The third is leveraging our free cash flow which we expect to generate in order to maximize value for our shareholders. We are excited to have an agreement to bring Jackpocket into the DraftKings family and enter the rapidly growing US digital lottery vertical. Importantly, this is not just a new product for our customers to enjoy, but really a way to strengthen our core OSB and iGaming position in the US by optimizing our overall LTV and CAC. We look forward to working together to provide tremendous and differentiated value to the combined customer base. In closing, 2023 is a fantastic year for DraftKings, yet I believe that 2024 will be even better. I am unbelievably excited about the plans we have in place to continue serving our customers and growing our business. Most importantly, I am excited about the quality of the team we have in place, and I have no doubt that we will continue to execute very effectively against our key priorities this year. We will work tirelessly to produce great results and build on the incredible momentum we generated in 2023. With that, I will turn it over to Jason Park. Good morning. It's a very good question, very big picture. I think it sounds like product is sort of part of your question. I definitely think in play is a huge opportunity, as you noted. Still very early stages of that developing, and I think there's a lot, both on the product side and also on the broadcast side that can be done to make that experience better and more accessible to -- or at least more interesting to a larger audience. I still think there's a lot of room to move on just organic growth of parlays and other sorts of things. I mean, remember we just launched progressive parlay recently, so that product is still very early in its development and should continue to drive strong parlay mix increase. And then there's a number of other initiatives that we have that we'll be rolling out throughout the year that I'm not going to steal my product team's thunder on, but we have lots of good stuff planned. I think really key thing to remember is, it's still super early days. A lot of the things that we think will happen over the coming years will greatly change the way that the product and the customer experience works. It's going to evolve quite a bit. I think it's a pretty exciting time and still very early stages, so lots of room to grow. Yes, I think it's more the latter. There's all sorts of different options that we're looking at for how to maximize shareholder return with the capital we'll be accumulating on our balance sheet. I think what you will see though is, we're going to stay very squarely on strategy. We talked about how priority A is winning in the US and I think Jackpocket is absolutely in line with that. Lottery is the oldest form of gaming in the US. It's been around forever. The audience is massive. And as you noted, it's a very efficient way to acquire customers in mass at extraordinarily lower CACs than what we see in the other forms of online gaming. And we know from overlap analysis that we did that those customers will cross sell very effectively too. And from the overlap analysis we did, we saw that the customers that overlapped were about 50% higher spend on DraftKings OSB and iGaming products than customers who didn't. So lots of reason to believe that not only is there cheap acquisition, but there's also high LTV customers that we can cross over. And I think that's a really core thing that DFS provided for us as an advantage too. So if you look at kind of the playbook that's worked for us, entering new states, having a built-up database, having an active base of customers that we can cross-sell. I think this is doubling down on that. Yes. So, I mean, there's a couple things to play here. First, for a fixed amount of promotions, obviously lower hold due to sport outcomes. And I mean, we had the worst two-week stretch of sport outcomes from a dollar cost basis that we've ever had as a public company. So that's going to just naturally make up. But if you look at sort of the adjusted for outcomes numbers, it was down to 300 basis points year-over-year. I think also, we had a blowout quarter from a customer acquisition perspective. So you're going to have a little bit higher promotion rate when that happens. And if you isolate to the retention side, to existing customer promotions, those were down even more significantly year-over-year. So we're actually seeing really good trends on that front, playing out pretty much exactly as we expected. And I think where you're seeing some noise is just from some of the outcomes and also a blowout quarter from customer acquisition. But even despite all that, when you adjust just for the outcomes and leave the acquisition numbers in there, it was still 200 bps to 300 bps lower year-over-year. Yes. First of all, regardless of when this closes, if it closes in 2024, it will not have a material impact. It will not cause us to change our guide, so let me be clear on that. We're talking low single digit losses this year, and I think next year will be a positive year. I think the real question is how much, depending on timing of close, synergy can we realize next year and how much upside is there. But I don't expect this to be any sort of drag. If anything, it'll be, I think some pleasant upside, but we're just hesitant to kind of commit to timing of synergies given that we don't have a definitive date of close yet. So really, I think that's the question for 2025 is, is it going to be slightly positive or are we going to be able to capture real meaningful synergies and start to accelerate some of the expected synergies that we have pegged for 2026 currently? And that's currently not something that we really can peg given we're not certain of the closing timing. But just to be completely clear, this will not change our guide regardless of when we close in 2024, and this should be, if anything, a positive, certainly not a drag on EBITDA in 2025. Yes, so for the fourth quarter, we were around 30%. We think there may have been an error in the Illinois report for December that overstated it, so that's something we're still digging into. But it was around 30% for the fourth quarter, and we expect continued increase this year. We haven't put any exact numbers out for what we are forecasting parlay mix to be. I think some of this -- somebody mentioned in-game betting earlier. There's so many moving parts and people have to remember, as different levers for monetization are increasingly being adopted by consumers, you're going to see lots of things moving. In-game betting, of course, is going to have less parlay mix just because of the rapid nature of it and therefore may have lower hold, but it's still a very good thing for monetization. So this is something we have to always keep in mind. Obviously, hold and parlay mix are big levers, but it's not the only lever. Those are not the only levers that we have to increase monetization. But to answer your question, for Q4 is 30%, and we're going to dig in and figure out what's going on with the Illinois data, but that looks a little off to me. Yes, it's a great question. I mean, first, the fact that there's overlap shows us that the customers are very similar type of customer. And we looked at a number of different data points to verify that from demographic data to other behavioral and psychographical stuff. I think the idea is that overlap was with zero CRM or actual effort put towards cross sell. And it's nowhere near the cross sell that we've been able to achieve from OSB to iGaming. So we think there's a ton of upside there with real meaningful effort put towards that. And that's something we do best. We feel like we have the best in the industry cross-sell rates. And I think whether it's BFS to OSB and iGaming or OSB to iGaming or any of the above, we've been able to achieve much higher cross-sell rates through our efforts. So I have to imagine there's a ton of upside there. And the other thing is, if we're seeing natural overlap with our audience, probably many of those are still using competitor products and not us. So I think there's also an opportunity to market more effectively to customers in our database that may still be playing OSB and iGaming, but with competitors, maybe in the Jackpocket database, I should say. So I think that's number one. And then number two is, you're right, absolutely, every new state that opens, this is just like DFS has been for us. We have this built-in customer base. We know that there's tons of people around the nation that play lotteries. One of the great things about this, too, is unlike OSB and iGaming, you don't need legislative action in most states in order to get lottery, courier lottery, digital courier lottery launch. You need to get usually some kind of approval through the lottery director and the executive branch, but you don't need legislative action, which makes it a much lower hurdle to get up and running in new states. And this is something, of course, that every state lottery we think would want. It'll grow the lottery market, bring new customers in. So I think it's a great opportunity to get a product potentially in the vast majority of US states. And you're absolutely right. I think as time goes on, if you like us believe that more and more states will continue to launch OSB and iGaming then it'll be the gift that keeps on giving. I think we feel pretty good about our technology stack. I think that there may be small bolt-ons here and there that we think are helpful to enhance. But I really think it's more about these kind of strategic moves that are going to help us win in US online gaming. And you know I think we're going to be super disciplined on M&A. I don't think you'll see us go in this rash of buying companies left and right. This is one we did a ton of diligence on. We underwrote it very carefully with very conservative, I think, assumptions. And we feel like it has high potential to be a real home run. So I think you're going to see us pursuing things like that that really make a lot of sense when you think about it. And I think you're going to see us continue to be super disciplined and you're going to see us look at all sorts of different ways to take the capital that we're accumulating, create shareholder value. This is -- M&A is not the only way to do it, there are many others. So, I think that's the best way I'd describe it. And I think it fits with how we're disciplined in general as a company. If you look at the deals we do on the business development and partnership side, it's the same thing. We use a lot of discretion. We're very careful and we underwrite with a very strong analytic process and that's exactly how we approach this M&A deal. I think, first, I'm glad that you feel that there's some upside there. I do too. I noted this earlier, I think one of the reasons that we're a little cautious with holes is that, there are other things you can do to improve modernization, like pushing live betting more that might actually not increase hole but still be very good from an LTV standpoint. So we want to make sure that we leave some flexibility for all sorts of different levers. And at the same time, I do think you're right, there's probably some upside there. Really for us, we've always had a nice mix of customers across the spectrum. And I do think in the last few months, there's been more casual customers coming in, but there's been more customers of all sorts of spend and sort of across the spectrum of spend. So really not seeing anything tremendously different other than just really strong customer acquisition across the board, but I can't look at it and say it's skewing more cash flow or anything like that. It just seems like overall customer acquisition is just really strong right now. Yes, I mean, that is something that we're actively looking at right now. So we're still doing our work, but we'll have more to say on that in the coming months. Yes, we're really excited that Marie on board, I mean she not only was at Amazon, she's at ESPN for many years and has an incredible reputation and really strong relationships throughout our ecosystem and industry. So very excited to bring her on. I wouldn't say this is any way a signal that we're looking at live sports rights. That's not something that right now is on our mind. But I think she brings a number of different experiences and skill sets that will help us understand all parts of the ecosystem. And we do a lot of business with folks who own live sports rights. So having that understanding from the other side of the table, I think, will be very helpful in future opportunities that we explore and future negotiations. So very excited to bring her on, and I think she's going to bring a lot of real depth of experience as well as a unique perspective to the team. We really look at both. I mean, for us, it's about how do we first engage the customer? If we have the customer engaged, that's table stakes. You can't do anything if you don't have that. So we start there, and then we really try to meet them where they're at. If they're looking for new types of bets, and that makes it more interesting than great. If they're looking to try new sports, then we try to provide that to them. And really, I think for us, it's about taking that customer and personalizing the experience, so they're sticky and they feel like it's easy and comfortable to use the app. So if you're always betting on basketball, we're going to show you basketball, but we might also show you other interesting basketball bets that we think you might find intriguing. So it's really something that I think starts with the customer. And there's all sorts of different levers that you can pull. And the important thing is not to force anything, to try to just get the right products in front of the right customers. And I think we've done a good job doing that. Yes, so on the first question, I mean, I think you're right, North Carolina will be similar. It's a little smaller population-wise in Ohio, but it's a top 10 state, and we expect it to be a great launch and contribute in a meaningful way. And it'll be pretty standard. I mean, at this point, our playbook's honed, so we're not going to approach North Carolina any differently, other than a few optimizations that we always make around the edges. But I think you're going to see North Carolina be a very similar state launch to the ones that you mentioned that we did last year. And as far as parlay mix, yes, you're absolutely right, newer states. I think it's always easier when you have a product that you're introducing customers to for the first time to get them to try new things and harder to get them if they've been using the product in a certain way for years to change behavior. So it's more of a grind, but the trends are absolutely continuing every single year in the oldest states that we have. From a parlay mix perspective, the trends are continuing to move in the right direction. So I think that's another one that'll just be a continuous tailwind for us over time and eventually it'll converge what we're seeing in the new states. It'll just take a little longer. We can hear you. So for us, a lot of the questions around branding and product were still in the early stages. But the current plan is to keep it as its own brand and app. I think they've built a strong audience and a good brand, and I think that we want to keep it, but obviously we're going to explore opportunities to integrate ecosystems, have all products available across all brands, just like we do with GNOG. And I think Jackpocket has a casino that they -- so there's a lot to do there, I think, with their brand, and we'll see how that all evolves over time, but that's the current plan. And then I'm sorry, what was the second question? Yes. So no new OSB and iGaming states are included in our synergy or any other assumptions. So we're just assuming current footprint. So a lot of upside if there's more OSB and iGaming states and cross-selling more customers, we do assume that some more lottery states launch. As I noted earlier, it's a lot more seamless to launch a lottery state. You don't need to go through the legislative process. It's really more of going and working out a deal directly with the state. So I think that, that's something that we feel a lot of confidence in and if you look at their ramp over the last few years, they've launched a number of different states. And I think the hardest part really is -- because there's no legislative process. The hardest part is, one they've already solved, which is, building a technology solution that will scale and we'll be able to service multiple states and lots of customers at the same time. And of course, remember, there's already states that they're in, that are big states. I mean, Texas is a huge revenue state for them. And as we know, Texas came very close last year to passing OSB, and we're very hopeful they will this year. New York is a huge state for them. I think New York could do iGaming in the next year or so. So that's another big opportunity. So really, I think the best is yet to come. And as I said earlier, this is an asset that we believe will just continue to increase in value, because if you're a believer, which I hope we all are, that there will be more and more OSB and iGaming states, none of that is baked into any of our synergy assumptions, that's just all upside. You got it. Yes, I think that is true. I mean I'm not sure if it's exactly apples to apples, I have to go back and check. But absolutely, retention is improving. Yes. I mean I think it's largely product. That's the biggest one. I also think that you're just seeing more and more natural organic growth as customers adopt more sports and things like that, which just keeps them more sticky and active on the product. But it's really just the product advancement more than anything else. We also are constantly optimizing our CRM. So that's a big lever too. I should mention we're testing all the time and finding wins. So I think between the product improving greatly over the last couple of years and our marketing and team continuing to test and learn the biggest drivers. But there's a lot of things, right? I think our customer service has improved. We're -- I think there's so many different dimensions across the products and across the entire customer experience that have helped us improve our retention. We're very excited about that when we worked with Barstool many times over the years and really thrilled to be working with them again. It's a partner that we know very well and I have a ton of data on. So we felt really -- I mean, this is about as good as it gets in terms of us having historical data and being able to underwrite this deal. So it's really exciting, and we believe it will be a strong performer for us. Yes. I mean I think it's a number of different things that come with scale. Certainly, their discounts that come with volume and scale and things like payment processing. Also, promotional mix continues to trend down as we increase the ratio of existing to new customers. And -- those things, I think, are the largest drivers. Yes. So I think this speaks to the power of our work that we've done over the last few years to build out the same game parlay product and improve player props and really diversify the bets that despite the fact that the game outcome did not go our way at all with the cheese winning, we ended up actually holding right in line with what we thought we would from a hold rate perspective. So that was really, I think, a testament to the great work the team has done over the last few years to drive more diversified bets and more parlays. Yes. I think iGaming is a little bit different because it's so high frequency. It's really -- whole rate matters, of course, if you look at the math. But if you think about kind of a customer and how they behave. Most people sit and they play for some period of time, and they have a budget and I think that hold rate generally doesn't move more than 100 bps or 200 bps up or down in any given day, it's much more stable than sports hold rate because it's not outcome dependent at all. So it's always something to look at, but I think it's just a fundamentally different product. And it's same thing with like live betting and game. If somebody is betting on every play of a game, taking a super high margin doesn't necessarily make that person stick for as long as he can. So it's very different than, I think, somebody who's making one or two bets pregame or maybe they're making a lot of bets pregame, but they're getting sort of on a much longer cycle and the money isn't churning as quickly. Well, I think that the real question is, what can Jackpocket contribute to the overall lottery ecosystem. And regardless of how it evolves, I think their products, their customers are going to have a role to play. And this is something that any lottery would want, right? I mean it would certainly make any -- I would think -- I shouldn't say any. I'm sure there's some around the country that, for whatever reason don't, but it increases the lottery market and increases sales. So it should be a no-brainer, I would think, for the vast majority of state lotteries. And I think Jackpocket is very well positioned for however it evolves in iLottery and other things. I mean they have an incredible customer base, a brand. This is, I think, something that actually could be a real tailwind for them depending on how it evolves. But whether it continues to be the current model or whether it changes, I think that Jackpocket is extremely well positioned and is a very unique asset. Yes. One other thing worth noting too is, iLottery requires legislative action unlike what Jackpocket does. So I think while it could happen, it's going to be a much slower burn. And I think the ability to get the digital lottery products that Jackpocket offers up and running in a number of states quickly is just much more seamless. Sure. I mean, as you know, our relationship with ESPN ended late last year, so that is certainly one. But I wouldn't say there's like any one thing. We're constantly optimizing it out. And actually, most of our spend is not committed. Most of our spend is done through buying that we can pull in and out of at any various points of time. So there's a ton of different levers that we can pull as we think about funding different agreements. And right now, I think given sort of the pace and cadence of what we expect state launches to be in 2024 barring some big surprise. I don't think you're going to see an increase in marketing this year. It's going to be much more of a focus on deploying our dollars much more effectively. And I think Barstool is a great example of that. It's a great question. At this point, we haven't dug in as much on that, but I think it's certainly something that you could see. I think that what we get with Jackpocket is the ability to acquire a lot of customers at a fraction. It's about 10% to 15% of our current customer acquisition costs. And that's something that, obviously, will provide a lot of levers for being able to optimize margin over the long run, assuming that we can continue to do that, which I have no reason to believe we can. And I think on the other side of it, being able to cross-sell, it will provide some revenue lift. We don't view this necessarily. It's more like DFS, right? DFS is a nice little product, makes money for us. But it's not something that is going to drive the massive top line growth. That's really the OSB and iGaming, and it's more of a vehicle to be able to continue to acquire customers and engage customers in states that don't have that yet. And I think Jackpocket, much like DFS, will do the same thing. And also, I think in states that do have OSB and iGaming, it will provide us another vehicle to acquire cheaply. And one of the cool things, I think, is if you look at sort of where a lot of customer acquisition happens now, it's during these big moments, whether that's the Super Bowl or March Madness coming up or any of those things. It's those big tentpole moments. And what Jackpocket does is, it creates more of those big mass, cheap customer acquisition opportunities during the year. And it could be any time, right? It could be the middle of August when there's suddenly a $1 billion jackpot and we're the only ones who are able to actually acquire in mass right before the NFL season starts. So it's those types of advantages, I think, that you're going to see really pay off over time. Great question. So I think on the first one, it gives you the ability to do that. It doesn't mean we will. I think for us right now, we feel there's a lot of room to just continue to drive engagement through product and customer service and other things. But certainly having a little bit more cushion to be able to find other new sorts of promotions that works is another advantage. And doesn't necessarily mean that, that's going to be something we're looking to do. But I do think it provides an ability to do so, which is certainly an advantage over time. And then on the streaming side, I think it's early to say. There's a lot of moving parts right now. And at the same time, we know, obviously, that there's a lot of disruption going on in sports media. Obviously, we've seen a ton of disruption and have seen kind of how the evolution of non-sports media and sports is still very much right in the thick of the evolution that's occurring and it will be interesting to see how it plays out and no doubt there'll be opportunities created, and we're always looking for new partners and interesting ways that we can take advantage of any disruption happening in an adjacent market to us. Yes, great questions. I mean, so we did a ton of work on the overall customer base and also on the general lottery market. And what we find is that, the people that are buying lottery tickets on Jackpocket, they're using mobile devices to do so. They're younger. They're a more tech-savvy customer, it's a different demographic, I think, than the average lottery customer, and that's part of why it's growing the market, which is great. So similar to kind of the online better versus the retail better, it's just -- it's a different person that's willing and also that has an iPhone and that sort of thing. And I think really, that's kind of what the appeal is, is that, this is a disruptive new thing in a market that really -- the customer wants this, right? I mean people don't buy lottery tickets today, sometimes, I think, due to convenience. And just like being able to make a bet on your phone, shooting, I mean if you look at anywhere right now that's legalized betting, online betting makes up a much larger portion of the handles than retail betting. It just makes sense when you give people a digital and mobile option that you're going to grow the market and also reach a new demographic of person. So that's really what we found when we dug in there. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question? iGaming or OSB. So actually another interesting thing we saw, I had gone in thinking this was going to be much more propensity to cross-sell to iGaming this type of customer. But when we did the overlap analysis, it was actually quite similar -- the overlap between OSB customers and iGaming customers. So that gave us great confidence that -- which makes sense in some ways, right, because the overlap between iGaming and OSB and the cross-sell rates are so high. So it kind of makes sense when you think about it, but I would have gone in and probably think it would skew a little more iGaming and it was actually very similar. Well, no doubt, I think there will be more. And I think what, you really have to think about is -- you're right, from a regulatory perspective, there are other -- it's not as hard. But I think that what really is hard is the technology side. It's a very complicated fulfillment process, and every state is a little bit different. So you have to build a solution that can be flexible and it's actually quite similar to what we've built in terms of our multistate regulatory structure in OSB and iGaming. But I think the added piece for them is the fulfillment, and that's very complicated to do that at scale in a cost-effective manner and have a technology system, they have patents as well on various pieces that they've created -- to have a technology system that can support rapid launch of states is not something that you can build right overnight. So no doubt there will be more competition over time, but I think these guys have a big head start. And while the barriers to entry may not be super high, I think that head start is real. Yes. I haven't really thought as much about that. They do have a lot of interesting things they've worked. I know they have a bingo product that were -- that they recently launched. So there could be some leverageable things there for sure. Definitely, I've thought about it more is they're building out a great lottery experience and by plugging in the iGaming experience that we've been able to build out in the OSB experience that we've been able to build out, to the lottery experience they've been able to build out. I think that's where the real power is. But there also might be -- you're right, some good nuggets there in terms of features and other things that are repurposeful across other products. So that's something that we'll have to look into a little bit more. Well, that's a product we're very excited about. We haven't talked as much about it because it just launched, but it's something that we think could really reinvigorate DFS growth in a real meaningful way. Right now, we're seeing really good early signal, very strong retention numbers, good monetization. The fees that we take, they are guaranteed price pools are actually higher than the average DFS fee. So that's good, too. So a lot of things to like about that product, and I think it's something that we could really see be a meaningful contributor in the future. Thank you. Yes. I mean, first, we are just in the process of completing the migration on GNOG. So that's going to be a real exciting one and really just at the very early stages of deploying our multi-brand strategy and I think that's going to be a real tailwind for us. We also have a number of product features and new games that we're working on as well as things that we're working to increase and build out like our jackpots offering, which I think, is a real differentiator for us. So there's a lot going on in that space. We're working on a lot of new gamification stuff. There's a lot. And I think really front and center is that GNOG migration and having those products become on the same platform, I think, will allow us to really get even more leverage out of each additional feature and game that we launch. Yes. There's a few states that I think are getting momentum on iGaming now, and it will be hard to say, but I think we're going to get at least one or two this year, if I had to guess. Some of the states, I'm hearing some momentum in include Maryland, Wyoming is one. So I think there's a few states that could consider it. I think a dark course is Illinois. Really, what I think you saw and there's kind of two things that I think are playing out here. One is, a number of different states wanted to do OSB first and see how that went, and that's still ramping for them. And so the draw for that reason of new tax revenues from online gaming isn't as strong if you just launched online sports betting and you're waiting to see how it's ramping and you're still getting more and more accustomed to and comfortable with it. The second thing is that, we talked a few years ago about post-COVID and how that was going to be a real catalyst given states would need tax revenue. What we ended up seeing was that, so much federal money was pumped into the state's coffers that that really dragged -- over the next few years, it kind of extended that time line a bit. But now that's, I think, coming to an end in many states, they're starting to see budgets that really look a lot like the budgets four or five years ago in many states and the surpluses in some of these states are no longer there. And so I think that's going to also just sort of change the dynamic in the coming years between people getting comfortable that regulatory and responsible gaming pieces that we can put in place are robust and really do a great job protecting, people understanding there actually isn't a legal online casino market, iGaming market and that much like with sports betting, disrupting that illegal market that had no consumer protections, paying no tax revenue, actually a real priority that states should have. And then, of course, the amount of programs, whether it be educational or otherwise, that the revenues can find, I think, are also going to be real catalyst behind. And it's kind of as we expected, maybe not exactly as we expected, but we thought there'd be a lot of momentum initially on OSB. I was actually pleasantly surprised as many states as they did ended up doing iGaming at the same time. And I think as OSB legislation continues to move through the states, I think you're going to see a wave of iGaming legislation start to materialize over the course of the next year or two. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Well, first, thank you all for joining us on today's call. Really, 2023 was an excellent year for DraftKings, and we're so excited about the opportunities in 2024 and beyond. I think 2024 is going to be even a bigger year for us. I hope everyone stays safe and well and look forward to chatting with you in the future. Thank you."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. I'll hit the highlights, including our full year 2023 and fourth quarter performance and our updated guidance for 2024. Please note, that all income statement measures discussed except for revenue are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, the organization is executing very well, and that is showing up in our results. In fiscal year 2023, revenue grew 64% versus 2022, and adjusted EBITDA improved year-over-year by nearly $600 million versus 2022, which resulted in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA flow through percentage of 40%. Adjusted gross margin increased nearly 200 basis points as we delivered higher sportsbook hold percentage and improved our promotional reinvestment for OSB and iGaming. Adjusted sales and marketing expense grew 3% as we reduced marketing in our more mature states and transitioned further into more efficient national marketing. In the fourth quarter, we continued to generate great performance across our core value drivers and produced more than $1.2 billion of revenue and $151 million of positive adjusted EBITDA. Better customer acquisition, retention, and engagement resulted in higher than expected handle for the quarter and positively impacted revenue and adjusted EBITDA by $93 million and $42 million, respectively. Structural sportsbook hold percentage was 10.4% and well ahead of expectations as we continued to improve our parlay mix and optimize our trading capabilities. This trend positively impacted revenue and adjusted EBITDA by $53 million and $38 million, respectively. As you are well aware of by now, sport outcomes were very customer friendly in the fourth quarter, primarily in the final two weeks of November, while December was consistent with expectations. Our actual sportsbook hold percentage for the fourth quarter was 9.2% due to sport outcomes, which were a headwind to revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $175 million and $126 million, respectively, compared to our expectations. Moving on to our full year 2024 guidance, we are poised for a rapid increase in adjusted EBITDA due to continued strong revenue growth coupled with a scaled fixed cost structure. In November of 2023, we guided fiscal year 2024 revenue of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $350 million to $450 million. Today, we are improving our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance range to $4.65 billion to $4.9 billion and our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $410 million to $510 million. Customer acquisition, retention, and engagement in Q4 and Q1 to date has continued to exceed expectations due to ongoing product innovation and marketing optimization initiatives. These trends account for $90 million of the revenue improvement and $35 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. Higher structural sportsbook hold percentage as a result of continued year-over-year bet mix improvement, as well as improvements in trading and risk management accounts for $35 million of the revenue improvement and $25 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. From an intra-year perspective in 2024, we expect first quarter revenue to increase approximately 45% year-over-year and second through fourth quarter revenue to each grow year-over-year in the 20% to 30% range. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately breakeven in the first quarter, nearly $150 million in the second quarter, and above $300 million in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we are also now guiding free cash flow. We expect to generate between $310 million and $410 million in free cash flow in 2024 based on approximately $120 million of annual CapEx and capitalized software development costs, as well as a modest source of cash from changes in networking capital and interest income. Therefore, we will end the year with approximately $1.6 billion of cash before using approximately $413 million to fund our proposed acquisition of Jackpocket. Looking further ahead, as discussed at our Investor Day and the letter we released last night, we expect to generate positive and increasing free cash flow starting this year and are beginning to explore ways to optimize our capital structure. Our expectation for sustainable revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion over the next several years offers us a number of options to maximize long-term returns for our shareholders. That concludes our remarks and we will now open the line for questions. I would just add Dan, our philosophy on guiding to hold rate has been that we should commit to something that we have empirically realized. So as you saw, structural hold in Q4 was better than we thought, and that gave us conviction to increase the embedded hold rate in our 2024 guide. But to Jason's point, we've got a lot of work going on to improve that, but our philosophy has been only to commit to what we've empirically actualized. Yes, I would just add. I mean, if you look at our cash balance that we forecasted, $1.6 billion at the end of this year, including the $400 million, roughly, for the acquisition of Jackpocket, and then our multi-year plan that we outlined in November, we're obviously going to be accumulating cash very quickly. So it's a great position to be in and we're exploring all those options in. Yes. So we outlined that for 2024, the free cash flow -- the delta between adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, net impact of CapEx, cap software plus some cumulative good guides across working capital and interest income. It's about $100 million. So that's a free cash flow yield on the adjusted EBITDA. I think about the components between adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as being more steady over time. So as adjusted EBITDA grows, the free cash flow conversion percentage is going to go up, Stephen. Yes, I agree. I think it's all of the above, Chad, where the improving promotional reinvestment rate due to our mix of existing versus new customers, our improving hold rate and then just ongoing optimization of our COGS vendors are all driving that improvement in gross margin rate."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stanton Dodge, Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead.\nStanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed further in our SEC filings that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements other than as required by law. During this call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings release and presentation, which can be found on our website and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, and thank you all for joining. The first three quarters of 2023 have been outstanding for DraftKings. We have made thoughtful investments in our product throughout the year and are winning with our customers, and our team executed tremendously around the start of NFL and college football season. Importantly, we remain focused on our core value drivers, acquiring customers efficiently, retaining and monetizing our existing customers, entering new jurisdictions and building an efficient and scaled organization. I'm pleased to share that this strong execution and focus resulted in another excellent quarter. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded our expectations and our momentum continued into the fourth quarter with the start of the basketball and hockey seasons. We are raising our expectations for fiscal year 2023 and introducing initial guidance for fiscal year 2024. In 2024, we expect revenue of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion and positive adjusted EBITDA of $350 million to $450 million. We also expect to generate meaningfully positive free cash flow in fiscal year 2024. As we look back on the third quarter in 2023, here are our key takeaways. First, we are winning. Our revenue in the quarter increased 57% year-over-year, and we achieved number one combined OSB and iGaming gross gaming revenue share in the U.S. We've efficiently added over 1,000 basis points of combined OSB and iGaming shares since the second quarter of 2022, which we are very proud of. Second, our investments in product and technology are paying off. We have created what we believe is the strongest product in the industry and are seeing overall engagement on our app and structural hold percentage continue to increase. Importantly, we have a clear road map to extend our product advantage over the coming years. Third, our older states are generating significant contribution profit, and newer states are generating positive contribution profit faster than previous states. Fourth, we expect attractive adjusted EBITDA flow through percentage on incremental revenue as we believe our organization is largely at scale and therefore, has a long runway of margin improvement. Finally, the best is yet to come. We are excited for the future and look forward to presenting our latest views on the U.S. opportunity, sources of competitive differentiation, core business drivers, including additional details on unit economics and our multiyear financial outlook at our Investor Day on November 14. With that, I will turn it over to Jason Park.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason. I'll hit the highlights, including our very strong third quarter performance, increased 2023 guidance and our initial expectations for 2024. Please note that all income statement measures discussed except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, the organization is executing very well, and that is showing up in our results. We achieved $790 million of revenue in the quarter, which is 57% higher than our third quarter 2022 revenue, and our adjusted EBITDA of negative $153 million improved by $111 million on a year-over-year basis. Customer retention and engagement far exceeded our expectations as customers enjoyed our live same game parlay offering as well as our live and player prop markets. MLB was a bright spot throughout the third quarter and we successfully transitioned many of those customers into the football season. Customer acquisition was also healthy and exceeded expectations. For example, we have already acquired more than 5% of the adult population in Kentucky following the launch of our Sportsbook product in that state on September 28. Structural hold was above 9.5% during the quarter and well ahead of expectations as we continue to improve our parlay mix and optimize our trading capabilities. Our actual Sportsbook hold percentage was approximately 9%, inclusive of customer-friendly sport outcomes, primarily in college football and the NFL. Promotional reinvestment as a percentage of GGR outperformed our expectations due to stronger than anticipated retention of existing customers, which resulted in a slightly higher mix of existing customers versus new customers. Promotions as a percentage of GGR continue to improve on a year-over-year basis for our OSB and iGaming states. Our adjusted gross margin was in line with expectations and increased almost 300 basis points year-over-year. Strong handle growth combined with improving structural sportsbook hold rate and better promotional reinvestment for OSB & iGaming contributed to higher adjusted gross margin. External marketing and fixed expenses were consistent with our plans as we executed our football season kickoff and continue to exert discipline against our compensation expenses and vendor-related costs. We're very pleased with our results in our more mature OSB and iGaming state. In the states that launched from 2018 through 2021, we continue to drive very strong handle and revenue growth year-over-year with a corresponding improvement in adjusted gross margin rate, while our external marketing costs decreased at a double-digit rate. Our strong third quarter results and our visibility into continued improvement have enabled us to significantly raise our expectations for 2023 revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We are improving our full year 2023 revenue guidance range to $3.67 billion to $3.72 billion or by $195 million at the midpoint. We are also improving our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to negative $95 million to negative $115 million or by $100 million at the midpoint. The bridge from the 2023 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance that we shared in August to our 2023 guidance as of today include stronger customer retention, acquisition and engagement and structural sportsbook hold improvement, partially offset by customer-friendly sport outcomes in the third quarter and our expected launch in May. You can see the details of the bridge in the earnings presentation we posted to our website. In terms of our full year, we are increasing our 2023 adjusted gross margin rate guidance to 43.5% to 45%. We now expect contribution profit, which we define as adjusted gross profit less external marketing to approach $800 million in fiscal year 2023. We continue to expect fixed cost to grow less than 10% and external marketing to be consistent with prior guidance even when including our investment in May. With regard to our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and now plan to end the year with more than $1.2 billion of cash. As a reminder, we expect approximately $120 million of capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs for fiscal year 2023, and changes in net working capital to be a modest source of cash. We expect this level of CapEx to continue in 2024. Moving on to our full year 2024 guidance. We are poised for a rapid increase in adjusted EBITDA due to continued strong revenue growth, coupled with a scaled fixed cost structure. For 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion or nearly $1 billion of incremental revenue growth compared to the midpoint of our fiscal 2023 revenue guidance and more than double our revenue from 2022. Our guidance range for 2024 adjusted EBITDA is $350 million to $450 million, which equates to more than $500 million of year-over-year growth compared to the midpoint of our fiscal year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance and more than $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA improvement since 2022. Our guidance range for 2024 includes investments to launch approximately 5% of the adult population. In addition, based on the midpoints of our fiscal year 2023 and 2024 guidance ranges, we expect year-over-year adjusted EBITDA flow-through percentage up 53%, which we look forward to delivery. In sum, we had an excellent third quarter and are very excited about the trajectory of our business. We look forward to sharing more details at our upcoming Investor Day. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks you for taking my question. Just wanted to start with sales and marketing. I think one of the many things we learned this quarter was seeing your overall sales and marketing actually declined year-over-year, and I believe implying external marketing down even more during the quarter. As we look out to next year, I think that pattern actually continues. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what's enabling you to do that and still make the investments that you hope to? And sort of just talk to us a little bit about both mix, meaning new customers acquired versus existing and also seasonality, if you could, just how should we think about external marketing across the year? Thank you.\nJason Robins: Thanks, Shaun. So you're correct that we do expect to further decline in external marketing next year, and that is inclusive of potential launches in North Carolina as well as some other states. So all specifically the states that have legalized not any new states we're predicting legalization. And I think the biggest reason why is that as our existing states mature, we see less and less external marketing spend there. We are still continuing to acquire customers even in our old estate vintages. So we do still have marketing spend allocated to those. But it\u2019s certainly not nearly at the same level as in the first year, two, three of the state. So as states mature, that comes down. And so just generally, as the business is maturing, we\u2019re seeing that happen, which is what we expected, of course, if we see some very significant new states come online next year, that could change. But right now based on the kind of launch that we expect to launch, we\u2019re forecasting an external marketing decline next year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jeff Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJoseph Greff: Good morning, guys.\nOperator: Sorry, Joe, sorry about that.\nJoseph Greff: When you look out to 2024 and you look at -- when you roll up your guidance and your forecast. And when you look at OSB older states and newer states, is there a more meaningful contribution coming from the older states or how are you looking at between the different cohorts and vintages?\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's a great question. We actually are going to dive into that very specific topic in much more granular detail at our Investor Day on the 14th. So I very much look forward to sharing detail there. And I think the way you could think about it is, if you look at sort of the relative population sizes of the different vintages and then think about the maturity curve, obviously, the older states are still growing. So on a per capita basis, they will be larger. And then if you kind of think about how big each vintage is based on the percentage of population, and then also think about the mix of whether it\u2019s just OSB or OSB and iGaming, that will give you a picture of how much. But we actually are going to go into a much more specific detail on this on the 14th. And I was very certainly warm by my IR team not to run the front run in the Investor Day. So it won\u2019t \u2013 but it\u2019s a great question and look forward to sharing more with you in a couple of weeks.\nJoseph Greff: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, thanks. Clearly, there's been a lot of concerns or questions about the competitive environment, whether new entrants or existing folks who perhaps need to protect share. How are you planning for promotions into 2024 versus '23 in the guidance that you provided and could there be a reallocation from marketing savings that you're discussing?\nJason Robins: We continue -- excuse me, it's a great question. We continue to expect to see a decline in promotions. I know that there are a couple of states that report them that different data can be extrapolated, but it's always tricky to kind of look at a couple of seats. We actually saw a decline year-over-year in promotion rate for our overall OSB and iGaming business in Q3. Obviously, as you know, we saw a gross margin increase of about 300 bps year-over-year. Next year, we forecasted a 200 bps to 300 bps gross margin increase, and that's mostly from promotional decline. There's a little bit of hold rate increase in there too. But definitely, we'll stay disciplined. We've seen multiple waves of competition. Last time we saw a huge wave of competition. We stayed disciplined. We didn't increase our promotion rate and I don't think we expect to do that this time. So we certainly contemplated a variety of different scenarios in our guidance. And at this point, I think we have a decent amount of experience and historical data on different types of competition that might emerge. But I think the important thing for us is just to continue what we've done all along, which is to stay disciplined to focus on bringing down promotion rate through optimization. And then just naturally, I think continuing to see the user base matures and so much of that promotion goes to new customers. And I think if we continue to do that and execute well, the trends that we've been seeing for the last seven, eight quarters will continue.\nStephen Grambling: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thank you. Jason, when you guys think about your guidance for '24 within the context of the share gains that you guys have shown consistently but really stepped up in the 3Q. How are you thinking about -- I think relative to the 33% is what you guys had in the release that's blended across both channels. How do you guys think about that share within the context of next year's net revenue and EBITDA guidance? Is it flattish, moving up, et cetera?\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's a great question. I mean what we've always sort of typically guided the same way, which is we look at historical cohorts and data, project forward based on that. So implicitly, that generally implies a flat share. And I think a lot of why we outperformed this year by such a significant margin was just our share increase. So certainly not banking on that for next year. We're confident that we have some opportunity there, and we believe that we can. But as far as what's embedded in the guidance, our methodology hasn't changed. We look at historical cohorts, which kind of implicitly implies flat share and any projection going forward.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you. And then obviously, based on your scale at this point and the flow-through that you guys expect to receive or generate going forward. I guess the next question kind of becomes -- looking back to your March Analyst Day when I think you guys laid out gross margins of like 56% at a steady state and some of the buckets, platform processing, et cetera, that would kind of contribute to that. How do you think about like kind of the evolution of maybe whittling down some of those costs, whether it be within processing or revenue share? And how far are we from having that as kind of a talking point around improving that gross margin?\nJason Park: Hey, Carlos. It's Jason Park. Yeah. So great question on the flow-through, and I'll start sort of on the bottom end of the income statement, and Jason had already alluded to improving or declining external marketing costs within the 2024 time period. And what I'd also add is, we're going to -- we've had a great 18 months of just exerting excellent discipline on our fixed costs. We'll continue to do that. Then into the cost of goods sold part, we guided to a 200 basis point to 300 basis point improvement in gross margin rate primarily as the promo reinvestment continues to improve and we do. We do have multiple initiatives throughout the cost of goods sold structure, whether those primarily around vendor related negotiations and continuing to achieve scale through volume discounts. And those are embedded within our gross margin rate guidance as well, and I think provide a long runway of continued improvement, both at the gross margin level and the EBITDA margin line.\nJason Robins: Yeah. And I think as Jason mentioned, definitely the largest driver of gross margin improvement is continued just maturity of the base, which brings promotion rate down. But certainly, in addition to some negotiations, we also just have existing contracts with volume thresholds that we expect over time trip that will bring gross margins down. That's one of the benefits of having scale.\nCarlo Santarelli: Yeah, Jason. And that's kind of where I was going with that. Like what -- is that time frame in the next year or two or is that kind of just ongoing enrolling?\nJason Robins: I think it's ongoing, really. I mean, at a certain point, you cap out, but I would imagine that Google gets better rates on vendors for things than we do. So I think just as you get bigger, you continue to be able to get leverage in those areas because you can afford to pay more even if it's less on a percentage revenue basis. And that's generally how all these things work is that as volume goes up, the rate comes down and -- so yeah, I do think it\u2019s just kind of an ongoing thing. We have a team that focuses on this pretty much all year around and is continually looking for ways to optimize the COGS structure.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you, both\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to talk about something that just has never come up until now, which is your cash flow statement. If we start to think about what next year brings with the '24 guidance, and I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about keeping CapEx at a similar $120 million level. You do start to pile up, you start to accumulate some cash. And I'd love to get a sense for how you think about managing around that. Obviously, you want to keep yourself positioned for a state like Florida or California or whatever may happen. But can you just maybe give us a little more color on how you're thinking about that?\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's a great question. And it's something we've actually been spending increasing time going through looking at all different options, including organic investments we can make opportunities for capital structure optimization, buybacks, looking at just basically how do we deliver the maximum value over the long term to shareholders. So that is a great question. It's something that we feel fortunate that we now really are in a position to have real value creation from optimally making those decisions to now. We've been, as you said, focused on getting to this point. But definitely feel very good about our trajectory on the cash flow side. And we'll have more to say as we think it through, but definitely a great question and something that we're actively discussing here.\nDavid Katz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Joe Stauff with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJoseph Stauff: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Two questions, I was just wondering, in your guide for '24. Jason, you had mentioned, I guess, within the two -- the gross margin improvement, you had an assumption for an improvement in structural hold. What is that? And then wondering if you could just comment on the level of adult penetration and user growth that you're getting in mass and Ohio, obviously, you get to 7% pretty quick. Is it fair to assume that, that's now higher, just call it, two months into the U.S. sports calendar?\nJason Robins: So great questions. On the hold side, we forecasted basically that we continue on the same level of structural hold rate we're on today. Obviously, there's some opportunities, we think, to potentially increase that. But right now, that's what we have line of sight to. So that's what we put in. And I'm sorry, what was the second question?\nJoseph Stauff: Yeah. Just a comment on trying to estimate adult penetration, how many more customers are out there, user growth, et cetera. And you had given Ohio and mass in terms of where you've been, you got to 7% pretty quickly. And I'm wondering where that is now.\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's another great question. I mean we haven't found a ceiling yet in the older states. We continue to acquire customers. Even in a state like New Jersey, which is our first state that we launched and obviously is bordering a lot of other states that have since launch, we continue to have healthy customer acquisition. So hard to say where the ceiling is. We're well into the double-digits in terms of adult population penetration in some of our older states. So I think it really has a lot to do with how we continue to evolve the product. If we continue to make the product more appealing to a wider audience and continue to find ways to innovate to reach more customers than \u2013 I think it can continue to go up over a long period of time. But certainly, at this point, we have not found the ceiling yet.\nJoseph Stauff: Thanks, Jason.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDaniel Politzer: Hey. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about hold. Maybe as you see it philosophically or the long term. I mean is there kind of a target or upper limit you see relative to the kind of mid-9 level you're at now? And I guess maybe along with that, how do you think about the trade-offs for hold relative to LTV for the customer?\nJason Robins: Yeah. I mean I think this is something that we'll just always continue to be analyzing and optimizing. And it's almost a tricky question to think about in that sense because it really depends on where you're getting hold increase from. If you continue to create products that the customer wants and they have demand that have higher hold, then that can do a great job, I think, of continuing to raise your hold and I think on the other side of it, if you're raising hold by either forcing people into things that they really don't want or making your pricing worse than the market. I think that\u2019s obviously potentially going to have a negative impact on LTV. So we\u2019re very focused on the customer and on creating \u2013 we think \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen this with a number of products we\u2019ve created from SGP to cash out. We have a new one that we\u2019re going to be talking about at our Investor Day that we\u2019re launching, which I love that, I\u2019m really excited about that kind of fits this double objective of being great for the customer and holding better than the average. So I think we have a long runway on that front. And it\u2019s really about focusing on the customer and maximizing the LTV. So in the end, if we do see that anything, whether it\u2019s sort of just the concept that holds higher or a particular product or anything that we\u2019ve introduced is having an adverse effect on LTVs. And obviously, we\u2019ll try to turn the dials accordingly. But that\u2019s really what the team is focused on. Hold is obviously a variable promotions are variable, but retention is the most important variable. So very much focused across all value creation drivers across the LTV spectrum. And I think that hold is something that, again, it\u2019s a little tricky because it depends on how you\u2019re doing it, but I do think there\u2019s a lot more room for upside there than not.\nDaniel Politzer: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nRobert Fishman: Hi. Good morning. On iGaming, despite still early days on legalization, has your confidence increased over the past year of how big of a driver iGaming can be for total company revenue? Maybe also importantly, total company profitability. And then just separately, with some of your competitors using that vision for streaming NFL games this year, can you discuss your updated thoughts on streaming live games in your app and whether you think there's any long-term benefits for DraftKings.\nJason Robins: So great questions. On the first one, I mean, iGaming is probably the one piece of our business I'd point to that's under talked about, namely because we're only in 11% of the population now. 87% is still not legalized. Huge opportunity there. Obviously, still tremendous opportunity with a little bit around half of the U.S. population, not having legal sports betting and all our oldest markets still growing too. But iGaming, as we've noted in the past, we believe has roughly 2 times the TAM on a per capita basis as online sports betting. So a tremendous opportunity and I do think you'll start to see more momentum in the states in the coming years. It's just as we thought in the beginning, sports is kind of leading the charge. But I definitely feel like that's an under talked about opportunity, and I'm glad that you're bringing it up and something that we -- much like the sports market feel we're very well positioned in having the number one position in the market at this point. And then as far as the question on streaming and the app, it's something we did look at and continue to look. I mean, one of the exciting parts of where we're at right now as a company, and as an industry is that there's still so much innovation out there, and there's so many things that we can do to create value for the customer and for the business. And we had a really full product road map going into NFL, didn't end up prioritizing that one, but it's something we continue to evaluate. Like I said, I think the fact that there\u2019s things that people feel are value creating out there that we probably would agree our value creating out there that still didn\u2019t make the cut because we have so many other really exciting things that we believe are adding value and generating the results that we\u2019ve generated. It\u2019s just really special time right now in the evolution of the market to be at, where there\u2019s so much great opportunity and so much innovation. And I think this is a great example of just this long product road map we have of things that we know and have confidence will deliver value. And it\u2019s just a matter of time before we can get to it all.\nRobert Fishman: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nBarry Jonas: Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you maybe talk about your expectations for the next wave of state to legalize OSB and where you could get access? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yeah. Great question. It's hard to say. Obviously, if you look at the map, a lot of the biggest states outside of the top three have already legalized. Obviously, Georgia is still one that's in that top 10 that has had some momentum in the last couple of years and hopefully, we get some traction there this year. Obviously, the big prizes of California, Texas and Florida are still out there, but those might be a little longer path with Texas not meeting again until '25 and Florida and California requiring ballot initiatives. So those are really kind of the big speeds in terms of population left out there. And I would say probably the clearest path now of them is in Georgia, but still really hard to say what the timing and likelihood of that is. And then more on the midsized states, we had good traction and progress in Minnesota last year. I think that could be one that's in play. Missouri, I think there continues to be a lot of interesting routes. There's some complications there too, but I think there's potential for that one. And then like every year, there's always some states that we didn't anticipate going into the legislative session and all of a sudden, there's some momentum around. And we usually figure that out either towards the end of the year, early next year as people are starting to think about introducing bills in the upcoming sessions, many of which start in Q1. So we'll know a lot more in the next three or four months, but definitely I think we'll get some more states this year, and those are a handful of the ones we have our eye on.\nBarry Jonas: Great. And then just for a follow-up, with ESPN bet coming online mid-football season, do you expect some trialing from your user base? And is this at all reflected in your guidance explicitly? Thanks.\nJason Robins: We've seen so many waves of competition now, and we really always had a highly competitive market. It's not like we haven't had a fierce competition pretty much from the start. So we always expect that there will be competitors that will come and try to give our customers an experience and we have to just give them a better experience. And certainly, there are people that will go take promos and that will happen. But in the end, we believe that most customers will gravitate to the best product, the best experience. So we\u2019re going to stay disciplined, and I think it will probably play out in a very similar fashion to other times. But we\u2019ve contemplated all sorts of scenarios in our guidance. That\u2019s why it\u2019s guidance with a range. We definitely have thought through what we think the competitive environment and different flavors of that could look like. And we feel that based on now, we\u2019ve been through this a few times, not only do we have experience managing it. We also have a lot of data. So we feel pretty confident that our guidance range is going to encompass any variety of scenarios that could possibly emerge on the competitive front.\nBarry Jonas: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. I have two questions. One is kind of a follow-up to the topic just prior. It sounded like you were saying your forward guidance is based on kind of flat market share with where you are at a given point. And I guess I'm just wondering to what degree you might have factored in that there were some competitors that either close up shop or sort of temporarily but would be coming back. And so is there a factor in there when you think about market share next year compared to this quarter or are you thinking that that's -- share this quarter was not impacted didn't benefit from that at all? And then my other question is, it's just -- I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of any difference in consumer behavior between an OSB customer and an iGaming customer? Could -- we can see a cumulative aggregate revenues by state, but you would see kind of what's happening on a per person basis, just thinking about like any consumer behavior there, more strength or impact from consumer concerns right now and one versus the other? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Great question. I mean on the first question, probably the best way to think about it is the guidance kind of is implicitly just due to the methodology going to gravitate towards a flattish share. And it wouldn't necessarily be like a flat share to the moment, right? Because we're looking at historical cohorts and seasonal data. So it really would encompass more of a steady-state share over a recent period of time than like a point in time like this month share type of thing. So that's how I would think about it. And then as I noted, I think really the range itself contemplates a variety of different scenarios and competitive impacts, including any impacts that we might see to share to customer behavior. But really based on historical data, we feel like we have all those scenarios properly encapsulated in the guidance range. So that's really how I think about it. And then really, I think there's also an element of just us having confidence that our customers in our cohorts have been sticky through multiple waves of competition. And flat share to me would be a disappointment. We've been gaining share. I expect us that our team is going to be dissatisfied if we don't continue to gain share. That doesn't mean that we're necessarily going to guide to that. Obviously, as I noted, we're not. But in some ways, you might think of flat share is actually a disappointment in some kind of impact that we weren't anticipating in that sense. But I think for us, really, the goal is always to continue to gain share. And I think it's just a matter of how we forecast and the guidance methodology that we choose that you end up with the sort of flattish share implicit assumption in there. And I'm sorry, what was your -- the second question was on iGaming and OSB customers, I think?\nRobin Farley: Kind of the consumer behavior, if one or the other is looking a little bit different in the last few months?\nJason Robins: Yeah. The key difference between the iGaming and OSB customers, really the OSB customer is very seasonal and event driven. There are certainly people that bet on sports throughout the year. But the fact of the matter is that the sport calendar changes throughout the year. So you're just going to have more betting in times of heavy sport like right now versus debt of summer or something like that. iGaming is kind of there and it's the same all the time. So while certainly, we have overall activity differences because more customers on the platform for sport mean more cross-sell into iGaming. On the individual customer basis, their behavior isn\u2019t going to change a whole lot throughout the year. There\u2019s some seasonality to it, but people tend to during holiday times, have more downtime and things like that, but it\u2019s much more \u2013 much less pronounced than the OSB customer, much more steady throughout the year.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nBernard McTernan: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Revenue growth has just been really explosive over the last couple of years, but the guidance for '24 has the year-over-year growth stepping down. What are some of the tailwinds that have been supporting the revenue growth slowing as we move from '23 to '24?\nJason Robins: Yeah. I think it's really just the size of the base increasing. I mean if you look at the absolute revenue growth, it's actually close to $1 billion in our guide for next year. So very healthy growth, just certainly, as the base gets bigger, that percentage is going to be harder to keep in the 50, 60 plus range. So I think that's really the big thing. Obviously, there's an effect on new states that can either increase or if there's a lack of new states to decrease that. So that\u2019s something, as you think about long-term TAM always to keep an eye on. But I think really what we\u2019re seeing next year because we still do see very healthy growth across all of our state cohorts. It\u2019s just a matter of we\u2019re coming off of a very large base of revenue. And adding $1 billion of revenue doesn\u2019t give the same percentage or nearly $1 billion, I should say, doesn\u2019t give the same percentage increase as it did in the past.\nBernard McTernan: Understood. Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandt Montour: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So just one on iGaming, another quarter of sequential market share growth there. I'm curious if you call out sort of your OSB share, OSB momentum cross-sell as the main driver of that sequential share lift, how much growth in comparison to that, are you getting from penetration in the Golden side and sort of getting more of those older customers, those slots customers and growth from that angle. And if you saw any benefit in the quarter from disruption at a certain competitor that had a headline stuff in the news.\nJason Robins: Yeah. So I think really, the iGaming business, I mentioned a few questions ago, I think is under talked about. It's just such a strong business, steady growth. And we just continue to be able to cross-sell better and acquire more efficiently as we get more data and test more things. So I think there's a ton of upside as you see more states legalize iGaming there. We don't have to reacquire a lot of the customers because such a large percentage of our share does come from cross-sell. The other thing I\u2019d note that we got a little bit of boost on is we launched Golden Nugget in Pennsylvania. That was the first state, that Golden Nugget is actually on the DraftKings platform. So \u2013 very excited about that. We saw some really strong early results there and continue to feel really positive on the trajectory there. And then we do expect to see more benefit from continuing to migrate Golden Nugget in other states. Pennsylvania was a new launch. We actually haven\u2019t migrated any states yet. That\u2019s all on the docket over the next couple of quarters, we\u2019re going to migrate pretty much \u2013 we\u2019re going to migrate every state for Golden Nugget online gaming. So really, I think that\u2019s something that also contributed to a little bit of the share increase, and hopefully, there\u2019s some more juice in that as we migrate these other states and continue to optimize the iGaming.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Clark Lampen with BTIG. Your line is open.\nWilliam Lampen: Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the question. I actually wanted to follow up on some of the comments that were just made around Golden Nugget. I know you launched the stand-alone app in Pennsylvania. In fact, kind of as you were saying, that means [indiscernible] migration is done or at least most of the heavy lifting is behind us. if I heard right, it also sounds like with direct cost guidance next year, that there really isn't much in terms of savings contemplated. Could you remind us, I guess, as you're moving the legacy product onto the Golden Nugget stack. Is this something that's really going to benefit share? Are there other efficiencies that accrue to you guys, I guess, from move on to that stack or is it mainly I guess, sort of the share and then exploring, I guess, sort of first-party versus third-party product mix opportunities? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yeah. So it's a great question. We actually will get cost of goods sold synergy. There's some timing things with contracts that have certain time frames that affect the timing of when those synergies will actually fully materialize. And what we determined is they're not very material to next year, but they are there, and we do expect to see some impact on the cost savings side. And then as you also alluded to, I think there's some upside on the revenue and share side as well given that we have pretty consistent data showing that our product and our platform converts new customers better, monetizes existing customers better, retains better. So really feel like there's some upside there as well. And Golden Nugget one, the same kind of story. We haven't built in a massive share increase or anything there. So it will be interesting to see what we can do with that brand. Obviously, we have high hopes and are very excited about the migration coming up. And hopefully, there's some upside in that for us. And it's certainly been a contributor. I mean, as I noted, we did gain share on the DraftKings brand, too. But when you combine the two brands, we're almost a 30% share now in iGaming, which is if you think about where we thought we could cap out a year or two ago was lower than that. So we're pretty bullish on the iGaming opportunity and feel like lots of exciting potential tailwinds in the 2024 product road map there.\nWilliam Lampen: Does it enable you guys to be a little bit more aggressive, I guess, with first-party products next year also or should we think about, I guess, sort of the same relative mix that we saw sort of this year and in the past?\nJason Robins: I mean, certainly, as the iGaming business grows and you can amortize those investments over a much larger revenue base, it's going to make more and more sense to invest in first-party products and bringing more and more things in-house, even on some of these tail games and things like long tail games, I should say, and things like that. So iGaming is such that we\u2019ll always have third-party partners. There\u2019s just certain content, whether it\u2019s IP that we don\u2019t have the rights to or otherwise that you want that others have. But I think as we continue to be able to build that base and have a larger revenue base to amortize our product investments over it\u2019s going to make more and more sense to try to bring some of the longer tail games in-house. And of course, we\u2019re always and that hasn\u2019t changed and won\u2019t change trying to innovate and come up with new games that are differentiated and gain market share and also we\u2019ll have the effect of, of course, cannibalizing third-party games as well. So that\u2019s always something we\u2019re doing. But I do think that as we increase the size of it, there will be just an economic argument that emerges on some of the longer tail games that doesn\u2019t exist today.\nWilliam Lampen: Yeah. Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Graham of Canaccord. Your line is open.\nMichael Graham: Thank you. I want to follow up on the product development topic for a minute. You had such a great pace of innovation over the last couple of years. Like can that accelerate over the next couple? And related to that, one of the things we've seen historically from the great big tech giants, I'm thinking like Netflix, Google, Facebook, they've been able to institutionalize an engineering-led product development ethos that has really enabled them to kind of extend leadership over time. I'm just wondering how prominent that is in your strategic thinking?\nJason Robins: I mean, that is absolutely essential on our strategic thinking. We've said pretty much from day 1 that product wins, and that is, first and foremost, the thing that we feel like has to be at the absolute forefront of the industry in order to be the best. Obviously, there are a lot of other things that go into customer experience, marketing, analytics, many other elements of the business are important, and we invest across those two. But really the heart and soul of the organization is product and technology. And I think you're absolutely right that that's something that we really feel like over the last several years has been a differentiator, really from day 1 has been a differentiator for us. And as far as the first part of your question, the pace of innovation, I actually expect it to increase. A lot of the work that we had to do once we had acquired our own technology platform and then some of the cleanup afterwards, that was really ongoing until late into 2021. So it's really been less than two years that we've kind of had just full runway. Not to mention the fact that there\u2019s many other infrastructure investments that we had to make over time that now positioned us to just more rapidly innovate. So we\u2019re always balancing whether it\u2019s implementation of AI to improve developer efficiency on our PAM, we\u2019re building out an API-driven structure so that teams outside of the PAM team can unlock different features in there and integrate products in a better way. We\u2019re always trying to think about not only how do we innovate for the customer, but also velocity and pace of innovation. How do we make our teams more efficient, how do we make them quicker. And some of that as you said, is cultural for sure. But there is also an infrastructure investment piece of just making it easier. And as it gets \u2013 the organization gets larger or more jurisdictions, the natural tendency is for it to get more complex. So there\u2019s just a constant, I think, push on our end to not accept that and to try to drive more efficiency so that we can innovate at a faster velocity.\nMichael Graham: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nJed Kelly: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to hold, as you engage more customers playing more sports, layer on more parlay products, does that reduce the volatility around your ability to forecast hold? Like does it become more consistent? And then just in -- just with the 4Q guidance, does that assume that the percentages you saw in the whole percentage in October, do you expect that to continue for November and December? Thank you.\nJason Robins: So on the first question, I think really, just as we get more data in, as the market matures, everything, whether it's hold rate or any other metric of the business, the forecasting gets tighter and tighter, which is great. I do think we're already pretty tight on full forecast in terms of expected hold. There's just sport outcome. And as far as your question on mix and how it affects it, really, as time goes on, having more variety, meaning more sports, more different types of bets will certainly make it more steady. So as live betting grows, as more sports get adoption, all of that, it's exactly what you think like the more concentrated in one type of bet or one sport, anything is the more susceptible you are to sport outcome effect. So as time goes on and as the base matures and as more people play more things and try more products, we do expect that volatility to decrease. And also, as we see more iGaming, I think same thing, more iGaming states will also smooth it out because the whole rate does not vary as much on iGaming based on any sort of outcome-driven event. So that's a couple of ways to think about it. As far as the Q4 guide, we\u2019ve assumed structural hold. The same \u2013 we did see some favorable sport outcomes kind of the opposite of Q3 in October. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say the exact hold in October is what we expected in the remainder of the year, but we believe that structural hold will be in line, and we sort of always take an outcome agnostic approach when we\u2019re forecasting but then appropriately build into our guidance range, all sorts of different scenarios that might occur.\nJed Kelly: Thanks. Great quarter.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open.\nRyan Sigdahl: Hey. Good morning. DraftKings hasn't participated directly via its DFS business. But any thoughts on Michigan, New York, Florida, all cracking down on [indiscernible] and player props via DFS and some of your competition there? And secondly to that, could that potentially be good for your sports betting OSB player prop business in New York and Michigan?\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's a good question. I definitely think that cracking down on the legal market is a good thing for us. And the AGA, I believe, I hope I don't mess this number up, said that just in legal betting states alone, there's about $4 billion right now of revenue leakage that's happening into the illegal market. So it's a real issue and probably costing states close to $1 billion in tax revenues at this point. So definitely a big deal and something that we're happy to see states doing. But we haven't really thought about any direct impacts on the business. It's not something we contemplate in our guidance and I think depending on the situation, there could be a potential for some of that revenue to leak into the illegal market to come back into the legal market. And if that happens, we certainly hope that we get our fair share of it.\nRyan Sigdahl: Impressive performance guys. Good luck.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jordan Bender with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nJordan Bender: Great. Good morning. From the market share gains in recent quarters, I was wondering if you guys had a sense of how much of that is true player conversion coming from other apps versus finding new players in existing space versus even hold rates pushing a GGR share and just overall growing the market? Thank you.\nJason Robins: I think it's a combination of multiple things. I mean, internally, we see all of our metrics going in the right direction. Retention rates are up, hold rates up, promotional reinvestment rate across OSB and iGaming is down. All of that independent of any sort of competitor of wallet dynamics, all of that is true. So just sort of based on that math, yes, that certainly led to a reasonable amount of the share increase. It's really hard to say how much of it is that, how much of its new players coming into the market and us disproportionately acquiring those players relative to competition and then retaining those players better relative to competition versus truly stealing players from competitors. We don't really know. We certainly know that amongst some players that they have tried multiple apps. And we think they're getting them to decide that we're the best and where the place they want to concentrate their play is an advantage, but it's hard to say historically how much of share gain has been driven by one factor or another.\nJordan Bender: Great. And then for my follow-up, Jason Park, I believe you said you're assuming next year 5% legalization that's legalized not launched yet. Is that to say you guys are moving away from assuming incremental legalization within your revenue guidance?\nJason Park: That's correct. Our revenue guidance includes assumed launches of states that in total represent 5% of the population.\nJordan Bender: Thank you very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Glagola with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nStephen Glagola: Thanks for the questions. DraftKings took pretty significant OSB share in New Jersey in Q3, and the state license, I think, got to like almost 49%. Can you just provide some more color on what's driving that, what you're doing with the VIP activity there? If you can quantify on the revenue upside for the quarter, how much was driven by New Jersey? And then do you expect this market share to be maintained in Q4 and 2024? Thank you.\nJason Robins: Very good question. New Jersey has been a real great story for us. It was our first state. It continues to be one of our largest states. But early on, we got off to a hot start and then we, candidly, in our first state had a weaker product at that point, and we lost a lot of share to the competition and ended up dropping down quite a bit relative to where we are today. And I think the team is really focused on building out that great experience, driven by a great product, and we're winning across segments from the most casual the VIP in New Jersey. All of our segments are performing well. Customer acquisition continues to be very strong in New Jersey, whoever thought that once New York and Connecticut and everywhere else in Pennsylvania launch that New Jersey would not have any growth anymore, I was wrong, continue to see quite a bit of customer acquisition and growth in New Jersey and iGaming has been around for like a decade there and continues to grow at a steady clip. So I think when you kind of put all that together, New Jersey has obviously always been a big focal point for us, and we knew that there was a lot of opportunity to recapture there given that it was our first state, and we've made so many enhancements to our products in some of the early days. And we're very grateful that many customers have given us a shot and have seen a lot of the product and experience improvements that we've made.\nStephen Glagola: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Understanding that the focus remains in North America, given some settling out in some international markets, given regulation changes. Has anything changed just in terms of the risk reward kind of looking outside of North America given where your product is right now and where the balance sheet is?\nJason Robins: We obviously are aware of the global gaming market. And I think long term, there's a lot of upside for us there. We believe that the product and technology investments and other operational infrastructure, marketing infrastructure we're building will be very portable throughout the globe. That said, we also understand that the largest market in the world is developing right now, and we're in a really strong position. And a lot of what we feel has helped us and benefited us has been our singular focus here. So that's something that we're very cognizant of. And as we think about longer-term opportunities, it's really important that we always keep that in mind and continue to make sure that the focus is here. And if we can figure out over time a way to find other ways to capitalize on the global opportunity, we will. But certainly would never do so at the expense of our focus in the U.S., which obviously we think is just the tremendous opportunity in front of us. And as I said, I think a lot of what's benefited us is having that focus, and we don't want to give that up easily.\nChad Beynon: Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE. Your line is open.\nJohn DeCree: Good morning, everyone. I'll cover a lot of ground. Maybe just one question on -- maybe some insights in the consumer behavior from where you guys sit. I don't know if you -- could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing as states mature versus new states that launch at the customer evolves in terms of average bet or average deposit size? Are those kind of metrics that you look at? And how have they been trending? I guess, with the notion that new states you're penetrating quicker, the reaching contribution quicker? Are they just starting at a more sophisticated or more mature point than older vintages? So kind of a broad question, but curious if you can talk about any of those trends.\nJason Robins: Yes. It's a really fascinating question, and there's a lot of different data insight that can be gathered from looking at all the different states. It's an interesting one. So -- if I kind of -- to more stay at a high level to answer your question, as you noted, the penetration rate has definitely increased penetration to the adult population in terms of how fast that's happening. As a result, you might imagine, we're acquiring a larger base of customers going deeper, therefore, also means that we're not just acquiring some of the same types of customers we acquired very early in other markets. We're also acquiring some of the customers that we acquired later in other markets. But overall, it's still that initial cohort is incredibly valuable. And we've really seen most of that show up in increased CAC efficiency just because such a large influx of new customers has really brought the CAC down for us in a lot of the new states in the early days. So that's something we're definitely seeing. And as far as the other dynamics go, there's also improvements in things that we've made to the product and the way that we do CRM, they have affected things. So we're seeing customers in new states come in generally with a higher starting parlay mix because it's easier to kind of get people accustomed to coming in on some of these new products we've launched versus older states, getting people to retrain behaviors to try different products when they're used to using the product in a certain way. And I think that has the opposite effect. It increases the immediate monetization and things like that. So A lot of moving levers there. But overall, I think you're kind of seeing those two high-level factors impact things. The product improvements and CRM improvements we made are increasing some of the metrics coming out of the gates. But you\u2019re also just seeing so much faster ramp in the population penetration that we\u2019re capturing, more casual customers with some of the more die hard customers in there in that early phase as well. Both of them are, I think, overall, resulting in a net very positive impact for us. We\u2019re seeing great CACs relative to where we saw in the early days of launching new states, and the LTVs continue to be incredibly strong from those early cohorts.\nJohn DeCree: Understood. Thanks, Jason. I appreciate the additional color.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jason Robins for any closing remarks.\nJason Robins: Thank you all for joining us on today's call. Really excited about 2023, shaping up to be an excellent year for DraftKings. So proud of the team for our Q3 results and looking forward to close the year with bang. And really equally, if not more, excited about 2024 and beyond, lots of great things ahead on the product side and also very excited to be having a very meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA year for the first time. So lots of good milestones ahead. We're excited about the opportunity, and we look forward to sharing additional insights at our Investor Day on November 14. I hope everybody has a great rest of the next couple of weeks. We'll see you again on November 14. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you all for joining. The first three quarters of 2023 have been outstanding for DraftKings. We have made thoughtful investments in our product throughout the year and are winning with our customers, and our team executed tremendously around the start of NFL and college football season. Importantly, we remain focused on our core value drivers, acquiring customers efficiently, retaining and monetizing our existing customers, entering new jurisdictions and building an efficient and scaled organization. I'm pleased to share that this strong execution and focus resulted in another excellent quarter. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded our expectations and our momentum continued into the fourth quarter with the start of the basketball and hockey seasons. We are raising our expectations for fiscal year 2023 and introducing initial guidance for fiscal year 2024. In 2024, we expect revenue of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion and positive adjusted EBITDA of $350 million to $450 million. We also expect to generate meaningfully positive free cash flow in fiscal year 2024. As we look back on the third quarter in 2023, here are our key takeaways. First, we are winning. Our revenue in the quarter increased 57% year-over-year, and we achieved number one combined OSB and iGaming gross gaming revenue share in the U.S. We've efficiently added over 1,000 basis points of combined OSB and iGaming shares since the second quarter of 2022, which we are very proud of. Second, our investments in product and technology are paying off. We have created what we believe is the strongest product in the industry and are seeing overall engagement on our app and structural hold percentage continue to increase. Importantly, we have a clear road map to extend our product advantage over the coming years. Third, our older states are generating significant contribution profit, and newer states are generating positive contribution profit faster than previous states. Fourth, we expect attractive adjusted EBITDA flow through percentage on incremental revenue as we believe our organization is largely at scale and therefore, has a long runway of margin improvement. Finally, the best is yet to come. We are excited for the future and look forward to presenting our latest views on the U.S. opportunity, sources of competitive differentiation, core business drivers, including additional details on unit economics and our multiyear financial outlook at our Investor Day on November 14. With that, I will turn it over to Jason Park. Thanks, Shaun. So you're correct that we do expect to further decline in external marketing next year, and that is inclusive of potential launches in North Carolina as well as some other states. So all specifically the states that have legalized not any new states we're predicting legalization. And I think the biggest reason why is that as our existing states mature, we see less and less external marketing spend there. We are still continuing to acquire customers even in our old estate vintages. So we do still have marketing spend allocated to those. But it's certainly not nearly at the same level as in the first year, two, three of the state. So as states mature, that comes down. And so just generally, as the business is maturing, we're seeing that happen, which is what we expected, of course, if we see some very significant new states come online next year, that could change. But right now based on the kind of launch that we expect to launch, we're forecasting an external marketing decline next year. Yeah. It's a great question. We actually are going to dive into that very specific topic in much more granular detail at our Investor Day on the 14th. So I very much look forward to sharing detail there. And I think the way you could think about it is, if you look at sort of the relative population sizes of the different vintages and then think about the maturity curve, obviously, the older states are still growing. So on a per capita basis, they will be larger. And then if you kind of think about how big each vintage is based on the percentage of population, and then also think about the mix of whether it's just OSB or OSB and iGaming, that will give you a picture of how much. But we actually are going to go into a much more specific detail on this on the 14th. And I was very certainly warm by my IR team not to run the front run in the Investor Day. So it won't \u2013 but it's a great question and look forward to sharing more with you in a couple of weeks. We continue -- excuse me, it's a great question. We continue to expect to see a decline in promotions. I know that there are a couple of states that report them that different data can be extrapolated, but it's always tricky to kind of look at a couple of seats. We actually saw a decline year-over-year in promotion rate for our overall OSB and iGaming business in Q3. Obviously, as you know, we saw a gross margin increase of about 300 bps year-over-year. Next year, we forecasted a 200 bps to 300 bps gross margin increase, and that's mostly from promotional decline. There's a little bit of hold rate increase in there too. But definitely, we'll stay disciplined. We've seen multiple waves of competition. Last time we saw a huge wave of competition. We stayed disciplined. We didn't increase our promotion rate and I don't think we expect to do that this time. So we certainly contemplated a variety of different scenarios in our guidance. And at this point, I think we have a decent amount of experience and historical data on different types of competition that might emerge. But I think the important thing for us is just to continue what we've done all along, which is to stay disciplined to focus on bringing down promotion rate through optimization. And then just naturally, I think continuing to see the user base matures and so much of that promotion goes to new customers. And I think if we continue to do that and execute well, the trends that we've been seeing for the last seven, eight quarters will continue. Yeah. It's a great question. I mean what we've always sort of typically guided the same way, which is we look at historical cohorts and data, project forward based on that. So implicitly, that generally implies a flat share. And I think a lot of why we outperformed this year by such a significant margin was just our share increase. So certainly not banking on that for next year. We're confident that we have some opportunity there, and we believe that we can. But as far as what's embedded in the guidance, our methodology hasn't changed. We look at historical cohorts, which kind of implicitly implies flat share and any projection going forward. Yeah. And I think as Jason mentioned, definitely the largest driver of gross margin improvement is continued just maturity of the base, which brings promotion rate down. But certainly, in addition to some negotiations, we also just have existing contracts with volume thresholds that we expect over time trip that will bring gross margins down. That's one of the benefits of having scale. I think it's ongoing, really. I mean, at a certain point, you cap out, but I would imagine that Google gets better rates on vendors for things than we do. So I think just as you get bigger, you continue to be able to get leverage in those areas because you can afford to pay more even if it's less on a percentage revenue basis. And that's generally how all these things work is that as volume goes up, the rate comes down and -- so yeah, I do think it's just kind of an ongoing thing. We have a team that focuses on this pretty much all year around and is continually looking for ways to optimize the COGS structure. Yeah. It's a great question. And it's something we've actually been spending increasing time going through looking at all different options, including organic investments we can make opportunities for capital structure optimization, buybacks, looking at just basically how do we deliver the maximum value over the long term to shareholders. So that is a great question. It's something that we feel fortunate that we now really are in a position to have real value creation from optimally making those decisions to now. We've been, as you said, focused on getting to this point. But definitely feel very good about our trajectory on the cash flow side. And we'll have more to say as we think it through, but definitely a great question and something that we're actively discussing here. So great questions. On the hold side, we forecasted basically that we continue on the same level of structural hold rate we're on today. Obviously, there's some opportunities, we think, to potentially increase that. But right now, that's what we have line of sight to. So that's what we put in. And I'm sorry, what was the second question? Yeah. It's another great question. I mean we haven't found a ceiling yet in the older states. We continue to acquire customers. Even in a state like New Jersey, which is our first state that we launched and obviously is bordering a lot of other states that have since launch, we continue to have healthy customer acquisition. So hard to say where the ceiling is. We're well into the double-digits in terms of adult population penetration in some of our older states. So I think it really has a lot to do with how we continue to evolve the product. If we continue to make the product more appealing to a wider audience and continue to find ways to innovate to reach more customers than \u2013 I think it can continue to go up over a long period of time. But certainly, at this point, we have not found the ceiling yet. Thank you. Yeah. I mean I think this is something that we'll just always continue to be analyzing and optimizing. And it's almost a tricky question to think about in that sense because it really depends on where you're getting hold increase from. If you continue to create products that the customer wants and they have demand that have higher hold, then that can do a great job, I think, of continuing to raise your hold and I think on the other side of it, if you're raising hold by either forcing people into things that they really don't want or making your pricing worse than the market. I think that's obviously potentially going to have a negative impact on LTV. So we're very focused on the customer and on creating \u2013 we think \u2013 and we've seen this with a number of products we've created from SGP to cash out. We have a new one that we're going to be talking about at our Investor Day that we're launching, which I love that, I'm really excited about that kind of fits this double objective of being great for the customer and holding better than the average. So I think we have a long runway on that front. And it's really about focusing on the customer and maximizing the LTV. So in the end, if we do see that anything, whether it's sort of just the concept that holds higher or a particular product or anything that we've introduced is having an adverse effect on LTVs. And obviously, we'll try to turn the dials accordingly. But that's really what the team is focused on. Hold is obviously a variable promotions are variable, but retention is the most important variable. So very much focused across all value creation drivers across the LTV spectrum. And I think that hold is something that, again, it's a little tricky because it depends on how you're doing it, but I do think there's a lot more room for upside there than not. So great questions. On the first one, I mean, iGaming is probably the one piece of our business I'd point to that's under talked about, namely because we're only in 11% of the population now. 87% is still not legalized. Huge opportunity there. Obviously, still tremendous opportunity with a little bit around half of the U.S. population, not having legal sports betting and all our oldest markets still growing too. But iGaming, as we've noted in the past, we believe has roughly 2 times the TAM on a per capita basis as online sports betting. So a tremendous opportunity and I do think you'll start to see more momentum in the states in the coming years. It's just as we thought in the beginning, sports is kind of leading the charge. But I definitely feel like that's an under talked about opportunity, and I'm glad that you're bringing it up and something that we -- much like the sports market feel we're very well positioned in having the number one position in the market at this point. And then as far as the question on streaming and the app, it's something we did look at and continue to look. I mean, one of the exciting parts of where we're at right now as a company, and as an industry is that there's still so much innovation out there, and there's so many things that we can do to create value for the customer and for the business. And we had a really full product road map going into NFL, didn't end up prioritizing that one, but it's something we continue to evaluate. Like I said, I think the fact that there's things that people feel are value creating out there that we probably would agree our value creating out there that still didn't make the cut because we have so many other really exciting things that we believe are adding value and generating the results that we've generated. It's just really special time right now in the evolution of the market to be at, where there's so much great opportunity and so much innovation. And I think this is a great example of just this long product road map we have of things that we know and have confidence will deliver value. And it's just a matter of time before we can get to it all. Yeah. Great question. It's hard to say. Obviously, if you look at the map, a lot of the biggest states outside of the top three have already legalized. Obviously, Georgia is still one that's in that top 10 that has had some momentum in the last couple of years and hopefully, we get some traction there this year. Obviously, the big prizes of California, Texas and Florida are still out there, but those might be a little longer path with Texas not meeting again until '25 and Florida and California requiring ballot initiatives. So those are really kind of the big speeds in terms of population left out there. And I would say probably the clearest path now of them is in Georgia, but still really hard to say what the timing and likelihood of that is. And then more on the midsized states, we had good traction and progress in Minnesota last year. I think that could be one that's in play. Missouri, I think there continues to be a lot of interesting routes. There's some complications there too, but I think there's potential for that one. And then like every year, there's always some states that we didn't anticipate going into the legislative session and all of a sudden, there's some momentum around. And we usually figure that out either towards the end of the year, early next year as people are starting to think about introducing bills in the upcoming sessions, many of which start in Q1. So we'll know a lot more in the next three or four months, but definitely I think we'll get some more states this year, and those are a handful of the ones we have our eye on. We've seen so many waves of competition now, and we really always had a highly competitive market. It's not like we haven't had a fierce competition pretty much from the start. So we always expect that there will be competitors that will come and try to give our customers an experience and we have to just give them a better experience. And certainly, there are people that will go take promos and that will happen. But in the end, we believe that most customers will gravitate to the best product, the best experience. So we're going to stay disciplined, and I think it will probably play out in a very similar fashion to other times. But we've contemplated all sorts of scenarios in our guidance. That's why it's guidance with a range. We definitely have thought through what we think the competitive environment and different flavors of that could look like. And we feel that based on now, we've been through this a few times, not only do we have experience managing it. We also have a lot of data. So we feel pretty confident that our guidance range is going to encompass any variety of scenarios that could possibly emerge on the competitive front. Great question. I mean on the first question, probably the best way to think about it is the guidance kind of is implicitly just due to the methodology going to gravitate towards a flattish share. And it wouldn't necessarily be like a flat share to the moment, right? Because we're looking at historical cohorts and seasonal data. So it really would encompass more of a steady-state share over a recent period of time than like a point in time like this month share type of thing. So that's how I would think about it. And then as I noted, I think really the range itself contemplates a variety of different scenarios and competitive impacts, including any impacts that we might see to share to customer behavior. But really based on historical data, we feel like we have all those scenarios properly encapsulated in the guidance range. So that's really how I think about it. And then really, I think there's also an element of just us having confidence that our customers in our cohorts have been sticky through multiple waves of competition. And flat share to me would be a disappointment. We've been gaining share. I expect us that our team is going to be dissatisfied if we don't continue to gain share. That doesn't mean that we're necessarily going to guide to that. Obviously, as I noted, we're not. But in some ways, you might think of flat share is actually a disappointment in some kind of impact that we weren't anticipating in that sense. But I think for us, really, the goal is always to continue to gain share. And I think it's just a matter of how we forecast and the guidance methodology that we choose that you end up with the sort of flattish share implicit assumption in there. And I'm sorry, what was your -- the second question was on iGaming and OSB customers, I think? Yeah. The key difference between the iGaming and OSB customers, really the OSB customer is very seasonal and event driven. There are certainly people that bet on sports throughout the year. But the fact of the matter is that the sport calendar changes throughout the year. So you're just going to have more betting in times of heavy sport like right now versus debt of summer or something like that. iGaming is kind of there and it's the same all the time. So while certainly, we have overall activity differences because more customers on the platform for sport mean more cross-sell into iGaming. On the individual customer basis, their behavior isn't going to change a whole lot throughout the year. There's some seasonality to it, but people tend to during holiday times, have more downtime and things like that, but it's much more \u2013 much less pronounced than the OSB customer, much more steady throughout the year. Yeah. I think it's really just the size of the base increasing. I mean if you look at the absolute revenue growth, it's actually close to $1 billion in our guide for next year. So very healthy growth, just certainly, as the base gets bigger, that percentage is going to be harder to keep in the 50, 60 plus range. So I think that's really the big thing. Obviously, there's an effect on new states that can either increase or if there's a lack of new states to decrease that. So that's something, as you think about long-term TAM always to keep an eye on. But I think really what we're seeing next year because we still do see very healthy growth across all of our state cohorts. It's just a matter of we're coming off of a very large base of revenue. And adding $1 billion of revenue doesn't give the same percentage or nearly $1 billion, I should say, doesn't give the same percentage increase as it did in the past. Yeah. So I think really, the iGaming business, I mentioned a few questions ago, I think is under talked about. It's just such a strong business, steady growth. And we just continue to be able to cross-sell better and acquire more efficiently as we get more data and test more things. So I think there's a ton of upside as you see more states legalize iGaming there. We don't have to reacquire a lot of the customers because such a large percentage of our share does come from cross-sell. The other thing I'd note that we got a little bit of boost on is we launched Golden Nugget in Pennsylvania. That was the first state, that Golden Nugget is actually on the DraftKings platform. So \u2013 very excited about that. We saw some really strong early results there and continue to feel really positive on the trajectory there. And then we do expect to see more benefit from continuing to migrate Golden Nugget in other states. Pennsylvania was a new launch. We actually haven't migrated any states yet. That's all on the docket over the next couple of quarters, we're going to migrate pretty much \u2013 we're going to migrate every state for Golden Nugget online gaming. So really, I think that's something that also contributed to a little bit of the share increase, and hopefully, there's some more juice in that as we migrate these other states and continue to optimize the iGaming. Yeah. So it's a great question. We actually will get cost of goods sold synergy. There's some timing things with contracts that have certain time frames that affect the timing of when those synergies will actually fully materialize. And what we determined is they're not very material to next year, but they are there, and we do expect to see some impact on the cost savings side. And then as you also alluded to, I think there's some upside on the revenue and share side as well given that we have pretty consistent data showing that our product and our platform converts new customers better, monetizes existing customers better, retains better. So really feel like there's some upside there as well. And Golden Nugget one, the same kind of story. We haven't built in a massive share increase or anything there. So it will be interesting to see what we can do with that brand. Obviously, we have high hopes and are very excited about the migration coming up. And hopefully, there's some upside in that for us. And it's certainly been a contributor. I mean, as I noted, we did gain share on the DraftKings brand, too. But when you combine the two brands, we're almost a 30% share now in iGaming, which is if you think about where we thought we could cap out a year or two ago was lower than that. So we're pretty bullish on the iGaming opportunity and feel like lots of exciting potential tailwinds in the 2024 product road map there. I mean, certainly, as the iGaming business grows and you can amortize those investments over a much larger revenue base, it's going to make more and more sense to invest in first-party products and bringing more and more things in-house, even on some of these tail games and things like long tail games, I should say, and things like that. So iGaming is such that we'll always have third-party partners. There's just certain content, whether it's IP that we don't have the rights to or otherwise that you want that others have. But I think as we continue to be able to build that base and have a larger revenue base to amortize our product investments over it's going to make more and more sense to try to bring some of the longer tail games in-house. And of course, we're always and that hasn't changed and won't change trying to innovate and come up with new games that are differentiated and gain market share and also we'll have the effect of, of course, cannibalizing third-party games as well. So that's always something we're doing. But I do think that as we increase the size of it, there will be just an economic argument that emerges on some of the longer tail games that doesn't exist today. I mean, that is absolutely essential on our strategic thinking. We've said pretty much from day 1 that product wins, and that is, first and foremost, the thing that we feel like has to be at the absolute forefront of the industry in order to be the best. Obviously, there are a lot of other things that go into customer experience, marketing, analytics, many other elements of the business are important, and we invest across those two. But really the heart and soul of the organization is product and technology. And I think you're absolutely right that that's something that we really feel like over the last several years has been a differentiator, really from day 1 has been a differentiator for us. And as far as the first part of your question, the pace of innovation, I actually expect it to increase. A lot of the work that we had to do once we had acquired our own technology platform and then some of the cleanup afterwards, that was really ongoing until late into 2021. So it's really been less than two years that we've kind of had just full runway. Not to mention the fact that there's many other infrastructure investments that we had to make over time that now positioned us to just more rapidly innovate. So we're always balancing whether it's implementation of AI to improve developer efficiency on our PAM, we're building out an API-driven structure so that teams outside of the PAM team can unlock different features in there and integrate products in a better way. We're always trying to think about not only how do we innovate for the customer, but also velocity and pace of innovation. How do we make our teams more efficient, how do we make them quicker. And some of that as you said, is cultural for sure. But there is also an infrastructure investment piece of just making it easier. And as it gets \u2013 the organization gets larger or more jurisdictions, the natural tendency is for it to get more complex. So there's just a constant, I think, push on our end to not accept that and to try to drive more efficiency so that we can innovate at a faster velocity. So on the first question, I think really, just as we get more data in, as the market matures, everything, whether it's hold rate or any other metric of the business, the forecasting gets tighter and tighter, which is great. I do think we're already pretty tight on full forecast in terms of expected hold. There's just sport outcome. And as far as your question on mix and how it affects it, really, as time goes on, having more variety, meaning more sports, more different types of bets will certainly make it more steady. So as live betting grows, as more sports get adoption, all of that, it's exactly what you think like the more concentrated in one type of bet or one sport, anything is the more susceptible you are to sport outcome effect. So as time goes on and as the base matures and as more people play more things and try more products, we do expect that volatility to decrease. And also, as we see more iGaming, I think same thing, more iGaming states will also smooth it out because the whole rate does not vary as much on iGaming based on any sort of outcome-driven event. So that's a couple of ways to think about it. As far as the Q4 guide, we've assumed structural hold. The same \u2013 we did see some favorable sport outcomes kind of the opposite of Q3 in October. So I wouldn't necessarily say the exact hold in October is what we expected in the remainder of the year, but we believe that structural hold will be in line, and we sort of always take an outcome agnostic approach when we're forecasting but then appropriately build into our guidance range, all sorts of different scenarios that might occur. Thank you. Yeah. It's a good question. I definitely think that cracking down on the legal market is a good thing for us. And the AGA, I believe, I hope I don't mess this number up, said that just in legal betting states alone, there's about $4 billion right now of revenue leakage that's happening into the illegal market. So it's a real issue and probably costing states close to $1 billion in tax revenues at this point. So definitely a big deal and something that we're happy to see states doing. But we haven't really thought about any direct impacts on the business. It's not something we contemplate in our guidance and I think depending on the situation, there could be a potential for some of that revenue to leak into the illegal market to come back into the legal market. And if that happens, we certainly hope that we get our fair share of it. Thank you. I think it's a combination of multiple things. I mean, internally, we see all of our metrics going in the right direction. Retention rates are up, hold rates up, promotional reinvestment rate across OSB and iGaming is down. All of that independent of any sort of competitor of wallet dynamics, all of that is true. So just sort of based on that math, yes, that certainly led to a reasonable amount of the share increase. It's really hard to say how much of it is that, how much of its new players coming into the market and us disproportionately acquiring those players relative to competition and then retaining those players better relative to competition versus truly stealing players from competitors. We don't really know. We certainly know that amongst some players that they have tried multiple apps. And we think they're getting them to decide that we're the best and where the place they want to concentrate their play is an advantage, but it's hard to say historically how much of share gain has been driven by one factor or another. Very good question. New Jersey has been a real great story for us. It was our first state. It continues to be one of our largest states. But early on, we got off to a hot start and then we, candidly, in our first state had a weaker product at that point, and we lost a lot of share to the competition and ended up dropping down quite a bit relative to where we are today. And I think the team is really focused on building out that great experience, driven by a great product, and we're winning across segments from the most casual the VIP in New Jersey. All of our segments are performing well. Customer acquisition continues to be very strong in New Jersey, whoever thought that once New York and Connecticut and everywhere else in Pennsylvania launch that New Jersey would not have any growth anymore, I was wrong, continue to see quite a bit of customer acquisition and growth in New Jersey and iGaming has been around for like a decade there and continues to grow at a steady clip. So I think when you kind of put all that together, New Jersey has obviously always been a big focal point for us, and we knew that there was a lot of opportunity to recapture there given that it was our first state, and we've made so many enhancements to our products in some of the early days. And we're very grateful that many customers have given us a shot and have seen a lot of the product and experience improvements that we've made. We obviously are aware of the global gaming market. And I think long term, there's a lot of upside for us there. We believe that the product and technology investments and other operational infrastructure, marketing infrastructure we're building will be very portable throughout the globe. That said, we also understand that the largest market in the world is developing right now, and we're in a really strong position. And a lot of what we feel has helped us and benefited us has been our singular focus here. So that's something that we're very cognizant of. And as we think about longer-term opportunities, it's really important that we always keep that in mind and continue to make sure that the focus is here. And if we can figure out over time a way to find other ways to capitalize on the global opportunity, we will. But certainly would never do so at the expense of our focus in the U.S., which obviously we think is just the tremendous opportunity in front of us. And as I said, I think a lot of what's benefited us is having that focus, and we don't want to give that up easily. Yes. It's a really fascinating question, and there's a lot of different data insight that can be gathered from looking at all the different states. It's an interesting one. So -- if I kind of -- to more stay at a high level to answer your question, as you noted, the penetration rate has definitely increased penetration to the adult population in terms of how fast that's happening. As a result, you might imagine, we're acquiring a larger base of customers going deeper, therefore, also means that we're not just acquiring some of the same types of customers we acquired very early in other markets. We're also acquiring some of the customers that we acquired later in other markets. But overall, it's still that initial cohort is incredibly valuable. And we've really seen most of that show up in increased CAC efficiency just because such a large influx of new customers has really brought the CAC down for us in a lot of the new states in the early days. So that's something we're definitely seeing. And as far as the other dynamics go, there's also improvements in things that we've made to the product and the way that we do CRM, they have affected things. So we're seeing customers in new states come in generally with a higher starting parlay mix because it's easier to kind of get people accustomed to coming in on some of these new products we've launched versus older states, getting people to retrain behaviors to try different products when they're used to using the product in a certain way. And I think that has the opposite effect. It increases the immediate monetization and things like that. So A lot of moving levers there. But overall, I think you're kind of seeing those two high-level factors impact things. The product improvements and CRM improvements we made are increasing some of the metrics coming out of the gates. But you're also just seeing so much faster ramp in the population penetration that we're capturing, more casual customers with some of the more die hard customers in there in that early phase as well. Both of them are, I think, overall, resulting in a net very positive impact for us. We're seeing great CACs relative to where we saw in the early days of launching new states, and the LTVs continue to be incredibly strong from those early cohorts. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. Really excited about 2023, shaping up to be an excellent year for DraftKings. So proud of the team for our Q3 results and looking forward to close the year with bang. And really equally, if not more, excited about 2024 and beyond, lots of great things ahead on the product side and also very excited to be having a very meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA year for the first time. So lots of good milestones ahead. We're excited about the opportunity, and we look forward to sharing additional insights at our Investor Day on November 14. I hope everybody has a great rest of the next couple of weeks. We'll see you again on November 14. Thanks."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. I'll hit the highlights, including our very strong third quarter performance, increased 2023 guidance and our initial expectations for 2024. Please note that all income statement measures discussed except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, the organization is executing very well, and that is showing up in our results. We achieved $790 million of revenue in the quarter, which is 57% higher than our third quarter 2022 revenue, and our adjusted EBITDA of negative $153 million improved by $111 million on a year-over-year basis. Customer retention and engagement far exceeded our expectations as customers enjoyed our live same game parlay offering as well as our live and player prop markets. MLB was a bright spot throughout the third quarter and we successfully transitioned many of those customers into the football season. Customer acquisition was also healthy and exceeded expectations. For example, we have already acquired more than 5% of the adult population in Kentucky following the launch of our Sportsbook product in that state on September 28. Structural hold was above 9.5% during the quarter and well ahead of expectations as we continue to improve our parlay mix and optimize our trading capabilities. Our actual Sportsbook hold percentage was approximately 9%, inclusive of customer-friendly sport outcomes, primarily in college football and the NFL. Promotional reinvestment as a percentage of GGR outperformed our expectations due to stronger than anticipated retention of existing customers, which resulted in a slightly higher mix of existing customers versus new customers. Promotions as a percentage of GGR continue to improve on a year-over-year basis for our OSB and iGaming states. Our adjusted gross margin was in line with expectations and increased almost 300 basis points year-over-year. Strong handle growth combined with improving structural sportsbook hold rate and better promotional reinvestment for OSB & iGaming contributed to higher adjusted gross margin. External marketing and fixed expenses were consistent with our plans as we executed our football season kickoff and continue to exert discipline against our compensation expenses and vendor-related costs. We're very pleased with our results in our more mature OSB and iGaming state. In the states that launched from 2018 through 2021, we continue to drive very strong handle and revenue growth year-over-year with a corresponding improvement in adjusted gross margin rate, while our external marketing costs decreased at a double-digit rate. Our strong third quarter results and our visibility into continued improvement have enabled us to significantly raise our expectations for 2023 revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We are improving our full year 2023 revenue guidance range to $3.67 billion to $3.72 billion or by $195 million at the midpoint. We are also improving our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to negative $95 million to negative $115 million or by $100 million at the midpoint. The bridge from the 2023 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance that we shared in August to our 2023 guidance as of today include stronger customer retention, acquisition and engagement and structural sportsbook hold improvement, partially offset by customer-friendly sport outcomes in the third quarter and our expected launch in May. You can see the details of the bridge in the earnings presentation we posted to our website. In terms of our full year, we are increasing our 2023 adjusted gross margin rate guidance to 43.5% to 45%. We now expect contribution profit, which we define as adjusted gross profit less external marketing to approach $800 million in fiscal year 2023. We continue to expect fixed cost to grow less than 10% and external marketing to be consistent with prior guidance even when including our investment in May. With regard to our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and now plan to end the year with more than $1.2 billion of cash. As a reminder, we expect approximately $120 million of capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs for fiscal year 2023, and changes in net working capital to be a modest source of cash. We expect this level of CapEx to continue in 2024. Moving on to our full year 2024 guidance. We are poised for a rapid increase in adjusted EBITDA due to continued strong revenue growth, coupled with a scaled fixed cost structure. For 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion or nearly $1 billion of incremental revenue growth compared to the midpoint of our fiscal 2023 revenue guidance and more than double our revenue from 2022. Our guidance range for 2024 adjusted EBITDA is $350 million to $450 million, which equates to more than $500 million of year-over-year growth compared to the midpoint of our fiscal year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance and more than $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA improvement since 2022. Our guidance range for 2024 includes investments to launch approximately 5% of the adult population. In addition, based on the midpoints of our fiscal year 2023 and 2024 guidance ranges, we expect year-over-year adjusted EBITDA flow-through percentage up 53%, which we look forward to delivery. In sum, we had an excellent third quarter and are very excited about the trajectory of our business. We look forward to sharing more details at our upcoming Investor Day. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions. Hey, Carlos. It's Jason Park. Yeah. So great question on the flow-through, and I'll start sort of on the bottom end of the income statement, and Jason had already alluded to improving or declining external marketing costs within the 2024 time period. And what I'd also add is, we're going to -- we've had a great 18 months of just exerting excellent discipline on our fixed costs. We'll continue to do that. Then into the cost of goods sold part, we guided to a 200 basis point to 300 basis point improvement in gross margin rate primarily as the promo reinvestment continues to improve and we do. We do have multiple initiatives throughout the cost of goods sold structure, whether those primarily around vendor related negotiations and continuing to achieve scale through volume discounts. And those are embedded within our gross margin rate guidance as well, and I think provide a long runway of continued improvement, both at the gross margin level and the EBITDA margin line. That's correct. Our revenue guidance includes assumed launches of states that in total represent 5% of the population."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the DraftKings Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Stanton Dodge, Chief Legal Officer. Sir, please go ahead.\nStanton Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed further in our SEC filings that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements other than as required by law. During this call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings presentation, which can be found on our website and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business; and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials and we will then open the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning. Thank you all for joining. I'm excited to be with you today to talk about our outstanding second quarter and significantly improved outlook for fiscal year 2023. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded expectations in the second quarter and importantly, we generated significant positive adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter revenue increased 88% year-over-year to $875 million. Our revenue growth trajectory has been very strong due to our continued focus on enhancing our products and improving our customer experience, which is driving excellent retention and rapidly improving monetization. At the same time, we remain relentlessly focused on efficiency and our mantra of revenue growth and cost efficiency is now a core tenant (ph) of the organization. As a result of our strong revenue growth and ongoing efforts to capture efficiencies, we delivered $73 million of positive adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance to a range of $3.46 billion to $3.54 billion, implying growth of 56% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance includes our expectation of nearly $1.2 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. We are also improving our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of negative $190 million to negative $220 million, an improvement of 35% at the midpoint versus our May full year guidance. Our fiscal year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance includes our expectation of $150 million to $175 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of this year. Turning to our OSB product. We have continued to focus on powering our own same game parlays and differentiating our live betting content. We now have live same game parlays built in-house for most of the major sports, including NFL, NBA, MLB, college football and college basketball and added to our live markets for golf, tennis, and MLB. We are improving our product to have very fast philosophy with very high quality. In iGaming, we're executing our two brand strategy while focusing on differentiating through more in-house content, including live dealer and jackpot offerings. Our persistent focus on product differentiation is already apparent in share trends. In the states, where we are currently live, we achieved OSB handle share of 35% and OSB GGR share of 32% in the quarter, which were the highest they have been since the COVID impacted second quarter of 2020. We also maintained number one iGaming GGR position and set an all-time record for our iGaming GGR share at 27%. Looking ahead, we are very excited for football season. Our entire organization is dialed in and ready for the start of NFL and NCAA football. I am proud of the team and the culture we have put in place. In particular, I am proud of our team for their relentless focus on efficiency and expense management over the past 12 months. Our work of achieving and is not done and we feel great about the trajectory of the business. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jason Park.\nJason Park: Thank you, Jason. I'll hit on the highlights, including our Q2 performance and our improved 2023 guidance. Please note that all income statement measures discussed except for revenue are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, the organization is executing very well, and that is showing up in our results. We achieved $875 million of revenue in the quarter, which is 88% higher than our second quarter 2022 revenue and our adjusted EBITDA of positive $73 million significantly outperformed our expectations and improved by nearly $200 million on a year-over-year basis. Customer retention and engagement outperformed expectations as we successfully transition customers from the NBA season into MLB. We have seen significantly better than expected engagement on MLB due to our enhanced product. Structural hold was also above expectations at approximately 9% for the quarter, while promotional intensity improved together supporting a more than 550 basis point year-over-year improvement in our adjusted gross margin rate to 47%. Fixed expenses were slightly better than expected as we managed vendor related costs and exerted discipline on our compensation expense. We were particularly pleased with the results in our more mature online sports book in iGaming states. In our states that launch from 2018 through 2021, combined handle growth accelerated quarter-over-quarter and increased more than 35% compared to the same period in 2022. In these states, revenue increased more than 70% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin rate increased more than 800 basis points and external marketing declined more than 10% while total unique customers increased approximately 25%. These strong results and our visibility its continued improvement have enabled us to raise our full year 2023 revenue guidance range to $3.46 billion to $3.540 billion from $3.135 billion to $3.235 billion or by $315 million at the midpoint. We are also improving our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to negative $190 million to negative $220 million from negative $290 million to negative $340 million or by $110 million at the midpoint. The bridge from our May full year 2023 guidance to our current full year 2023 guidance includes increases due to stronger customer retention, acquisition and engagement, structural sports book hold improvement and favorable sport outcomes in the second quarter, these items are partially offset by Kentucky now launching this year and being included in our forecast and Ohio\u2019s tax rate increasing effective July 1. Customer retention, acquisition, and engagement are exceeding expectation and account for $225 million of the revenue improvement and $100 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. Our structural sports book hold percentage forecast is also higher, supported by our introduction of in-house same game parlay capabilities and new live betting markets. This trend accounts for $40 million of the revenue improvement and $30 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. Favorable sport outcomes in the second quarter contributed $30 million to the revenue improvement and $20 million to the adjusted EBITDA improvement. We are very excited that Kentucky\u2019s Horse Racing Commission recently set a target launch date of September 28, 2023 for online sports betting, which is sooner than we previously anticipated. As a result, we expect $20 million of additional revenue in 2023 and a headwind of $30 million to 2023 adjusted EBITDA. Last, we expect Ohio's increased tax rate from 10% to 20%, which went into effect July 1, to result in $10 million of additional costs this year. In terms of our full year 2023 adjusted gross margin percentage, we now expect to be in the 43% to 45% range, an improvement from our previous guidance of 42% to 45%. We expect contribution profit, which we define as adjusted gross profit less external marketing to grow to approximately $700 million in fiscal year 2023, which includes our investment into Kentucky. With regard to our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and now plan to end the year with more than $1 billion. As a reminder, we expect approximately $120 million of capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs for fiscal year 2023 and change in net working capital to be slightly positive for the year. In sum, we had a strong second quarter and are very excited for the upcoming football season. That concludes our remarks. We will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking my questions. Jason or Jason, maybe just to start off, obviously, dramatic market share gains. And I think a lot of this comes back to just truly core product improvement. So I was wondering, if you could give us just a little bit of color on what you think the big success stories have been over the last three, six, nine months on the product side? And then maybe to put it in quantification terms, what would it take to narrow the gap between your OSB handle share that you outlined at 35% and the OSB GGR share at 32%. Is that a realistic goal?\nJason Robins: Thank you, Shaun. So first on the question around product, it's been a lot of things. I think It's a very complicated product and there's a lot of things that can create customer friction, if you're not careful. And, I think really a big focus for us over the last year and a half has been removing customer friction throughout the journeys, so that's been a big deal. We've obviously greatly enhanced our same game parlay offering that's been a huge part of the story over the last six months to eight months. And I think our live betting options have gotten better as well. I can objectively say, I think in H2, we feel we're going to have the best product in the market. So really excited about that. And I think that's the big difference maker as you noted. As far as hold rate goes, we're continually working to improve that. We've obviously closed the gap quite a bit between handle share and GGR share, and I have no reason to believe that we can't continue to do that.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Stephen Grambling of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling: Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to change over to marketing and costs. It looks like in the back half, the assumption is for effectively, I think, very much lower growth. So it seems like you're continuing to be focused on reducing costs. Are there still big contracts out that could be up for renegotiation or that, we could be considering as we look into the second half or into next year as we look at the guidance or beyond?\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, we always are reevaluating every time we have a deal come up, whether it makes sense to continue and at what price, and that's a continual thing. So we're going to continue just over the course of our lifetime to see optimization there. I think same thing across the board with marketing, with promotion, And I do think there's opportunity also if we can gain more market share to generate better top line as well. So those are really the core areas of focus for the company. I think on the corporate cost side, we really -- there's probably a little bits here and there. We\u2019ve really spent so much effort on that for the last year and a half or so that I think the low hanging fruit there has been picked. But certainly the intent is to have significantly slower fixed cost growth next year and I do think there's some room to optimize some of the levers that I mentioned.\nStephen Grambling: Jason, as a quick clarification or any of the bigger kind of national marketing contracts, embedded in the guidance in terms of cost reductions or those still kind of outstanding?\nJason Robins: No, we don't have any cost reductions embedded in the guidance from any of that.\nStephen Grambling: Great. Thank you so much.\nJason Robins: Certainly, as I mentioned, always look at when things come up, but we're at this point not building any favorable renegotiations into the guidance.\nStephen Grambling: Makes sense. Thank you.\nJason Robins: Thanks. And Stephen, as you know, our approach to guidance in general has been, we're going to bake what we know. If we have lots of things that we're working on, some of them may come through, some of them may not. So we don't kind of forecast like a probability adjusted number. We really bake what we know. And then we look at anything like you're describing as well as potentially any additional market share gains or anything else that might drive top line. We look at that as upside.\nJason Park: I would add Stephen that these types of team and league deals are a much smaller percentage of our total marketing expense than some of the other operators in the industry. And as a general philosophy, we have implemented more short duration deals to give us a chance to evaluate actual performance, more frequently.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from David Katz of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So in the comments, you talked about backward-looking friction removal as a product focus. Can you just talk a bit more about how that focus looks going forward and what the to-do list is to sort of keep your product on a winning track?\nJason Robins: It's a great question. I mean, I think that this is an area that there's still a lot left to do. It's true of any product in the digital space that there's always going to be room to optimize your funnels and improve the experience, but particularly in regulated gaming, where there's a lot of requirements that you have to follow. And there's a lot of states that launch very quickly. So the focus for us has been on how do we get live and make sure that we're complying with all relevant laws and regulations. I think as you then kind of say, okay, let's take a look at along the way. What has that done that might have created bad experiences for customers. Flags that go off that were missed fires or things that were actually correct, but don't really properly give the customer a path to resolving them even this better explanation. I think there's so much there. And for us, it's really about the customer experience. We look at the product and we say, if you're a customer, what elements of it would be frustrating, what elements of it would make you feel like I'm just going to go try somewhere else. And we try to improve that the best we can, obviously, making sure that we continue to follow all compliant -- stay compliant with all regulations and laws in every jurisdiction that we operate. But I think there's a lot there and just will continually be because of the sort of nature of the regulated gaming industry. And I think particularly now given how many states launched now quickly, there's just a lot of low-hanging fruit still there along that front.\nDavid Katz: Understood. And as my follow-up, I do have to ask, periodically, there's a lot of discussion and I think it's been obviously ramping up M&A. What are the boundaries and what thoughts might you be able to share in terms of what you might want for or need to keep the momentum going?\nJason Robins: I know there's a lot of chatter about M&A. At this point, we're about -- I mean, we had a great quarter. We're really excited about that, but we're kind of on to this quarter. It's about to be the most important time of year seasonally for us. We have fall coming up with the NFL and call it football calendar MBA. Lots of things happening this fall. So this is the most important time of the year. This is when we acquired the most customers, when we have the biggest opportunity to gain more market share to where we generate the most revenue, we'll generate the most EBITDA. I think this is so important a moment for DraftKings that we team laser focused on executing and everybody\u2019s really dialed in now. We have a lot of exciting stuff coming for NFL and college football and basketball and hockey and everything else, and we\u2019re pretty excited about that. And listen, there\u2019s always talk of things happening in the background and we have small teams that make sure they\u2019re aware of what\u2019s going on. But as a company, we\u2019re very, very focused on executing and winning in the U.S.\nDavid Katz: Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about percent of players that migrate from the OSB side to the iGaming side and how that's kind of changed from before Golden Nugget till now?\nJason Robins: Hi, Robin. Thank you. So it's been pretty consistent actually around 50% in states that have both products tend to cross over. That hasn't really changed with Golden Nugget because golden nugget is such a smaller piece of the pie. It's less than 5% of our revenue. So that doesn't really move the overall needle. We do see Golden Nugget is certainly more dominant casino brand. So the crossover is a little bit less there. But it doesn't really move the needle on the overall business. The overall business stay pretty consistent in the 50%-ish range.\nRobin Farley: Okay. And do you expect that to change when you talk about migrating in the next couple of months to the DraftKings tax stack or not necessarily, it sounds like?\nJason Robins: I don't think so, at least not in the short term because it's such a small piece of the revenue. But certainly, we hope that, that's a brand that grows and becomes bigger and bigger, and it could potentially impact long term. But I don't think we expect an immediate change when we migrate. I think, if anything, the focus will be on continuing to build out the casino audience and the CRM and cross-sell multi-brand strategy within casino. But as time goes on, I think that we\u2019ll have to see how the brand is growing and developing and if it can become more of a sports brand than it is today. But I think as of now, we think of it as more of a casino brand.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question will come from Joe Stauff of SIG. Your line is open.\nJoseph Stauff: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I was curious I guess just in terms of understanding maybe the speed of adoption, especially looking at newer states, you've reached about 7% adult -- penetration of the adults in the newer states. And I'm wondering how you think about maybe that continuum in terms of the level of penetration that we have in some of your older estates, call it, New Jersey or whatever? And then the second question I had was whether it be the number or the percentage of jurisdictions you operate in that are now contribution positive? Hello\nOperator: Pardon me.\nStanton Dodge: Yes. We are back.\nJoseph Stauff: All right. I'll ask the questions, I guess. Again, I was curious if the speed of adoption especially as we think about maybe the new estates, you've reached about 7% penetration there. And just wondering how quickly now -- do we think about that continuum reaching penetration of some of your older states, whether it be New Jersey or so? And then the second question was really about the percentage or the number of jurisdictions that you operate in where your contribution positive now?\nStanton Dodge: Yes. We are back.\nJoseph Stauff: Back again.\nJason Robins: Yeah. This should be hopefully better. So you're asking about the penetration of new state [indiscernible] I apologize. I missed the last part of the question.\nJoseph Stauff: Yeah. No problem. Just trying to understand the new states, right, you've reached about 7% penetration or so in the newer states and wondering how quickly you think that adoption rate will get to levels in those newer states that you have in New Jersey or so?\nJason Robins: It's hard to say. I mean still very new. I think we're continuing to see good acquisition in those new states. And then we're going to know a lot more in a couple of months after NFL starts that -- this will be the first time, for example, in Massachusetts that there's NFL betting available online. So one would expect you'll see another wave of customer acquisition, but we'll know more how things are tracking in the next couple of months and we'll certainly be able to update you on the next earnings call.\nJason Park: And I'd add, Joe, [Technical Difficulty] older vintage states, we continue to see really healthy acquisition. We're obviously bringing marketing spend down in those older states to match the level of acquisition and achieve appropriate CAC. But we haven't really found a dealing in even our most mature states.\nJoseph Stauff: Interesting. And one follow-up, if I could. Are you willing to maybe share with us maybe the percentage of jurisdictions or the number where your contribution positive?\nJason Robins: Yeah. We'll definitely be talking more about that this fall on our Q4 earnings call and at the Q3 earnings call in November and in our Investor Day. So I don't want to run the team on that one, but we have a [indiscernible].\nJoseph Stauff: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Dan Politzer of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDaniel Politzer: Hey. Good morning, everyone. First one specific question and maybe one more high level. Just in terms of the quarter, [indiscernible] was 10%. I think adjusting for the favorable sport out comes around 9%. Can you maybe give us just some more detail there in terms of [indiscernible] and late count? And then in terms of how you're thinking about this over time, I think your largest competitor has called out a goal of 12%, so it feels like you're closing that gap pretty quickly. How do you think about this evolving over time? And maybe any guidepost for how you think about this year versus next year?\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's a great question on ceiling (ph). I think we're still trying to figure out what we think the right level and appropriate level to get to is, and we'll continue to follow the data. I don't feel like we have enough yet to say that we have target there other than I think there is still room to increase. And we thus far have seen really no material impact to handle -- so definitely room to go up. And parlay mix was actually right on expectation for us this quarter. There\u2019s definitely some upside, I think, in average like count with the rollout of our new bet slip that will be powered by our in-house SGP models. I think that will improve the leg adding experience in the UI, and that should hopefully increase average like count this fall. But as far as Q2 goes, we were really at where we expected.\nOperator: One moment, please. Speakers are you able to hear us?\nDaniel Politzer: Yeah. Could I just squeeze in one more for my follow-up.\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] Actually, one moment, please, sir. Mr. Robin, Mr. Park, are you able to hear us? Just one moment -- just having a technical difficulty. Please stay on your lines. [Technical Difficulty]. Mr. Robin, Mr. Park, are you able to hear us?\nJason Robins: Yes. Hi.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you.\nDaniel Politzer: Yes. Can I just squeeze in one quick follow-up.\nJason Robins: Yeah. Sure.\nDaniel Politzer: Okay. Yeah. Just looking out the next few years, maybe more long term. As you think about seasonality involving, do you envision a scenario where you could be EBITDA positive in all four quarters? Are you going to always kind of have this big jump just given the start sport season and then maybe the shoulder season.\nJason Robins: No, we definitely expect that as the business inflects towards more permanent profitability there.\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] One moment, please. Speakers will be back on momentarily. [Technical Difficulty] We ask you to please standby. Speakers will be back on momentarily.\nJason Robins: Hello.\nOperator: Yes. We can able to hear you.\nJason Robins: Fine service, I apologize. I don't know if there's a technical issue on the service providers' end, but we've tried several different phones here. I apologize to those the call. Go ahead, please.\nDaniel Politzer: That's all for me.\nJason Robins: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Good morning. You guys previously -- I believe it was back in March of 2022. More or less articulated a longer-term goal with sales and marketing representing about 10% of revenue and promotions -- sorry, 10% of net revenue and promotions about 22% of gross revenue. Given the experience over kind of the last several quarters of reducing promotions, seeing how the customer reacted as well as the experience you've had in your vintage states taking out some of the external marketing. Are those still kind of where you're thinking? And do you believe that -- do you have any sense around the timeline of when you think you can get to those levels?\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] Speakers are you there.\nJason Robins: Hello.\nOperator: It is an sense -- please repeat your question? .\nCarlo Santarelli: Is there a way to fix this issue. It doesn't seem to be on our end.\nOperator: One moment, please. [Technical Difficulty]\nJason Robins: We join as a participant? [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Actually it possible that you can -- maybe you can call in on a different line. Let me give you a moment I'm going to pause the call and I will work something else. Everyone we ask you to please stay on your lines. We'll be resuming the conference shortly. [Technical Difficulty]. And pardon me, we do apologize. I'm afraid that we do have the a little bit, what all has happened. We do have the speakers back -- one moment, Mr. Carlo Santarelli, I\u2019m going to place you back and ask your questions. One moment, please. Carlo Santarelli, are you able to hear us?\nCarlo Santarelli: I could hear you, yes. Thanks.\nOperator: Welcome. If you could please repeat your questions?\nCarlo Santarelli: Is the management team there?\nJason Robins: Yes, we're here.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Well, you guys were gone. I just gave guidance for '24 to the rest of the focus on the call. I hope that's all right.\nJason Robins: Note it down. Thank you.\nCarlo Santarelli: My question related to -- with some of the experiences that you've had now reducing promotions, reducing sales and marketing. I believe back in March of '22, you guided sales and marketing kind of as a longer-term target to be about 10% of revenue with promotions about 22% of GGR. Based on kind of your experience in working those expenses lower. Do you guys feel there's an appropriate time line or do you feel those targets have shifted at all?\nJason Robins: So we'll definitely talk more about this at our upcoming Investor Day in Q4. But I don't think that there's going to be a material change to either of those targets from what we're seeing today. But obviously, over the next few months, we\u2019ll continue to do the work to prepare and we\u2019ll have more to say on that in the fall.\nCarlo Santarelli: All right. Thank you, Jason.\nJason Robins: Thanks, Carlo.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Bernie McTernan of Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nBernard McTernan: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jason, in -- can you just expand on some of the comments in the letter on AI? Should we think about them more as revenue generating opportunities or cost efficiencies and just any specific initiatives or products to point to that are in the works?\nJason Robins: I think it's definitely both. When you can do more for less, that drives both revenue and cost efficiency and so I think that's really the thematic. Obviously, depending on what it is and where in the stage of development, it is that will affect the relative ways that we use it. I think, for example, right now with our developer efficiency initiatives, we're focused on how do we get more done with our development team. So I think that what that probably means is over time, we don't need to add as many engineers to get the work done that we didn't want to do as we continue to scale the business and build out the product and serve the customer. But I do think it's a combination, if you think about it from a P&L standpoint of both cost opportunity and revenue opportunity. None of that is baked into any of our guidance or any of the things we've shared in the past at Investor Day. This is something that we really view is upside. And it's in the category of the long list of things that we're working on that we think could create even better long-term economics for our shareholders.\nBernard McTernan: Is it helping some of the product roadmap that's coming out for this current NFL season or is that too early, and it's more of a '24, '25 event?\nJason Robins: I think the -- there will be some impacts. We've been working on machine learning for a long time and base level AI. I think some of the advances in what third-party tools are out there and available are really hitting inflection point in the last months. And I think that's where really the opportunity lies to take it to the next level. But there's things we've been working on in and around this space for years. So there will be some impact of the machine learning and AI work in the coming season. But I think some of the really big more like things that can kind of fundamentally change the outlook of the business. Those are still on the comp?\nBernard McTernan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nJed Kelly: Hey. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Two, if I may, are you now just seeing structurally lower tax just on getting better amortization from your brand spend. And then can you speak to, I know that the product enhancements, but what is keeping players more engaged outside of football is some of the merchandising you're doing on the front page or products? Just can you talk about the engagement trends you're seeing? Thankyou.\nJason Robins: Yes. So great question. I think on the CAC side, it's a combination of several things. One, certainly, what you're mentioning, this national scale of the brand that we've built and the leverage we're getting out of that. It's also -- this is another area of the business. It's constantly being analyzed and optimized. We have a team of analytics people. We have machine learning and now we're actually starting to implement AI as a means of helping with things like bidding BBC platforms or creation of multiple -- many multiples more of different types of creative that you can test and optimize in the market. So that's just a continual thing that we've been doing, and I think it's going to continue and potentially could be even with some of the AI work that we're exploring into another sort of step function improvement, but it is what you're saying too, absolutely. I think that there's sort of an underlying advantage that we have and that we have a brand, we have national scale. But then we also have a team that's really been honing and optimizing the marketing engine and it's a complicated thing, right? I mean this is very not straightforward analysis. We're at any given point in time during our peak season spending in so many different places with so many different partners so many different creatives in market. So it's really just the opportunity to just continually optimize an engine like that, I think, should be a continual tailwind for us for many years to come.\nJed Kelly: And then on player engagement like [indiscernible] football?\nJason Robins: So I think the big difference this year was the way that we were able to continue to retain NFL players into NBA season and that's continued into baseball season as well. Those have both exceeded our expectations. We also have seen excellent cross-sell into iGaming. Robin was asking about that earlier. That's continued as we -- it's kind of like this halo effect of when you retain better and cross more people into MBA on the sports side, that then has some spillover effect on iGaming because more active players on the OSB platform cross-sell more into more active players on the iGaming products. So that's really, I think, what I would attribute to Q2. If you look at past years, we've typically seen revenue decline Q2 to Q1. We weren't expecting this. I mean, this was the result of a huge market share gain year-over-year. Lots of really just metrics that for last 1.5 years, we've been testing and really just hit a great point where the optimization is really kicking in. And just the culmination of a ton of grid product work. I mean the product is so much better year-over-year from where it was last year. And as I said earlier, I feel like in the back half of the year, we're going to have the best product in the market.\nJason Park: Yes. I think. Look, I think all the work we do in that sport retention or sport to sport cross-sell, however you want to think about it. You got to cross-sell them, but most importantly, the product's got to be great. When you're bringing an NFL player into NBA or an NBA player into MLB, and we're just super proud of how strong both our NBA product and MLB product improved on a year-over-year basis.\nJed Kelly: Thank you. Good quarter.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Michael Graham of Canaccord. Your line is open.\nMichael Graham: Thanks a lot and yeah, awesome quarter, guys. I wanted to ask on the growth outlook for the rest of the year. Can you maybe deconstruct that from the perspective of the vintages of your states, like how much of the growth do you think is going to come from some of your newer states versus more established ones? And related to that, just maybe a layer of depth into how you layered the launch of Kentucky into your outlook for Q3?\nJason Robins: Absolutely. So definitely, the bulk of the growth is going to come from the states that we launched from 2018 through '21. We are starting to get some real good contribution from some of the 22 states as well. But I think the degree to which we are still seeing growth in our older state, it's very significant and they're obviously a bigger piece of the pie. So when you can get that kind of growth in your older states, it makes it a very big impact on the overall business. And then, I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question?\nMichael Graham: Kentucky.\nJason Robins: Kentucky. So Kentucky, I think we had a slide on this, but we're projecting roughly, we're expecting, I should say, $20 million of revenue and $30 million EBITDA loss from Kentucky in fiscal year '23. And I think that assumes a September 28 launch date. Last time, when we guided, we did not actually have a clear launch date for Kentucky and now that we do, we put it into the guidance. And I'll note that despite that not being in our prior guide and now being in our current guide, we still had a massive improvement in the guide. So that shows that not only can we fund new state launches through the results that we're generating in all states and the cost efficiencies we're finding, but we can do that and continue to see upside on top of that, which is a great story, I think, from years past where we always had to kind of increase the loss outlook every time that we\u2019ve had a new state launch.\nMichael Graham: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Brandt Montour of Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandt Montour: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Just one from me. So back to the same game parlay enhancements for the upcoming NFL season, it sounds like you're pretty confident, chasing that parlays the best as you call it, I guess, it sounds like you baked in higher holds for this. It sounds like you baked in higher retention and no share gains, if I'm reading your comments correctly. I guess the question is, are the product enhancements differentiated enough that it could be a driver of market share or is it the kind of thing where you would have to go out and get people to flip from your main competitor to try it? How does the mechanics work of gaining share off something like that?\nJason Robins: I mean, you're right. It's a combination of two things it could be actual wallet that was going to your competitors, customers that were using competitors before or it could simply be just better engagement and monetization of customers on your platform. And I think what we felt like in Q2, it was a combination of both definitely being able to increase whole rate year-over-year, made a big difference in share. But it was a combination of both. We think we got handle share from people that were playing NBA with competitors last year as well. And I think that's really a result of just the product improvement year-over-year. So to answer your question, absolutely, could there be upside? Yes. I mean the goal for the team is to go out and beat anything that we put out there. And I think that we feel like we have quite a few initiatives that could help us gain share and could help us further retain, engage and monetize our users in the back half of the year. We've just consistently take an approach of not putting things that we don't feel we have full line of sight to in the guide, our guide, we consider to be what we commit to. And then we go out and we try to deliver above that by executing better and hopefully, some of the things that you hope come through, but we don't put hope in the guide we put what we know in the guide.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Thanks for the comments. Congrats on the quarter.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Again one moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Stephen Glagola of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nStephen Glagola: Thanks for the question. On the updated implied second half guidance and quarterly cadence versus your prior guide, could you just walk us through your assumptions for the greater implied EBITDA upside to Q3 versus Q4 and particularly in light of the Kentucky launch and favorable sport outcomes in Q3 last year? And then also just what are the hold percentage rates you're assuming for Q3 and Q4? Thank you.\nJason Robins: Thank you. Yeah. So we're assuming a similar hold rate to what we had in the back half of last year. I think for the Q3, Q4 question, Kentucky definitely made a little bit of a difference but the fact that we were able to increase the guide for the back half of the year, increased the Q4 guide, I think really had to do with just the overall performance of the existing states that we're in and of the overall business cost efficiency side. And I think that, that's more than enough to offset the Kentucky EBITDA that we're -- negative EBITDA that we're expecting to generate in the back half of the year. So we're pretty optimistic about a really great second half and I think we'll have to see exactly what ends up happening with states like North Carolina and Vermont. But right now, we feel like Kentucky is going to provide a great opportunity for us to go and invest in acquiring customers and in our existing states. And there's also several new states that haven't had a full NFL season. Massachusetts hasn't had any NFL season, Ohio didn't launch until January last year. So there should be a lot of upside in any customer acquisition numbers in H2 this year.\nStephen Glagola: Hey, Jason. Just one more, if I can. In light of the Ohio move to double its tax rate, could you maybe just discuss the long-term risk to your business and state governments would look to take increase in taxes on gross gaming revenue. And sort of what are the incentives that would keep state governments maintaining lower tax rates? Thank you.\nJason Robins: Yeah. I think it's a great question. Obviously, disappointing to see, but I think most state governments understand that if you start taxing this too high, you kind of defeat the purpose because it makes it really impossible for the legal regulated operators to compete with the illegal offshore operators that are not paying or some of them onshore now. They're not paying taxes that are not following regulations. There is, I think, great awareness of that and state legislatures. So I'm optimistic that states are going to keep taxes at a reasonable level. I think that they understand that they're ultimately going to drive volume back into the illegal market if they try to tax the industry to heavily.\nStephen Glagola: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nRobert Fishman: Hi. Good morning, guys. Two questions on partnership. First, ahead of the NFL kickoff, can you help us understand how the Amazon Thursday night football partnership helps your business last year and whether there are more opportunities to build upon that success this year? And then anything you can share on how the ESPN partnership has been a driver of your strong month growth or overall business? And would you be willing to expand your ESPN partnership depending on which direction Disney ends up going with his strategic review?\nJason Robins: Yeah. So Amazon has been a great partner. Last year, we were really happy with Thursday night football results that was big driver of customer acquisition for us. Those games are also really well built for seeing game parlay offerings to really help drive a lot of parlay mix through better promotion of being game parley on Thursday night. We have a few extra things that we're going to be doing on Amazon this year. I'm pretty excited about that we'll be, I think, coming to everybody in and do order once the season launches. So it really should be a great year with Amazon, and we're really just thrilled with that partnership. And as far as the ESPN goes, same story. We've been really happy with them as a partner. They've been great. We continue to get great value out of that relationship. And we'll have to see. I think, obviously, we saw the same comments everybody else did from Bob Iger and I think it's still fairly early days for them, but I don't want to speak for them. They'll know better than I will, what their plans are. But -- we're always happy with great partners like ESPN, if there's a way to have a deeper relationship that makes sense for both companies and something we would certainly consider. And if it doesn't make sense, and there's something that doesn't really work for us or for them, then we won't. We're perfectly happy with the relationship as it is now. So I think that's how we're thinking about it.\nRobert Fishman: Okay. Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Sigdahl of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open.\nRyan Sigdahl: Good morning, guys. Just one for us. You mentioned MLB has been a positive surprise. There specific product that's resonating better with the player, whether it be live, same game parley, et cetera.?\nJason Robins: Yeah. I think first of all, MLB itself has made some great changes that have helped increase engagement with the stores, so they get the credit for that. But I think betting has helped a lot too. And MLB first of all, is very well built for live betting. So that's been a real product that works very well with that sport and we're excited about the offering we have there this year. Also, the same game parlay product has been significantly enhanced this year. We brought our own models into the fold, and I think really just improved both the UI and the overall offering of same game parlay for MLB, and there's been a number of other things we've done. We've done some work on the cash-out feature. I mean there's a lot of different areas that we've worked on that I think have really helped improve the MLB offering year-over-year and that combined with really strong engagement from a viewership perspective, I think, has driven unexpectedly positive to the upside results for MLB season so far.\nRyan Sigdahl: Thanks, Jason. Nice job guys.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Barry Jonas of Truist. Your line is open.\nBarry Jonas: Hey, guys. You've previously given some advice on how to think about NFL results and corresponding hold. Last year, it correlated maybe a little less, but season went on. Just curious as we head into football season, if there's anything you can give us to help think about sort of that week-to-week success?\nJason Robins: Yeah. I think it's very similar to what we had shared last year that the results can definitely range between negative 10% and probably positive 20% depending on, if you're really taking like that 95% confidence interval, it can get that wide in any given week, obviously, over the course of several weeks, over the course of the season, that\u2019s ban tight, but that's how I would think about kind of a week-to-week thing. And really, it's a result generally in NFL of two things. One, do the favorites win or lose. And second is, how the player props do. And that second part has become increasingly important as the industries evolve because so much betting is now happening on player props and so much time being parlayed, it depends on player props. So that's really made a big difference. I think given Q3 is always one that for our business planning group, it's their least favorite quarter because so much volume comes in the last three weeks of the quarter and not that it's the only thing going on, but like relatively speaking, July and August are slower months. So it's really the last few weeks to get always the NFL volume and a few good or bad weeks can definitely swing the results a little bit. But I think that as we've gotten bigger and our customer base has become more diversified, the effects of that are lower as we've gotten more of a mix of player parlays it's not just straight game outcomes that -- so I think we have to look at this season. I think this year, we might see a little bit tighter band, certainly over 3 weeks, we will. But I think still fair, given what we know today. I think week-to-week about that minus 10% to plus 20% possibility on hold depending on the game outcomes and player part the outcomes.\nBarry Jonas: That's helpful. Just quick follow-up. Wanted to get your thoughts on Florida, given the recent court decision. Do you see a pathway for DraftKings to compete in the state?\nJason Robins: I think too early to tell what the path is, but I'm optimistic there will be a pathway there because I think people in Florida want great products. And so, I do think that it will get figured out. But right now, I think it's really hard to say. There's still going to be a few steps to play out in a few things with court rulings and other things. So it's really at this point, a little bit murky and I think we'll know a lot more in the coming months.\nBarry Jonas: Great. Congrats on the quarter.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Jordan Bender of JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nJordan Bender: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So you gave comments on where your GGR margin could potentially go over time, more of a wait and see. But maybe just on the NGR margin side, that still lags international markets. given the parlay mix, can we maybe exceed 10% to 12% NGR margin that we see in the international market?\nJason Robins: Yeah. I think that at this point, we have no reason to believe that we can't get to the same sort of NGR margins that we see internationally. But obviously, there's still -- it's still early days here. So we see how it plays out. But given the fact that we've, over the last couple of years, continued to optimize the hold rate, continue to optimize the promo mix and we've actually seen better customer engagement, better retention, I'm pretty optimistic and have no reason to believe that we can't reach similar type of numbers that you're talking about that more mature markets across the globe have been able to get to.\nJordan Bender: Great. And then just on the follow-up, you called out [indiscernible] that have legalized but not launched yet. Market that we don't talk about is Nevada. Is there any interest from DraftKings to go into that state at any point in time?\nJason Robins: Yeah. We're definitely interested. I mean, Nevada is obviously an important state for gaming. There's a robust sports betting market there. It is in-person registration. So I would attempt for any expectations for the possible contribution there, but I do think it's an important state because people go there who are our customers and they want to be able to make bets. And so I think being able to give them that option as well as to be able to access the Nevadans that are now betting with others and I think would like to try DraftKings product is definitely something that we're exploring.\nJordan Bender: Great. Nice quarter.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Next question will come from Jeffrey Stantial of Stifel. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Stantial: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our question. Nice quarter. My question is on the continued structural hold rate expansion. It seems that a lot of time has spent talking about the parlays and the impact on mix, but maybe not as much on the optimized trading and risk management improvements you guys have made. Can you just unpack this a bit more for us. I guess, are there specific bet types or sports or you've been getting better at minimizing these trading inefficiencies? And how do you think about further upside here? Are there any comps you would point to or perhaps you're tracking an even better spread between, call it, the underlying VIG and the realized hold rates? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Very good question. I think you're absolutely right that we've talked and everybody has talked a lot about partly mix and average light count and those are certainly very important drivers of whole rate improvement. But there is also -- there are also the other levers that you mentioned. I would say that really across the board, we feel we've improved. In fact, the Q2 outperformance is really more a function of those other things that you mentioned because parley mix, even though its way up year-over-year was kind of on track with our expectations. So it was really the customer risk management, the trading improvement -- we've spent a lot of dev effort on tooling for our traders to make it easier for them to adjust lines, spot soft lines to move them faster and to better optimize them. We've also really significantly invested in our modeling and approach for customer risk management. So I think those are things that are really paying off as well as you look at the hold rate improvement and the outperformance in Q2.\nJeffrey Stantial: Thanks, Jason.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you and one moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of John DeCree of CBRE Securities. Your line is open.\nJohn DeCree: Good morning, Jason, Jason. Thanks for taking all the questions. Maybe one back to the roots on DFS, a much smaller piece of the business now, but I was wondering if you could give us a little insight as to how that business is trending in the context of customer acquisition. So as you enter new states, are you still getting a similar kind of initial cross-sell out of DFS that you did maybe two to three years ago in your older vintage states? And then is DFS still kind of an ongoing tool in those older vintage stage are you still acquiring customers via TFS first?\nJason Robins: Absolutely. I mean DFS actually is at a great year so far, and that's been driven by a lot of improvements we've made across the product. Best fall has seen a big jump year-over-year and that's something that you can sort of use as a little bit of a litmus test for or maybe the advanced test for how NFL season is going to go because a lot of those drafts happen in the July, August time frame, so very exciting year for DFS. We have some really good stuff planned for the back half of the year on that product. And it is continually adding new customers. We have seen really strong crossover continue from DFS when we launch new states. So everything seems to be working on that front and continue to be a big source of engagement for customers and states that don't have sports betting as well as a great funnel for new states that launch.\nJohn DeCree: Thanks. And I think you answered my follow-up in there, but just to ask it explicitly, customers that cross over from DFS to sports and/or iGaming, -- are they still retained as DFS or you're seeing customers play go back and forth still? Or what's the -- what happens when they cross over OSB? Did they kind of reduce their time on DFS or are you still seeing multiproduct use across the customer base?\nJason Robins: Definitely seen multiproduct use. I mean there\u2019s some cannibalization, of course, but it\u2019s not very significant. The products are pretty different. And people like them for different reasons. People also are not spending a ton of money on DFS. So it\u2019s really not like a big wallet thing to \u2013 it\u2019s more of an engagement thing. And they are different products, and I think that they provide different types of experiences for people. So we are seeing a great deal of crossover, but we\u2019re also seeing great retention across all of those products as well. It appears that the cannibalization is fairly minimal. And a lot of it also happens in the initial launch stages. People are very excited about sports betting. They maybe forget about DFS for a little bit, but we\u2019re seeing some of our older state vintages, as time goes on, they come back and some of the cannibalization, even though it wasn\u2019t that significant to begin with, even that small bits of cannibalization, we\u2019re seeing reverse in some of our older states.\nJohn DeCree: Great. I appreciate that, Jason and congratulations on a fantastic quarter.\nJason Robins: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And this will end the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jason Robins for closing remarks.\nJason Robins: Thank you all for joining us on today\u2019s call. We had an excellent first half of 2023. We are laser-focused on the back half and on the fall, and we\u2019re very excited about the rest of the year and beyond. I look forward to speaking with you over the next few weeks and hope you all stay safe and well. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a pleasant day and enjoy your weekend.",

            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you all for joining. I'm excited to be with you today to talk about our outstanding second quarter and significantly improved outlook for fiscal year 2023. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded expectations in the second quarter and importantly, we generated significant positive adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter revenue increased 88% year-over-year to $875 million. Our revenue growth trajectory has been very strong due to our continued focus on enhancing our products and improving our customer experience, which is driving excellent retention and rapidly improving monetization. At the same time, we remain relentlessly focused on efficiency and our mantra of revenue growth and cost efficiency is now a core tenant (ph) of the organization. As a result of our strong revenue growth and ongoing efforts to capture efficiencies, we delivered $73 million of positive adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance to a range of $3.46 billion to $3.54 billion, implying growth of 56% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance includes our expectation of nearly $1.2 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. We are also improving our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of negative $190 million to negative $220 million, an improvement of 35% at the midpoint versus our May full year guidance. Our fiscal year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance includes our expectation of $150 million to $175 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of this year. Turning to our OSB product. We have continued to focus on powering our own same game parlays and differentiating our live betting content. We now have live same game parlays built in-house for most of the major sports, including NFL, NBA, MLB, college football and college basketball and added to our live markets for golf, tennis, and MLB. We are improving our product to have very fast philosophy with very high quality. In iGaming, we're executing our two brand strategy while focusing on differentiating through more in-house content, including live dealer and jackpot offerings. Our persistent focus on product differentiation is already apparent in share trends. In the states, where we are currently live, we achieved OSB handle share of 35% and OSB GGR share of 32% in the quarter, which were the highest they have been since the COVID impacted second quarter of 2020. We also maintained number one iGaming GGR position and set an all-time record for our iGaming GGR share at 27%. Looking ahead, we are very excited for football season. Our entire organization is dialed in and ready for the start of NFL and NCAA football. I am proud of the team and the culture we have put in place. In particular, I am proud of our team for their relentless focus on efficiency and expense management over the past 12 months. Our work of achieving and is not done and we feel great about the trajectory of the business. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason Park. Thank you, Shaun. So first on the question around product, it's been a lot of things. I think It's a very complicated product and there's a lot of things that can create customer friction, if you're not careful. And, I think really a big focus for us over the last year and a half has been removing customer friction throughout the journeys, so that's been a big deal. We've obviously greatly enhanced our same game parlay offering that's been a huge part of the story over the last six months to eight months. And I think our live betting options have gotten better as well. I can objectively say, I think in H2, we feel we're going to have the best product in the market. So really excited about that. And I think that's the big difference maker as you noted. As far as hold rate goes, we're continually working to improve that. We've obviously closed the gap quite a bit between handle share and GGR share, and I have no reason to believe that we can't continue to do that. Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, we always are reevaluating every time we have a deal come up, whether it makes sense to continue and at what price, and that's a continual thing. So we're going to continue just over the course of our lifetime to see optimization there. I think same thing across the board with marketing, with promotion, And I do think there's opportunity also if we can gain more market share to generate better top line as well. So those are really the core areas of focus for the company. I think on the corporate cost side, we really -- there's probably a little bits here and there. We've really spent so much effort on that for the last year and a half or so that I think the low hanging fruit there has been picked. But certainly the intent is to have significantly slower fixed cost growth next year and I do think there's some room to optimize some of the levers that I mentioned. No, we don't have any cost reductions embedded in the guidance from any of that. Certainly, as I mentioned, always look at when things come up, but we're at this point not building any favorable renegotiations into the guidance. Thanks. And Stephen, as you know, our approach to guidance in general has been, we're going to bake what we know. If we have lots of things that we're working on, some of them may come through, some of them may not. So we don't kind of forecast like a probability adjusted number. We really bake what we know. And then we look at anything like you're describing as well as potentially any additional market share gains or anything else that might drive top line. We look at that as upside. It's a great question. I mean, I think that this is an area that there's still a lot left to do. It's true of any product in the digital space that there's always going to be room to optimize your funnels and improve the experience, but particularly in regulated gaming, where there's a lot of requirements that you have to follow. And there's a lot of states that launch very quickly. So the focus for us has been on how do we get live and make sure that we're complying with all relevant laws and regulations. I think as you then kind of say, okay, let's take a look at along the way. What has that done that might have created bad experiences for customers. Flags that go off that were missed fires or things that were actually correct, but don't really properly give the customer a path to resolving them even this better explanation. I think there's so much there. And for us, it's really about the customer experience. We look at the product and we say, if you're a customer, what elements of it would be frustrating, what elements of it would make you feel like I'm just going to go try somewhere else. And we try to improve that the best we can, obviously, making sure that we continue to follow all compliant -- stay compliant with all regulations and laws in every jurisdiction that we operate. But I think there's a lot there and just will continually be because of the sort of nature of the regulated gaming industry. And I think particularly now given how many states launched now quickly, there's just a lot of low-hanging fruit still there along that front. I know there's a lot of chatter about M&A. At this point, we're about -- I mean, we had a great quarter. We're really excited about that, but we're kind of on to this quarter. It's about to be the most important time of year seasonally for us. We have fall coming up with the NFL and call it football calendar MBA. Lots of things happening this fall. So this is the most important time of the year. This is when we acquired the most customers, when we have the biggest opportunity to gain more market share to where we generate the most revenue, we'll generate the most EBITDA. I think this is so important a moment for DraftKings that we team laser focused on executing and everybody's really dialed in now. We have a lot of exciting stuff coming for NFL and college football and basketball and hockey and everything else, and we're pretty excited about that. And listen, there's always talk of things happening in the background and we have small teams that make sure they're aware of what's going on. But as a company, we're very, very focused on executing and winning in the U.S. Thank you. Hi, Robin. Thank you. So it's been pretty consistent actually around 50% in states that have both products tend to cross over. That hasn't really changed with Golden Nugget because golden nugget is such a smaller piece of the pie. It's less than 5% of our revenue. So that doesn't really move the overall needle. We do see Golden Nugget is certainly more dominant casino brand. So the crossover is a little bit less there. But it doesn't really move the needle on the overall business. The overall business stay pretty consistent in the 50%-ish range. I don't think so, at least not in the short term because it's such a small piece of the revenue. But certainly, we hope that, that's a brand that grows and becomes bigger and bigger, and it could potentially impact long term. But I don't think we expect an immediate change when we migrate. I think, if anything, the focus will be on continuing to build out the casino audience and the CRM and cross-sell multi-brand strategy within casino. But as time goes on, I think that we'll have to see how the brand is growing and developing and if it can become more of a sports brand than it is today. But I think as of now, we think of it as more of a casino brand. Yeah. This should be hopefully better. So you're asking about the penetration of new state [indiscernible] I apologize. I missed the last part of the question. It's hard to say. I mean still very new. I think we're continuing to see good acquisition in those new states. And then we're going to know a lot more in a couple of months after NFL starts that -- this will be the first time, for example, in Massachusetts that there's NFL betting available online. So one would expect you'll see another wave of customer acquisition, but we'll know more how things are tracking in the next couple of months and we'll certainly be able to update you on the next earnings call. Yeah. We'll definitely be talking more about that this fall on our Q4 earnings call and at the Q3 earnings call in November and in our Investor Day. So I don't want to run the team on that one, but we have a [indiscernible]. Yeah. It's a great question on ceiling (ph). I think we're still trying to figure out what we think the right level and appropriate level to get to is, and we'll continue to follow the data. I don't feel like we have enough yet to say that we have target there other than I think there is still room to increase. And we thus far have seen really no material impact to handle -- so definitely room to go up. And parlay mix was actually right on expectation for us this quarter. There's definitely some upside, I think, in average like count with the rollout of our new bet slip that will be powered by our in-house SGP models. I think that will improve the leg adding experience in the UI, and that should hopefully increase average like count this fall. But as far as Q2 goes, we were really at where we expected. Yes. Hi. Yeah. Sure. No, we definitely expect that as the business inflects towards more permanent profitability there. Hello. Fine service, I apologize. I don't know if there's a technical issue on the service providers' end, but we've tried several different phones here. I apologize to those the call. Go ahead, please. Okay. Thank you. Hello. We join as a participant? [Technical Difficulty] Yes, we're here. Note it down. Thank you. So we'll definitely talk more about this at our upcoming Investor Day in Q4. But I don't think that there's going to be a material change to either of those targets from what we're seeing today. But obviously, over the next few months, we'll continue to do the work to prepare and we'll have more to say on that in the fall. Thanks, Carlo. I think it's definitely both. When you can do more for less, that drives both revenue and cost efficiency and so I think that's really the thematic. Obviously, depending on what it is and where in the stage of development, it is that will affect the relative ways that we use it. I think, for example, right now with our developer efficiency initiatives, we're focused on how do we get more done with our development team. So I think that what that probably means is over time, we don't need to add as many engineers to get the work done that we didn't want to do as we continue to scale the business and build out the product and serve the customer. But I do think it's a combination, if you think about it from a P&L standpoint of both cost opportunity and revenue opportunity. None of that is baked into any of our guidance or any of the things we've shared in the past at Investor Day. This is something that we really view is upside. And it's in the category of the long list of things that we're working on that we think could create even better long-term economics for our shareholders. I think the -- there will be some impacts. We've been working on machine learning for a long time and base level AI. I think some of the advances in what third-party tools are out there and available are really hitting inflection point in the last months. And I think that's where really the opportunity lies to take it to the next level. But there's things we've been working on in and around this space for years. So there will be some impact of the machine learning and AI work in the coming season. But I think some of the really big more like things that can kind of fundamentally change the outlook of the business. Those are still on the comp? Yes. So great question. I think on the CAC side, it's a combination of several things. One, certainly, what you're mentioning, this national scale of the brand that we've built and the leverage we're getting out of that. It's also -- this is another area of the business. It's constantly being analyzed and optimized. We have a team of analytics people. We have machine learning and now we're actually starting to implement AI as a means of helping with things like bidding BBC platforms or creation of multiple -- many multiples more of different types of creative that you can test and optimize in the market. So that's just a continual thing that we've been doing, and I think it's going to continue and potentially could be even with some of the AI work that we're exploring into another sort of step function improvement, but it is what you're saying too, absolutely. I think that there's sort of an underlying advantage that we have and that we have a brand, we have national scale. But then we also have a team that's really been honing and optimizing the marketing engine and it's a complicated thing, right? I mean this is very not straightforward analysis. We're at any given point in time during our peak season spending in so many different places with so many different partners so many different creatives in market. So it's really just the opportunity to just continually optimize an engine like that, I think, should be a continual tailwind for us for many years to come. So I think the big difference this year was the way that we were able to continue to retain NFL players into NBA season and that's continued into baseball season as well. Those have both exceeded our expectations. We also have seen excellent cross-sell into iGaming. Robin was asking about that earlier. That's continued as we -- it's kind of like this halo effect of when you retain better and cross more people into MBA on the sports side, that then has some spillover effect on iGaming because more active players on the OSB platform cross-sell more into more active players on the iGaming products. So that's really, I think, what I would attribute to Q2. If you look at past years, we've typically seen revenue decline Q2 to Q1. We weren't expecting this. I mean, this was the result of a huge market share gain year-over-year. Lots of really just metrics that for last 1.5 years, we've been testing and really just hit a great point where the optimization is really kicking in. And just the culmination of a ton of grid product work. I mean the product is so much better year-over-year from where it was last year. And as I said earlier, I feel like in the back half of the year, we're going to have the best product in the market. Thank you. Absolutely. So definitely, the bulk of the growth is going to come from the states that we launched from 2018 through '21. We are starting to get some real good contribution from some of the 22 states as well. But I think the degree to which we are still seeing growth in our older state, it's very significant and they're obviously a bigger piece of the pie. So when you can get that kind of growth in your older states, it makes it a very big impact on the overall business. And then, I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question? Kentucky. So Kentucky, I think we had a slide on this, but we're projecting roughly, we're expecting, I should say, $20 million of revenue and $30 million EBITDA loss from Kentucky in fiscal year '23. And I think that assumes a September 28 launch date. Last time, when we guided, we did not actually have a clear launch date for Kentucky and now that we do, we put it into the guidance. And I'll note that despite that not being in our prior guide and now being in our current guide, we still had a massive improvement in the guide. So that shows that not only can we fund new state launches through the results that we're generating in all states and the cost efficiencies we're finding, but we can do that and continue to see upside on top of that, which is a great story, I think, from years past where we always had to kind of increase the loss outlook every time that we've had a new state launch. I mean, you're right. It's a combination of two things it could be actual wallet that was going to your competitors, customers that were using competitors before or it could simply be just better engagement and monetization of customers on your platform. And I think what we felt like in Q2, it was a combination of both definitely being able to increase whole rate year-over-year, made a big difference in share. But it was a combination of both. We think we got handle share from people that were playing NBA with competitors last year as well. And I think that's really a result of just the product improvement year-over-year. So to answer your question, absolutely, could there be upside? Yes. I mean the goal for the team is to go out and beat anything that we put out there. And I think that we feel like we have quite a few initiatives that could help us gain share and could help us further retain, engage and monetize our users in the back half of the year. We've just consistently take an approach of not putting things that we don't feel we have full line of sight to in the guide, our guide, we consider to be what we commit to. And then we go out and we try to deliver above that by executing better and hopefully, some of the things that you hope come through, but we don't put hope in the guide we put what we know in the guide. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. So we're assuming a similar hold rate to what we had in the back half of last year. I think for the Q3, Q4 question, Kentucky definitely made a little bit of a difference but the fact that we were able to increase the guide for the back half of the year, increased the Q4 guide, I think really had to do with just the overall performance of the existing states that we're in and of the overall business cost efficiency side. And I think that, that's more than enough to offset the Kentucky EBITDA that we're -- negative EBITDA that we're expecting to generate in the back half of the year. So we're pretty optimistic about a really great second half and I think we'll have to see exactly what ends up happening with states like North Carolina and Vermont. But right now, we feel like Kentucky is going to provide a great opportunity for us to go and invest in acquiring customers and in our existing states. And there's also several new states that haven't had a full NFL season. Massachusetts hasn't had any NFL season, Ohio didn't launch until January last year. So there should be a lot of upside in any customer acquisition numbers in H2 this year. Yeah. I think it's a great question. Obviously, disappointing to see, but I think most state governments understand that if you start taxing this too high, you kind of defeat the purpose because it makes it really impossible for the legal regulated operators to compete with the illegal offshore operators that are not paying or some of them onshore now. They're not paying taxes that are not following regulations. There is, I think, great awareness of that and state legislatures. So I'm optimistic that states are going to keep taxes at a reasonable level. I think that they understand that they're ultimately going to drive volume back into the illegal market if they try to tax the industry to heavily. Yeah. So Amazon has been a great partner. Last year, we were really happy with Thursday night football results that was big driver of customer acquisition for us. Those games are also really well built for seeing game parlay offerings to really help drive a lot of parlay mix through better promotion of being game parley on Thursday night. We have a few extra things that we're going to be doing on Amazon this year. I'm pretty excited about that we'll be, I think, coming to everybody in and do order once the season launches. So it really should be a great year with Amazon, and we're really just thrilled with that partnership. And as far as the ESPN goes, same story. We've been really happy with them as a partner. They've been great. We continue to get great value out of that relationship. And we'll have to see. I think, obviously, we saw the same comments everybody else did from Bob Iger and I think it's still fairly early days for them, but I don't want to speak for them. They'll know better than I will, what their plans are. But -- we're always happy with great partners like ESPN, if there's a way to have a deeper relationship that makes sense for both companies and something we would certainly consider. And if it doesn't make sense, and there's something that doesn't really work for us or for them, then we won't. We're perfectly happy with the relationship as it is now. So I think that's how we're thinking about it. Yeah. I think first of all, MLB itself has made some great changes that have helped increase engagement with the stores, so they get the credit for that. But I think betting has helped a lot too. And MLB first of all, is very well built for live betting. So that's been a real product that works very well with that sport and we're excited about the offering we have there this year. Also, the same game parlay product has been significantly enhanced this year. We brought our own models into the fold, and I think really just improved both the UI and the overall offering of same game parlay for MLB, and there's been a number of other things we've done. We've done some work on the cash-out feature. I mean there's a lot of different areas that we've worked on that I think have really helped improve the MLB offering year-over-year and that combined with really strong engagement from a viewership perspective, I think, has driven unexpectedly positive to the upside results for MLB season so far. Thank you. Yeah. I think it's very similar to what we had shared last year that the results can definitely range between negative 10% and probably positive 20% depending on, if you're really taking like that 95% confidence interval, it can get that wide in any given week, obviously, over the course of several weeks, over the course of the season, that's ban tight, but that's how I would think about kind of a week-to-week thing. And really, it's a result generally in NFL of two things. One, do the favorites win or lose. And second is, how the player props do. And that second part has become increasingly important as the industries evolve because so much betting is now happening on player props and so much time being parlayed, it depends on player props. So that's really made a big difference. I think given Q3 is always one that for our business planning group, it's their least favorite quarter because so much volume comes in the last three weeks of the quarter and not that it's the only thing going on, but like relatively speaking, July and August are slower months. So it's really the last few weeks to get always the NFL volume and a few good or bad weeks can definitely swing the results a little bit. But I think that as we've gotten bigger and our customer base has become more diversified, the effects of that are lower as we've gotten more of a mix of player parlays it's not just straight game outcomes that -- so I think we have to look at this season. I think this year, we might see a little bit tighter band, certainly over 3 weeks, we will. But I think still fair, given what we know today. I think week-to-week about that minus 10% to plus 20% possibility on hold depending on the game outcomes and player part the outcomes. I think too early to tell what the path is, but I'm optimistic there will be a pathway there because I think people in Florida want great products. And so, I do think that it will get figured out. But right now, I think it's really hard to say. There's still going to be a few steps to play out in a few things with court rulings and other things. So it's really at this point, a little bit murky and I think we'll know a lot more in the coming months. Thank you. Yeah. I think that at this point, we have no reason to believe that we can't get to the same sort of NGR margins that we see internationally. But obviously, there's still -- it's still early days here. So we see how it plays out. But given the fact that we've, over the last couple of years, continued to optimize the hold rate, continue to optimize the promo mix and we've actually seen better customer engagement, better retention, I'm pretty optimistic and have no reason to believe that we can't reach similar type of numbers that you're talking about that more mature markets across the globe have been able to get to. Yeah. We're definitely interested. I mean, Nevada is obviously an important state for gaming. There's a robust sports betting market there. It is in-person registration. So I would attempt for any expectations for the possible contribution there, but I do think it's an important state because people go there who are our customers and they want to be able to make bets. And so I think being able to give them that option as well as to be able to access the Nevadans that are now betting with others and I think would like to try DraftKings product is definitely something that we're exploring. Thank you. Very good question. I think you're absolutely right that we've talked and everybody has talked a lot about partly mix and average light count and those are certainly very important drivers of whole rate improvement. But there is also -- there are also the other levers that you mentioned. I would say that really across the board, we feel we've improved. In fact, the Q2 outperformance is really more a function of those other things that you mentioned because parley mix, even though its way up year-over-year was kind of on track with our expectations. So it was really the customer risk management, the trading improvement -- we've spent a lot of dev effort on tooling for our traders to make it easier for them to adjust lines, spot soft lines to move them faster and to better optimize them. We've also really significantly invested in our modeling and approach for customer risk management. So I think those are things that are really paying off as well as you look at the hold rate improvement and the outperformance in Q2. Thank you. Absolutely. I mean DFS actually is at a great year so far, and that's been driven by a lot of improvements we've made across the product. Best fall has seen a big jump year-over-year and that's something that you can sort of use as a little bit of a litmus test for or maybe the advanced test for how NFL season is going to go because a lot of those drafts happen in the July, August time frame, so very exciting year for DFS. We have some really good stuff planned for the back half of the year on that product. And it is continually adding new customers. We have seen really strong crossover continue from DFS when we launch new states. So everything seems to be working on that front and continue to be a big source of engagement for customers and states that don't have sports betting as well as a great funnel for new states that launch. Definitely seen multiproduct use. I mean there's some cannibalization, of course, but it's not very significant. The products are pretty different. And people like them for different reasons. People also are not spending a ton of money on DFS. So it's really not like a big wallet thing to \u2013 it's more of an engagement thing. And they are different products, and I think that they provide different types of experiences for people. So we are seeing a great deal of crossover, but we're also seeing great retention across all of those products as well. It appears that the cannibalization is fairly minimal. And a lot of it also happens in the initial launch stages. People are very excited about sports betting. They maybe forget about DFS for a little bit, but we're seeing some of our older state vintages, as time goes on, they come back and some of the cannibalization, even though it wasn't that significant to begin with, even that small bits of cannibalization, we're seeing reverse in some of our older states. Thank you so much. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We had an excellent first half of 2023. We are laser-focused on the back half and on the fall, and we're very excited about the rest of the year and beyond. I look forward to speaking with you over the next few weeks and hope you all stay safe and well. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Jason. I'll hit on the highlights, including our Q2 performance and our improved 2023 guidance. Please note that all income statement measures discussed except for revenue are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, the organization is executing very well, and that is showing up in our results. We achieved $875 million of revenue in the quarter, which is 88% higher than our second quarter 2022 revenue and our adjusted EBITDA of positive $73 million significantly outperformed our expectations and improved by nearly $200 million on a year-over-year basis. Customer retention and engagement outperformed expectations as we successfully transition customers from the NBA season into MLB. We have seen significantly better than expected engagement on MLB due to our enhanced product. Structural hold was also above expectations at approximately 9% for the quarter, while promotional intensity improved together supporting a more than 550 basis point year-over-year improvement in our adjusted gross margin rate to 47%. Fixed expenses were slightly better than expected as we managed vendor related costs and exerted discipline on our compensation expense. We were particularly pleased with the results in our more mature online sports book in iGaming states. In our states that launch from 2018 through 2021, combined handle growth accelerated quarter-over-quarter and increased more than 35% compared to the same period in 2022. In these states, revenue increased more than 70% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin rate increased more than 800 basis points and external marketing declined more than 10% while total unique customers increased approximately 25%. These strong results and our visibility its continued improvement have enabled us to raise our full year 2023 revenue guidance range to $3.46 billion to $3.540 billion from $3.135 billion to $3.235 billion or by $315 million at the midpoint. We are also improving our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to negative $190 million to negative $220 million from negative $290 million to negative $340 million or by $110 million at the midpoint. The bridge from our May full year 2023 guidance to our current full year 2023 guidance includes increases due to stronger customer retention, acquisition and engagement, structural sports book hold improvement and favorable sport outcomes in the second quarter, these items are partially offset by Kentucky now launching this year and being included in our forecast and Ohio's tax rate increasing effective July 1. Customer retention, acquisition, and engagement are exceeding expectation and account for $225 million of the revenue improvement and $100 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. Our structural sports book hold percentage forecast is also higher, supported by our introduction of in-house same game parlay capabilities and new live betting markets. This trend accounts for $40 million of the revenue improvement and $30 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. Favorable sport outcomes in the second quarter contributed $30 million to the revenue improvement and $20 million to the adjusted EBITDA improvement. We are very excited that Kentucky's Horse Racing Commission recently set a target launch date of September 28, 2023 for online sports betting, which is sooner than we previously anticipated. As a result, we expect $20 million of additional revenue in 2023 and a headwind of $30 million to 2023 adjusted EBITDA. Last, we expect Ohio's increased tax rate from 10% to 20%, which went into effect July 1, to result in $10 million of additional costs this year. In terms of our full year 2023 adjusted gross margin percentage, we now expect to be in the 43% to 45% range, an improvement from our previous guidance of 42% to 45%. We expect contribution profit, which we define as adjusted gross profit less external marketing to grow to approximately $700 million in fiscal year 2023, which includes our investment into Kentucky. With regard to our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and now plan to end the year with more than $1 billion. As a reminder, we expect approximately $120 million of capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs for fiscal year 2023 and change in net working capital to be slightly positive for the year. In sum, we had a strong second quarter and are very excited for the upcoming football season. That concludes our remarks. We will now open the line for questions. I would add Stephen that these types of team and league deals are a much smaller percentage of our total marketing expense than some of the other operators in the industry. And as a general philosophy, we have implemented more short duration deals to give us a chance to evaluate actual performance, more frequently. And I'd add, Joe, [Technical Difficulty] older vintage states, we continue to see really healthy acquisition. We're obviously bringing marketing spend down in those older states to match the level of acquisition and achieve appropriate CAC. But we haven't really found a dealing in even our most mature states. Yes. I think. Look, I think all the work we do in that sport retention or sport to sport cross-sell, however you want to think about it. You got to cross-sell them, but most importantly, the product's got to be great. When you're bringing an NFL player into NBA or an NBA player into MLB, and we're just super proud of how strong both our NBA product and MLB product improved on a year-over-year basis."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the DraftKings Q1 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  \n I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Stanton Dodge, you may begin. \nR. Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.  \n Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed further in our SEC filings that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements other than as required by law.\n During this call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings presentation, which can be found on our website and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.\n Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on our business and Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer of DraftKings, who will provide a review of our financials. We will then open the line to questions.\n I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins. \nJason Robins: Good morning, and thank you all for joining. I'm excited to be with you today and share that DraftKings is off to an excellent start in 2023.  \n Revenue growth has been outstanding, supported by strong customer retention, acquisition and engagement as well as better structural hold percentage than anticipated. First quarter revenue increased 84% year-over-year, and we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to a range of $3.135 billion to $3.235 billion, implying growth of 42% year-over-year at the midpoint, which is pretty remarkable off a revenue base of $2.2 billion in full year 2022.  \n At the same time, achieving efficiency remains a relentless focus. Our mantra of revenue growth and cost efficiency is gaining even more momentum throughout the organization. Due to both our strong revenue growth and our ongoing effort to capture efficiencies, primarily within external marketing and our fixed costs, we are on the cusp of achieving profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis. We expect to be approximately breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis in the second quarter, and we expect to achieve nearly $150 million of positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, we are improving our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of negative $290 million to negative $340 million. or an increase of 21% at the midpoint versus our February full year guidance.\n Turning to our product offerings. DraftKings has continued to introduce unique sports wagering opportunities by most recently launching live Same Game Parlays for MLB, supported by our in-house trading platform. We continue to invest in our in-house trading capabilities and technology in advance of the NFL season this fall.\n In iGaming, we estimate that we achieved #1 GGR share in the U.S. at 26% in the first quarter. Our homegrown games continue to function as a key differentiator. For example, our exclusive DraftKings jackpot product is now live in three states across more than 100 slots and table games. We also launched DK Horse, our stand-alone horse racing app, at the end of March, which offers wagering on races from hundreds of domestic and international tracks, including all three Triple Crown races beginning with this weekend's Kentucky Derby.\n I am proud of the team and culture we have in place. In particular, I am proud of our team for their relentless focus on efficiency and expense management over the past 12 months. Our work on achieving ends is not done, and we feel great about the trajectory of our business.\n With that, I will turn it over to Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer. \nJason Park: Thank you, Jason. I'll hit on the highlights, including our Q1 performance and our new and improved 2023 guidance. Please note that all income statement measures discussed, except for revenue, are on non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis.  \n As Jason mentioned, the organization is executing very well, and that is showing up in our results. We achieved $770 million of revenue in the quarter, which is 84% higher than our first quarter 2022 revenue and our adjusted EBITDA of negative $222 million in Q1 significantly outperformed our expectations.\n Structural hold percentage was better than anticipated, with parlay handle mix up 400 basis points year-over-year, while promotional intensity declined, together supporting a more than 600 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross margin rate.\n We were particularly pleased with the results in our older state vintages. In each of our 2018, 2019 and 2020, 2021 state vintages, first quarter 2023 handle grew more than 25% compared to the same period in 2022. GAAP revenue grew at least 80% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin rate increased at least 1,200 basis points year-over-year, and external marketing spend declined at least 10% year-over-year. These strong results and our visibility into continued improvement have enabled us to raise our full year 2023 revenue guidance range to $3.135 billion to $3.235 billion from $2.85 billion to $3.05 billion.\n We are also improving our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to negative $290 million to $340 million from negative $350 million to $450 million or by $85 million at the midpoint. The bridge from our February full year 2023 guidance to our May full year 2023 guidance includes increases due to stronger customer retention, acquisition and engagement, structural sportsbook hold improvement and favorable sport outcomes in the first quarter, which were partially offset by the timing of our recognition of a loyalty program expense.  \n Customer retention, acquisition and engagement are exceeding expectations and account for approximately $195 million of the revenue improvement and approximately $80 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. Our structural sportsbook hold percentage forecast is also higher, supported by our introduction of in-house Same Game Parlay capabilities. This trend accounts for approximately $20 million of the revenue improvement and approximately $15 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. \n Favorable sport outcomes in the first quarter contributed approximately $20 million to the revenue improvement and approximately $15 million to the adjusted EBITDA increase. Last, expense recognition timing is a $25 million headwind to our improved full year adjusted EBITDA guidance.  \n As a result of greater visibility into our new loyalty program, costs that were originally expected to be expensed in the first quarter of 2024 are now expected to be expensed throughout 2023. This additional expense accrual in 2023 will not result in additional cash outflow.  \n In terms of our full year 2023 adjusted gross margin percentage, we continue to expect to land in the range of 42% to 45%.  With regard to our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and now plan to end the year with more than $800 million of cash before our expected inflection to generating positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024 under any reasonable new state launch scenario.  \n In sum, we had a strong first quarter, and underlying drivers are improving our outlook for 2023 and beyond.  \n That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\t And our first question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. \nShaun Kelley: For either Jason or Jason, just obviously, I wanted to talk about the revenue performance, excellent in the quarter. And I wanted to get your sense on -- if the thesis here is around improved customer retention, engagement, what products or product changes in your suite are continuing that?  \n And kind of how does this play out through the first quarter? I think from what we understand, it sounds like March was just an exceptional pickup for DraftKings. So can you talk a little bit about both that cadence and your product mix that may be helping continue engagement beyond traditional NFL season? \nJason Robins: Thank you, Sean. I appreciate it. And I think you're right. It really -- the theme on the revenue side has been customer retention, monetization. Also, we've had tremendous acquisition results. We acquired 57% more first-time players year-over-year on a 27% lower cost of acquisition. So really pleased on that front, too. \n It's been our OSB and iGaming products that have been carrying the load for us. We've been seeing really the big trend difference year-over-year is last year, we saw a bigger drop off after the NFL season ended after the Super Bowl. And this year, I think, due to some CRM optimizations and product enhancements on the sports betting side, as well as some similar things that we've been doing on the iGaming side, we've just seen much stronger retention flowing into late Feb and March. And it seems to be continuing into Q2 as well. \nShaun Kelley: Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, as we think about the revenue outlook and the increase in the quarter, what -- are faster paybacks contemplated in that as well? As we think about just kind of what you're seeing on the individual state level, I think that's been a thesis around particularly the Ohio and Massachusetts launches. But is that contemplated in the revenue outlook increase here? Or is that an opportunity going forward? \nJason Robins: No, absolutely. I mean, really, the way to think about it is the strong acquisition we've been seeing and has been continuing to see in those new state launches, and the speed with which we penetrated into the mid- to high single digits of population -- adult population, I think that sets up for both a faster payback, meaning what used to be a 2- to 3-year time to profitability is being pulled in.  \n And also, we think that there will be more revenue contribution from those states in here as well. So it's absolutely a driver of the increased revenue forecast. \nJason Park: I would add, Shaun. As we indicated, the increase in our Q4 EBITDA, I think that a big part of that improvement is exactly what you're referring to. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Bernie McTernan of Needham & Company. \nBernard McTernan: Maybe to start, just the reiteration of the 42% to 45% gross margin guide for the year. Just given the strong performance of 1Q, just any puts and takes we should be thinking about for the remainder of the year here? \nJason Robins: I think the biggest thing is the increased acquisition that we see in customer acquisition. As we've noted in the past, new users are aware a lot of the promotion dollars are spent, and that therefore drives up the promotion dollars.  \n That said, we are reiterating the same guide of 42% to 45%. We don't see that being any different on the year. But certainly, you'll see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. You'll see something -- some of that show up in the flow-through rate. So that's probably the biggest moving part. But overall, we don't expect it to change outside of that range this year for gross margin percentage. \nBernard McTernan: Understood. And now wanting to step on the toes of any maybe future potential Investor Day. But now that you've posted back-to-back quarters of really strong results on profitability, any changes to thoughts on long-term profitability or maybe getting to those long-term targets sooner? \nJason Robins: Well, you're right. We are planning on covering that at the Investor Day. So I'll hold off on comment on that until then, but we will certainly have more to say about that later this year. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Ed Young of Morgan Stanley. \nEdward Young: My question relates to Slide 6, about the increasing pace of customer acquisition. The 6% you've achieved in Massachusetts in the first, I guess, 50 to 60 days, suggest that the paces continuing to improve even further of the '23 cohort. \n Can you just talk to the drivers of this? How much of that is related to your playbook? How much is that sort of stage you're at in terms of the market? And particularly, I wonder if you could comment on to what extent any of that's reflective of the competitive situation and the actions of others that were informing those faster paybacks? \nJason Robins: I mean I do think it's all of the above. I think all of the factors you just mentioned, all three factors, are contributing in our tailwinds right now. So one, I think we've very much optimized our go-to-market. We now are close to 2 dozen states at this point. So I think we've had a lot of time to really optimize that and feel very good about our new state playbook. \n Secondly, you're seeing the effects of national advertising. And that really, I think, especially in the case of Ohio, Massachusetts and Maryland, which came late or shortly following in the case of Massachusetts, the NFL season, a lot of that probably a quick ramp was at least in part the result of a switch to national advertising, which made it more -- that these states been in the past, maybe for a new state launch, hadn't seen as much of the advertising during an NFL season.  \n Ohio and Maryland and Massachusetts saw advertising on our national advertising all year -- all NFL season long. I think also there's a lot of momentum in the industry. People travel to different states. They have friends playing. So I think that's helped with faster ramp. \n And I do think that competitively, you're right, that there's been a lot more consolidation in the last few state launches to the top two players in the sportsbook market. And I think that, that's also driving it as well. \nEdward Young: Great. Just a quick follow-up on iGaming. You talked about some of the internal improvements in terms of retention through the end of the NFL season into March. But I wonder if you could just again broaden the competitive environment question there on iGaming.\n Are you seeing anything particularly different in that environment? Is that informing the market share as well? Or do you think it's sort of primarily sort of internal actions that bring that share increase? \nJason Robins: I think it's again a mix of both. I think that you're certainly seeing both. I also think that because the cross-sell is so strong between sports betting and iGaming that as we gain share in sports betting, we're naturally going to gain some share in iGaming as well if we continue to do a good job with the cross-sell, which we have been doing. So I think that's a big factor to consider also. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. \nCarlo Santarelli: Jason, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that [ parlay handle ] was up about 400 basis points year-over-year. Could you maybe put some parameters around, a, kind of the influence that had on hold -- on a stabilized basis, maybe not in the quarter, but maybe some sensitivity around that? And b, could you perhaps give us kind of an estimate of what that number looks like at an absolute level? \nJason Robins: The hold rate? \nCarlo Santarelli: Sorry, the mix, the parlay mix. \nJason Robins: I don't -- yes, we haven't disclosed that. I think -- we are looking right now at, at least for Q1, a hold rate that was in the mid-8s. It was roughly a 250-basis-point year-over-year increase, and that was a combination of outcomes, which were unfavorable last year and a little bit favorable this year as well as that increased parlay mix that drove the increase. \nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Okay. And then as a follow-up, I believe last year, your marketing was a little bit over $800 million. In steady state, how do you guys think about that number relative to revenue as a percentage of revenue? \n Probably post-launch, et cetera? \nJason Robins: Yes, I think you're right, it does depend in the short term, of course, on state launches. But long term, in our Investor Day, I think we -- what do we say about 7% to 8% of revenue? A little bit more. About 10%, I believe, of revenue in our Investor Day.  \n So I think for now, as I noted on an earlier question, we'll be updating some of those metrics later this year at our new Investor Day. But for now, I think we're comfortable saying we think that that's the right number. And I think that potentially as revenue grows, it doesn't mean that marketing would need to continue up from there.  \n So I think if you sort of take the snapshot that we put in our last Investor Day, I think at that level of scale, it looks about right. But I also think that, to the extent that revenue continues to grow from there, I don't think marketing has to grow linearly either. \nJason Park: Yes. Carlo, I think marketing as a percentage of sales is a perfectly good sort of outside in metric. Internally, we'll just continue to look at LTV to CAC as the state is in that fifth, seventh year and adjust the marketing -- total marketing expense dollars to reflect adults that are left to be acquired. And as we've provided those statistics on our older states, you can see that those -- the absolute marketing dollars are declining in the older states. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Barry Jonas of Truist Securities. \nBarry Jonas: Great. We've seen some deals across the space recently. Curious how you're thinking about M&A here? \nJason Robins: No. Right now, it's not really a focus of ours. We feel like we had really strong organic growth. We're executing very well competitively. We're seeing natural consolidation of market share happen in the U.S. So I think right now, that's our focus. And it doesn't mean that down the road, M&A couldn't become more interesting. But at the moment, we're very focused on execution. \nBarry Jonas: Great. And just as a follow-up, curious where you think, from a state legalization perspective, what are the biggest opportunities for OSB? And maybe iGaming expansion exist today? \nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question. I think right now, the states that we are seeing active bills that, I think, have a shot of moving Texas, which we'll see. It's different by the day, what I hear there. \n North Carolina, Minnesota, and I think Vermont are the ones that have the best shots of moving. Kentucky, of course, already passed this year. We don't have any update yet on the timing of launch, but we expect by our August call, we'll have a little bit more clarity there and can factor that into any future guidance, to the extent that it's relevant to this year. \n And then on the iGaming side, I think there's a lot of bills right now. I don't know that most of them have a good shot of moving this year, but the state that I think probably has the best chance on the iGaming front this year would be Illinois. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Daniel Politzer of Wells Fargo. \nDaniel Politzer: I just wanted to dive a little bit more into gross margin. Obviously, it came in nicely above. \n I was wondering if you could maybe unpack this a bit and talk to the puts and takes here in terms of gaming taxes, the platform cost, processing cost and the rev share. I mean which of these pieces are tied to GGR versus handle? And what kind of moves around quarter-over-quarter? Because this obviously was a big source of the upside, and we've already talked about that a little bit, but any more color there would be great. \nJason Park: Yes. Good question. I mean, I think gross margin rate was obviously higher on a year-over-year basis, by 600 basis points. Underneath of that is a bunch of state complexion, Dan. \n So you've got investment through promo dollars, which is a headwind to gross margin rate in Ohio and Massachusetts. At the same time, we're lapping a heavy promotional Q1 with the New York and Louisiana launches in Q1 of 2022. \n That's probably one of the largest factors that impact gross margin rate in any given period. Bigger picture, the other elements, taxes, those are fairly well known from a statutory tax rates. Platform cost, we continue to be very thoughtful about vendors that sit within our platform cost, and you hear us talking about bringing in-house more of our game offerings both on OSB and iGaming side. \n And then in terms of market access, as a scale operator, we believe we get fantastic rates in the states that do require market access fees. So I think those are the biggest levers and elements of our gross margin rate. \nDaniel Politzer: Got it. And just one quick follow-up, if I may. Third quarter, I don't think expectations really changed much there. Is there an expectation that maybe for Massachusetts, Ohio, maybe even Maryland, you have the first football season, and there's -- we should expect an uptick in promotions there. Or is there some element that I'm missing that maybe I should be aware of? \nJason Robins: Yes. I think you're right in the sense that we expect that, given some of the early acquisition trends we've seen in those states and knowing that Massachusetts hasn't even had any football yet, it was March Madness, but there's still probably a significant audience out there, we are baking in an increased acquisition assumption, which results in Q3, even though there might be sort of similar to what Jason was saying on the gross margin side. There's a lot of puts and takes there, too, and it will probably net out slightly better than we thought. \n But I think that's really going to depend on how strong the customer acquisition is. And overall, H2 should definitely be better. So it's really just a question of depending on acquisition trends, which are a little hard to predict in these states at that early stage of the NFL season, how much falls in Q4 versus how much falls in Q3. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Benjamin Chaiken of Credit Suisse. \nBenjamin Chaiken: I think in your previous comments last quarter, you targeted fixed cost for '23 to be up 10% to 15% year-over-year. I know Jason in a latter -- and in the prepared remarks, you talked about low single-digit cadence in 2Q. How are you thinking about the full year fixed cost guide? Is it still that 10% to 15%? Or has it moved around at all? \nJason Park: Yes, absolutely, maintaining the 10% to 15% on a full year basis. And we called out single digit for Q2, as you could see that the fixed costs in Q1 were higher than that. So yes, maintaining the 10% to 15% full year fixed cost growth. \nBenjamin Chaiken: Okay. And then I'm kind of doing this on the fly, but that implies roughly low single digit -- flat to low single-digit decline in external marketing year-over-year to Carlo's question, you have some new state launches in there, which implies that the legacy states, if you will, external marketing is coming down pretty dramatically. Is this national advertising, better product? How do you think about it? And then are you pleasantly surprised? Or is this all kind of according to plan? \nJason Robins: No, I think this is according to plan. And certainly, I think the speed with which we're seeing it happen is a pleasant surprise. But I think the trends are what we expected.\n Where we land on the year will be roughly flat, I believe. I think there is some plus or minus that could occur based on results. As Jason Park noted earlier, we very much treat this fluidly and are looking at the data real time. And so as we see how -- especially Q2, I think, is pretty we're pretty certain where we'll be there. I think Q3 is a little bit of flexibility depending on results. \n But I think we expect to be in the flattish range year-over-year. And if we spend a little more, I think that would also probably come with an incremental revenue expectation in Q4. So I don't think anything would change on the adjusted EBITDA front. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer & Company. \nJed Kelly: Great. Two, if I may, one longer term. Jason, how do you think about the right approach in terms of managing the optimal hold percentage you want to generate with the maximum number of users? And then my follow-up is, you saw very strong growth in the vintage state. I think you said 10% unique user growth.\n Where are those unique users coming from? Is that more consumers being a legal age? Or are you actually getting new users? And does that include Golden Nugget? Or is that all organic? \nJason Robins: Yes. I think. So on the first question, I think the answer is we don't know yet. If you look around the world, there's markets that have significantly higher hold rates than anyone in the U.S. I've heard is targeting simply due to some of the legal frameworks there. \n And there's a point -- there's a variety of data points. I know there's a lot of moving parts, if one were to want to try to put that puzzle together. But I think we're very much going to treat it iteratively. And the key for us is really product market fit.\n So driving hold up by increasing the take, meaning making worse odds or players is not something that I think is really being considered right now, creating products that people want and that they retain well on and that they continue to use and get enjoyment out of is the message.\n So I think to the extent that we are able to keep doing that, and I think we have a lot of ideas, obviously, we talked a lot about parlay and driving that. But there's other products like cash out and things like that, where there's certainly opportunity. \n So these are -- the way we think about it internally is not, hey, let's drive hold up, it's how do we get more adoption? And how do we make sure we're retaining and getting satisfaction from customers on these products? And the outcome, the consequence of that is higher hold rate. \n And so I think if we continue to approach it that way, there's probably a good deal of still upside there. And where it ends is anyone's guess, we're going to watch the data and continue to be very data-driven as a company. \n And then I'm sorry, what was the second question? \nJed Kelly: Where is the 10% unique user growth coming from in vintage states? \nJason Robins: There's always new people coming into the market. We still haven't reached, we think the ultimate TAM. So meaning any given older vintage state, we have to remember, we're still even in the oldest of states less than 5 years into this thing.\n So it's -- I mean, iGaming, I guess in New Jersey has been around longer. But for OSB and outside of New Jersey, iGaming hasn't been around for more than 4 or 5 years, anywhere either. I think 4 years is the most. \n So really, it's still early innings. And I think that at this stage of most any market, you'd expect to see continued user growth and continued penetration of the population. So there are under the coverage, you're right, there's always people that are reaching legal age, it's always people moving in and out of state, there are moving parts. But I think a lot of it is just -- like with any product, you don't get 100% of the adoption on day 1. \n You get some of the most avid and excited users, and that's something we consider when we're setting our CAC targets that you do get more casual customers as time goes on. But there's still a lot of market out there. And I think a lot of this is product-driven, too. The more that we create products that can appeal to the mainstream and that can be easier and less intimidating, I think, for the average customer to understand, the more that user growth will continue. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Robert Fishman of MoffetNathanson. \nRobert Fishman: Given the current weak ad market backdrop, can you just discuss how that's helping with your additional ad buying efficiencies, both on the national and local basis? Maybe I don't know if possible to compare how much you're paying for an ad spot in the playoff this year compared to last year? \nJason Robins: No doubt that there has been a reduction in market rate for advertising. It's been different in different channels. But if you look at it kind of from a macro perspective, it's definitely happening across the board. \n There is some offset in certain channels of that because there are limits placed on inventory, specifically for our categories. So as an example, the NFL has put a restriction on, I believe, it's 5 spots per game. Don't quote me on the number, but there's some -- I think it's 5 per game. \n So naturally, that changes things. It doesn't have the same effect, maybe in other forms of media, where auto and insurance and others are competing and driving the market. But no doubt, if you look at it on a kind of macro basis, there's been a reduction in ad rate, and that's part of alongside optimization, why we've been able to have such a significant increase in -- excuse me, in customers, but actually to get that with a decrease in CAC, you usually don't see that usually when you have a 50-plus percent increase in customers, your CAC goes up a little bit, and we saw a 27% year-over-year decline in Q1. \nRobert Fishman: That makes a lot of sense. And just maybe a big picture. With the current competitive landscape, it seems clear to us at least that you cemented DraftKings as a winner for this long-term opportunity. So can you just talk about plans to keep growing your market share from here and maybe even potentially close the gap with FanDuel? \nJason Robins: Yes. I mean, first, we don't take anything for granted. So we assume that there's always going to be a very competitive market. And that we don't assume we won anything or that we have anything that we can bank on yet.\n And I think that keeps a lot of the edge in the competitive drive for the company. No doubt having a big competitor in FanDuel also is helpful. It gives us somebody on the OSB side to feel like we can chase down. \n And I think similarly, on the iGaming side, we've been chasing down BetMGM. And for the first time in Q1, we're able to pass them for #1 market share in iGaming, which we're very proud of. \n So definitely, I think, having that competitive landscape is helpful in keeping our employees focused on who we need to be. And at the same time, we also understand that new competitors can enter the market at any time, and we can't take anything for granted and have to assume that we always have to be serving the customer and innovating and creating new products and new features. And over time, we believe that that's the key to driving loyalty. It's just best product, best customer experience. \nJason Park: I would add, if you look at the market shares relative to FanDuel on a year-over-year basis, our handle -- both of our handle share increases are fairly comparable. And it just reiterates that hold rate is -- continues to be a very large focus area of DraftKings and again, hold rates through product mix and bringing customers additional products that they enjoy. So I think as we continue to make progress in hold rate, that's going to help with relative market share vis-a-vis FanDuel. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Joseph Stauff of FIG. \nJoseph Stauff: Asking about just frame how much wider, say, your product depth is this year versus last, especially in the second quarter? So I don't know how you can frame for us. Like how much wider NBA product is? Or especially second quarter versus last? Especially as I see it kind of going into May, 5 states still in play. Obviously, Knicks and Celtics, which have huge [indiscernible] and probably betting handle? \nJason Robins: No, I think -- I mean, first, you're right that the product is really night and day year-over-year. I think, particularly as you look at the sportsbook product, not that we haven't made as much progress in iGaming, but it was starting from a standpoint where last Q2, we were about 6, 7 months removed going into the quarter from our migration. And now we've had a full extra year under our belt.\n We've introduced micro markets for NBA, baseball and several other sports that are really a unique feature that nobody else has. We're the only company in the space now with live Same Game Parlay. We didn't even have Same Game Parlay 1.5 years ago. Now we have the only live NBA Same Game Parlay, and also the only live MLB Same Game Parlay in the market. \n And we're continually innovating on a number of features. We added parlay insurance and just many, many other markets that didn't exist last year. So I think you're exactly right. The depth, and not just in terms of the markets, although certainly, there's been a tremendous amount of breadth and depth increase in the market, but of the features and the capabilities as well has been very transformational in terms of our ability to compete for market share and to win the customer. \nJoseph Stauff: And then can you just remind us on your efforts and your initiatives to GNOG in particular? And just remind us of maybe be fully, say, implemented in the market? \nJason Robins: Yes. So GNOG is -- we are still focusing on the migration there, and believe that we are on track. I think that GNOG has certainly been a good addition in terms of -- it's part of the story of why we've been able to get to #1 market share. \n I will say that I think that the best is really still ahead there because as long as it's not on our platform, we're not realizing the vast majority of the synergies that we put out when we did the deal. And I think those are all still on the come. So we're very excited about the migration. \n And I think when I say synergy it's not just the cost, obviously, there's cost savings. But also just having a superior product with better revenue and monetization on the players, smoother customer experience, easier to use, superior merchandising, driving more cross-sell between games, I think all of that -- easier flows on the customer acquisition side, we know for a fact that our PAM is converting at a better rate on new users than the GNOG conversion rate. \n So lots of good things there, but we haven't realized them yet. So very excited about that and hope to start to see some of that materialize in the back half of the year. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Clark Lampen of BTIG. \nWilliam Lampen: Jason, given a lot of the positive things that are happening now with the U.S. business that we've covered already on the call so far, I'm curious whether we're at a point where either near or medium term you'd feel more comfortable entertaining opportunities to expand the business maybe a little bit more broadly in overseas markets? \nJason Robins: For us right now, the opportunity in the U.S. is so significant, and we are so well positioned here that, that has to be the focus. At some point down the road, international will become of interest, but right now, we're very focused on the U.S. \n And at the same time, obviously, we understand that the capabilities that we're building on the product side, the technology side. These will be things that will give us high leverage and create really strong EBITDA margins where we'd expand into international markets because a lot of the same tech and product is usable without having to add a ton of incremental cost. \n So it's something down the road we consider. But right now, we think the U.S. is still in the very infancy stages we are so strongly positioned. We're growing our market share. We're growing at a faster clip. The investments we're making are working, and we want to continue to fuel that as much as possible. \nWilliam Lampen: Understood. And then maybe coming back to product. We've seen some of your peers of late looking to bolster their first-party offerings. I'm curious understanding that the priority is really building in-house there is sort of bigger picture a widening gap between you, FanDuel, and the rest of the sports betting market, would you consider additional acquisitions as a means of sort of both improving the offering and magnifying that trend? Or is there one market, whether it's OSB or iGaming, where that makes more sense? \nJason Robins: At this point, I don't think that, that's really a focus either. We're seeing market share consolidate organically. And I think, at a certain point down the road, that will reach some sort of ceiling. And then we'll evaluate that at that point. \n But right now, I think we feel like the similar answer to your prior question that what we're doing is working. And companies all the time make mistakes by getting distracted when they have something that's really working instead of just focusing. And I think that's something that we feel is really important to just continue to keep the team focused on -- eye on the prize right now. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. \nChad Beynon: As we think about the revenue guidance, Q1 was 24% of that, which I believe is slightly higher than normal. And you called out all the items that led to that strong performance. But as we think about normal seasonality, understanding that it's a moving target with these structural hold changes, is there anything that you're comfortable with providing to us just in terms of how that could look? What's really hinged on that fourth quarter or what the middle of the year could look like? \nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question. I mean I think that if you're comparing to last year, we had unusually low hold last Q1 because of unfavorable sport outcome. So in any given quarter, that can swing you and that's part of why we really focus more on annual guidance and giving some color around relatively how much we expect to fall in different halves or quarters. \n But it does vary a little bit based on that. Although over the course of the year, it tends to even out. So you will see some fluctuations in terms of the revenue distribution. Also, you'll see some changes depending on timing of state launches and other things like that. \n So I think that's really why it was a bit different is that last year, we had really low hold -- was still outcome-driven. And there have been some structural hold changes that have improved, too. But we did see really poor sport outcomes in Q1 last year relative to this year, and that's been a big difference. \n As far as anything baked into future quarters, a lot of what we also improved throughout last year was already taking effect in the back half of the year. We have other initiatives that we think could lead to some upside this year. But of the things that we know we have that we've baked into our forecast, a lot of that was already realized in the back half of last year. So you see a bigger impact in Q1 and potentially in the first part of Q2 as well, whereas as we get closer to H2, some of that is kind of lapping year-over-year. \nChad Beynon: Okay. Helpful. And then with respect to just media tie-ins, you've done some of these exclusive live broadcasting partnerships. It appears that there will be more opportunities if you want to kind of expand with other partners in the media space. \n Just wondering what you've seen, from a success or failure, with some of these exclusive deals that you've had, if the engagement is higher? And maybe it's worth exploring some of those opportunities that could come up in the next 12 to 24 months? \nJason Robins: Yes. I mean, I think for us, continuing to optimize there is a big part of optimizing our marketing. And really it's a deal-by-deal thing. So at this point, we have tremendous data, not just from our decade-plus of daily fantasy sports, but now from almost 5 years of sports betting, on what types of media, deliver what types of results. That's been a big part of our year-over-year optimization. \n I also think that the market environment has improved, which we noted earlier on a previous question. So there's a lot to like in the media space. And from the standpoint of deals, we evaluate each deal on a deal-by-deal basis. And the hurdle is if we were to take those same dollars and spend them on the open market, could we do at least this well? And if we think we can do at least this well, then why tie them up? \n So it has to be a deal where we feel like we have some sort of strategic advantage either access to good efficient spend it at increased scale. It wouldn't be achievable elsewhere or some sort of deal that would give us favorable pricing or something that would make it so that having a tie-in -- a tie-up of dollars versus flexibility in dollars would make sense for us. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. \nRobin Farley: I have two questions. One is just a follow-up. I'm sorry, I don't know if you clarified how much of the GNOG acquisition contributed to that, the 10% increase in unique users? And then I had a question also on -- your guidance just typically improves every year being 7% to 9% of the population. And that would take quite a few of those smaller states you mentioned having to legalize this year to kind of achieve that increased access to the population for 2024. \n If you're -- if you don't see those sort of multiple legalizations, I mean, obviously, if Texas is not an issue, but really referring to the other ones. Is there enough organic growth from your existing states to maintain guidance, even if you don't get multiple legalization this year for 2024? \nJason Robins: So thank you, Robin. On the first question, we actually -- it's like-for-like. So it wasn't just we took GNOG and added it in and kept GNOG in the base. In fact, if you look at GNOG, it's actually a little bit of a downward drag on that 10% number. So it would have actually been higher if you just looked at the DraftKings brand, but it's all included. \n So that's in there. And on the second question, as far as like -- it's going to vary year-to-year, right? And right now, I think if you look at bills that are live, you could see a scenario where it's above what we forecasted below or right on. \n Obviously, if Texas comes through, then that plus Kentucky alone is already over the target. If Texas does not, you still get into that sort of range that we set as an expectation if North Carolina, Minnesota and Vermont end up passing alongside Kentucky.\n So I think either of those are potential scenarios to get at or above. And obviously, if some or none of those bills pass, then we won't. So I think too early in the year to kind of call that. As far as the implications and what they would be. I mean we were still seeing nearly double year-over-year revenue growth in our older state vintages in Q1. We mentioned that earlier. \n And I think, again, people need to remember that even the oldest of states are still less than 5 years into this thing. And so there's still a ton of just organic growth happening. I do think, long-term TAM, we need to continue to see state legalization, but I wouldn't make too much out of whether we're above or below in any year. \n In fact, one of the interesting implications is really on the specific 2024 numbers. If we see less legalization, I don't really expect a tremendous difference to 2024 revenue because a lot of the states that might legalize this year would end up launching. Throughout '24, there will be new user acquisition, things like that. \n So it probably won't really move the needle a whole lot on revenue, maybe a little bit, but not a ton. Where it really would have an effect would be on the EBITDA, which, obviously, we want to see more state legalization. But in the short term, less would mean more -- less state legalization will mean more EBITDA in 2024. So it's kind of an interesting way to look at it as well, I think. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Jordan Bender of JMP Securities. \nJordan Bender: If we think about your legacy customers, does the promotional intensity of those players, maybe it consistent with more international markets Or do you think there is still more room to save on promotions coming from those cohorts? \nJason Robins: I think definitely, there's more room. And similar to how we look at hold, it can't be something where we create a worse customer value proposition, a worse experience, and you don't need to. There's plenty of levers just by making sure we get the right things targeted to the right people so that they're actually generating incremental GGR alongside the promotional dollars and having the effect that we want. \n There's optimization of bonus hunters still out there, which we've been very focused on. There's all sorts of levers that you can pull. And then there's still just the natural decline that you're going to see over time as the market matures. And I think you can look across Europe and see that trend in a number of different markets. \n So no doubt, there's still room there, and that's still a focus area for the team. And at the same time, we feel like there's no real absolute target. It's certainly about maximizing long-term NPV and player value. So we're also leaving the flexibility to say that if you could find wins where you can really drive increased revenue and retention through promotions that pay back quickly, then we want you to pursue that as well. \nJordan Bender: Great. And then for my follow-up, on DK Horse, should we be thinking about that as a revenue driver for you guys? Or is that more of kind of a cross-sell opportunity into other areas of the business? \nJason Robins: I mean it will have a revenue impact, but it will be fairly de minimis on the year. We're still rolling it out. It's in, I think, 15 states now. So still in the process of doing that. I think we'll have more to say probably, more information on that once we get through the Triple Crown, particularly the Kentucky Derby, which I think will give us a sense of what kind of customer acquisition we can expect. \n And I think really, it's still new enough that I wouldn't necessarily ascribe a whole lot of revenue this year to it. But as we get smarter about how to utilize that product and cross-sell between it in sportsbook and iGaming, I think you'll continue to see a bigger and bigger impact. And it is something that we felt was important to add to our product portfolio, and we'll also work to better integrate long term. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Ryan Sigdahl of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. \nRyan Sigdahl: Nice job. Curious on Massachusetts, So you guys defended your home turf very nicely there. Took #1 handle share by a commanding lead. How important was that psychologically to win the early battleground? And I guess, did you change your spend and your strategy versus running the normal playbook that you say applied in Maryland or Ohio? \nJason Robins: I think, really, the only thing that we changed in terms of strategy was just making it clear that we're a hometown company. And obviously, that's unique to hear. So other than that, it was pretty much the same playbook. \n I think New England, in particular, we tend to love our own here. So we feel like that was a really good angle for this market, and it worked. It was very effective from a market share perspective and a new customer acquisition perspective. So we'll continue to do that. But otherwise, it's the same state playbook that we've been optimizing over the last 20-plus states. \n And I think that was the biggest reason that we've had success in penetrating because you saw a similar adult penetration, maybe not quite as much market share, but similar acquisition and adult penetration in Ohio and Maryland as well. \nRyan Sigdahl: And then just for my follow-up, with the live Same Game Parlay products for the NBA, Major League Baseball, has that accelerated in-game betting in total? Or is it just a shift in what people are betting on live and being margin accretive rather than incremental? \nJason Robins: No, it's definitely incremental. I mean I think that right now, we're seeing both parlay. I know we talk about parlay a lot, but we're also seeing in-game grow. So there's a lot of upside there. \n I think the biggest upside in in-game is just figuring out how to get the video feeds, lower latency for people who want to do that play-by-play type of betting. But no doubt, live Same Game Parlay has driven an increase in engagement in game. \nOperator: And our next question will come from John DeCree of CBRE. \nJohn DeCree: Maybe the first one, which is probably a little bit of summary from a couple of components that we've talked about this morning already. But with structural hold rate going up, and then particularly in vintage cohorts that promotional intensity is moderate here coming down, but yes, your customer retention seems to be increasing nicely, which is a really nice tailwind. I was wondering if you could kind of talk about what you think is kind of driving that success? So presumably, customer value is going up or if they're spending more, but also coming back more frequently. \nJason Robins: I think it really starts with product -- that our product will create stickier customers. And I think customer experience has been a big focus. We've had significant improvements in our CX year-over-year, including the introduction of chat and other things that I think have helped a lot. \n Our CRM, on the marketing front, has been optimized for several years now. And I think we've made a lot of year-over-year improvements in that, especially as it relates to some of the post-Super Bowl retention and cross-sell into iGaming. I think the CRM team has done a fantastic job. \n Really, it's been execution across the business. I think it's been a lot of really good work by a lot of great people across the whole company. \nJohn DeCree: That's helpful. And maybe an easy one for Jason Park. I think cash at the end of the year is expected to be around $800 million. In the past, I think you've been comfortable with capitalization, but is it fair to assume with that cash balance and profitability trajectory improving that you're still comfortable with your capitalization at this point? \nJason Park: Very comfortable with our capitalization. No need for additional capital. \nOperator: And I would now like to turn the conference back to Jason for closing remarks. \nJason Robins: Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We're off to a strong start in 2023 and are excited about the rest of the year and beyond. I look forward to speaking with you over the next few weeks and hope you all stay safe and well. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you all for joining. I'm excited to be with you today and share that DraftKings is off to an excellent start in 2023.  \n Revenue growth has been outstanding, supported by strong customer retention, acquisition and engagement as well as better structural hold percentage than anticipated. First quarter revenue increased 84% year-over-year, and we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to a range of $3.135 billion to $3.235 billion, implying growth of 42% year-over-year at the midpoint, which is pretty remarkable off a revenue base of $2.2 billion in full year 2022.  \n At the same time, achieving efficiency remains a relentless focus. Our mantra of revenue growth and cost efficiency is gaining even more momentum throughout the organization. Due to both our strong revenue growth and our ongoing effort to capture efficiencies, primarily within external marketing and our fixed costs, we are on the cusp of achieving profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis. We expect to be approximately breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis in the second quarter, and we expect to achieve nearly $150 million of positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, we are improving our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of negative $290 million to negative $340 million. or an increase of 21% at the midpoint versus our February full year guidance.\n Turning to our product offerings. DraftKings has continued to introduce unique sports wagering opportunities by most recently launching live Same Game Parlays for MLB, supported by our in-house trading platform. We continue to invest in our in-house trading capabilities and technology in advance of the NFL season this fall.\n In iGaming, we estimate that we achieved #1 GGR share in the U.S. at 26% in the first quarter. Our homegrown games continue to function as a key differentiator. For example, our exclusive DraftKings jackpot product is now live in three states across more than 100 slots and table games. We also launched DK Horse, our stand-alone horse racing app, at the end of March, which offers wagering on races from hundreds of domestic and international tracks, including all three Triple Crown races beginning with this weekend's Kentucky Derby.\n I am proud of the team and culture we have in place. In particular, I am proud of our team for their relentless focus on efficiency and expense management over the past 12 months. Our work on achieving ends is not done, and we feel great about the trajectory of our business.\n With that, I will turn it over to Jason Park, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you, Sean. I appreciate it. And I think you're right. It really -- the theme on the revenue side has been customer retention, monetization. Also, we've had tremendous acquisition results. We acquired 57% more first-time players year-over-year on a 27% lower cost of acquisition. So really pleased on that front, too. \n It's been our OSB and iGaming products that have been carrying the load for us. We've been seeing really the big trend difference year-over-year is last year, we saw a bigger drop off after the NFL season ended after the Super Bowl. And this year, I think, due to some CRM optimizations and product enhancements on the sports betting side, as well as some similar things that we've been doing on the iGaming side, we've just seen much stronger retention flowing into late Feb and March. And it seems to be continuing into Q2 as well. No, absolutely. I mean, really, the way to think about it is the strong acquisition we've been seeing and has been continuing to see in those new state launches, and the speed with which we penetrated into the mid- to high single digits of population -- adult population, I think that sets up for both a faster payback, meaning what used to be a 2- to 3-year time to profitability is being pulled in.  \n And also, we think that there will be more revenue contribution from those states in here as well. So it's absolutely a driver of the increased revenue forecast. I think the biggest thing is the increased acquisition that we see in customer acquisition. As we've noted in the past, new users are aware a lot of the promotion dollars are spent, and that therefore drives up the promotion dollars.  \n That said, we are reiterating the same guide of 42% to 45%. We don't see that being any different on the year. But certainly, you'll see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. You'll see something -- some of that show up in the flow-through rate. So that's probably the biggest moving part. But overall, we don't expect it to change outside of that range this year for gross margin percentage. Well, you're right. We are planning on covering that at the Investor Day. So I'll hold off on comment on that until then, but we will certainly have more to say about that later this year. I mean I do think it's all of the above. I think all of the factors you just mentioned, all three factors, are contributing in our tailwinds right now. So one, I think we've very much optimized our go-to-market. We now are close to 2 dozen states at this point. So I think we've had a lot of time to really optimize that and feel very good about our new state playbook. \n Secondly, you're seeing the effects of national advertising. And that really, I think, especially in the case of Ohio, Massachusetts and Maryland, which came late or shortly following in the case of Massachusetts, the NFL season, a lot of that probably a quick ramp was at least in part the result of a switch to national advertising, which made it more -- that these states been in the past, maybe for a new state launch, hadn't seen as much of the advertising during an NFL season.  \n Ohio and Maryland and Massachusetts saw advertising on our national advertising all year -- all NFL season long. I think also there's a lot of momentum in the industry. People travel to different states. They have friends playing. So I think that's helped with faster ramp. \n And I do think that competitively, you're right, that there's been a lot more consolidation in the last few state launches to the top two players in the sportsbook market. And I think that, that's also driving it as well. I think it's again a mix of both. I think that you're certainly seeing both. I also think that because the cross-sell is so strong between sports betting and iGaming that as we gain share in sports betting, we're naturally going to gain some share in iGaming as well if we continue to do a good job with the cross-sell, which we have been doing. So I think that's a big factor to consider also. The hold rate? I don't -- yes, we haven't disclosed that. I think -- we are looking right now at, at least for Q1, a hold rate that was in the mid-8s. It was roughly a 250-basis-point year-over-year increase, and that was a combination of outcomes, which were unfavorable last year and a little bit favorable this year as well as that increased parlay mix that drove the increase. Yes, I think you're right, it does depend in the short term, of course, on state launches. But long term, in our Investor Day, I think we -- what do we say about 7% to 8% of revenue? A little bit more. About 10%, I believe, of revenue in our Investor Day.  \n So I think for now, as I noted on an earlier question, we'll be updating some of those metrics later this year at our new Investor Day. But for now, I think we're comfortable saying we think that that's the right number. And I think that potentially as revenue grows, it doesn't mean that marketing would need to continue up from there.  \n So I think if you sort of take the snapshot that we put in our last Investor Day, I think at that level of scale, it looks about right. But I also think that, to the extent that revenue continues to grow from there, I don't think marketing has to grow linearly either. No. Right now, it's not really a focus of ours. We feel like we had really strong organic growth. We're executing very well competitively. We're seeing natural consolidation of market share happen in the U.S. So I think right now, that's our focus. And it doesn't mean that down the road, M&A couldn't become more interesting. But at the moment, we're very focused on execution. Yes, it's a great question. I think right now, the states that we are seeing active bills that, I think, have a shot of moving Texas, which we'll see. It's different by the day, what I hear there. \n North Carolina, Minnesota, and I think Vermont are the ones that have the best shots of moving. Kentucky, of course, already passed this year. We don't have any update yet on the timing of launch, but we expect by our August call, we'll have a little bit more clarity there and can factor that into any future guidance, to the extent that it's relevant to this year. \n And then on the iGaming side, I think there's a lot of bills right now. I don't know that most of them have a good shot of moving this year, but the state that I think probably has the best chance on the iGaming front this year would be Illinois. Yes. I think you're right in the sense that we expect that, given some of the early acquisition trends we've seen in those states and knowing that Massachusetts hasn't even had any football yet, it was March Madness, but there's still probably a significant audience out there, we are baking in an increased acquisition assumption, which results in Q3, even though there might be sort of similar to what Jason was saying on the gross margin side. There's a lot of puts and takes there, too, and it will probably net out slightly better than we thought. \n But I think that's really going to depend on how strong the customer acquisition is. And overall, H2 should definitely be better. So it's really just a question of depending on acquisition trends, which are a little hard to predict in these states at that early stage of the NFL season, how much falls in Q4 versus how much falls in Q3. No, I think this is according to plan. And certainly, I think the speed with which we're seeing it happen is a pleasant surprise. But I think the trends are what we expected.\n Where we land on the year will be roughly flat, I believe. I think there is some plus or minus that could occur based on results. As Jason Park noted earlier, we very much treat this fluidly and are looking at the data real time. And so as we see how -- especially Q2, I think, is pretty we're pretty certain where we'll be there. I think Q3 is a little bit of flexibility depending on results. \n But I think we expect to be in the flattish range year-over-year. And if we spend a little more, I think that would also probably come with an incremental revenue expectation in Q4. So I don't think anything would change on the adjusted EBITDA front. Yes. I think. So on the first question, I think the answer is we don't know yet. If you look around the world, there's markets that have significantly higher hold rates than anyone in the U.S. I've heard is targeting simply due to some of the legal frameworks there. \n And there's a point -- there's a variety of data points. I know there's a lot of moving parts, if one were to want to try to put that puzzle together. But I think we're very much going to treat it iteratively. And the key for us is really product market fit.\n So driving hold up by increasing the take, meaning making worse odds or players is not something that I think is really being considered right now, creating products that people want and that they retain well on and that they continue to use and get enjoyment out of is the message.\n So I think to the extent that we are able to keep doing that, and I think we have a lot of ideas, obviously, we talked a lot about parlay and driving that. But there's other products like cash out and things like that, where there's certainly opportunity. \n So these are -- the way we think about it internally is not, hey, let's drive hold up, it's how do we get more adoption? And how do we make sure we're retaining and getting satisfaction from customers on these products? And the outcome, the consequence of that is higher hold rate. \n And so I think if we continue to approach it that way, there's probably a good deal of still upside there. And where it ends is anyone's guess, we're going to watch the data and continue to be very data-driven as a company. \n And then I'm sorry, what was the second question? There's always new people coming into the market. We still haven't reached, we think the ultimate TAM. So meaning any given older vintage state, we have to remember, we're still even in the oldest of states less than 5 years into this thing.\n So it's -- I mean, iGaming, I guess in New Jersey has been around longer. But for OSB and outside of New Jersey, iGaming hasn't been around for more than 4 or 5 years, anywhere either. I think 4 years is the most. \n So really, it's still early innings. And I think that at this stage of most any market, you'd expect to see continued user growth and continued penetration of the population. So there are under the coverage, you're right, there's always people that are reaching legal age, it's always people moving in and out of state, there are moving parts. But I think a lot of it is just -- like with any product, you don't get 100% of the adoption on day 1. \n You get some of the most avid and excited users, and that's something we consider when we're setting our CAC targets that you do get more casual customers as time goes on. But there's still a lot of market out there. And I think a lot of this is product-driven, too. The more that we create products that can appeal to the mainstream and that can be easier and less intimidating, I think, for the average customer to understand, the more that user growth will continue. No doubt that there has been a reduction in market rate for advertising. It's been different in different channels. But if you look at it kind of from a macro perspective, it's definitely happening across the board. \n There is some offset in certain channels of that because there are limits placed on inventory, specifically for our categories. So as an example, the NFL has put a restriction on, I believe, it's 5 spots per game. Don't quote me on the number, but there's some -- I think it's 5 per game. \n So naturally, that changes things. It doesn't have the same effect, maybe in other forms of media, where auto and insurance and others are competing and driving the market. But no doubt, if you look at it on a kind of macro basis, there's been a reduction in ad rate, and that's part of alongside optimization, why we've been able to have such a significant increase in -- excuse me, in customers, but actually to get that with a decrease in CAC, you usually don't see that usually when you have a 50-plus percent increase in customers, your CAC goes up a little bit, and we saw a 27% year-over-year decline in Q1. Yes. I mean, first, we don't take anything for granted. So we assume that there's always going to be a very competitive market. And that we don't assume we won anything or that we have anything that we can bank on yet.\n And I think that keeps a lot of the edge in the competitive drive for the company. No doubt having a big competitor in FanDuel also is helpful. It gives us somebody on the OSB side to feel like we can chase down. \n And I think similarly, on the iGaming side, we've been chasing down BetMGM. And for the first time in Q1, we're able to pass them for #1 market share in iGaming, which we're very proud of. \n So definitely, I think, having that competitive landscape is helpful in keeping our employees focused on who we need to be. And at the same time, we also understand that new competitors can enter the market at any time, and we can't take anything for granted and have to assume that we always have to be serving the customer and innovating and creating new products and new features. And over time, we believe that that's the key to driving loyalty. It's just best product, best customer experience. No, I think -- I mean, first, you're right that the product is really night and day year-over-year. I think, particularly as you look at the sportsbook product, not that we haven't made as much progress in iGaming, but it was starting from a standpoint where last Q2, we were about 6, 7 months removed going into the quarter from our migration. And now we've had a full extra year under our belt.\n We've introduced micro markets for NBA, baseball and several other sports that are really a unique feature that nobody else has. We're the only company in the space now with live Same Game Parlay. We didn't even have Same Game Parlay 1.5 years ago. Now we have the only live NBA Same Game Parlay, and also the only live MLB Same Game Parlay in the market. \n And we're continually innovating on a number of features. We added parlay insurance and just many, many other markets that didn't exist last year. So I think you're exactly right. The depth, and not just in terms of the markets, although certainly, there's been a tremendous amount of breadth and depth increase in the market, but of the features and the capabilities as well has been very transformational in terms of our ability to compete for market share and to win the customer. Yes. So GNOG is -- we are still focusing on the migration there, and believe that we are on track. I think that GNOG has certainly been a good addition in terms of -- it's part of the story of why we've been able to get to #1 market share. \n I will say that I think that the best is really still ahead there because as long as it's not on our platform, we're not realizing the vast majority of the synergies that we put out when we did the deal. And I think those are all still on the come. So we're very excited about the migration. \n And I think when I say synergy it's not just the cost, obviously, there's cost savings. But also just having a superior product with better revenue and monetization on the players, smoother customer experience, easier to use, superior merchandising, driving more cross-sell between games, I think all of that -- easier flows on the customer acquisition side, we know for a fact that our PAM is converting at a better rate on new users than the GNOG conversion rate. \n So lots of good things there, but we haven't realized them yet. So very excited about that and hope to start to see some of that materialize in the back half of the year. For us right now, the opportunity in the U.S. is so significant, and we are so well positioned here that, that has to be the focus. At some point down the road, international will become of interest, but right now, we're very focused on the U.S. \n And at the same time, obviously, we understand that the capabilities that we're building on the product side, the technology side. These will be things that will give us high leverage and create really strong EBITDA margins where we'd expand into international markets because a lot of the same tech and product is usable without having to add a ton of incremental cost. \n So it's something down the road we consider. But right now, we think the U.S. is still in the very infancy stages we are so strongly positioned. We're growing our market share. We're growing at a faster clip. The investments we're making are working, and we want to continue to fuel that as much as possible. At this point, I don't think that, that's really a focus either. We're seeing market share consolidate organically. And I think, at a certain point down the road, that will reach some sort of ceiling. And then we'll evaluate that at that point. \n But right now, I think we feel like the similar answer to your prior question that what we're doing is working. And companies all the time make mistakes by getting distracted when they have something that's really working instead of just focusing. And I think that's something that we feel is really important to just continue to keep the team focused on -- eye on the prize right now. Yes, it's a great question. I mean I think that if you're comparing to last year, we had unusually low hold last Q1 because of unfavorable sport outcome. So in any given quarter, that can swing you and that's part of why we really focus more on annual guidance and giving some color around relatively how much we expect to fall in different halves or quarters. \n But it does vary a little bit based on that. Although over the course of the year, it tends to even out. So you will see some fluctuations in terms of the revenue distribution. Also, you'll see some changes depending on timing of state launches and other things like that. \n So I think that's really why it was a bit different is that last year, we had really low hold -- was still outcome-driven. And there have been some structural hold changes that have improved, too. But we did see really poor sport outcomes in Q1 last year relative to this year, and that's been a big difference. \n As far as anything baked into future quarters, a lot of what we also improved throughout last year was already taking effect in the back half of the year. We have other initiatives that we think could lead to some upside this year. But of the things that we know we have that we've baked into our forecast, a lot of that was already realized in the back half of last year. So you see a bigger impact in Q1 and potentially in the first part of Q2 as well, whereas as we get closer to H2, some of that is kind of lapping year-over-year. Yes. I mean, I think for us, continuing to optimize there is a big part of optimizing our marketing. And really it's a deal-by-deal thing. So at this point, we have tremendous data, not just from our decade-plus of daily fantasy sports, but now from almost 5 years of sports betting, on what types of media, deliver what types of results. That's been a big part of our year-over-year optimization. \n I also think that the market environment has improved, which we noted earlier on a previous question. So there's a lot to like in the media space. And from the standpoint of deals, we evaluate each deal on a deal-by-deal basis. And the hurdle is if we were to take those same dollars and spend them on the open market, could we do at least this well? And if we think we can do at least this well, then why tie them up? \n So it has to be a deal where we feel like we have some sort of strategic advantage either access to good efficient spend it at increased scale. It wouldn't be achievable elsewhere or some sort of deal that would give us favorable pricing or something that would make it so that having a tie-in -- a tie-up of dollars versus flexibility in dollars would make sense for us. So thank you, Robin. On the first question, we actually -- it's like-for-like. So it wasn't just we took GNOG and added it in and kept GNOG in the base. In fact, if you look at GNOG, it's actually a little bit of a downward drag on that 10% number. So it would have actually been higher if you just looked at the DraftKings brand, but it's all included. \n So that's in there. And on the second question, as far as like -- it's going to vary year-to-year, right? And right now, I think if you look at bills that are live, you could see a scenario where it's above what we forecasted below or right on. \n Obviously, if Texas comes through, then that plus Kentucky alone is already over the target. If Texas does not, you still get into that sort of range that we set as an expectation if North Carolina, Minnesota and Vermont end up passing alongside Kentucky.\n So I think either of those are potential scenarios to get at or above. And obviously, if some or none of those bills pass, then we won't. So I think too early in the year to kind of call that. As far as the implications and what they would be. I mean we were still seeing nearly double year-over-year revenue growth in our older state vintages in Q1. We mentioned that earlier. \n And I think, again, people need to remember that even the oldest of states are still less than 5 years into this thing. And so there's still a ton of just organic growth happening. I do think, long-term TAM, we need to continue to see state legalization, but I wouldn't make too much out of whether we're above or below in any year. \n In fact, one of the interesting implications is really on the specific 2024 numbers. If we see less legalization, I don't really expect a tremendous difference to 2024 revenue because a lot of the states that might legalize this year would end up launching. Throughout '24, there will be new user acquisition, things like that. \n So it probably won't really move the needle a whole lot on revenue, maybe a little bit, but not a ton. Where it really would have an effect would be on the EBITDA, which, obviously, we want to see more state legalization. But in the short term, less would mean more -- less state legalization will mean more EBITDA in 2024. So it's kind of an interesting way to look at it as well, I think. I think definitely, there's more room. And similar to how we look at hold, it can't be something where we create a worse customer value proposition, a worse experience, and you don't need to. There's plenty of levers just by making sure we get the right things targeted to the right people so that they're actually generating incremental GGR alongside the promotional dollars and having the effect that we want. \n There's optimization of bonus hunters still out there, which we've been very focused on. There's all sorts of levers that you can pull. And then there's still just the natural decline that you're going to see over time as the market matures. And I think you can look across Europe and see that trend in a number of different markets. \n So no doubt, there's still room there, and that's still a focus area for the team. And at the same time, we feel like there's no real absolute target. It's certainly about maximizing long-term NPV and player value. So we're also leaving the flexibility to say that if you could find wins where you can really drive increased revenue and retention through promotions that pay back quickly, then we want you to pursue that as well. I mean it will have a revenue impact, but it will be fairly de minimis on the year. We're still rolling it out. It's in, I think, 15 states now. So still in the process of doing that. I think we'll have more to say probably, more information on that once we get through the Triple Crown, particularly the Kentucky Derby, which I think will give us a sense of what kind of customer acquisition we can expect. \n And I think really, it's still new enough that I wouldn't necessarily ascribe a whole lot of revenue this year to it. But as we get smarter about how to utilize that product and cross-sell between it in sportsbook and iGaming, I think you'll continue to see a bigger and bigger impact. And it is something that we felt was important to add to our product portfolio, and we'll also work to better integrate long term. I think, really, the only thing that we changed in terms of strategy was just making it clear that we're a hometown company. And obviously, that's unique to hear. So other than that, it was pretty much the same playbook. \n I think New England, in particular, we tend to love our own here. So we feel like that was a really good angle for this market, and it worked. It was very effective from a market share perspective and a new customer acquisition perspective. So we'll continue to do that. But otherwise, it's the same state playbook that we've been optimizing over the last 20-plus states. \n And I think that was the biggest reason that we've had success in penetrating because you saw a similar adult penetration, maybe not quite as much market share, but similar acquisition and adult penetration in Ohio and Maryland as well. No, it's definitely incremental. I mean I think that right now, we're seeing both parlay. I know we talk about parlay a lot, but we're also seeing in-game grow. So there's a lot of upside there. \n I think the biggest upside in in-game is just figuring out how to get the video feeds, lower latency for people who want to do that play-by-play type of betting. But no doubt, live Same Game Parlay has driven an increase in engagement in game. I think it really starts with product -- that our product will create stickier customers. And I think customer experience has been a big focus. We've had significant improvements in our CX year-over-year, including the introduction of chat and other things that I think have helped a lot. \n Our CRM, on the marketing front, has been optimized for several years now. And I think we've made a lot of year-over-year improvements in that, especially as it relates to some of the post-Super Bowl retention and cross-sell into iGaming. I think the CRM team has done a fantastic job. \n Really, it's been execution across the business. I think it's been a lot of really good work by a lot of great people across the whole company. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We're off to a strong start in 2023 and are excited about the rest of the year and beyond. I look forward to speaking with you over the next few weeks and hope you all stay safe and well. Thank you."

            "name": "Jason Park",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. I'll hit on the highlights, including our Q1 performance and our new and improved 2023 guidance. Please note that all income statement measures discussed, except for revenue, are on non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis.  \n As Jason mentioned, the organization is executing very well, and that is showing up in our results. We achieved $770 million of revenue in the quarter, which is 84% higher than our first quarter 2022 revenue and our adjusted EBITDA of negative $222 million in Q1 significantly outperformed our expectations.\n Structural hold percentage was better than anticipated, with parlay handle mix up 400 basis points year-over-year, while promotional intensity declined, together supporting a more than 600 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross margin rate.\n We were particularly pleased with the results in our older state vintages. In each of our 2018, 2019 and 2020, 2021 state vintages, first quarter 2023 handle grew more than 25% compared to the same period in 2022. GAAP revenue grew at least 80% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin rate increased at least 1,200 basis points year-over-year, and external marketing spend declined at least 10% year-over-year. These strong results and our visibility into continued improvement have enabled us to raise our full year 2023 revenue guidance range to $3.135 billion to $3.235 billion from $2.85 billion to $3.05 billion.\n We are also improving our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to negative $290 million to $340 million from negative $350 million to $450 million or by $85 million at the midpoint. The bridge from our February full year 2023 guidance to our May full year 2023 guidance includes increases due to stronger customer retention, acquisition and engagement, structural sportsbook hold improvement and favorable sport outcomes in the first quarter, which were partially offset by the timing of our recognition of a loyalty program expense.  \n Customer retention, acquisition and engagement are exceeding expectations and account for approximately $195 million of the revenue improvement and approximately $80 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. Our structural sportsbook hold percentage forecast is also higher, supported by our introduction of in-house Same Game Parlay capabilities. This trend accounts for approximately $20 million of the revenue improvement and approximately $15 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. \n Favorable sport outcomes in the first quarter contributed approximately $20 million to the revenue improvement and approximately $15 million to the adjusted EBITDA increase. Last, expense recognition timing is a $25 million headwind to our improved full year adjusted EBITDA guidance.  \n As a result of greater visibility into our new loyalty program, costs that were originally expected to be expensed in the first quarter of 2024 are now expected to be expensed throughout 2023. This additional expense accrual in 2023 will not result in additional cash outflow.  \n In terms of our full year 2023 adjusted gross margin percentage, we continue to expect to land in the range of 42% to 45%.  With regard to our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and now plan to end the year with more than $800 million of cash before our expected inflection to generating positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024 under any reasonable new state launch scenario.  \n In sum, we had a strong first quarter, and underlying drivers are improving our outlook for 2023 and beyond.  \n That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions. I would add, Shaun. As we indicated, the increase in our Q4 EBITDA, I think that a big part of that improvement is exactly what you're referring to. Yes. Carlo, I think marketing as a percentage of sales is a perfectly good sort of outside in metric. Internally, we'll just continue to look at LTV to CAC as the state is in that fifth, seventh year and adjust the marketing -- total marketing expense dollars to reflect adults that are left to be acquired. And as we've provided those statistics on our older states, you can see that those -- the absolute marketing dollars are declining in the older states. Yes. Good question. I mean, I think gross margin rate was obviously higher on a year-over-year basis, by 600 basis points. Underneath of that is a bunch of state complexion, Dan. \n So you've got investment through promo dollars, which is a headwind to gross margin rate in Ohio and Massachusetts. At the same time, we're lapping a heavy promotional Q1 with the New York and Louisiana launches in Q1 of 2022. \n That's probably one of the largest factors that impact gross margin rate in any given period. Bigger picture, the other elements, taxes, those are fairly well known from a statutory tax rates. Platform cost, we continue to be very thoughtful about vendors that sit within our platform cost, and you hear us talking about bringing in-house more of our game offerings both on OSB and iGaming side. \n And then in terms of market access, as a scale operator, we believe we get fantastic rates in the states that do require market access fees. So I think those are the biggest levers and elements of our gross margin rate. Yes, absolutely, maintaining the 10% to 15% on a full year basis. And we called out single digit for Q2, as you could see that the fixed costs in Q1 were higher than that. So yes, maintaining the 10% to 15% full year fixed cost growth. I would add, if you look at the market shares relative to FanDuel on a year-over-year basis, our handle -- both of our handle share increases are fairly comparable. And it just reiterates that hold rate is -- continues to be a very large focus area of DraftKings and again, hold rates through product mix and bringing customers additional products that they enjoy. So I think as we continue to make progress in hold rate, that's going to help with relative market share vis-a-vis FanDuel. Very comfortable with our capitalization. No need for additional capital."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alan Ellingson, DraftKings' Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nAlan Ellingson: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed further in our SEC filings that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecasts. We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements other than as required by law. During this call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings release and presentation, which can be found on our website and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on the business. Following Jason's remarks, I will provide a review of our financials. We will then open the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, and thank you all for joining. As you can see in our results, our core value drivers are strong. In the third quarter, we acquired more online sportsbook and iGaming customers year-over-year, while CAC declined nearly 20%. Structural sportsbook hold percentage continued to increase. Our trajectory here is encouraging with NFL parlay mix tracking up more than 500 basis points year-over-year. Our promotional reinvestment rate improved by 300 basis points year-over-year as a percentage of gross gaming revenue even though we acquired more customers and had higher new customer promotions. These core value drivers collectively contributed to a 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in adjusted gross margin for the third quarter of 2024. While we experienced the most customer friendly stretch of NFL sport outcomes we've ever seen early in the fourth quarter, which pressures our revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the short-term, the overall trajectory of our business is strong. We are excited to reiterate our fiscal year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion and introduce our inaugural fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance, which calls for 31% year-over-year growth at our guidance midpoints. Even more importantly, our sportsbook product is continuing to improve, which positions us well for this NBA season and beyond. This fall, we launched new and exclusive NBA markets, specifically designed to engage customers with key game storylines and expanded our in-house same game parlay offering to more than 50 new NBA markets. We also appreciate being recognized in a recent third-party report as the number one overall sportsbook app in the U.S., ranking first in the user experience, betting interface and features categories. Our apps now ranked number one in sportsbook and numbers one and two in iGaming with the DraftKings Casino and Golden Nugget Casino brands respectively. Lastly, I'd like to touch on the Ballot initiative in Missouri. Earlier this week, Missouri voters passed a ballot initiative legalizing online sports betting in the state, following a productive and efficient campaign that was backed by a wide consortium of sports teams and gaming operators. Missouri represents approximately 2% of the U.S. population and we expect to launch our sportsbook product in the state pending market access, licensure, regulatory approvals and contractual approvals. In closing, our business fundamentals are healthy, and we are excited about our financial trajectory into 2025 and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Alan Ellingson.\nAlan Ellingson: Thank you, Jason. I'll hit the highlights, including our third quarter performance and our fiscal year 2024 and 2025 guidance. Please note that all income statement measures discussed, except for revenue are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, our business fundamentals were healthy in the third quarter. We grew revenue 39% year-over-year to $1.95 million and generated a $59 million adjusted EBITDA loss. Our online sportsbook gross gaming revenue increased 39% and iGaming gross gaming revenue grew 26% when compared to the third quarter of 2023. Newly acquired online sportsbook and iGaming customers increased 14% year-over-year, while our CAC for these customers improved nearly 20% year-over-year. Structural sportsbook hold percentages increased year-over-year as customers continue to enjoy our parlay offerings. Promotional reinvestment rates for our online sportsbook and iGaming improved by 300 basis points year-over-year as we reduced promotions for lower value customer segments and began to mitigate the impact of the Illinois tax increase. Adjusted gross margin was above our expectations at 40% and increased 300 basis points year-over-year. Looking ahead, I'll briefly comment on our fiscal year 2024 guidance before discussing our expectations for fiscal year 2025. On August 1, 2024, we guided fiscal year 2024 revenues of $5.05 billion to $5.25 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $340 million to $420 million. Our third quarter financial performance was consistent with our expectations. NFL outcomes early in the fourth quarter, however, have resulted in headwinds to revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $250 million and $175 million respectively. We have also made significant progress in identifying customers with lower lifetime values across our footprint and are improving our expectation for promotions for the remainder of the fiscal year 2024 accordingly. And we are continuing to drive expense efficiency throughout the organization as we balance growth and profitability. As a result, we now expect fiscal year 2024 revenues of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion and fiscal year adjusted EBITDA of $240 million to $280 million. Moving on to our fiscal year 2025 guidance. In November 2023, we stated our expectation that fiscal year 2025 adjusted EBITDA would be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion. We reiterated this expectation in August. Given strong underlying momentum in our core value drivers, we continue to expect fiscal year 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $900 million to $1 billion. Today, we are introducing a fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance range of $6.2 billion to $6.6 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 27% to 35% compared to our updated fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance midpoint. We expect structural sportsbook hold percentage of 11% in fiscal year 2025 with further upside in fiscal year 2026 and beyond. We expect our fiscal year 2025 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 45% to 47%. We expect stock based compensation expense to represent approximately 6% of revenue in fiscal year 2025. Additionally, we expect the bridge between adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to be $100 million, and therefore, expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $850 million in fiscal year 2025. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, if we could start off, I think most of our questions this morning from investors have really kind of been around the flow through assumptions for next year. So, obviously, some pros and cons. But where we left it a quarter ago, I think, you had spoken about a 50% flow through kind of on a long-term basis and I think that's some of the long-term objectives had kind of pinpointed to. This year, for next year, you're looking at 39%. So can you just talk some -- about some of the puts and takes behind those variables as well as sort of how it interacts with what you're seeing on the revenue and customer acquisition side at this point? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Thanks, Shaun. Yeah. So definitely feel 50% is about the right number long-term for flow through. I think next year, what you're seeing around 40% rather than 50% is that we have, as we've noted in the last couple of quarters been seeing unexpectedly strong customer acquisition. And that's a really great thing for the long-term potential in the TAM of the industry. But obviously, we want to be cautious next year that we don't end up underestimating customer acquisition promotions, and therefore, having a higher flow through guide than what actually materializes. So that's really the thinking behind that. As we've noted in the past, should customer acquisition slow, I think whenever that happens, there'll be some short-term adjusted EBITDA upside. So that could very well be the case in '25. Obviously, we want to see the continued customer acquisition because that bodes well for '26 and beyond. But should there be less-than-expected or I should say a slowdown in customer acquisition, could definitely be some upside to that flow-through rate that you mentioned.\nShaun Kelly: Thank you very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, just rolling through the rest of the year, one of the discussions, we've been having is, how do we get comfortable month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter that the kinds of impact that we see here don't recur and/or flip back in the more positive direction. I guess what I'm asking is, if you could talk about some of the levers that you have at your disposal and how the business evolves to mitigate some of the lock factor that showed up here?\nJason Robins: No. It's a great question. Obviously, the shorter the period, the more that volatility in sport outcomes can affect things. So only being about a month into Q4, I think, just the timing of when you're seeing the guide, it's obviously going to -- a month period is going to have more volatility. And as you noted, it could swing either way. Just last night, Bengals make that 2 point conversion and that last touchdown doesn't go in for a fourth parlay leg to hit for, the touchdown parlay, then it would have been very different outcome. So things can swing either way. I think certainly over longer periods of time, it normalizes. It was a little bit of a down year this year. This year, we were around -- will expect to be around 10.5% structural hold and we'll finish just over 10% actual, at least that's where we're tracking now, maybe sport outcomes will improve. But that's -- typically over the course of the year, pretty big number. So I think over a year, it's pretty smooth. And what you'll see, I think as the business evolves, right now, our adjusted EBITDA is a small percentage of our revenue as that continues to go up and we approach our long-term 30% plus margins, you're going to see the impact of sport outcomes, because they affect revenue flow through at a much -- excuse me, affect the EBITDA at a much lower percentage. Think about it this way. Next year, our adjusted EBITDA is going to double at the top end of our guidance range, but we expect revenue to grow at a just over a 30% pace. So the impact of sport outcome on revenue is obviously going to be the same, but on EBITDA could be -- excuse me, it will be about -- a little over 30% higher, but on EBITDA, it will be on a number that's 4 times bigger. So, as we scale and the business generates more and more EBITDA, these impacts will become more rounding errors, but obviously, now in a year where we're just turning positive adjusted EBITDA for the first-time in company history, it's going to be a bigger impact.\nDavid Katz: Understood. Looks like past interference to me. Thank you very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: Okay. One small thing, just wondering, I don't know, if you said the hold percentage in Q3. And then the bigger question is, with Illinois, you've talked about, changing promotional activity to kind of offset the higher tax. Can you talk a little bit about -- do you feel like you have sort of fully figured out how to do that or is that still a work in progress? In other words, are you -- where you want to be with that trade off? Thanks.\nJason Robins: So, hold was as expected in Q3. We didn't see any -- it was nice to actually have a neutral quarter, especially with NFL starting. And then, as far as Illinois goes, I think we've begun to implement some things. We're still figuring out exactly what the right levels are. But if you see sort of in the bridge that we shared, we included some promo efficiency. And within that, one of the components is some mitigation in Illinois. So we have begun to implement that, but I wouldn't say that we fully realized it and it's not a huge component of the guide next year. So potentially, some upside there depending on how things evolve.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thanks. Good morning. Jason, I was wondering, so within the context of the 31% revenue guidance for next year, to the extent you can \u2013 like, how would you parse that between market growth across both iGaming and sports betting, market share and promotional extraction. If you could kind of bucket maybe the growth across those three verticals or any kind of direction you can give on that.\nJason Robins: Sure. So we do bottoms up builds. So, we typically will look at cohort data. Implicit in that, I think is that market share doesn't change because we're basing our cohort data on what we've seen in the past and we're basing our customer acquisition estimates on what we've seen in the past. So I think that's going to be basically implying a flat market share. That said, we don't actually forecast it that way. It's more of a top down exercise. We say, okay, if we kept market share flat, what would this imply for market growth in sanity check it that way. On the promotional side, we've been, I think, as I noted, a little cautious with customer acquisition environment having been so hot. So that one, I think, could be, potential upside if there is slower customer acquisition, but of course, that's not as much, a benefit in 2026 and beyond, but could be some upside on the EBITDA front for next year. But we weren't too aggressive with that number. So it's not a huge component of it. So really, it's more about just kind of natural market growth, handle growth on our side and then a little bit of structural hold improvement.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. And then, just on the promotional side, is obviously 300 was the number this quarter? Is that kind of in the ballpark of what you're looking to extract next year for the entirety of the year or is it something a little more muted just based on what you just said already on the customer acquisition environment?\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's a little more muted just because we've been cautious on the customer acquisition environment, but it's really going to depend on that. I mean, the decline is going to happen just based on the fact that the base is maturing and it's more existing users. It's just a question of how hot customer acquisition is. So I think we've been a little more cautious and have had a bit more muted of an assumption, and we'll see how that plays out.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you. And if I could, just one follow-up. You guys obviously provided some good disclosure around your MUPs and ARPMUPs in the period ex-Jackpocket. The ARPMUP growth, I believe was 8%. Is that just a mix issue of some of the newer customers you're bringing in or is that, something that maybe relates to some of the legacy customers and you guys getting a little bit smarter with managing volatility and whatnot?\nJason Robins: Yeah. I think it's more the latter. Obviously, as we bring on new customers, Jackpocket, there's a lot of moving parts. So one of the things that we noted in our letter is that we do intend to make some additional disclosures at the product level next year. We're still sort of sorting out exactly what those are. But I realize it's kind of confusing with the way we have it now, especially with all the different product lines that we have. So that's something we're taking a look at, so that we can hopefully provide some more useful disclosures for all of you.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the question that Carlos just asked, maybe ask it somewhat differently. If you can look back at the 3Q and parse between OSB and iGaming segments, can you talk about spend per existing user versus newly acquired users, how much of a delta or maybe lower spend new users might have relative to some of your longer-term, maybe more VIP customers?\nJason Robins: Sure. So obviously, with the caveat that it's still early. I do think that the users we acquired in Q3 look a lot like customers we've been acquiring recently, certainly maybe not the first year in a state cohort, but very similar to the more recent cohorts. So it seems like really the story is that, after the first year or two, you do get some decline in customer LTV, but then it seems to plateau. It doesn't really seem to be lower in years four, five, six and beyond. So that's kind of what we're seeing. But again, very early, we're basing this on, for most of these customers, only a month or two of data. So obviously, we'll see how that plays out as NBA progresses and things like that. But from what we can tell, it seems like they're very similar quality to who we've been acquiring.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thank you. And then with respect to your 2025 revenue and EBITDA guidance range, what's contemplated at the high end versus what's baked into the low end? What's that $100 million EBITDA bridge? What's the delta there?\nJason Robins: The biggest difference is just customer acquisition environment, because that's kind of the hardest thing for us to predict at this point. We feel very good about the models we have for our existing cohorts and have been very accurate in forecasting those Obviously, other levers like fixed costs and marketing spend are controllable. So it's really much more what does the new customer volume look like and how does that end up affecting new customer promotion levels.\nJoe Greff: Great. And then one final question here. Given the aforementioned customer friendly results in October, have your handle expectations versus a quarter ago called change? In other words, would 4Q handle actually have gone up relative to three months ago, given these outcomes and what might be stronger engagement?\nJason Robins: We have seen a little bit of evidence that handle can go up or down based on whether customers are winning or not. But it\u2019s actually not really that big a number if it is an impact at all. I think much more what we see is that people don\u2019t need to deposit as much more, but they tend to keep their betting levels at a pretty similar level. And on the margins, you see some incremental betting. But for the most part, people just continue to kind of bet as they\u2019ve been betting at this point. So not something that we built into our assumptions. If there is any of that, it could be upside. Also could be some upside on the payment processing cost side because you don\u2019t need to have people depositing again if they have money in their account. So all those things could potentially create upside. But I think if it is, it\u2019s not very significant. So we haven\u2019t built it into the guide.\nJoe Greff: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ben Miller with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBen Miller: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just on the \u201825 EBITDA guide, I was wondering if you could expand on what some of the embedded assumptions are in there versus last quarter? And what some of those moving pieces are that leave the range unchanged against factors that may or may not be new this quarter? You obviously have a revenue guide versus prior expectations. It seems like you're mitigating some tax in Illinois. Are there any assumptions from Missouri? Any color around that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJason Robins: Sure. Yeah. So I mean, I think the general story is that, in Q3, we kind of performed as expected. And Q4, outside of sport outcomes, all the fundamentals are pointing towards exactly kind of what we thought, maybe even a little bit better going into Q3 and Q4. So there is maybe some reason to feel more optimism. Obviously, we also got stung by sport outcomes. So I think between that and also wanting to be cautious on customer acquisition, we didn't feel comfortable raising the guide at this point. But we do see some really interesting things with parlay mix being up 500 basis points year-over-year in NFL, and NBA off to a very strong start from a mix perspective, that do give us some confidence that there could be some upside. But right now, we feel like with the data we have, this is the right place to be in, and felt like the real macro story was maybe a little upside, but more so that we really reaffirmed over the last couple of quarters all the key fundamentals that led us to feel $900 million to $1 billion was the right number.\nBen Miller: Great. And then maybe just a big picture one, Jason. I'm curious your thoughts on the non-sports betting prediction markets, and whether that's an opportunity, or how you think about that from a product standpoint, from a competition standpoint, as either cannibalizing or an opportunity for OSB and iGaming? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yeah. I think it's a very interesting thing. The market within that that's dominant is election markets, of course, and particularly during presidential elections. So I know there's a lot of attention on it over the last few weeks. And I do think there could be a place for it outside of elections, but that's really where the interest seems to be now from a demand -- customer demand side. So definitely something we're looking at in advance of next presidential election and potentially there will be an opportunity to look at something sooner. It is a different framework. It's not licensed as a betting product, it's licensed as financial market. So it's definitely a very different thing. So we'll have to see where it fits in the priority list. But it is something we'll plan on looking at ahead of next election for sure.\nBen Miller: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling: Hey. Thanks. I'm going to try to roll two into one here. One is just on the guidance for 2025. I guess, what level of customer acquisition or user growth do you have embedded in the revenue guide? And then secondarily, you talked about the 500 basis points increase in parlays within the football season, I guess, what do you think is explicitly driving that and is that going to carry over into other sports in the next year? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yeah. So great question. I think on the first one, as we noted, we are fairly cautious with customer acquisition from a promotional budgeting perspective, but we also are not counting on a lot of volume from customers that we acquire. It's mostly existing customers. So I think that's really been built up from years and years of cohort data, and we feel very good about those assumptions. And then, of course, as we noted, we expect structural hold to be around 11% next year. So that's another key assumption that we have. And then I think -- I'm sorry, what was your second question?\nStephen Grambling: Just as you think about, what's the drivers of the 500 basis points increase in parlays and does that carry over into other sports, or specific product changes?\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's a great. So I mean a lot of it is product. We've introduced a lot of new features. We have live SGP markets across NFL, NBA and other sports now. So a lot of it is just product and product availability. I think we've really increased our abilities around merchandising and creating interesting player props and combinations of player props into prepacked parlays, and I think that's been a factor. So it's a number of things, our marketing approach. It's a lot of different pieces moving towards that objective that have driven it. As far as does that carryover in other sports, definitely have some encouraging early signs in NBA that we're seeing. And for us, that's the other big one, right, because May (ph) is the other big sport, but also it's the sport that has such a heavy SGP mix in general and it's just naturally player oriented as a sport. So that's a big one. And then baseball, we're also very excited about that being a driver of parlay mix and baseball too. We really pushed on touchdowns this year. I think homeruns is a good analogy for that in baseball. So definitely a lot of translatable insights, I think, but obviously, each sport is different too. So we'll have to see as each season starts how it goes.\nStephen Grambling: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ben Chaiken with Mizuho.\nBenjamin Chaiken: Hey, thanks. Jason, the elevated external marketing for '25 totally makes sense. But I guess the question is, in '24, you had a similar opportunity to acquire customers that you didn't see coming at the beginning of the year. How are you estimating that opportunity in '25 a year plus out? And I know you, I think you said you're taking a conservative angle. But again, just more so, how did you quantify the magnitude of the opportunity for something that seems maybe hard to predict? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yeah. I mean I think we -- because it's hard to predict, we really try to, from a cost perspective, approach it cautiously. But then in terms of the revenue, we would be counting on, not count on a huge year for customer acquisition. So we tried to kind of be cautious on both sides of the equation, and that's how you approach anything, I think, when it's hard to predict. The other thing I'd note is that the addition of Jackpocket, which really we only have for about half a year, a little over half a year, also makes a big difference. And this year, there were no big jackpots. So I think that's not normal. Last year, there were three, I think $1 billion (ph) plus jackpots. So we also want to make sure that, if we get some big jackpots in the lottery next year, we have some customer acquisition budget for that. And just remember, even that alone, going from half a year-ish, a little more than half a year to a full year is also more marketing and more new customers. So that's part of the story as well.\nBenjamin Chaiken: Got you. And then just some back of the envelope math, is it fair to say you held the light by about 500 basis points in October? I'm basically saying the 250 of hold divided by an estimated October handle on our end? Does that sound right?\nJason Robins: You are about right. Good math work.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Clark Lampen with BTIG. Your line is open.\nClark Lampen: Thanks for taking the question. Jason, I wanted to follow up on structural hold rates. You called out 11 for next year, you're pacing towards 10.5. Hopefully, without sounding too myopic, why only 50 basis points of increase expected when I think a lot of the conversations that we've had so far around product mix shifts and the momentum that you guys are seeing with packaging product, stuff like that, it all feels quite positive?\nJason Robins: Yeah. I think that's what we feel, we have the line of sight to commit to right now. And it's more of how we view our commitment than what we really want to achieve. Our internal goals will certainly be higher than that. But as we think about what we want to guide, and not even being into 2025 yet, just wanted to make sure that we really only committed to something that we are highly confident in based on what we know right now.\nClark Lampen: How does micro-betting, I guess, sort of factor into that, if at all, also next year? I'm curious if you could give us an update maybe on the simple bet integration and perhaps when we might start to see, I guess, some of the product that's sort of in the pipeline starting to roll out? Thank you.\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's a great question. So I mean, Simple Bet's been a partner of ours for a while. So a lot of this was, one, about bringing a cost in-house, and two, really being able to take it to the next level. So we do have a lot of micro-betting offerings now, but I think a lot of what we're going to develop going into next year will really be at the top of the market and I think will separate us and really differentiate us on the live betting side. And it won't just be micros, there are all sorts of live betting and derivative markets that Simple Bet will help us with. So we're very excited about that. I think as you think about the impact on hold, live betting does have lower hold rates. So as we mix more into live betting, it will naturally have some impact on lowering the overall average hold. But obviously, we believe it's highly incremental volume. So that's a good thing. And at the same time, the other lever is we do believe that there's places that we have the opportunity to move live betting hold rate up. So while as a whole it's lower, we might be able to offset any of the mix shift and maybe even offset it to the positive with having actually higher hold rates within the live betting in pockets where it's not high enough today. So those are all things I think Simple Bet will really help us with. And then obviously, on the pre-match side, we'll continue to push hard on parlay mix. And I think overall, we expect, as we noted, structural hold to go up, but it will certainly be a mix of live betting and overall kind of performance on the pre-match side.\nClark Lampen: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Joe Stauff with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJoe Stauff: Okay. Good morning, Jason. I had a question. Maybe if you could describe maybe retention levels and what they look like between, say, an OSB and a casino customer. And the reason I ask is, certainly within OSB, you have a significantly larger competitive advantage given your product and number of iterations and so forth and the amount of share that you have versus the casino market that certainly seems finite today and more competitive. And so I was just curious about what does retention levels look like between, say, both of those customer cohorts?\nJason Robins: Yeah. It's actually not too different. The retention in sports betting is naturally a little bit better, but it's not as different as you might think. And from our perspective, we view our iGaming offering as top of the market. We have -- we've noted been rated the number one and number two ranked apps and product quality for DraftKings and the Golden Nugget brands, respectively. And we think our iGaming app is clearly head and shoulders the best product. So I do think that you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a bit more competitive. And so naturally, there\u2019s a little bit more fragmentation. But if you look at our share in iGaming, it\u2019s not that much lower than our share in sports betting. And we expect that to have some upside too as we continue to improve the product.\nJoe Stauff: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDan Politzer: Hey. Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. I know a lot of the focus has been on the 2025 guide. But one of the things I was looking back at your Investor Day last year, you actually forecast revenue of 2026 at $6.2 billion. So as you think about that relationship and maybe that could be just stale at this point, but should we think about kind of the path forward outside of 2025, the flow through and maybe the leverage as maybe you kind of look to exceed those prior targets given there seems to be upside on revenue, how should we think about that kind of going forward? And along with that, sales and marketing, you guys did a lot of deals in 2020, 2021, probably rolling off soon. So I mean, is that also an opportunity as we think about kind of the flow through as we move past 2025?\nJason Robins: Yeah. I do think, to your last point, that is an opportunity. And I'm glad you brought up the Investor Day. I think that we were a little conservative in the Investor Day in terms of the overall industry growth. I believe we are around 9% CAGR and flat share. So what we're seeing is that the growth is just much stronger. And as you noted, we're actually going to be where we thought we'd be in 2026 and 2025 with much stronger customer acquisition and continued growth. So I think there is some upside there. And obviously, that means that the flow through is going to have to catch up as the growth slows down in the outer years. But I think right now, we\u2019re seeing really encouraging signs that the TAM is bigger than probably we thought when we did the Investor Day. And as you noted, we\u2019re already a year ahead of where we thought we\u2019d be.\nDan Politzer: Thanks so much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandt Montour: Good morning, everybody. I'd like to dig in a little bit more on the 11% hold number. Jason, how do you think about that 50 bps lift in terms of average parlay -- or parlay mix versus average number of leg count improvement? And could you get there just by anniversarying the parlay mix lift you're seeing today? Understanding that there's differences in your product across sports. And then the last part of this question is, with regards to your main competitor and the hole that you -- I know that you see that they do, what would it take to get to something a little bit closer to what they're doing next year? Is that even possible, like a 12% or a 13%? What would that take?\nJason Robins: Yeah. To your first question, it's really mix driven. And I think we can get there based on just the mix shifts we're seeing, albeit, obviously, there's some assumptions around which sports they're likely to transfer into. For example, we are not expecting next year nearly the mix shift in college sports because they tend to be less player prop oriented and, therefore, less parlay heavy. But with the kind of nuances aside, I think, yes, we can get there based on the mix shift we're seeing. And I think that, with the path to 12%, 13% is really mix driven. I mean there\u2019s other things, of course, on the margin you can always do to improve your sharp modeling, improve your risk mitigation, things like that, but 90% plus of that is just mix. So we\u2019re continuing to focus on that. It\u2019s been a real great point of success this year. We feel like we have a great plan going into next year, drive it even higher. And it\u2019s exciting to know that there\u2019s a clear path to getting much higher on hold rate. And we think that is actually a big upside lever of the business that maybe people aren\u2019t counting on.\nBrandt Montour: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nJed Kelly: Hey. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on iGaming, can you sort of talk about the promotional velocity, how that's trended over the last couple of quarters, where that's going into '25? And then just on the -- you had a King of the Court promotion. I thought it was really good. Can you talk about any learnings or engagement and the ability to sort of do some type of a social parlay -- social promotion again? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Thanks. Yeah. So I mean, for -- on the King of the Court promotion, it's been a real big success for us. We've been very pleased with the results. And I do think, to your point, it's something we can build on in the future. We're always trying different things. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but we try to build on principles of what works. So if we see certain types of promotions are working, we don't just say, hey, run the same promotion. We ask ourselves why and try to comp with other promotions with similar mechanics. So this is really a creation of a number of other things that we had seen working, and we had high confidence running it going into the season. So far, it's been a huge success. And then, sorry, what was the first question that you asked?\nJed Kelly: IGaming promotional velocity?\nJason Robins: Yeah. It\u2019s been pretty steady year-over-year. New customer acquisition has been up, as we noted. So with that adjusted out, it\u2019s been pretty steady year-over-year. Each year, though, we continue to see a decline because same as Sportsbook, as you have less and less new customers as an overall percentage of the mix, you\u2019re just going to naturally see decline.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nBarry Jonas: Hey, good morning. With Missouri approving OSB, curious what states you're eyeing next for OSB or even iGaming? And maybe specifically, I wanted to get your thoughts on Florida given recent comments from the Seminoles maybe opening the door for others? Thank you.\nJason Robins: I mean, it's always hard to predict states at this point. Everybody is kind of now finally turning their attention from the election to the upcoming legislative sessions next year. And so starting to have a lot of those discussions. But I think if you kind of look at where we left off last year and some of the bills that got close, obviously, got through 1 House (ph) in Texas, still some big hurdles there, but hoping that we can figure out a path. Georgia, same thing, got through the Senate. Hoping there's a path there. Minnesota got very close to the goal line last year. So hoping that we can get that one across this year. And then on the iGaming side, I think New York and Illinois are obviously two big ones we're keeping an eye on, and I think could potentially have some momentum. And then some others that I think could potentially get there in the next year or two are Maryland and North Carolina. So those are all states that we're looking at. But always going into it you think it's going to be a few, and then inevitably, some of the ones you felt good about don't pan out, and then there's some that you didn't see coming and end up having a real chance of success and maybe getting over the line. So it's early. Just came off the election. But based on kind of where the momentum was and where we were last session -- the last set of sessions, I think those are some of the ones to keep an eye on.\nBarry Jonas: Great. And any thoughts on Florida?\nJason Robins: Very encouraged to hear those comments. We really have a ton of respect for Hard Rock and for the Seminoles and Jim Allen has done a fantastic job and enjoyed spending time and getting to know him and his team. So we\u2019ll see how that all plays out. Obviously, Florida is a big state and something that we\u2019d be very excited if there were a path to be able to offer our product to customers there. But not really up to us. We\u2019ll have to see what they want to do and how the discussions progress. And obviously, if there\u2019s anything material, we\u2019ll come talk about it. But at this point, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s very far along. And there\u2019s been a lot of speculation in the press, but really, I think it\u2019s pretty early stage.\nBarry Jonas: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to start with the expectation of $850 million of free cash flow for '25, how should investors think about the use of cash, particularly for buybacks next year? And then just a follow-up on hold. We all can track what happens with certain game outcomes and how that with favorites winning, how that can negatively impact hold. Is it possible to disaggregate the total impact on hold between what was going on with team outcomes versus player props in the quarter?\nJason Robins: Yeah. Let me quickly touch on the latter and then I'll have Alan take your first question. We're not at this time breaking down the hold. But what you can probably guess is that it's a mix of both. So typically, when favorites win, it's good for the customer. And typically, when the big-name players get lots of yards and score touchdowns, it's good for the customer. So when you see in the backup tight ends and running backs get in the end zone in low-scoring games where the underdogs are winning, typically, that's good for the house. So that's how I think about it. It was a mix. And if you're going to see the type of result that we saw to start the quarter, it has to be because it was that bad. But when it swings the other way, it could swing the other way hard too. So a lot of time left in the quarter and, obviously, a lot of time left in the season. And Alan, do you want to touch on that $850 million in free cash flow and how we're thinking about that?\nAlan Ellingson: Yes. We feel really good about having positive free cash flow, not just in 2024, but the $850 million you mentioned that we\u2019re expecting in 2025. We\u2019re keeping our eyes on the markets, we expect to act responsibly. But you should expect us to be more active with repurchases in future quarters as we scale into our free cash flow and as we have more liquidity. Thank you.\nBernie McTernan: Fair enough. Thank you, both.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord. Your line is open.\nMichael Graham: Thank you. I just wanted to ask about one of your slides in the deck. You said you have 3.6 million MUPs at the end of the quarter and 9.3 million total customers. I just wanted to ask if you could update us on your strategies for reactivating customers who have not engaged recently. Is it just a matter of promotional spend, or is there -- are there other things you're doing?\nJason Robins: I'd say, it's a great question. It's a really important thing as obviously just core retention is important as the base gets bigger. And we view retention, activation, monetization as the ultimate keys to winning. Obviously, acquisition is very important too. But over the long term, it's about retaining and getting great usage and gameplay out of your customers. So definitely an important topic. I kind of look at it along two dimensions. So one are just the constant always-on type of tactics where if we see particular things that we believe either are going to lead to attrition or recent lapses in customers, we can trigger different types of CRM treatments and retargeting treatments that will go and try to get them to reactivate. And then the other factor, I would say, is really more seasonal around like event-driven activation. So think like start of NFL season as an example, or Super Bowl. And so really thinking about how do you use those moments when you know there's going to be a lot of natural reactivation in the market to get not only additional reactivation but also to make sure the natural activation you're getting as much of that as possible. I kind of think of the start of NFL season as a lot of people who maybe at one point signed up for more than 1 book are going to decide where they want to start playing in the season. So you want to make sure it\u2019s with you. And obviously, as you do that season after season, they tend to not think about it and just come back to their favorite apps. So that\u2019s a lot of what we try to do is really use those big moments to win our share of the activation and also try to drive incremental activation through CRM.\nMichael Graham: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nChad Beynon: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, with the 30% growth for '25, you have a lot of focus areas that you need to be dialed into. But Jason, I wonder if anything has changed just in terms of beginning to look at some international markets, or more importantly, when is the right time to start considering growing in other markets as top line might begin to slow if there's no legislation here in North America? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yeah. I mean definitely don't feel like it is a need. It's more of an opportunistic thing at this point. So it's not to say that if the right opportunity came about, we wouldn't pursue an international expansion strategy. But I don't think we feel like it's a need. We are still -- you noted growth, and even without a ton of new states launching next year, we\u2019re still well easily into a Rule of 40 company with over 30% growth and around a 15% EBITDA margin. So definitely feel really good about where we are from a growth perspective and don\u2019t need to look to those things, but also if the right opportunity comes along, we would be open to it. And I think, we\u2019re staying patient and waiting for the right thing.\nChad Beynon: Thank you very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jeff Stantial with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJeff Stantial: Great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our question. Jason, I wanted to drill down into a comment you made early on in the call. If I caught it correctly, you said both the volume of users acquired and the signup offer per user acquired were both up year-on-year, though promotional reinvestment, as you note, in the latter was down about 300 bps year-on-year. Is that mostly retention bonusing optimization and structural hold expansion that's driving that improvement? And then strategically, should we think about the higher nominal sign-up offer as being mostly opportunistic in the current user acquisition environment or how much is it may be informed by more what certain competitors are offering? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Sure. So a couple of things I'd point to. One, definitely have seen some improvement year-over-year on the retention side. And two, even though, yes, we did see an increase year-over-year in new customer mix -- excuse me, new customer volume, the mix actually shifted more towards existing customers just because of the growth of the retention side of the universe. So we did see both, I think, which is great, an increase, but also a shift towards a more mature customer base. And so those combinations ended up netting into some decline in overall promotion rate as well. So those are the big factors. But really for us, the expectation is that even if we do continue to see more new customers in a rapidly increasing industry, we don't actually think that it will be at a level, even in our most kind of aggressive, or, I guess, from a promotion standpoint, conservative estimates, we don't think it will reach a level where the overall mix is still not going to continue to shift more and more towards mature existing users each year. So we should continue to expect to see that drive down promotion rate each subsequent year, barring maybe a new large state opening up like if a California opened up or a Texas, that could obviously in the short-term sway. But from an existing state basis, we don't see that being the case.\nJeff Stantial: Great. And then just in terms of the second part of that question, the offer levels per user acquired, is that just opportunistically leaning in when the fish are biting or is there kind of another reason to raise the per user offer?\nJason Robins: No, we're always experimenting play. I mean our overall new user offer and the overall promotion rate for new users has not gone up. But we're always kind of shifting in and out of different offers and changing things around based on what test results say.\nJeff Stantial: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jordan Bender with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.\nJordan Bender: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The original gross margin guidance for '24 was 45% to 47%. So as we think through the bridge, on one hand, Illinois is a negative, which you've noted there should be some offset, game outcomes are onetime and Jackpocket should be actually positive to gross margin. So I'm just struggling to get why gross margins are essentially in the same place in '25 kind of blending those factors together. Is there anything else that we're missing here?\nJason Robins: I mean it\u2019s really new user growth. That\u2019s been the thing that\u2019s been driving the overall promotion level to a point where we hadn\u2019t seen quite the level of gross margin improvement we wanted. But remember, Q3, we did see a 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in gross margin. So it is definitely trending in the right direction.\nJordan Bender: Thank you very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open.\nRyan Sigdahl: Hey, good morning. How much of the $55 million of promotion optimization was because of customer-friendly sports outcomes and you just didn't have to retention, promote quite as much to them, versus an actual structural change in the promo strategy and playbook that we can run with going forward?\nJason Robins: No, it's really nothing to do with sport outcomes. It's really two things. One, some mitigation of Illinois from the tax increase. And two, we've recently made some real progress in identifying customers that are lower LTV that needed a lower level of promotion in order to make sense from an LTV perspective. So we made some optimizations there. And actually very happy to say that that resulted in basically no change to revenue, but it did drive significant adjusted EBITDA. So that\u2019s something that we really think should be more permanent. But obviously, we\u2019ll keep an eye on what happens and continue to adjust and test it accordingly.\nRyan Sigdahl: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Jason Robins for any closing remarks.\nJason Robins: Great. Thank you all for joining us on today\u2019s call. We\u2019re looking forward to a really strong finish in 2024 and are really excited and optimistic about 2025 and beyond. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you all for joining. As you can see in our results, our core value drivers are strong. In the third quarter, we acquired more online sportsbook and iGaming customers year-over-year, while CAC declined nearly 20%. Structural sportsbook hold percentage continued to increase. Our trajectory here is encouraging with NFL parlay mix tracking up more than 500 basis points year-over-year. Our promotional reinvestment rate improved by 300 basis points year-over-year as a percentage of gross gaming revenue even though we acquired more customers and had higher new customer promotions. These core value drivers collectively contributed to a 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in adjusted gross margin for the third quarter of 2024. While we experienced the most customer friendly stretch of NFL sport outcomes we've ever seen early in the fourth quarter, which pressures our revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the short-term, the overall trajectory of our business is strong. We are excited to reiterate our fiscal year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion and introduce our inaugural fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance, which calls for 31% year-over-year growth at our guidance midpoints. Even more importantly, our sportsbook product is continuing to improve, which positions us well for this NBA season and beyond. This fall, we launched new and exclusive NBA markets, specifically designed to engage customers with key game storylines and expanded our in-house same game parlay offering to more than 50 new NBA markets. We also appreciate being recognized in a recent third-party report as the number one overall sportsbook app in the U.S., ranking first in the user experience, betting interface and features categories. Our apps now ranked number one in sportsbook and numbers one and two in iGaming with the DraftKings Casino and Golden Nugget Casino brands respectively. Lastly, I'd like to touch on the Ballot initiative in Missouri. Earlier this week, Missouri voters passed a ballot initiative legalizing online sports betting in the state, following a productive and efficient campaign that was backed by a wide consortium of sports teams and gaming operators. Missouri represents approximately 2% of the U.S. population and we expect to launch our sportsbook product in the state pending market access, licensure, regulatory approvals and contractual approvals. In closing, our business fundamentals are healthy, and we are excited about our financial trajectory into 2025 and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Alan Ellingson. Thanks, Shaun. Yeah. So definitely feel 50% is about the right number long-term for flow through. I think next year, what you're seeing around 40% rather than 50% is that we have, as we've noted in the last couple of quarters been seeing unexpectedly strong customer acquisition. And that's a really great thing for the long-term potential in the TAM of the industry. But obviously, we want to be cautious next year that we don't end up underestimating customer acquisition promotions, and therefore, having a higher flow through guide than what actually materializes. So that's really the thinking behind that. As we've noted in the past, should customer acquisition slow, I think whenever that happens, there'll be some short-term adjusted EBITDA upside. So that could very well be the case in '25. Obviously, we want to see the continued customer acquisition because that bodes well for '26 and beyond. But should there be less-than-expected or I should say a slowdown in customer acquisition, could definitely be some upside to that flow-through rate that you mentioned. No. It's a great question. Obviously, the shorter the period, the more that volatility in sport outcomes can affect things. So only being about a month into Q4, I think, just the timing of when you're seeing the guide, it's obviously going to -- a month period is going to have more volatility. And as you noted, it could swing either way. Just last night, Bengals make that 2 point conversion and that last touchdown doesn't go in for a fourth parlay leg to hit for, the touchdown parlay, then it would have been very different outcome. So things can swing either way. I think certainly over longer periods of time, it normalizes. It was a little bit of a down year this year. This year, we were around -- will expect to be around 10.5% structural hold and we'll finish just over 10% actual, at least that's where we're tracking now, maybe sport outcomes will improve. But that's -- typically over the course of the year, pretty big number. So I think over a year, it's pretty smooth. And what you'll see, I think as the business evolves, right now, our adjusted EBITDA is a small percentage of our revenue as that continues to go up and we approach our long-term 30% plus margins, you're going to see the impact of sport outcomes, because they affect revenue flow through at a much -- excuse me, affect the EBITDA at a much lower percentage. Think about it this way. Next year, our adjusted EBITDA is going to double at the top end of our guidance range, but we expect revenue to grow at a just over a 30% pace. So the impact of sport outcome on revenue is obviously going to be the same, but on EBITDA could be -- excuse me, it will be about -- a little over 30% higher, but on EBITDA, it will be on a number that's 4 times bigger. So, as we scale and the business generates more and more EBITDA, these impacts will become more rounding errors, but obviously, now in a year where we're just turning positive adjusted EBITDA for the first-time in company history, it's going to be a bigger impact. So, hold was as expected in Q3. We didn't see any -- it was nice to actually have a neutral quarter, especially with NFL starting. And then, as far as Illinois goes, I think we've begun to implement some things. We're still figuring out exactly what the right levels are. But if you see sort of in the bridge that we shared, we included some promo efficiency. And within that, one of the components is some mitigation in Illinois. So we have begun to implement that, but I wouldn't say that we fully realized it and it's not a huge component of the guide next year. So potentially, some upside there depending on how things evolve. Sure. So we do bottoms up builds. So, we typically will look at cohort data. Implicit in that, I think is that market share doesn't change because we're basing our cohort data on what we've seen in the past and we're basing our customer acquisition estimates on what we've seen in the past. So I think that's going to be basically implying a flat market share. That said, we don't actually forecast it that way. It's more of a top down exercise. We say, okay, if we kept market share flat, what would this imply for market growth in sanity check it that way. On the promotional side, we've been, I think, as I noted, a little cautious with customer acquisition environment having been so hot. So that one, I think, could be, potential upside if there is slower customer acquisition, but of course, that's not as much, a benefit in 2026 and beyond, but could be some upside on the EBITDA front for next year. But we weren't too aggressive with that number. So it's not a huge component of it. So really, it's more about just kind of natural market growth, handle growth on our side and then a little bit of structural hold improvement. Yeah. It's a little more muted just because we've been cautious on the customer acquisition environment, but it's really going to depend on that. I mean, the decline is going to happen just based on the fact that the base is maturing and it's more existing users. It's just a question of how hot customer acquisition is. So I think we've been a little more cautious and have had a bit more muted of an assumption, and we'll see how that plays out. Yeah. I think it's more the latter. Obviously, as we bring on new customers, Jackpocket, there's a lot of moving parts. So one of the things that we noted in our letter is that we do intend to make some additional disclosures at the product level next year. We're still sort of sorting out exactly what those are. But I realize it's kind of confusing with the way we have it now, especially with all the different product lines that we have. So that's something we're taking a look at, so that we can hopefully provide some more useful disclosures for all of you. Sure. So obviously, with the caveat that it's still early. I do think that the users we acquired in Q3 look a lot like customers we've been acquiring recently, certainly maybe not the first year in a state cohort, but very similar to the more recent cohorts. So it seems like really the story is that, after the first year or two, you do get some decline in customer LTV, but then it seems to plateau. It doesn't really seem to be lower in years four, five, six and beyond. So that's kind of what we're seeing. But again, very early, we're basing this on, for most of these customers, only a month or two of data. So obviously, we'll see how that plays out as NBA progresses and things like that. But from what we can tell, it seems like they're very similar quality to who we've been acquiring. The biggest difference is just customer acquisition environment, because that's kind of the hardest thing for us to predict at this point. We feel very good about the models we have for our existing cohorts and have been very accurate in forecasting those Obviously, other levers like fixed costs and marketing spend are controllable. So it's really much more what does the new customer volume look like and how does that end up affecting new customer promotion levels. We have seen a little bit of evidence that handle can go up or down based on whether customers are winning or not. But it's actually not really that big a number if it is an impact at all. I think much more what we see is that people don't need to deposit as much more, but they tend to keep their betting levels at a pretty similar level. And on the margins, you see some incremental betting. But for the most part, people just continue to kind of bet as they've been betting at this point. So not something that we built into our assumptions. If there is any of that, it could be upside. Also could be some upside on the payment processing cost side because you don't need to have people depositing again if they have money in their account. So all those things could potentially create upside. But I think if it is, it's not very significant. So we haven't built it into the guide. Sure. Yeah. So I mean, I think the general story is that, in Q3, we kind of performed as expected. And Q4, outside of sport outcomes, all the fundamentals are pointing towards exactly kind of what we thought, maybe even a little bit better going into Q3 and Q4. So there is maybe some reason to feel more optimism. Obviously, we also got stung by sport outcomes. So I think between that and also wanting to be cautious on customer acquisition, we didn't feel comfortable raising the guide at this point. But we do see some really interesting things with parlay mix being up 500 basis points year-over-year in NFL, and NBA off to a very strong start from a mix perspective, that do give us some confidence that there could be some upside. But right now, we feel like with the data we have, this is the right place to be in, and felt like the real macro story was maybe a little upside, but more so that we really reaffirmed over the last couple of quarters all the key fundamentals that led us to feel $900 million to $1 billion was the right number. Yeah. I think it's a very interesting thing. The market within that that's dominant is election markets, of course, and particularly during presidential elections. So I know there's a lot of attention on it over the last few weeks. And I do think there could be a place for it outside of elections, but that's really where the interest seems to be now from a demand -- customer demand side. So definitely something we're looking at in advance of next presidential election and potentially there will be an opportunity to look at something sooner. It is a different framework. It's not licensed as a betting product, it's licensed as financial market. So it's definitely a very different thing. So we'll have to see where it fits in the priority list. But it is something we'll plan on looking at ahead of next election for sure. Yeah. So great question. I think on the first one, as we noted, we are fairly cautious with customer acquisition from a promotional budgeting perspective, but we also are not counting on a lot of volume from customers that we acquire. It's mostly existing customers. So I think that's really been built up from years and years of cohort data, and we feel very good about those assumptions. And then, of course, as we noted, we expect structural hold to be around 11% next year. So that's another key assumption that we have. And then I think -- I'm sorry, what was your second question? Yeah. It's a great. So I mean a lot of it is product. We've introduced a lot of new features. We have live SGP markets across NFL, NBA and other sports now. So a lot of it is just product and product availability. I think we've really increased our abilities around merchandising and creating interesting player props and combinations of player props into prepacked parlays, and I think that's been a factor. So it's a number of things, our marketing approach. It's a lot of different pieces moving towards that objective that have driven it. As far as does that carryover in other sports, definitely have some encouraging early signs in NBA that we're seeing. And for us, that's the other big one, right, because May (ph) is the other big sport, but also it's the sport that has such a heavy SGP mix in general and it's just naturally player oriented as a sport. So that's a big one. And then baseball, we're also very excited about that being a driver of parlay mix and baseball too. We really pushed on touchdowns this year. I think homeruns is a good analogy for that in baseball. So definitely a lot of translatable insights, I think, but obviously, each sport is different too. So we'll have to see as each season starts how it goes. Yeah. I mean I think we -- because it's hard to predict, we really try to, from a cost perspective, approach it cautiously. But then in terms of the revenue, we would be counting on, not count on a huge year for customer acquisition. So we tried to kind of be cautious on both sides of the equation, and that's how you approach anything, I think, when it's hard to predict. The other thing I'd note is that the addition of Jackpocket, which really we only have for about half a year, a little over half a year, also makes a big difference. And this year, there were no big jackpots. So I think that's not normal. Last year, there were three, I think $1 billion (ph) plus jackpots. So we also want to make sure that, if we get some big jackpots in the lottery next year, we have some customer acquisition budget for that. And just remember, even that alone, going from half a year-ish, a little more than half a year to a full year is also more marketing and more new customers. So that's part of the story as well. You are about right. Good math work. Yeah. I think that's what we feel, we have the line of sight to commit to right now. And it's more of how we view our commitment than what we really want to achieve. Our internal goals will certainly be higher than that. But as we think about what we want to guide, and not even being into 2025 yet, just wanted to make sure that we really only committed to something that we are highly confident in based on what we know right now. Yeah. It's a great question. So I mean, Simple Bet's been a partner of ours for a while. So a lot of this was, one, about bringing a cost in-house, and two, really being able to take it to the next level. So we do have a lot of micro-betting offerings now, but I think a lot of what we're going to develop going into next year will really be at the top of the market and I think will separate us and really differentiate us on the live betting side. And it won't just be micros, there are all sorts of live betting and derivative markets that Simple Bet will help us with. So we're very excited about that. I think as you think about the impact on hold, live betting does have lower hold rates. So as we mix more into live betting, it will naturally have some impact on lowering the overall average hold. But obviously, we believe it's highly incremental volume. So that's a good thing. And at the same time, the other lever is we do believe that there's places that we have the opportunity to move live betting hold rate up. So while as a whole it's lower, we might be able to offset any of the mix shift and maybe even offset it to the positive with having actually higher hold rates within the live betting in pockets where it's not high enough today. So those are all things I think Simple Bet will really help us with. And then obviously, on the pre-match side, we'll continue to push hard on parlay mix. And I think overall, we expect, as we noted, structural hold to go up, but it will certainly be a mix of live betting and overall kind of performance on the pre-match side. Yeah. It's actually not too different. The retention in sports betting is naturally a little bit better, but it's not as different as you might think. And from our perspective, we view our iGaming offering as top of the market. We have -- we've noted been rated the number one and number two ranked apps and product quality for DraftKings and the Golden Nugget brands, respectively. And we think our iGaming app is clearly head and shoulders the best product. So I do think that you're right, it's a bit more competitive. And so naturally, there's a little bit more fragmentation. But if you look at our share in iGaming, it's not that much lower than our share in sports betting. And we expect that to have some upside too as we continue to improve the product. Yeah. I do think, to your last point, that is an opportunity. And I'm glad you brought up the Investor Day. I think that we were a little conservative in the Investor Day in terms of the overall industry growth. I believe we are around 9% CAGR and flat share. So what we're seeing is that the growth is just much stronger. And as you noted, we're actually going to be where we thought we'd be in 2026 and 2025 with much stronger customer acquisition and continued growth. So I think there is some upside there. And obviously, that means that the flow through is going to have to catch up as the growth slows down in the outer years. But I think right now, we're seeing really encouraging signs that the TAM is bigger than probably we thought when we did the Investor Day. And as you noted, we're already a year ahead of where we thought we'd be. Yeah. To your first question, it's really mix driven. And I think we can get there based on just the mix shifts we're seeing, albeit, obviously, there's some assumptions around which sports they're likely to transfer into. For example, we are not expecting next year nearly the mix shift in college sports because they tend to be less player prop oriented and, therefore, less parlay heavy. But with the kind of nuances aside, I think, yes, we can get there based on the mix shift we're seeing. And I think that, with the path to 12%, 13% is really mix driven. I mean there's other things, of course, on the margin you can always do to improve your sharp modeling, improve your risk mitigation, things like that, but 90% plus of that is just mix. So we're continuing to focus on that. It's been a real great point of success this year. We feel like we have a great plan going into next year, drive it even higher. And it's exciting to know that there's a clear path to getting much higher on hold rate. And we think that is actually a big upside lever of the business that maybe people aren't counting on. Thanks. Yeah. So I mean, for -- on the King of the Court promotion, it's been a real big success for us. We've been very pleased with the results. And I do think, to your point, it's something we can build on in the future. We're always trying different things. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but we try to build on principles of what works. So if we see certain types of promotions are working, we don't just say, hey, run the same promotion. We ask ourselves why and try to comp with other promotions with similar mechanics. So this is really a creation of a number of other things that we had seen working, and we had high confidence running it going into the season. So far, it's been a huge success. And then, sorry, what was the first question that you asked? Yeah. It's been pretty steady year-over-year. New customer acquisition has been up, as we noted. So with that adjusted out, it's been pretty steady year-over-year. Each year, though, we continue to see a decline because same as Sportsbook, as you have less and less new customers as an overall percentage of the mix, you're just going to naturally see decline. I mean, it's always hard to predict states at this point. Everybody is kind of now finally turning their attention from the election to the upcoming legislative sessions next year. And so starting to have a lot of those discussions. But I think if you kind of look at where we left off last year and some of the bills that got close, obviously, got through 1 House (ph) in Texas, still some big hurdles there, but hoping that we can figure out a path. Georgia, same thing, got through the Senate. Hoping there's a path there. Minnesota got very close to the goal line last year. So hoping that we can get that one across this year. And then on the iGaming side, I think New York and Illinois are obviously two big ones we're keeping an eye on, and I think could potentially have some momentum. And then some others that I think could potentially get there in the next year or two are Maryland and North Carolina. So those are all states that we're looking at. But always going into it you think it's going to be a few, and then inevitably, some of the ones you felt good about don't pan out, and then there's some that you didn't see coming and end up having a real chance of success and maybe getting over the line. So it's early. Just came off the election. But based on kind of where the momentum was and where we were last session -- the last set of sessions, I think those are some of the ones to keep an eye on. Very encouraged to hear those comments. We really have a ton of respect for Hard Rock and for the Seminoles and Jim Allen has done a fantastic job and enjoyed spending time and getting to know him and his team. So we'll see how that all plays out. Obviously, Florida is a big state and something that we'd be very excited if there were a path to be able to offer our product to customers there. But not really up to us. We'll have to see what they want to do and how the discussions progress. And obviously, if there's anything material, we'll come talk about it. But at this point, I wouldn't say that it's very far along. And there's been a lot of speculation in the press, but really, I think it's pretty early stage. Yeah. Let me quickly touch on the latter and then I'll have Alan take your first question. We're not at this time breaking down the hold. But what you can probably guess is that it's a mix of both. So typically, when favorites win, it's good for the customer. And typically, when the big-name players get lots of yards and score touchdowns, it's good for the customer. So when you see in the backup tight ends and running backs get in the end zone in low-scoring games where the underdogs are winning, typically, that's good for the house. So that's how I think about it. It was a mix. And if you're going to see the type of result that we saw to start the quarter, it has to be because it was that bad. But when it swings the other way, it could swing the other way hard too. So a lot of time left in the quarter and, obviously, a lot of time left in the season. And Alan, do you want to touch on that $850 million in free cash flow and how we're thinking about that? I'd say, it's a great question. It's a really important thing as obviously just core retention is important as the base gets bigger. And we view retention, activation, monetization as the ultimate keys to winning. Obviously, acquisition is very important too. But over the long term, it's about retaining and getting great usage and gameplay out of your customers. So definitely an important topic. I kind of look at it along two dimensions. So one are just the constant always-on type of tactics where if we see particular things that we believe either are going to lead to attrition or recent lapses in customers, we can trigger different types of CRM treatments and retargeting treatments that will go and try to get them to reactivate. And then the other factor, I would say, is really more seasonal around like event-driven activation. So think like start of NFL season as an example, or Super Bowl. And so really thinking about how do you use those moments when you know there's going to be a lot of natural reactivation in the market to get not only additional reactivation but also to make sure the natural activation you're getting as much of that as possible. I kind of think of the start of NFL season as a lot of people who maybe at one point signed up for more than 1 book are going to decide where they want to start playing in the season. So you want to make sure it's with you. And obviously, as you do that season after season, they tend to not think about it and just come back to their favorite apps. So that's a lot of what we try to do is really use those big moments to win our share of the activation and also try to drive incremental activation through CRM. Yeah. I mean definitely don't feel like it is a need. It's more of an opportunistic thing at this point. So it's not to say that if the right opportunity came about, we wouldn't pursue an international expansion strategy. But I don't think we feel like it's a need. We are still -- you noted growth, and even without a ton of new states launching next year, we're still well easily into a Rule of 40 company with over 30% growth and around a 15% EBITDA margin. So definitely feel really good about where we are from a growth perspective and don't need to look to those things, but also if the right opportunity comes along, we would be open to it. And I think, we're staying patient and waiting for the right thing. Sure. So a couple of things I'd point to. One, definitely have seen some improvement year-over-year on the retention side. And two, even though, yes, we did see an increase year-over-year in new customer mix -- excuse me, new customer volume, the mix actually shifted more towards existing customers just because of the growth of the retention side of the universe. So we did see both, I think, which is great, an increase, but also a shift towards a more mature customer base. And so those combinations ended up netting into some decline in overall promotion rate as well. So those are the big factors. But really for us, the expectation is that even if we do continue to see more new customers in a rapidly increasing industry, we don't actually think that it will be at a level, even in our most kind of aggressive, or, I guess, from a promotion standpoint, conservative estimates, we don't think it will reach a level where the overall mix is still not going to continue to shift more and more towards mature existing users each year. So we should continue to expect to see that drive down promotion rate each subsequent year, barring maybe a new large state opening up like if a California opened up or a Texas, that could obviously in the short-term sway. But from an existing state basis, we don't see that being the case. No, we're always experimenting play. I mean our overall new user offer and the overall promotion rate for new users has not gone up. But we're always kind of shifting in and out of different offers and changing things around based on what test results say. I mean it's really new user growth. That's been the thing that's been driving the overall promotion level to a point where we hadn't seen quite the level of gross margin improvement we wanted. But remember, Q3, we did see a 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in gross margin. So it is definitely trending in the right direction. No, it's really nothing to do with sport outcomes. It's really two things. One, some mitigation of Illinois from the tax increase. And two, we've recently made some real progress in identifying customers that are lower LTV that needed a lower level of promotion in order to make sense from an LTV perspective. So we made some optimizations there. And actually very happy to say that that resulted in basically no change to revenue, but it did drive significant adjusted EBITDA. So that's something that we really think should be more permanent. But obviously, we'll keep an eye on what happens and continue to adjust and test it accordingly. Great. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We're looking forward to a really strong finish in 2024 and are really excited and optimistic about 2025 and beyond. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon."

            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed further in our SEC filings that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecasts. We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements other than as required by law. During this call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings' operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings release and presentation, which can be found on our website and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on the business. Following Jason's remarks, I will provide a review of our financials. We will then open the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins. Thank you, Jason. I'll hit the highlights, including our third quarter performance and our fiscal year 2024 and 2025 guidance. Please note that all income statement measures discussed, except for revenue are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, our business fundamentals were healthy in the third quarter. We grew revenue 39% year-over-year to $1.95 million and generated a $59 million adjusted EBITDA loss. Our online sportsbook gross gaming revenue increased 39% and iGaming gross gaming revenue grew 26% when compared to the third quarter of 2023. Newly acquired online sportsbook and iGaming customers increased 14% year-over-year, while our CAC for these customers improved nearly 20% year-over-year. Structural sportsbook hold percentages increased year-over-year as customers continue to enjoy our parlay offerings. Promotional reinvestment rates for our online sportsbook and iGaming improved by 300 basis points year-over-year as we reduced promotions for lower value customer segments and began to mitigate the impact of the Illinois tax increase. Adjusted gross margin was above our expectations at 40% and increased 300 basis points year-over-year. Looking ahead, I'll briefly comment on our fiscal year 2024 guidance before discussing our expectations for fiscal year 2025. On August 1, 2024, we guided fiscal year 2024 revenues of $5.05 billion to $5.25 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $340 million to $420 million. Our third quarter financial performance was consistent with our expectations. NFL outcomes early in the fourth quarter, however, have resulted in headwinds to revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $250 million and $175 million respectively. We have also made significant progress in identifying customers with lower lifetime values across our footprint and are improving our expectation for promotions for the remainder of the fiscal year 2024 accordingly. And we are continuing to drive expense efficiency throughout the organization as we balance growth and profitability. As a result, we now expect fiscal year 2024 revenues of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion and fiscal year adjusted EBITDA of $240 million to $280 million. Moving on to our fiscal year 2025 guidance. In November 2023, we stated our expectation that fiscal year 2025 adjusted EBITDA would be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion. We reiterated this expectation in August. Given strong underlying momentum in our core value drivers, we continue to expect fiscal year 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $900 million to $1 billion. Today, we are introducing a fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance range of $6.2 billion to $6.6 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 27% to 35% compared to our updated fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance midpoint. We expect structural sportsbook hold percentage of 11% in fiscal year 2025 with further upside in fiscal year 2026 and beyond. We expect our fiscal year 2025 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 45% to 47%. We expect stock based compensation expense to represent approximately 6% of revenue in fiscal year 2025. Additionally, we expect the bridge between adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to be $100 million, and therefore, expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $850 million in fiscal year 2025. That concludes our remarks, and we will now open the line for questions. Yes. We feel really good about having positive free cash flow, not just in 2024, but the $850 million you mentioned that we're expecting in 2025. We're keeping our eyes on the markets, we expect to act responsibly. But you should expect us to be more active with repurchases in future quarters as we scale into our free cash flow and as we have more liquidity. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Alan Ellingson, DraftKings' Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.\nAlan Ellingson: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

Following Jason's remarks, I will provide a review of our financials. We will then open the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins.\nJason Robins: Good morning, and thank you all for joining. There are five key points that I'd like to focus on during our call today. First, we are achieving strong and efficient customer acquisition. New OSB and iGaming customers increased nearly 80% year-over-year, while cap declined more than 40% year-over-year in the second quarter, a period with no new state launches. We anticipate the healthy customer acquisition environment to continue through the back half of the year and possibly beyond, which may indicate that the US online gaming opportunity could be even larger than we previously thought. Second, we believe we have a reasonable solution for high tax states, including Illinois. We plan to implement a gaming tax surcharge in the four states that have multiple sports betting operators and tax rates above 20% starting January 1, 2025. We believe additional upside potentially exists for adjusted EBITDA in 2025 and beyond from this gaming tax surcharge. Third, the Jackpocket integration is off to a great start. We are on track to hit the multiyear guidance for the transaction that we provided in announcement and expect the deal to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in the fiscal year 2025. Fourth, we are excited about the future and are reiterating our expectation for $900 million to $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2025. Finally, we said last quarter that we would provide an update on capital allocation. We are pleased to announce that our Board authorized a share repurchase of up to $1 billion of our Class A common stock. This inaugural authorization reflects our conviction in the strong trajectory of our business and our expectation that we will generate significant free cash flow in the coming years. I'd also like to emphasize that all of us at DraftKings are very excited for the start of football season. Our product is in a great position as we are continuing to differentiate ourselves by investing in new features and functionality for Sportsbook and iGaming. In Sportsbook, we recently launched in-house player prop wagers for NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, college football, college basketball, and tennis. We also broadened our progressive parlays to include spread and total wagers. In addition, we plan to integrate a bet and watch experience with NFL streaming. In iGaming, the DraftKings and Golden Nugget Online Gaming apps were ranked number one and number two overall in a recent third party survey. We are on track to double the number of new games we will release this year compared to last year and recently improved our interface to promote game discoverability. In closing, our business fundamentals are very healthy and we are excited about the second half of 2024 and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Alan Ellingson.\nAlan Ellingson: Thank you, Jason. I'll hit the financial highlights, including our second quarter 2024 performance and our updated guidance. Please note that all income statement measures discussed, except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, our business fundamentals were strong in the second quarter. We generated $1.104 billion of revenue, representing 26% year-over-year growth and $128 million of adjusted EBITDA. Importantly, customer acquisition exceeded our expectations as new to DraftKings, OSB and iGaming customers increased nearly 80% year-over-year. Customer retention and engagement were healthy and resulted in handle that exceeded our expectations. Handle was strong even with fewer than anticipated NBA playoff games. Structural Sportsbook hold percent improved year-over-year in line with our expectations to approximately 10%. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 43%, primarily due to better than expected customer acquisition and the corresponding promotional reinvestment. Operating expenses, including sales and marketing, products and technology, and general and administrative expenses were consistent with our expectations as we continued to balance revenue growth with operating efficiency across the organization. Moving on to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $5.050 billion to $5.250 billion from a range of $4.800 billion to $5 billion. The updated range equates to year-over-year growth of 38% to 43%. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by strong customer acquisition, engagement and retention trends for our existing customers as well as the inclusion of Jackpocket and our recent launch of Sportsbook in Washington, DC. We are also revising our fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $340 million to $420 million from the range of $460 million to $540 million. The revision takes into account Illinois raising its Sportsbook tax rate, strong new customer acquisition expectations, as well as the prior mentioned inclusion of Jackpocket and our recent Sportsbook launch in Washington, DC. From fiscal year 2024, we now expect our adjusted gross margin to increase modestly. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase at a mid to high single digit rate year-over-year. The increase is primarily due to the investments in Jackpocket brand. We continue to expect the bridge between adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to be approximately $100 million based on approximately $120 million of annual capital expenditure and capitalized software development costs, as well as a modest source of cash from changes in net working capital combined with interest income. And we continue to expect 2024 stock-based compensation expense to be flat to down in dollar terms on a year-over-year basis and represents approximately 7% of revenue in fiscal year 2024. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2025, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $900 million to $1 billion due to our underlying business momentum, including the benefit of higher customer acquisitions in the second half of 2024. We believe additional upside potential exists when we apply the gaming tax surcharge in those noted high tax states that have multiple online Sportsbook operators, which we are not including at this time. We expect to provide more details on our fiscal year 2025 guidance with our next earnings report in November. That concludes our remarks. We will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Thank you, and good morning. I appreciate all the information. What I was really hoping to do was just talk about the surcharge for a moment, which is an interesting strategy, and how you thought about the degree to which competitors may or may not follow, and how you react under those circumstances? Just flushing out the strategy a bit more would be really helpful.\nJason Robins: Thank you, David. Great question. I think every company has to do what's best for their own business. I think we believe this is what's best for us. And I would imagine that if that's our calculus, then others would come to the same conclusion. But we really don't know and we'll have to see. And, obviously, there might be other ways, too, that -- other ideas for how to implement something like this that might be better than what we came up with. We thought through this quite a bit, but you never know. So we do have some time between now and January 1st, and we'll see what happens.\nDavid Katz: Right. Interesting. And as a quick follow up, just with respect to putting the surcharge aside, if we think about the impact that we should be reflecting in our models for Illinois, assuming no surcharge, any help, Alan, as to how we might sort of think through that impact and include it for the future, just a lot going on in there?\nJason Robins: I'll answer quickly and then Alan can add any detail. But I think the best way to think about it is the overperformance that we are seeing with customer acquisition. The launch of Washington, DC, our expectation for Jackpocket to deliver positive EBIT next -- EBITDA next year, as well as underlying trends with our existing customers and outperformance on the handle side. All should offset the Illinois tax increase next year. So even if we don't get any benefit from the fee, we will see still $900 million to $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA next year.\nDavid Katz: Yes. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with BofA. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Jason or Alan, I think a lot of the rest of the subject of the sort of update here is about the increased customer acquisition environment. Obviously, some of the continued investments you're making. So the impact here seems to be -- the net is obviously higher revenue expectations and lower profit flow throughs. Specifically asking about kind of 2025 to start, just the implied -- the implied guidance right now implies some reacceleration. You haven't -- I don't think, you've given explicit revenue guidance. That seems to be kind of the undertone here. So what in your mind would kind of cause the environment to change from where we're at today? And if it doesn't, what would some of the offsets potentially be for DraftKings as we kind of move into next year? And, let's say, the customer acquisition environment remains rich and you continue to see strong adds there? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yes. It's a great question. Just to explain a little bit about what's going on. One, even if we didn't spend another dime on marketing, new customers -- get new customer promotions. So, you're right, that has a drag on revenue and EBITDA, and we're seeing enough outperformance on the revenue side elsewhere that while it certainly hit the bottom line a little bit or will for the remainder of the year, it didn't actually. We're still seeing improved revenue. So that just kind of demonstrates, I think, the underlying strength of the business and the customers that we're seeing. So when you kind of put all that together next year, we do expect to get a little bit more revenue, because we'll need that to offset -- in order to make the math work that's needed to offset the Illinois gaming tax increase. So that's kind of how you get to the $900 million to $1 billion. And then any additional upside beyond that Illinois gaming tax amount would be either revenue driven or from the impact of the fee that we're instituting in those four states. And then as far as the potential for hot customer acquisition next year, that can always happen. Right now, we feel we've built in some degree of the increased trends we're seeing. And obviously, a lot of that will depend on if there's more state launches and things like that. So, I think, you could sort of think of this as a same state basis type of thing again. And obviously, if there's more state launches next year and more customer acquisition investment, then that might change things a bit. But that just means bigger numbers longer term over the following year. So, I think, that's the right way to think about it. But as of today, I see no reason to think that on a same state basis, we would -- we wouldn't be able to deliver $900 million to $1 billion in EBITDA -- in adjusted EBITDA next year.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling: Hi. Thanks. Just want to maybe follow up on Shaun's question, but ask it in a different way. Are you seeing any change in the cost to sustain and engage existing players? And also on the new customer acquisition, is that primarily coming from new states? Are you still seeing even greater uptick from existing states?\nJason Robins: So we are not seeing an increase in the existing player cost. It's all new player driven and mix driven, so meaning, mix of new players to existing. And interestingly, it really is across the board. So certainly we got some boost from North Carolina having launched in late Q1. But if you remember, last year we had two big states, Ohio and Massachusetts, launched in Q1. So this year there were less new state launches around this timeframe and none in Q2. We did have DC launch recently, but that didn't affect the Q2 numbers that was in July. So really it has to come from existing states if you look at it that way. And then it's really across products, too. We did see some particular strength in the Golden Nugget brand as we migrated onto the DraftKings platform and product. We definitely saw a boost in conversion and got some lift on there. But really it's been across states, across products.\nStephen Grambling: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, everybody.\nJason Robins: Hi.\nJoe Greff: Jason, just wanted to ask on the higher new user acquisition cost plans in the second half of this year. How much of this is offense, meaning, to grow the new user base versus defense versus impacting the competition? And then my follow-up to that is, you mentioned that presently the customer acquisition environment is healthy. What if that environment changes to the downside? How do you react? How do you pivot?\nJason Robins: Yes, great questions. I mean, we, I think, have been very consistent in that. We don't react competitively. We make decisions based on our three-year payback rule and what our data says our customer acquisition spend is returning. So as we noted, we had an over 80% increase -- an almost -- excuse me, 80% increase in new players in Q2 year-over-year and an over 40% CAC decline. I mean, those are just massive numbers, right? So when you or me looking at those numbers, your marketing team is coming to you and saying we can deliver more productive spend with the same type of results, it's hard to say no to that, right? And we've been monitoring cohort quality. I mean, everything looks really, really solid. So, I think, it's just a particularly strong environment right now. The market is growing quickly. I think, it's just really -- you've got to fish when the fish are biting, so to speak. So, I think, that's the way to think about it. It's absolutely offensive and really more so just kind of following the data. And by the same token to your second question, if it goes the other way, we'll follow it back the other way. So the good news for us is the vast majority of our marketing spend is flexible. We can move in and out of it very quickly. A lot of it's digital. Even the TV we can move out of in a matter of days, usually. So, really it's quite easy for us to make adjustments as we see what's working and at what levels. And same way that when the data is telling us we should be investing deeper, because the paybacks are really strong, if we start to see the opposite or if we start to see a decline in cohort quality, we can easily adjust there.\nJoe Greff: Great. And Alan, when do you start becoming a cash taxpayer with the gaming? And what's the corporate tax -- cash corporate tax rate in 2026?\nAlan Ellingson: We'll probably start paying a minimum amount of cash taxes in 2025 and 2026, but we don't expect to run through all of our NOLs until 2027 or 2028 at the soonest.\nJoe Greff: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Clark Lampen with BTIG. Your line is open.\nClark Lampen: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question.\nJason Robins: Good morning.\nClark Lampen: Jason, I want to come back to the sort of customer acquisition topic and the comments you made around existing state performance. I'm curious, I guess, in absence of obvious changes, I guess from last quarter to this one, from like a launch dynamic standpoint, what's creating, I guess, the sort of more favorable environment that you're leaning into. Is it sort of more of a push factor where CACs have come down enough, where it makes sense to spend more and you can actually reach customer cohorts that you weren't previously addressing, or is something sort of ticked up in terms of interest that suggests the TAM maybe really is expanding at a faster pace than we expected right now?\nJason Robins: Yes. It's a great question and hard to exactly pinpoint, but I think it's a combination of both the things that you said, primarily. So, one, as we've increased our state footprint, we've talked about this for years now, how this is kind of the gift that keeps on giving. We see the same cost from a national marketing perspective, regardless of how many states we're operating in. But the bigger your footprint, the more bang for your buck you're getting for it. So as we've grown our state footprint, you're absolutely right, it just continues to improve our efficiency, which allows us to unlock the ability to reach a little bit deeper and spend a little bit more in pockets that weren't meeting our payback thresholds previously. Secondly, I do think that there's just a ton of momentum in the industry right now. Lots of buzz coming up with NFL season. It's only going to get bigger, because this is the most busy time of year for us typically from a customer acquisition perspective, I guess the Super bowl, but the whole NFL, kind of NBA, that whole fall timeframe is usually the biggest overall period. And, really, I see no reason to think that that's going to slow down. Obviously, as noted earlier, we're going to be very closely monitoring the data and if we see any changes, we'll adjust our spend and adjust our approach. But right now, I think, if anything, you'd expect it to build, because we're in really the least busy time of year and we're still seeing very strong customer acquisition. So, I don't know why that would slow down going into the busiest time of year.\nClark Lampen: Understood. I have a follow up also for Alan, I guess, on the repurchase that was announced today. Alan, you guys just wrote a fairly large check for Jackpocket. There have been some rumors of other sort of smaller scale deals. Football season last year was a pretty good reminder of result swings and the potential for sort of intra-quarter outflows. Is it fair to think that, I guess, utilization of that buyback authorization might be more of a 2025 event? And if so, is this something that's going to be more formulaic in nature or would you hope to be a little bit more tactical and take advantage of the bigger dislocations, I guess, in the stock price? Thank you.\nAlan Ellingson: I think we anticipate being able to buyback the $1 billion of Class A shares over the next two to three years. And we would like to be -- ideally be formulaic with it create some consistency. But I do expect it to take more than just the next little while to get fully finalized.\nJason Robins: Yes. And it will be a mix. I mean, we'll have certainly some flexibility, as you noted, to take advantage of any dislocations in the share price. But as Alan noted, I think the bulk of it will be formulaic.\nClark Lampen: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nRobert Fishman: Hi. Good morning. Curious, are you guys seeing any signs of consumer weakness in your -- some of your older states, maybe? And how would you think about the impact on OSB and iGaming if we see any more of macro headwinds in the next couple of quarters? And then shifting gears a little bit, given the expected integration of the bet-and-watch experience with the NFL streaming, curious did you see anything last year? Some of your competitors did, I think, have this functionality. So anything that you learned last year about the NFL season that pushed you into this product enhancement? And any early thoughts about exploring these rights for the NBA? Thank you.\nJason Robins: Yes. I think, on your first question, we're seeing absolutely no signs of any weakness in the consumer whatsoever. Hard to know how much of that is unique to our industry versus macro, but really on our end, we're seeing super strong, healthy cohort behavior across the board. And as noted, customer acquisition is really at an all-time high as well. So everything looks really good on that front for us. On the bet-and-watch side, it wasn't really that we saw anything last year and anything our competitors did. It was more that we wanted to do this all along. It's a great thing that we think will add a lot of value to our customers doing live betting, just didn't make the cut. We had so many other great things that we were trying to get done last year. And, I think, to do it in a sort of haphazard way wasn't our style. We want to do it right, so we really wanted to make sure it wasn't just some kind of hack together integration of a video feed. But it was a true experience that we are creating, because if somebody tries it, we want them to say, this is great, and come back and get one shot at a first impression. So, I think, we felt like between the other things that we had on our roadmap and our desire to make sure we did this in the right way, we decided it would be better off for this coming season.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next set of question. Our next question comes from Ben Miller with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBen Miller: Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just back on the gaming tax surcharge, can you just talk about the thought process behind using a surcharge as the mitigation measure as opposed to a more discreet lever? And then are there any insights you can share around customer behavior from any A/B Testing that you might have done in advance of announcing this? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Sure. So definitely discussed and thought through a lot of different ways of doing it. And as I said, some better idea comes along. We're open to it. I think the important thing is that, if you look at sort of the way it's typically done in other industries, whether it'd be hotel taxes or even the sales tax that you pay when you buy something at the store, taxis, you name it. It's typically line itemed out separately and usually 100% passed along to the consumer. In this case, we're obviously subsidizing a chunk of it. So, we just thought that was most sort of in line with how it's typically done versus trying to obfuscate it, which also isn't consistent with our commitment to be transparent to our customers and be very customer friendly in everything we do. So, I know there's maybe benefit to hiding it, because maybe people don't notice, but I think over the long term customers appreciate transparency and even if they don't love that, their state implemented a high tax and some of that is being passed along. I think they prefer that to not knowing if it were buried in the pricing or something else.\nBen Miller: Was there any A/B testing that you guys done that you could share any customer behavior from that?\nJason Robins: No, we haven't. We actually -- still there's work to do to implement it and I think it's hard to A/B test something like that. What we are doing is we're launching in four states, so we'll certainly see the impact there. And, obviously, it won't be a perfect A/B test, but I think that we have enough comparable data from other states and enough of an understanding of what we would expect from consumer behavior that, I think, will have a pretty clean read on the impact. But it is a nominal amount. If you look at the materials we provided in the investor presentation, for Illinois, for example, if you made $10 bet to win $20, it would be a 37-ish -- 30 something cent. I forget the exact number charged. So, obviously, some people might just react negatively to the idea of being charged at all. But it's really fairly nominal and it makes a huge difference in our ability to make a reasonable margin and also more importantly to compete with the illegal market, which pays no taxes and has the ability to invest 100% of their revenue into product and other things. So for us to be able to be competitive with the illegal market and invest properly in product and customer experience in a state that has a very high tax rate, we feel this is an important step that consumers will ultimately understand. And if they feel the product and experience is better, then they'd rather pay for that than somewhere else that maybe doesn't have as stronger product.\nBen Miller: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: Thanks. Yes. I wanted to ask, when you think about strategy in Latin America, is that something you would pursue sort of organically or something that you might look to use M&A to get a stake in that market? And then just a quick follow-up question on the earlier commentary about the increased acquisition -- customer acquisition. Your market share looked pretty consistent year-over-year. I guess, how should we think about what's the time lag between the higher customer acquisition and that showing up in the market share numbers? Thank you.\nJason Robins: So, a couple things. One, answering your question on Latin America, we would probably not do it organically if we were to pursue, it would be through M&A. That said, we don't currently have any plans to do that either. I think, we're really focused, as we've noted in the past, on winning the US online gaming opportunity. In fact, just in the last couple of months, we divested VSiN, we shuttered Reignmakers. So, I mean, we're more focused than ever on our core. And I think that's just been a mantra and a theme throughout the company is focus, focus, focus. So definitely want to make that point. But were we to do something, I think it would likely be through M&A for that very reason we don't want to take a big chunk of our brain trust here and distract them with something like that. And then, I'm sorry -- oh, second question on share. So hard to know exactly, because I would assume that if we're seeing robust customer acquisition, then our competitors are as well. So, I don't know if that's unique to us. If it were unique to us, it should show up pretty quickly within a quarter or two of acquiring the customers. But I think the caveat is, my guess is that the entire market, the entire industry is experiencing very strong customer acquisition right now, because -- well, I guess there could be some things, like in the case of the Golden Nugget migration, that we're getting a little bit of an extra boost from, but for the most part we're seeing it across states, across products. So, I think, it's more of a macro industry trend as much as anything else.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDan Politzer: Hey, good morning, everyone. First one, in terms of that stronger customer acquisition retention engagement, if I just look at your slide deck, it's a positive revenue of about $177 million, but a drag in terms of EBITDA. But that compares with your first quarter, where it was -- both of those figures were positive, right? They would add incremental adjusted EBITDA. So, I guess, the question is, is there any way to kind of break out this -- the $23 million EBITDA loss as part of your bridge as it relates to better monetization of existing customers versus maybe the drag of acquiring new customers?\nJason Robins: Yes. It's a great question. I mean, I think that the best way to think about it is if you assume that the incremental revenue from existing customers flows through somewhere in the 50-ish percent range, maybe a little bit higher, but somewhere around there, then you can kind of back into what comes from each.\nDan Politzer: Got it. And then --\nJason Robins: And the other thing I note, too, and I just want to make sure people understand this as well, because I think it's an important point. When we talk about revising EBITDA guidance and incremental customer acquisition cost, even if we didn't spend any more money on marketing, new customer promos come from just more customers coming in. So if we under forecast it, which in this case we did, the number of new customers that we expect to acquire this year, then even if we spent zero more dollars on advertising, on marketing, we would still see a headwind, which is in that line you're mentioning from new customer promos, because just more people signing up means more new customer promos. So, that's a good thing. It's not a bad thing. Obviously, it creates more profit over the long term, but it's something that really is not within our control. And, I think, a good long term element of what we believe is a large and growing TAM. But in the end, unless we took away new customer offers, which we would never do, that's something that we can't really control.\nDan Politzer: Got it. And then just quickly for my follow up on the surcharge. In those states that you're going to implement that, are there additional steps that you're going to implement as well, such as marketing reductions or any other levers you can pull in Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, to maybe offset some of the higher taxes?\nJason Robins: Yes. I think part of the idea is to do this in place of that, so we can continue to invest in the state. I think, New York is a great example where everyone -- all companies have, including DraftKings, have pulled back heavily on promotions and in state marketing investment. And, I think, that's fine, that's one way of doing it. But another way is to say, look, I'm going to adjust so that we're effectively at a 20% tax rate, which is in line with a lot of other states, and I'm going to invest at the level that I would invest in a 20% tax rate state. We'll have to see which one works better, but my guess is that that's going to work better, because it allows us to make the investments in product and promotions and marketing and all the other things that should continue to create long term growth.\nDan Politzer: Thanks so much for all the detail.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Joe Stauff with SIG. Your line is open.\nJoe Stauff: Okay. Thanks. Good morning, Jason and Alan. Two questions, please.\nJason Robins: Good morning.\nJoe Stauff: I wanted to see if you could, Jason, sort of describe, say, the iCasino first opportunity. At this point, you have GNOG fully ramped up and launched, and in particular, was it a material contributor to your MUP growth? And then the second piece is just wanted to ask about, say, the economics of customer acquisition in existing states. We're aware obviously of that initial golden cohort, but just wondering how and what you've seen in terms of the economics and the LTVs for all the cohorts after that, whether it'd be year two versus year three and so forth? I guess the main question is, like, in year two and year three, based on what you can observe, are the economics very different between them? One would think over time it'd be lower, but I was just wondering what you're observing.\nJason Robins: Yes. It's great question. So starting off, as we noted, we're seeing customer acquisition outperform really across the board, really states and products alike. That said, GNOG has been a bright spot ever since we migrated onto the DraftKings products and platform, which is a much more positive customer experience, better conversion flows, all those sorts of things. We have definitely seen GNOG spike. So that was a material contributor for sure. It's still relatively small compared to DraftKings, but we're very excited about the potential for that brand in growth that we're going to see there. So more to come there, but definitely an important contributor to the outperformance on customer acquisition. And then the cohort question, we've noted this in the past as well, for sure. As time goes on, you see some decline in cohort quality. It's a thing that we look at every single day, and it's not just a matter of time. Obviously, time is one factor, but you also see different LTVs based on what sport you acquire a player on or whether a player gets acquired onto iGaming versus onto OSB. First, there's a number of different factors that we have noted that definitely drive differential LTVs. Obviously, the state that they're acquired and play in based on tax rates and other elements like whether there's iGaming. So, lots of complex variables that go into how we look at LTV, but certainly one of them is that there is an underlying quality of the player that declines as time goes on. Because of course you're going to get your strongest players in the first year or two of state launch. So that is something that we factor in. We closely monitor it. It tends to asymptote out after a little bit of time. So it's not like it just perpetually declines. Usually you kind of get that first year or two, depending on the state where you get the strongest players, and then it kind of flattens out. But no doubt, players you're getting a few years in or weaker than the players you get day one.\nJoe Stauff: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with DB. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, everybody. Good morning.\nJason Robins: Good morning.\nCarlo Santarelli: First off, I just wanted to clarify something as it pertains to the 80%, the 80% growth in customers. Does that include the draft -- the Jackpocket customer base?\nJason Robins: No, that's just new customers onto the DraftKings brand. Oh, and GNOG as well.\nCarlo Santarelli: In GNOG and DraftKings, okay, that's helpful. And then secondly, just to follow up, Jason, on your response to, I believe it was Dan's question, around the $177 million [Technical Difficulty] I know you said 50% flow through on the existing customers. Is it fair to more or less estimate that the existing customers are likely generating, call it, more than $177 million of incremental net revenue as the new customers would carry kind of negative net revenue through the rest of this year through the payback period. And hence the math is kind of like 200 to 300 from new customers, and then looked at the other way, take 50% flow through for the EBITDA and look at what the delta is on the acquired customers. Is that accurate?\nJason Robins: That's close. So new customers that we acquired, say, in Q2 will definitely generate positive revenue by the end of the year, but their new customer promo will also be a significant chunk of the play. What is it about three or four months after a customer's acquired that they -- so depending on the timing, many of them would be negative this year, but some would get positive. So it's a little bit complicated to think about. But the best way that I would think about it is separate out. Instead of thinking of it as a customer level, think of it as we're spending X more promo dollars because of new customers. And those promo dollars are going to flow through somewhere around 90% to the bottom line. And that's how you can back -- and then the rest of the revenue, the positive revenue, flows through in the 50s and that's how you can back into it.\nCarlo Santarelli: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to start sticking on the EBITDA bridge for 2025 or moving over to 2025, how much of the stronger customer acquisition, retention engagement, that line that's offsetting the Illinois, how much of that is really truly existing customers versus customers that you've acquired this year?\nJason Robins: Sorry, say it one more time.\nBernie McTernan: Yes. In the EBITDA bridge, so Illinois is a big negative and then the big offset is the customer retention engagement line. So want to know how much of that is driven by truly existing customers that you acquired before this year and better outperformance there versus the customers that you have been and expect to acquire this year?\nJason Robins: This is 2025, right, you are talking about?\nBernie McTernan: Yes, for the 2025. Exactly.\nJason Robins: Okay. I don't know proportionally how it breaks out. Do you know the answer to that?\nAlan Ellingson: We won't break it out for this call, but disproportionate amount of it is the existing customers. New customers tend to ramp up over time. So you can assume that it's a little bit heavier on the existing customers and the performance on the retention and the engagement of our existing customers and less on the new customers, which we're still exploring the value of.\nBernie McTernan: Okay, perfect. And then just given the focus on higher tax rate states, is the contribution profit margin significantly different in those high tax rate states versus the lower ones?\nJason Robins: Well, pre-instituting the fee, definitely the contribution margin is different, because even with reduced promo and marketing, you still can't like -- I mean, it depends on the state, right. I guess, New York is probably the one I'm thinking of when I'm answering your question. 51% tax on gross revenue is just -- you can't overcome it to a point where it's going to be in line with the other states margin wise. But obviously it depends on the state. And some states that are closer to that 20%, we can claw back most of it through promo and reduce advertising.\nBernie McTernan: Okay. Thanks, Jason. Thanks, Alan.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nJed Kelly: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just circling back on the surcharge, maybe a different way to ask it, what would cause you not to potentially implement it? And then just real quickly on hold. Some of the hold trends are obviously different, but have you seen any change in how you view your structural hold or your parlay mix? Or are you changing, like, hey, it's more important to drive engagement than to maximize hold. Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yes. Great question. So, as of now, I don't think there would be any reason that we wouldn't implement it, but obviously we're paying close attention to customer feedback. And if we hear anything that makes us change our mind, we'll certainly let you know. I think on the hold side, we continue to focus very much there. I think it's largely still a bet mix thing. Certainly, we feel like there's a ton of room to increase our parlay mix and increase our average leg count still. So team is very focused on that. I think, we're also focusing on other parts of the betting platform as well, such as live betting. So it's a little bit more balanced probably than, I think, maybe last year where it was just all about hold rate and bet mix, but we're still very focused on bet mix.\nJed Kelly: And then just real quick, anything to call out on shutting down Reignmakers in terms of our EBITDA drag or headwind fix?\nJason Robins: Yes. Reignmakers is fairly immaterial, so I wouldn't factor it in in any way. I think, for us, it's really just about eliminating a distraction and potential risk. And as I said earlier, I think the mantra around the company has been focus, focus, focus, let's go win the US online gaming opportunity and maximize the amount of profit we're driving in that space. And I think that's what we're focusing on right now.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nBarry Jonas: Hey, guys. We've seen a number of states starting to react to the offshore market by banning [indiscernible]. Do you see these actions as meaningful to combat the illegal market?\nJason Robins: I think so. I mean, right now, the illegal market, particularly in the iGaming space, ironically, is bigger than ever. I think consumers don't know oftentimes what's legal and what's not. They don't know if it's legal in their state, and there's just zero controls put on these companies that make sure that they're not marketing to miners and other sorts of things. So I do think it's a big issue, and it's good to see the regulators starting to focus on it. And the thing is that there's so much pent up demand and there's so many people that would prefer to bet in the legal market. I think you're seeing growth despite the fact that there's still a rampant illegal market. But for sure, a lot of the current TAM is still tied up there, both for the long term health of the industry as well as for making sure that states are maximizing their revenues and their purpose for doing this, which is to regulate and protect consumers, I think it's absolutely essential that that continues to be a focus. So I'm happy to see it, and hopefully we'll see more of it.\nBarry Jonas: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ben Chaiken with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nBen Chaiken: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Two very quick product questions. I guess, on integrating -- I would imagine integrating Jackpocket into the DraftKings app would be another significant customer acquisition opportunity, I guess. One, do you agree? And two, if so, any color on timing? And then on the bet-and-watch integration, will that require users to have access to the games themselves, or will you have an opportunity to kind of tactically subsidize that in any way? Thanks.\nJason Robins: I think the bet-and-watch is just included, so is that correct? It's not. Yeah, there's no additional charge for it. So it's a feature that customers will have just by being a part of the DraftKings user base. And then -- sorry, what was the first question?\nAlan Ellingson: Jackpocket.\nJason Robins: Oh, Jackpocket. Yes. So, we do plan on integrating those products into DraftKings, as well as integrating DraftKings Casino and OSB products into Jackpocket. Timing, we haven't quite determined yet. I think, in the past, what we said, and I kind of echo is, we long term want to have all of our products available through all of our brands, and exactly when we implement those things directly versus when we have more linkage through brand-to-brand cross-sell will depend on other priorities and how that slots into our product roadmap. But we definitely do plan to do that at some point.\nBen Chaiken: I guess just as a very quick follow up, would you agree that integrating it would be a significant kind of customer acquisition catalyst for other portions of the business, or do you think you've already acquired those customers? Does that makes sense.\nJason Robins: No, we definitely haven't acquired all those customers. So I agree it would be, and that's the reason we're planning to do it. I also think that in the interim, we continue to see Jackpocket as a great vehicle for acquiring those customers and cross-selling them into DraftKings. But we know from experience that having a fully integrated product is always going to yield stronger conversion and stronger cross-sell. So no doubt you're correct that that will be a boost.\nBen Chaiken: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandt Montour: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So, one more on the surcharge. Just thinking through the potential outcomes of that plan, especially if nobody follows suit, we would think that -- we would think that it would affect the larger players, the VIPs more, and at the same time, you're accelerating your customer acquisition and penetrating more customers in your existing states. Is there a thought that this would potentially move you more to a recreational mix and could that actually help hold longer term?\nJason Robins: Yes. It's a great question. Certainly, I think that players betting multi-leg parlays and things like that are going to be less sensitive, because the payout is already very large. So, I get that. I hadn't really thought about how it might affect -- I mean, we're hopeful that our product and the investment we're making, our customer experience is strong enough that we have players across the spectrum and they view us as being worth maybe paying a few extra cents on a bet. But certainly we'll have to see how that plays out and it'll be something just like everything, where we look at the data and we decide what we do accordingly. I do think that if you run the math, it would take quite a bit of top line deterioration to make it not worthwhile from a bottom line perspective. So, I'm optimistic. But we'll have to see and we'll have to follow whatever the data and analytics tell us to do.\nBrandt Montour: Oh, great. Thanks for that, Jason. And then just to follow up on Jackpocket, just piecing together some of your comments, you're investing more in marketing. This year in Jackpocket, the integration sounds like a little bit more longer term. So what gives you confidence that you're going to inflect positive in your 2025 guide in your -- in that you laid out in your deck? Just trying to understand some of the drivers there.\nJason Robins: Well, really it's the revenue growth we're seeing right now on Jackpocket that gives us confidence we'll be able to achieve adjusted positive EBITDA in 2025. So they've been really doing well from that standpoint. Also, as a reminder, they have an extremely low CAC. So while we are investing more in, we get a lot of customers for that. So, definitely makes a big difference in their revenue ramp as well. So, I think, all signs point towards them being a positive contributor to adjusted EBITDA in 2025 and beyond. But obviously, we'll have to see how the back half of the year plays out and we'll have more of an update on that in November.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jordan Bender with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.\nJordan Bender: Hey, it's Jordan. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to talk on your market access agreements. There's obviously not much room to move in some states, like in New York and Oregon, but is the supply/demand dynamic changed to the point that states with unused skins can maybe act as a renegotiation tool and be a serious lever to drive cost savings over the long term? Thank you.\nJason Robins: I think, there's probably some room there. Most states we feel we have pretty good deals in already, so I don't think there's a ton where we feel there's a lot of optimization, but I think there's probably some optimization and it'll be a little bit longer term, because most of the deals we struck are very long term deals. So, like seven to 10-year deals. But I do think as they start to come up, there will be states that have a lot of open skins. And just like anything, it's a supply/demand thing. And I think also, even though we got great rates, many of the early states were before, I think, we really established the level of place in the industry that we have. So, I think, that will hopefully help a little bit, too.\nJordan Bender: Thank you very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ryan Sigdhal with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open.\nRyan Sigdhal: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJason Robins: Good morning.\nRyan Sigdhal: Looking at Slide 10, the MUP increase sequentially, normally kind of flattish quarter given seasonality, up almost 1 million. Are you able to break out how much that was Jackpocket versus just organic DraftKings and Golden Nugget acquisition?\nJason Robins: It was mostly Jackpocket. Obviously, the new customer acquisition boosted it too, but given the substantial size of their database, it was mostly Jackpocket. No?\nAlan Ellingson: No.\nJason Robins: Oh, I'm sorry. It was not. I got that wrong. Half and half. Okay, I stand corrected. Thankfully, I have people with better data than I have in my brain, apparently next to me, so it's about half and half.\nRyan Sigdhal: Thank you. Good luck, guys.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord. Your line is open.\nMichael Graham: Thank you. Jason, I just wanted to ask about your thoughts on the product and the platform as we head into the NFL season. Obviously, you don't have the tremendous, like, upside from introducing same game parlays that you had, but you have the bet-and-watch feature. But just wanted to, kind of, hear any comments you're willing to share on how you think the product will perform in this important seasonal period here coming up?\nJason Robins: I think I feel really excited about the product we have going into NFL. A lot of the work we've been doing over the last several months has been more back end performance stuff. So things that maybe aren't as immediately obvious, because they don't show up like front end features, but things like making sure that pages load faster, making sure that the app crashes less, making sure markets are up for longer, and we have less time where marketing markets are locked or unavailable, adding new bet types, bringing in-house our pricing and trading for many new sports, and also launching things like cash out for same game parlay. So we have a lot of really exciting new stuff. We expanded progressive parlays to include new types of bets as well. So -- and more to come. Obviously, bet-and-watch hasn't launched yet and we have a number of other features that we haven't announced that we have planned for the coming months. A lot of what we do, really all of what we do, revolves around a calendar starting in the fall. So the team thinks about it as what do we want to ship in the August-September timeframe and how do we then, starting at the beginning of the year, orient our entire product road map and calendar around that. So a lot of the product that we ship is going to be done over the next three to six weeks, and I think you'll see a lot of new stuff pop up as the season approaches.\nMichael Graham: All right. That's exciting. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, I wanted to ask about, I guess, the temperature of some of the tribal news that's been out there. Obviously a big decision that we learned a few months ago in Florida. Does this change the landscape of other tribal states in terms of what you believe they could offer and then, more importantly, your ability to partner with these companies? Could that accelerate some of the TAM if they decide to move forward on digital? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yes. I do think that there is some momentum in tribal communities now. And, obviously, DraftKings already has a number of partners that are tribes in various states, including Foxwoods, the Pequot Tribe in Connecticut, Passamaquoddy in Maine, Bay Mills in Michigan, several others. I don't want to leave any out, but I probably left a few out. But we continue to believe that we are the partner of choice and also that we have a great track record, if you talk to any of our tribal partners, of being great partners. And, I think, just like anything, it takes time and education sometimes in some states, like California, where there's over 70 tribes. I think that there it's obviously about getting alignment as much as it is about openness. And so each one, each state is a bit unique, just like all states in all regards politically and otherwise are unique in their own ways. So we kind of have to look at it that way. But I do think there's some momentum now more than ever. I think you're seeing -- we're seeing tribes come to us and ask about what we can do. Minnesota is one that I think is another tribal state that got very close to passing a bill this past session. And I'm hopeful that it gets done next session. And that was all about the tribes and the tracks agreeing to a deal. So, sometimes it's not even about openness, it's about getting different stakeholders within the state to align.\nChad Beynon: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jeff Stantial with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJeff Stantial: Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe digging in a bit further into some of the commentary on iCasino player acquisition. Jason, you talked about some sequential uplift to conversion rates from the Golden Nugget platform transition, but looking at this more strategically, I guess, has your philosophy on investing towards that iCasino led player cohort changed at all now that Golden Nugget is fully integrated. Historically, I believe the strategy is more to focus on cross-sell of sports users versus acquiring that higher CAC, higher LTV, iCasino led player. But just curious if you're thinking here shifted around at all based on the returns that you're seeing with this recent user acquisition upsell [ph]? Thanks.\nJason Robins: Yes. I think so. I mean, I wouldn't really describe it as a philosophical change as much as us continuing with the philosophy of following the data and the analytics and putting our dollars where we feel that where we see the best returns. So naturally, as you noted, when you see an increase in performance on GNOG, then that would mean that more dollars should flow there, because it's performing better, therefore should get a higher proportion of our acquisition spend. So we definitely are moving dollars around based on performance and what we're seeing, and that's always been consistent with what we've done. But the result, as you noted, has been some shift towards that iGaming-first customer acquisition investment, which I think, again, it's all just kind of where do we get the best return, right. It's not that we think cross-sell is inherently a better way of doing it. It was just -- and still is, by the way, that that's where we get the bulk of our iGaming customers, and that's the most efficient means of doing it. But certainly where we see opportunity to invest directly in acquiring an iGaming-first customer, we're also taking advantage of that.\nJeff Stantial: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lance Vitanza with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nLance Vitanza: Thanks, guys. First of all, congratulations on a great quarter.\nJason Robins: Thank you.\nLance Vitanza: I just have one question regarding the surcharge, but it does have three parts. And maybe just to focus on Illinois, can you talk about what percentage of the EBITDA lost due to the tax rate increase? Is the surcharge designed to recapture? I'm just trying to get a sense for the potential upside beyond the $900 million to $1 billion guide to the extent that the surcharge is successful. Obviously, I'm talking about fiscal 2025.\nJason Robins: Yes. So the way we calculated it is, we set the amount such that we are targeting DraftKings covering 20% of gross revenue and taxes. And so basically, the way to think of it is, any tax rate that's higher than 20%, we would be paying up to the 20%, and then the remaining would be -- the fee is designed to offset. So in a state like New York, where the tax rate is 51%, that's a large number. Obviously, the big question is, do we see any deterioration in handle and top line as a result? But you can do the math and see it would take quite a bit, because if you think about 51% versus 20%, that's 60% of the taxes that we're paying in New York. And you could do the math on that from all the public reports. It's a big number. So, you need to see a substantial decline in handle to get to a point where you were fully cannibalizing that. And obviously, if we saw that, we would reconsider our plan. But I think there's quite a bit of cushion there.\nLance Vitanza: Well, and my gut tells me that customer activity would actually be highly inelastic, at least around mid-single digit surcharge on winnings. But -- and, I know, you haven't done A/B Testing, but do you have any data that you've seen that would bear this out? I mean, other than just our guts?\nJason Robins: Yes. I think you're right, by the way. The best data we have is really from either other industries or from our industry and other parts of the world. There are other places where online gaming companies charge customers more because of the tax regime. In countries like Germany or Australia, as an example. It's not done exactly in this way, but it's conceptually very similar. Also, we noted this earlier on the call, but a number of industries, from hotels to taxis, all have taxes in various states that get charged to the customer. And people may gripe about it, but I don't really see behavior change because of it. So, you're right. It depends on the level, I think, in the mid-single digits. Our belief is that when you compare it to sort of other industries as well as, sort of, what we just got checked think seems fair and seems reasonable to a customer. It seems like this is a good zone for us, but we'll only find out when we do it. It's hard. You can't really A/B Test something like that.\nLance Vitanza: Right. And last part of my question. I'm glad that you're making the surcharge visible to consumers. As you point out, black market operators pay zero tax, a 40% tax, and obviously referring to Illinois here, that seems short-sighted, unfair and ultimately counterproductive. And I'm wondering if part of the calculus in making the visible, making the surcharge visible, is that intended to raise awareness around this issue? Do you think you could possibly generate grassroots support for more rational tax policy, i.e., lower rates?\nJason Robins: Well, there's certainly an element there that entered into our thinking. Obviously, you're right. When you have illegal operators paying zero tax, that's pretty tough to compete with at any level. But when it starts getting higher than 20%, it just becomes untenable. So I do think that in absence of us doing something like this, why wouldn't more states consider it? It's not getting passed to their customers, they're not hearing from their constituents, and we haven't, in New York, done anything differently, or nobody in the industry has. So I do think that this is something that may make some states reconsider, because now they may be hearing more from their citizens that they don't like it. Obviously, they wouldn't be hearing anything from people who are being charged, because it's not like -- I guess maybe they'd hear from like local teams that aren't getting as much sponsorship spend, but not from the mass of voters that bet on sports. So -- but in the end, I think states are going to decide based on a number of items. I mean, if you look at some of the comparison industries I mentioned, like taxis and hotels, it's not like you don't pay for that when you go to a New York. So, I think, some states feel like because of where they are and because of the value proposition they bring that they can have higher costs in certain things and that's not up to us. That's a policy decision that they're going to have to make. And, as a business, we have to make the business decision that we have to make accordingly. But certainly we will continue to advocate for taxes that allow us to compete more with the illegal market. And I am hopeful and I believe most states do see that. If you look, most -- vast majority of states around the country have tax rates of 20% or under, it's just a handful that don't.\nLance Vitanza: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jason Robins for any closing remarks.\nJason Robins: Well, thank you all for joining us on today's call. We are really optimistic about the second half of 2024 and are excited and well positioned position for success in the future 2025 and beyond. Thank you for your continued support.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you all for joining. There are five key points that I'd like to focus on during our call today. First, we are achieving strong and efficient customer acquisition. New OSB and iGaming customers increased nearly 80% year-over-year, while cap declined more than 40% year-over-year in the second quarter, a period with no new state launches. We anticipate the healthy customer acquisition environment to continue through the back half of the year and possibly beyond, which may indicate that the US online gaming opportunity could be even larger than we previously thought. Second, we believe we have a reasonable solution for high tax states, including Illinois. We plan to implement a gaming tax surcharge in the four states that have multiple sports betting operators and tax rates above 20% starting January 1, 2025. We believe additional upside potentially exists for adjusted EBITDA in 2025 and beyond from this gaming tax surcharge. Third, the Jackpocket integration is off to a great start. We are on track to hit the multiyear guidance for the transaction that we provided in announcement and expect the deal to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in the fiscal year 2025. Fourth, we are excited about the future and are reiterating our expectation for $900 million to $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2025. Finally, we said last quarter that we would provide an update on capital allocation. We are pleased to announce that our Board authorized a share repurchase of up to $1 billion of our Class A common stock. This inaugural authorization reflects our conviction in the strong trajectory of our business and our expectation that we will generate significant free cash flow in the coming years. I'd also like to emphasize that all of us at DraftKings are very excited for the start of football season. Our product is in a great position as we are continuing to differentiate ourselves by investing in new features and functionality for Sportsbook and iGaming. In Sportsbook, we recently launched in-house player prop wagers for NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, college football, college basketball, and tennis. We also broadened our progressive parlays to include spread and total wagers. In addition, we plan to integrate a bet and watch experience with NFL streaming. In iGaming, the DraftKings and Golden Nugget Online Gaming apps were ranked number one and number two overall in a recent third party survey. We are on track to double the number of new games we will release this year compared to last year and recently improved our interface to promote game discoverability. In closing, our business fundamentals are very healthy and we are excited about the second half of 2024 and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Alan Ellingson. Thank you, David. Great question. I think every company has to do what's best for their own business. I think we believe this is what's best for us. And I would imagine that if that's our calculus, then others would come to the same conclusion. But we really don't know and we'll have to see. And, obviously, there might be other ways, too, that -- other ideas for how to implement something like this that might be better than what we came up with. We thought through this quite a bit, but you never know. So we do have some time between now and January 1st, and we'll see what happens. I'll answer quickly and then Alan can add any detail. But I think the best way to think about it is the overperformance that we are seeing with customer acquisition. The launch of Washington, DC, our expectation for Jackpocket to deliver positive EBIT next -- EBITDA next year, as well as underlying trends with our existing customers and outperformance on the handle side. All should offset the Illinois tax increase next year. So even if we don't get any benefit from the fee, we will see still $900 million to $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA next year. Yes. It's a great question. Just to explain a little bit about what's going on. One, even if we didn't spend another dime on marketing, new customers -- get new customer promotions. So, you're right, that has a drag on revenue and EBITDA, and we're seeing enough outperformance on the revenue side elsewhere that while it certainly hit the bottom line a little bit or will for the remainder of the year, it didn't actually. We're still seeing improved revenue. So that just kind of demonstrates, I think, the underlying strength of the business and the customers that we're seeing. So when you kind of put all that together next year, we do expect to get a little bit more revenue, because we'll need that to offset -- in order to make the math work that's needed to offset the Illinois gaming tax increase. So that's kind of how you get to the $900 million to $1 billion. And then any additional upside beyond that Illinois gaming tax amount would be either revenue driven or from the impact of the fee that we're instituting in those four states. And then as far as the potential for hot customer acquisition next year, that can always happen. Right now, we feel we've built in some degree of the increased trends we're seeing. And obviously, a lot of that will depend on if there's more state launches and things like that. So, I think, you could sort of think of this as a same state basis type of thing again. And obviously, if there's more state launches next year and more customer acquisition investment, then that might change things a bit. But that just means bigger numbers longer term over the following year. So, I think, that's the right way to think about it. But as of today, I see no reason to think that on a same state basis, we would -- we wouldn't be able to deliver $900 million to $1 billion in EBITDA -- in adjusted EBITDA next year. So we are not seeing an increase in the existing player cost. It's all new player driven and mix driven, so meaning, mix of new players to existing. And interestingly, it really is across the board. So certainly we got some boost from North Carolina having launched in late Q1. But if you remember, last year we had two big states, Ohio and Massachusetts, launched in Q1. So this year there were less new state launches around this timeframe and none in Q2. We did have DC launch recently, but that didn't affect the Q2 numbers that was in July. So really it has to come from existing states if you look at it that way. And then it's really across products, too. We did see some particular strength in the Golden Nugget brand as we migrated onto the DraftKings platform and product. We definitely saw a boost in conversion and got some lift on there. But really it's been across states, across products. Hi. Yes, great questions. I mean, we, I think, have been very consistent in that. We don't react competitively. We make decisions based on our three-year payback rule and what our data says our customer acquisition spend is returning. So as we noted, we had an over 80% increase -- an almost -- excuse me, 80% increase in new players in Q2 year-over-year and an over 40% CAC decline. I mean, those are just massive numbers, right? So when you or me looking at those numbers, your marketing team is coming to you and saying we can deliver more productive spend with the same type of results, it's hard to say no to that, right? And we've been monitoring cohort quality. I mean, everything looks really, really solid. So, I think, it's just a particularly strong environment right now. The market is growing quickly. I think, it's just really -- you've got to fish when the fish are biting, so to speak. So, I think, that's the way to think about it. It's absolutely offensive and really more so just kind of following the data. And by the same token to your second question, if it goes the other way, we'll follow it back the other way. So the good news for us is the vast majority of our marketing spend is flexible. We can move in and out of it very quickly. A lot of it's digital. Even the TV we can move out of in a matter of days, usually. So, really it's quite easy for us to make adjustments as we see what's working and at what levels. And same way that when the data is telling us we should be investing deeper, because the paybacks are really strong, if we start to see the opposite or if we start to see a decline in cohort quality, we can easily adjust there. Good morning. Yes. It's a great question and hard to exactly pinpoint, but I think it's a combination of both the things that you said, primarily. So, one, as we've increased our state footprint, we've talked about this for years now, how this is kind of the gift that keeps on giving. We see the same cost from a national marketing perspective, regardless of how many states we're operating in. But the bigger your footprint, the more bang for your buck you're getting for it. So as we've grown our state footprint, you're absolutely right, it just continues to improve our efficiency, which allows us to unlock the ability to reach a little bit deeper and spend a little bit more in pockets that weren't meeting our payback thresholds previously. Secondly, I do think that there's just a ton of momentum in the industry right now. Lots of buzz coming up with NFL season. It's only going to get bigger, because this is the most busy time of year for us typically from a customer acquisition perspective, I guess the Super bowl, but the whole NFL, kind of NBA, that whole fall timeframe is usually the biggest overall period. And, really, I see no reason to think that that's going to slow down. Obviously, as noted earlier, we're going to be very closely monitoring the data and if we see any changes, we'll adjust our spend and adjust our approach. But right now, I think, if anything, you'd expect it to build, because we're in really the least busy time of year and we're still seeing very strong customer acquisition. So, I don't know why that would slow down going into the busiest time of year. Yes. And it will be a mix. I mean, we'll have certainly some flexibility, as you noted, to take advantage of any dislocations in the share price. But as Alan noted, I think the bulk of it will be formulaic. Yes. I think, on your first question, we're seeing absolutely no signs of any weakness in the consumer whatsoever. Hard to know how much of that is unique to our industry versus macro, but really on our end, we're seeing super strong, healthy cohort behavior across the board. And as noted, customer acquisition is really at an all-time high as well. So everything looks really good on that front for us. On the bet-and-watch side, it wasn't really that we saw anything last year and anything our competitors did. It was more that we wanted to do this all along. It's a great thing that we think will add a lot of value to our customers doing live betting, just didn't make the cut. We had so many other great things that we were trying to get done last year. And, I think, to do it in a sort of haphazard way wasn't our style. We want to do it right, so we really wanted to make sure it wasn't just some kind of hack together integration of a video feed. But it was a true experience that we are creating, because if somebody tries it, we want them to say, this is great, and come back and get one shot at a first impression. So, I think, we felt like between the other things that we had on our roadmap and our desire to make sure we did this in the right way, we decided it would be better off for this coming season. Sure. So definitely discussed and thought through a lot of different ways of doing it. And as I said, some better idea comes along. We're open to it. I think the important thing is that, if you look at sort of the way it's typically done in other industries, whether it'd be hotel taxes or even the sales tax that you pay when you buy something at the store, taxis, you name it. It's typically line itemed out separately and usually 100% passed along to the consumer. In this case, we're obviously subsidizing a chunk of it. So, we just thought that was most sort of in line with how it's typically done versus trying to obfuscate it, which also isn't consistent with our commitment to be transparent to our customers and be very customer friendly in everything we do. So, I know there's maybe benefit to hiding it, because maybe people don't notice, but I think over the long term customers appreciate transparency and even if they don't love that, their state implemented a high tax and some of that is being passed along. I think they prefer that to not knowing if it were buried in the pricing or something else. No, we haven't. We actually -- still there's work to do to implement it and I think it's hard to A/B test something like that. What we are doing is we're launching in four states, so we'll certainly see the impact there. And, obviously, it won't be a perfect A/B test, but I think that we have enough comparable data from other states and enough of an understanding of what we would expect from consumer behavior that, I think, will have a pretty clean read on the impact. But it is a nominal amount. If you look at the materials we provided in the investor presentation, for Illinois, for example, if you made $10 bet to win $20, it would be a 37-ish -- 30 something cent. I forget the exact number charged. So, obviously, some people might just react negatively to the idea of being charged at all. But it's really fairly nominal and it makes a huge difference in our ability to make a reasonable margin and also more importantly to compete with the illegal market, which pays no taxes and has the ability to invest 100% of their revenue into product and other things. So for us to be able to be competitive with the illegal market and invest properly in product and customer experience in a state that has a very high tax rate, we feel this is an important step that consumers will ultimately understand. And if they feel the product and experience is better, then they'd rather pay for that than somewhere else that maybe doesn't have as stronger product. So, a couple things. One, answering your question on Latin America, we would probably not do it organically if we were to pursue, it would be through M&A. That said, we don't currently have any plans to do that either. I think, we're really focused, as we've noted in the past, on winning the US online gaming opportunity. In fact, just in the last couple of months, we divested VSiN, we shuttered Reignmakers. So, I mean, we're more focused than ever on our core. And I think that's just been a mantra and a theme throughout the company is focus, focus, focus. So definitely want to make that point. But were we to do something, I think it would likely be through M&A for that very reason we don't want to take a big chunk of our brain trust here and distract them with something like that. And then, I'm sorry -- oh, second question on share. So hard to know exactly, because I would assume that if we're seeing robust customer acquisition, then our competitors are as well. So, I don't know if that's unique to us. If it were unique to us, it should show up pretty quickly within a quarter or two of acquiring the customers. But I think the caveat is, my guess is that the entire market, the entire industry is experiencing very strong customer acquisition right now, because -- well, I guess there could be some things, like in the case of the Golden Nugget migration, that we're getting a little bit of an extra boost from, but for the most part we're seeing it across states, across products. So, I think, it's more of a macro industry trend as much as anything else. Yes. It's a great question. I mean, I think that the best way to think about it is if you assume that the incremental revenue from existing customers flows through somewhere in the 50-ish percent range, maybe a little bit higher, but somewhere around there, then you can kind of back into what comes from each. And the other thing I note, too, and I just want to make sure people understand this as well, because I think it's an important point. When we talk about revising EBITDA guidance and incremental customer acquisition cost, even if we didn't spend any more money on marketing, new customer promos come from just more customers coming in. So if we under forecast it, which in this case we did, the number of new customers that we expect to acquire this year, then even if we spent zero more dollars on advertising, on marketing, we would still see a headwind, which is in that line you're mentioning from new customer promos, because just more people signing up means more new customer promos. So, that's a good thing. It's not a bad thing. Obviously, it creates more profit over the long term, but it's something that really is not within our control. And, I think, a good long term element of what we believe is a large and growing TAM. But in the end, unless we took away new customer offers, which we would never do, that's something that we can't really control. Yes. I think part of the idea is to do this in place of that, so we can continue to invest in the state. I think, New York is a great example where everyone -- all companies have, including DraftKings, have pulled back heavily on promotions and in state marketing investment. And, I think, that's fine, that's one way of doing it. But another way is to say, look, I'm going to adjust so that we're effectively at a 20% tax rate, which is in line with a lot of other states, and I'm going to invest at the level that I would invest in a 20% tax rate state. We'll have to see which one works better, but my guess is that that's going to work better, because it allows us to make the investments in product and promotions and marketing and all the other things that should continue to create long term growth. Good morning. Yes. It's great question. So starting off, as we noted, we're seeing customer acquisition outperform really across the board, really states and products alike. That said, GNOG has been a bright spot ever since we migrated onto the DraftKings products and platform, which is a much more positive customer experience, better conversion flows, all those sorts of things. We have definitely seen GNOG spike. So that was a material contributor for sure. It's still relatively small compared to DraftKings, but we're very excited about the potential for that brand in growth that we're going to see there. So more to come there, but definitely an important contributor to the outperformance on customer acquisition. And then the cohort question, we've noted this in the past as well, for sure. As time goes on, you see some decline in cohort quality. It's a thing that we look at every single day, and it's not just a matter of time. Obviously, time is one factor, but you also see different LTVs based on what sport you acquire a player on or whether a player gets acquired onto iGaming versus onto OSB. First, there's a number of different factors that we have noted that definitely drive differential LTVs. Obviously, the state that they're acquired and play in based on tax rates and other elements like whether there's iGaming. So, lots of complex variables that go into how we look at LTV, but certainly one of them is that there is an underlying quality of the player that declines as time goes on. Because of course you're going to get your strongest players in the first year or two of state launch. So that is something that we factor in. We closely monitor it. It tends to asymptote out after a little bit of time. So it's not like it just perpetually declines. Usually you kind of get that first year or two, depending on the state where you get the strongest players, and then it kind of flattens out. But no doubt, players you're getting a few years in or weaker than the players you get day one. Good morning. No, that's just new customers onto the DraftKings brand. Oh, and GNOG as well. That's close. So new customers that we acquired, say, in Q2 will definitely generate positive revenue by the end of the year, but their new customer promo will also be a significant chunk of the play. What is it about three or four months after a customer's acquired that they -- so depending on the timing, many of them would be negative this year, but some would get positive. So it's a little bit complicated to think about. But the best way that I would think about it is separate out. Instead of thinking of it as a customer level, think of it as we're spending X more promo dollars because of new customers. And those promo dollars are going to flow through somewhere around 90% to the bottom line. And that's how you can back -- and then the rest of the revenue, the positive revenue, flows through in the 50s and that's how you can back into it. Sorry, say it one more time. This is 2025, right, you are talking about? Okay. I don't know proportionally how it breaks out. Do you know the answer to that? Well, pre-instituting the fee, definitely the contribution margin is different, because even with reduced promo and marketing, you still can't like -- I mean, it depends on the state, right. I guess, New York is probably the one I'm thinking of when I'm answering your question. 51% tax on gross revenue is just -- you can't overcome it to a point where it's going to be in line with the other states margin wise. But obviously it depends on the state. And some states that are closer to that 20%, we can claw back most of it through promo and reduce advertising. Yes. Great question. So, as of now, I don't think there would be any reason that we wouldn't implement it, but obviously we're paying close attention to customer feedback. And if we hear anything that makes us change our mind, we'll certainly let you know. I think on the hold side, we continue to focus very much there. I think it's largely still a bet mix thing. Certainly, we feel like there's a ton of room to increase our parlay mix and increase our average leg count still. So team is very focused on that. I think, we're also focusing on other parts of the betting platform as well, such as live betting. So it's a little bit more balanced probably than, I think, maybe last year where it was just all about hold rate and bet mix, but we're still very focused on bet mix. Yes. Reignmakers is fairly immaterial, so I wouldn't factor it in in any way. I think, for us, it's really just about eliminating a distraction and potential risk. And as I said earlier, I think the mantra around the company has been focus, focus, focus, let's go win the US online gaming opportunity and maximize the amount of profit we're driving in that space. And I think that's what we're focusing on right now. I think so. I mean, right now, the illegal market, particularly in the iGaming space, ironically, is bigger than ever. I think consumers don't know oftentimes what's legal and what's not. They don't know if it's legal in their state, and there's just zero controls put on these companies that make sure that they're not marketing to miners and other sorts of things. So I do think it's a big issue, and it's good to see the regulators starting to focus on it. And the thing is that there's so much pent up demand and there's so many people that would prefer to bet in the legal market. I think you're seeing growth despite the fact that there's still a rampant illegal market. But for sure, a lot of the current TAM is still tied up there, both for the long term health of the industry as well as for making sure that states are maximizing their revenues and their purpose for doing this, which is to regulate and protect consumers, I think it's absolutely essential that that continues to be a focus. So I'm happy to see it, and hopefully we'll see more of it. I think the bet-and-watch is just included, so is that correct? It's not. Yeah, there's no additional charge for it. So it's a feature that customers will have just by being a part of the DraftKings user base. And then -- sorry, what was the first question? Oh, Jackpocket. Yes. So, we do plan on integrating those products into DraftKings, as well as integrating DraftKings Casino and OSB products into Jackpocket. Timing, we haven't quite determined yet. I think, in the past, what we said, and I kind of echo is, we long term want to have all of our products available through all of our brands, and exactly when we implement those things directly versus when we have more linkage through brand-to-brand cross-sell will depend on other priorities and how that slots into our product roadmap. But we definitely do plan to do that at some point. No, we definitely haven't acquired all those customers. So I agree it would be, and that's the reason we're planning to do it. I also think that in the interim, we continue to see Jackpocket as a great vehicle for acquiring those customers and cross-selling them into DraftKings. But we know from experience that having a fully integrated product is always going to yield stronger conversion and stronger cross-sell. So no doubt you're correct that that will be a boost. Yes. It's a great question. Certainly, I think that players betting multi-leg parlays and things like that are going to be less sensitive, because the payout is already very large. So, I get that. I hadn't really thought about how it might affect -- I mean, we're hopeful that our product and the investment we're making, our customer experience is strong enough that we have players across the spectrum and they view us as being worth maybe paying a few extra cents on a bet. But certainly we'll have to see how that plays out and it'll be something just like everything, where we look at the data and we decide what we do accordingly. I do think that if you run the math, it would take quite a bit of top line deterioration to make it not worthwhile from a bottom line perspective. So, I'm optimistic. But we'll have to see and we'll have to follow whatever the data and analytics tell us to do. Well, really it's the revenue growth we're seeing right now on Jackpocket that gives us confidence we'll be able to achieve adjusted positive EBITDA in 2025. So they've been really doing well from that standpoint. Also, as a reminder, they have an extremely low CAC. So while we are investing more in, we get a lot of customers for that. So, definitely makes a big difference in their revenue ramp as well. So, I think, all signs point towards them being a positive contributor to adjusted EBITDA in 2025 and beyond. But obviously, we'll have to see how the back half of the year plays out and we'll have more of an update on that in November. I think, there's probably some room there. Most states we feel we have pretty good deals in already, so I don't think there's a ton where we feel there's a lot of optimization, but I think there's probably some optimization and it'll be a little bit longer term, because most of the deals we struck are very long term deals. So, like seven to 10-year deals. But I do think as they start to come up, there will be states that have a lot of open skins. And just like anything, it's a supply/demand thing. And I think also, even though we got great rates, many of the early states were before, I think, we really established the level of place in the industry that we have. So, I think, that will hopefully help a little bit, too. Good morning. It was mostly Jackpocket. Obviously, the new customer acquisition boosted it too, but given the substantial size of their database, it was mostly Jackpocket. No? Oh, I'm sorry. It was not. I got that wrong. Half and half. Okay, I stand corrected. Thankfully, I have people with better data than I have in my brain, apparently next to me, so it's about half and half. I think I feel really excited about the product we have going into NFL. A lot of the work we've been doing over the last several months has been more back end performance stuff. So things that maybe aren't as immediately obvious, because they don't show up like front end features, but things like making sure that pages load faster, making sure that the app crashes less, making sure markets are up for longer, and we have less time where marketing markets are locked or unavailable, adding new bet types, bringing in-house our pricing and trading for many new sports, and also launching things like cash out for same game parlay. So we have a lot of really exciting new stuff. We expanded progressive parlays to include new types of bets as well. So -- and more to come. Obviously, bet-and-watch hasn't launched yet and we have a number of other features that we haven't announced that we have planned for the coming months. A lot of what we do, really all of what we do, revolves around a calendar starting in the fall. So the team thinks about it as what do we want to ship in the August-September timeframe and how do we then, starting at the beginning of the year, orient our entire product road map and calendar around that. So a lot of the product that we ship is going to be done over the next three to six weeks, and I think you'll see a lot of new stuff pop up as the season approaches. Yes. I do think that there is some momentum in tribal communities now. And, obviously, DraftKings already has a number of partners that are tribes in various states, including Foxwoods, the Pequot Tribe in Connecticut, Passamaquoddy in Maine, Bay Mills in Michigan, several others. I don't want to leave any out, but I probably left a few out. But we continue to believe that we are the partner of choice and also that we have a great track record, if you talk to any of our tribal partners, of being great partners. And, I think, just like anything, it takes time and education sometimes in some states, like California, where there's over 70 tribes. I think that there it's obviously about getting alignment as much as it is about openness. And so each one, each state is a bit unique, just like all states in all regards politically and otherwise are unique in their own ways. So we kind of have to look at it that way. But I do think there's some momentum now more than ever. I think you're seeing -- we're seeing tribes come to us and ask about what we can do. Minnesota is one that I think is another tribal state that got very close to passing a bill this past session. And I'm hopeful that it gets done next session. And that was all about the tribes and the tracks agreeing to a deal. So, sometimes it's not even about openness, it's about getting different stakeholders within the state to align. Yes. I think so. I mean, I wouldn't really describe it as a philosophical change as much as us continuing with the philosophy of following the data and the analytics and putting our dollars where we feel that where we see the best returns. So naturally, as you noted, when you see an increase in performance on GNOG, then that would mean that more dollars should flow there, because it's performing better, therefore should get a higher proportion of our acquisition spend. So we definitely are moving dollars around based on performance and what we're seeing, and that's always been consistent with what we've done. But the result, as you noted, has been some shift towards that iGaming-first customer acquisition investment, which I think, again, it's all just kind of where do we get the best return, right. It's not that we think cross-sell is inherently a better way of doing it. It was just -- and still is, by the way, that that's where we get the bulk of our iGaming customers, and that's the most efficient means of doing it. But certainly where we see opportunity to invest directly in acquiring an iGaming-first customer, we're also taking advantage of that. Thank you. Yes. So the way we calculated it is, we set the amount such that we are targeting DraftKings covering 20% of gross revenue and taxes. And so basically, the way to think of it is, any tax rate that's higher than 20%, we would be paying up to the 20%, and then the remaining would be -- the fee is designed to offset. So in a state like New York, where the tax rate is 51%, that's a large number. Obviously, the big question is, do we see any deterioration in handle and top line as a result? But you can do the math and see it would take quite a bit, because if you think about 51% versus 20%, that's 60% of the taxes that we're paying in New York. And you could do the math on that from all the public reports. It's a big number. So, you need to see a substantial decline in handle to get to a point where you were fully cannibalizing that. And obviously, if we saw that, we would reconsider our plan. But I think there's quite a bit of cushion there. Yes. I think you're right, by the way. The best data we have is really from either other industries or from our industry and other parts of the world. There are other places where online gaming companies charge customers more because of the tax regime. In countries like Germany or Australia, as an example. It's not done exactly in this way, but it's conceptually very similar. Also, we noted this earlier on the call, but a number of industries, from hotels to taxis, all have taxes in various states that get charged to the customer. And people may gripe about it, but I don't really see behavior change because of it. So, you're right. It depends on the level, I think, in the mid-single digits. Our belief is that when you compare it to sort of other industries as well as, sort of, what we just got checked think seems fair and seems reasonable to a customer. It seems like this is a good zone for us, but we'll only find out when we do it. It's hard. You can't really A/B Test something like that. Well, there's certainly an element there that entered into our thinking. Obviously, you're right. When you have illegal operators paying zero tax, that's pretty tough to compete with at any level. But when it starts getting higher than 20%, it just becomes untenable. So I do think that in absence of us doing something like this, why wouldn't more states consider it? It's not getting passed to their customers, they're not hearing from their constituents, and we haven't, in New York, done anything differently, or nobody in the industry has. So I do think that this is something that may make some states reconsider, because now they may be hearing more from their citizens that they don't like it. Obviously, they wouldn't be hearing anything from people who are being charged, because it's not like -- I guess maybe they'd hear from like local teams that aren't getting as much sponsorship spend, but not from the mass of voters that bet on sports. So -- but in the end, I think states are going to decide based on a number of items. I mean, if you look at some of the comparison industries I mentioned, like taxis and hotels, it's not like you don't pay for that when you go to a New York. So, I think, some states feel like because of where they are and because of the value proposition they bring that they can have higher costs in certain things and that's not up to us. That's a policy decision that they're going to have to make. And, as a business, we have to make the business decision that we have to make accordingly. But certainly we will continue to advocate for taxes that allow us to compete more with the illegal market. And I am hopeful and I believe most states do see that. If you look, most -- vast majority of states around the country have tax rates of 20% or under, it's just a handful that don't. Well, thank you all for joining us on today's call. We are really optimistic about the second half of 2024 and are excited and well positioned position for success in the future 2025 and beyond. Thank you for your continued support."

            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed further in our SEC filings, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecasts. We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements other than as required by law. During this call, management will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be useful in evaluating DraftKings operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for DraftKings' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings release and presentation, which can be found on our website and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Jason Robins, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of DraftKings, who will share some opening remarks and an update on the business. Following Jason's remarks, I will provide a review of our financials. We will then open the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins. Thank you, Jason. I'll hit the financial highlights, including our second quarter 2024 performance and our updated guidance. Please note that all income statement measures discussed, except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, our business fundamentals were strong in the second quarter. We generated $1.104 billion of revenue, representing 26% year-over-year growth and $128 million of adjusted EBITDA. Importantly, customer acquisition exceeded our expectations as new to DraftKings, OSB and iGaming customers increased nearly 80% year-over-year. Customer retention and engagement were healthy and resulted in handle that exceeded our expectations. Handle was strong even with fewer than anticipated NBA playoff games. Structural Sportsbook hold percent improved year-over-year in line with our expectations to approximately 10%. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 43%, primarily due to better than expected customer acquisition and the corresponding promotional reinvestment. Operating expenses, including sales and marketing, products and technology, and general and administrative expenses were consistent with our expectations as we continued to balance revenue growth with operating efficiency across the organization. Moving on to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $5.050 billion to $5.250 billion from a range of $4.800 billion to $5 billion. The updated range equates to year-over-year growth of 38% to 43%. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by strong customer acquisition, engagement and retention trends for our existing customers as well as the inclusion of Jackpocket and our recent launch of Sportsbook in Washington, DC. We are also revising our fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $340 million to $420 million from the range of $460 million to $540 million. The revision takes into account Illinois raising its Sportsbook tax rate, strong new customer acquisition expectations, as well as the prior mentioned inclusion of Jackpocket and our recent Sportsbook launch in Washington, DC. From fiscal year 2024, we now expect our adjusted gross margin to increase modestly. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase at a mid to high single digit rate year-over-year. The increase is primarily due to the investments in Jackpocket brand. We continue to expect the bridge between adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to be approximately $100 million based on approximately $120 million of annual capital expenditure and capitalized software development costs, as well as a modest source of cash from changes in net working capital combined with interest income. And we continue to expect 2024 stock-based compensation expense to be flat to down in dollar terms on a year-over-year basis and represents approximately 7% of revenue in fiscal year 2024. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2025, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $900 million to $1 billion due to our underlying business momentum, including the benefit of higher customer acquisitions in the second half of 2024. We believe additional upside potential exists when we apply the gaming tax surcharge in those noted high tax states that have multiple online Sportsbook operators, which we are not including at this time. We expect to provide more details on our fiscal year 2025 guidance with our next earnings report in November. That concludes our remarks. We will now open the line for questions. We'll probably start paying a minimum amount of cash taxes in 2025 and 2026, but we don't expect to run through all of our NOLs until 2027 or 2028 at the soonest. I think we anticipate being able to buyback the $1 billion of Class A shares over the next two to three years. And we would like to be -- ideally be formulaic with it create some consistency. But I do expect it to take more than just the next little while to get fully finalized. We won't break it out for this call, but disproportionate amount of it is the existing customers. New customers tend to ramp up over time. So you can assume that it's a little bit heavier on the existing customers and the performance on the retention and the engagement of our existing customers and less on the new customers, which we're still exploring the value of. Jackpocket. No."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to DraftKings First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.[Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. \n I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stanton Dodge, Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead. \nR. Dodge: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Certain statements we make during this call may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed further in our SEC filings that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast.

We will then open the line to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jason Robins. \nJason Robins: Good morning, and thank you all for joining. DraftKings is off to an outstanding start in 2024, and we're excited to be raising our outlook for the year. There are 5 important takeaways as we reflect on our first quarter results and the rest of the year. \n First, our revenue growth is strong as we continue to efficiently acquire new customers, deepen our engagement with existing customers, improve our structural Sportsbook hold percentage and optimize promotional deployment. Revenue grew 53% year-over-year in the first quarter, and our increased revenue guidance midpoint implies 34% year-over-year growth for fiscal year 2024. \n Secondly, we delivered successful Sportsbook launches in Vermont and North Carolina. We acquired customers efficiently and a population penetration rates consistent with prior launches. We expect both states to contribute positively to adjusted EBITDA for the second half of 2024. \n Third, we continue to focus on driving product innovation and customer centricity. Our platform and overall customer experience are rapidly improving. And as a result, we are achieving excellent customer retention and participation across sports and games. \n Fourth, we continue to focus on driving operational efficiency across the organization. We expect adjusted EBITDA flow-through percentage of 53% for fiscal year 2024 due to our largely at scale fixed cost structure and our continued optimization of marketing and promotions. \n Fifth, we are continuing to explore capital allocation options given the strong trajectory of our free cash flow. Beyond our financial highlights, there are 2 important topics I'd also like to briefly discuss. \n The first is responsible gaming. There have been several recent headlines on responsible gaming, a topic that has always been very important to DraftKings. Building products that our customers can enjoy responsibly is rooted in our DNA. And we believe that we are at the forefront of responsible gaming initiatives, including technology, processes, industry affiliations and internal leadership. We will continue to drive these initiatives in conjunction with our regulatory partners and industry participants to responsibly grow this industry to its full potential. \n Second, we continue to innovate on our products while focusing differentially on proprietary technology solutions. In Sportsbook, we made substantial progress on our efforts to shift our highest impact content into our in-house technology and modeling platforms, while also expanding unique offerings like our Progressive Parlay products across all states and all major sports. We are also launching a cash out for Same Game Parlay, which is a critical addition to our offering. \n In iGaming, with the completion of the migration of the GNOG platform onto our in-house technology stack, we achieved important milestone touching both content and technology expansion. We launched Must Hit By Jackpots, another popular variant powered by our proprietary Jackpots platform. And we also continued to expand our homegrown casino games portfolio with the launch of 8 new unique to DraftKings titles in the first quarter of 2024, including Rocket 2, the sequel to our popular original Rocket game. In closing, 2024 is shaping up to be another fantastic year for DraftKings. \n With that, I will turn it over to Alan Ellingson. \nAlan Ellingson: Thank you, Jason. I'll hit the highlights including our first quarter 2024 performance and our updated guidance for the year. Please note that all income statement measures discussed except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, we are off to an outstanding start to the year. \n In the first quarter, we generated $1.175 billion of revenue, representing 53% year-over-year growth and $22 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing adjusted EBITDA flow through percentage of 60%. We achieved strong results across our core value drivers, customer acquisition, retention and engagement were excellent and resulted in higher-than-expected handle in the first quarter. \n Our structural Sportsbook hold percentage was slightly ahead of expectations at 9.8% and increased approximately 150 basis points year-over-year. Promotional reinvestment for OSB and iGaming continue to become more efficient year-over-year and improved by more than 700 basis points as a percentage of GGR. Adjusted gross margin increased more than 550 basis points year-over-year to 44% in the first quarter as a result of higher structural Sportsbook hold and improved promotional efficiency. \n Sales and marketing declined 11% on a year-over-year basis and was consistent with our expectations, both products and technology as well as general and administrative expenses were consistent with our expectations. As you are all aware, we are continuing to exert cost discipline across the organization while simultaneously increasing revenue on a year-over-year basis. \n Moving to our full year 2024 guidance, we are poised for a rapid increase in adjusted EBITDA due to continued strong revenue growth, coupled with our efficient fixed cost structure. On February 15, 2024, we guided fiscal year 2024 revenue of $4.65 billion to $4.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $410 million to $510 million. Today, we are improving our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $4.8 billion to $5 billion and our fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $460 million to $540 million. \n Importantly, the midpoints of our updated 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges implies a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA flow-through percentage of 53%. This attractive flow-through percentage is based on continued excellent performance across our core value drivers as we rapidly expand our gross margin and exert discipline on our cost structure, while simultaneously investing in promotion and marketing in accordance with our LTV to CAC targets. \n We will continue to focus on our dual goals of improving our financial expectations while also investing in customer acquisition and our product and technology capabilities. The $125 million improvement in our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance midpoint and $40 million improvement in our adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint breakdown as follows: customer acquisition, retention and engagement continue to exceed expectations due to marketing optimization initiatives and product advancements. These trends account for $165 million of the revenue improvement and $68 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. Structural Sportsbook hold percentage is increasing primarily as a result of momentum into our same game parlay offering. We now expect our structural Sportsbook hold percentage to approach 10.5% in fiscal year 2024, which accounts for $20 million of the revenue improvement and $14 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. \n Customer-friendly outcomes in late March and April were a headwind of $60 million and $42 million to our fiscal year 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, respectively. We continue to expect our adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 45% to 47% for the year, an improvement of 350 basis points at the midpoint compared to fiscal year 2023. We also continue to expect adjusted sales and marketing expense to decline modestly in fiscal year 2024. We.\n Finally, we expect to generate approximately $400 million in free cash flow in fiscal year 2024 based on approximately $120 million of annual capitalized expenditures and capitalized software development costs, as well as a modest source of cash from changes in net working capital combined with interest income. As a result, we expect our year-end 2024 cash and cash equivalents will be approximately $1.6 billion before our expected use of approximately $413 million in cash to fund our proposed acquisition of Jackpocket upon closing. \n That concludes our remarks. We will now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shaun Kelley with BofA. \nShaun Kelley: Jason or Alan, either, just wanted to see if we could dig in on the hold side a little bit. Obviously, a couple of puts and takes both in the quarter and just for, I think, relative to investor expectations out there. So Jason, if you could talk about like the evolution of kind of your theoretical hold, you actually said that overall, I think it came in a little bit better than management's expectations. So what's driving that? And how do you think about the product evolution maybe both this year and in the out years, what's sort of a good baseline for investors to think about improvement as we get out into 2025 and beyond? \nJason Robins: Yes. I think this has been obviously a big topic for a few years now, and our understanding of it is better than ever. So first, just to explain, when we say we think that structural hold is XYZ, that is based on expected hold and then any differences are bet mix driven. So what that really means is that our bet mix came in better than we expected as it relates to projected hold. As far as how we're thinking about it going forward, I think we continue to believe that there's a lot of upside here. I know everybody wants to know what's the ceiling. I think the answer is we don't know. \n We continue to monitor metrics and all customer behavior, handle per active rates all look healthy as we continue to drive increased parlay mix and average leg count. So I think that will continue to be the focus as long as we continue to see healthy customer metrics and get positive feedback that our customers are enjoying the products we're putting out there. So we'll see how far we can get it. But right now, we do believe there's a good bit of upside still remaining. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling of Morgan Stanley. \nStephen Grambling: I guess, one of the big debates seems to be around flow through versus some of your peers. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on where the company is capturing marketing efficiencies in the first quarter. And then where the biggest opportunities are longer term and whether your philosophy around marketing channels or even national versus local has changed? \nJason Robins: Yes. I mean we had an unbelievably efficient first quarter and it really continued into April. In fact, April, we had a 40% -- roughly 40% year-over-year decrease in our CAC. So I think it's just optimized performance and also really strong growth in the TAM and addressable market. So I think all of that is contributing to a really healthy and efficient marketing. And I give the team a lot of credit. They've worked hard over the last year or 2 to optimize. And if anything, I think we see maybe some opportunities now to invest a bit deeper. So really excited about the work that's been done there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. \nJoseph Greff: Jason, I was hoping you can update us with your views on M&A from here. Obviously, you have Jackpocket pending and closing in short order here. One, how do you think about M&A? Is it still more domestically focused versus international? And then could you do multiple M&A simultaneously. My question is kind of generated by -- within the quarter. There were some industry chatter with regard to one publicly traded iCasino operator. \nJason Robins: Yes. So first, we hope have been very consistent in saying that we have a very high bar for M&A. We understand there's a lot of ways that we can deploy capital to return value to shareholders. And M&A and going on an M&A spree is not something that we're like, hey, this is all we can do with our capital. I do think that M&A will be a lever for us, but we're also practical about, one, how much to your question, we can write off at a time. I do think it is obviously a question of size, but to do materially sized transactions simultaneously, would be very challenging. So that's certainly something that we weigh in our mind.\n And I think secondly, we feel like our organic growth path is really strong right now. So we don't really feel particularly compelled to do M&A as a source of growth, anything -- we understand that the integration and other work required with M&A is actually a distraction from that organic growth. So I think a long way of saying, bar will continue to be high, never say never, but I think 2 at exactly at the same time of size would be challenging. And I think for us, really, we look at capital allocation as a broader question as well as resource and time allocation. And we don't just look at it as, hey, M&A is the answer on that. It's also what are all the other things, whether it's organic investments we can be making or other methods of returning capital and creating value for our shareholders. So that's something that we're mindful of as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Miller with Goldman Sachs. \nBenjamin Miller: I'm curious how you think about the playbook around iGaming cross-sell the OSB users over time as we potentially see more states go live with iGaming that currently have OSB. Are there any updated views on how to think about any incremental investments needed in that scenario? And how you think about reinvestment of likely better LTVs and share of wallet into faster customer acquisition versus the flow-through to incremental margins? \nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question. I mean, first, anytime we have multiple products in a market, it's a huge boon to LTV. And the cost is -- you already acquired the customer. So there might be a promo or something associated with getting them to adopt a new product. But it's really a fraction of what it costs to acquire the customer on the platform. Once you've already acquired them, cross-selling is incredibly effective. And very fast payback means of increasing not only LTV, but also short-term gross profit as well.\n The main funnel we're seeing is really sports to iGaming. We do see some iGaming to sports cross-sell be effective. And of course, we are cross-selling between all of our products. But really, when we find markets have both iGaming and sports, the much more effective funnel is to acquire them on sports and cross-sell them to iGaming. And actually, what I'm really excited about, once we close Jackpocket, is I think that will be a really effective funnel as well, really efficient funnel acquiring on lottery and cross-selling into OSB and iGaming. So very excited about that one. But the short answer is we try to cross-sell between all of our products, and it doesn't cost that much more once you've acquired the customer onto the platform to get them to try new products. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. \nRobin Farley: I was originally going to ask how you balance your thoughts about capital allocation with M&A, but it sounds like you already sort of clarified that M&A is kind of not a major priority right now. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about capital allocation options and what types of things you're considering. \nAlan Ellingson: Yes, Robin, I'll speak to that. I think in the last few months, we've developed a lot more confidence than ever in our free cash flow trajectory for 2024 and beyond. To add some color, we recently kicked off our multiyear planning process. This is an exercise that touches all the functions verticals of the organization. And as part of this, we do evaluate potential uses of cash within our core business. We reevaluated the growth trends of the business and we look to maximize shareholder value. That does include potentially returning capital to our shareholders. So we anticipate we'll be able to share more specific details with you in the next quarter. But we're very comfortable with where we're at right now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. \nCarlo Santarelli: If you guys look out over kind of 2024 or 2025, what are kind of the key focal points or items that you're looking at from a legislative perspective, where you think -- whether it's iGaming or sports [ betting ] you think it will be kind of worth the efforts from your end to kind of make a push? And what are maybe the focused states and/or focused opportunities in your view? \nJason Robins: Yes. I think it's a great question. Obviously, having gotten up and running in 50% of the country population-wise, also roughly 50% of the states in only a little over 5 years is fast. And so I think, naturally, you're going to see a little bit of a slowdown on the sports side and also when you consider the fact that about a little less than half of the remaining population resides in 3 states, that will kind of give you a sense of where the focus is. There's a lot of states left for sure, but there's only a handful of really big ones.\n And when you kind of extend beyond the top 3 into like 5, 6, 7 states, you're going to capture a lot of that. So obviously, we made a push in Georgia this year, came up a little short in several other states as well. I do think you'll see a couple of bills done later in the year on OSB. But as far as thinking out into 2025, I think the big focus will be on Texas. Texas, I think, has a real shot. It got through 1 chamber last year. And as you may know, the Texas legislature doesn't meet in 2024, so we're really gearing up for 2025.\n Also, I think that if you shift over to iGaming, that's probably where there's going to be a little bit more rapid once I think you start to see some momentum legislation because still just a lot of untapped population there. We're still only live in about 11% of the population. So I think that once the states that in certain regions start moving on iGaming more, you'll see a more rapid succession of them. And I also think that the need for tax revenues is going to increase. I think there's a little bit of a delay in that with some of the COVID-relief money that was sent to state. So I do expect to see some momentum pick up in iGaming.\n And I think that's where you might see the next kind of wave of states really quickly. And then as I noted, I think the focus in sports betting will be on a handful of large states. Obviously, we'll try to get bills pass wherever we can. But the real needle movers will be not just the top 3 I mentioned, but states like Georgia that are also very large states population-wise.\n And then I guess the last thing I'd note is, obviously, as you know, we're in the process of completing our Jackpocket transaction. And I think there's a ton of state expansion opportunity there. And the vast majority of it doesn't have to be legislative. It's done without legislative action. So really excited about the prospects of getting that business up and running in a lot of different states. And I think you will see some additional states come -- get up and running for Jackpocket before the end of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Clark Lampen with BTIG. \nWilliam Lampen: I wanted to come back to marketing efficiency, especially since Jason, you noted that there's -- it seems like now there's an opportunity to invest a little bit deeper. Can you help us understand what's sort of driving some of the improvements that you noted in the shareholder letter. And I guess, maybe more importantly, whether what we're seeing now is indicative of ongoing improvements you guys think you can draw? I guess if I look at the numbers for the year, it seems like the OpEx guidance went up a little bit. And I'm wondering, specifically, are you guys seeing better payback periods right now that are leading you to lean in a little bit more aggressively on marketing? Appreciate it. \nJason Robins: You nailed it. I mean I think I mentioned earlier, the CAC for April was roughly 40% lower year-over-year. I mean we are seeing as efficient marketing as we've seen since, I think, basically launching sportsbook. So really, really excited about that. I don't -- I mean, just to be clear, we're not going to have a massive increase. I think this is like optimization around the edges where we see an opportunity, maybe invest a little bit deeper in a couple of areas. But this isn't going to be like a major shift in strategy by any means. I think we're going to focus on as markets mature, seeing lower and lower external marketing spend. And at the same time, it's not going to be a straight line.\n There will be periods where we find good solid things that we can cut or just natural kind of market conditions lead to us cutting certain spend. And then there will be other times we identify windows where we can increase. And I think given some of the efficiency we've been seeing, we think there's an opportunity maybe for a little bit of a deeper investment. But like I said, it's a little bit. As you mentioned, it was not a huge move. It was just a slight increase in OpEx versus where we were before. And I think that's a sign of the strong revenue growth and unbelievable CACs that we're seeing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joel Stauff with Susquehanna. \nJoseph Stauff: I wanted to ask maybe Jason, if you can discuss like your more recent customer acquisitions or cohorts versus, say, a year ago or whatever kind of time period to go? And the lifetime value or the LTVs that you calculate for those, are you seeing an improvement largely because of marketing efficiency? Or are the economics or the spending levels for the more recently acquired customers similar to, say, a year ago. I was wondering if you could discuss that. \nJason Robins: It's really both sides of the LTV and CAC equation. As I noted a moment ago, we had a really sharp decrease, about 40% better CAC in April this year than last year. And a continuation of really strong CACs through Q4 and Q1. And at the same time, we've also made a tremendous number of improvements to our product, to our CRM to our customer experience overall, which has led to stickier customers, our activity rates are higher than ever, and our handle and spend per customer is up. So I think we're just in a period of industry growth and still very early stage of the industry where a lot of things are just out there to be optimized and improved upon. And where I think the team is executing really well against both sides of the LTV and CAC equation right now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. \nRobert Fishman: Jason, on media right partnerships, I'm wondering if you can talk about your Amazon relationship and how that's helped drive incremental opportunities for Thursday Night Football. And then really, any early thoughts on how that partnership can be expanded if they're able to secure a big NBA package or maybe any other comments you want to make on NBA's new media deal and how that could impact DraftKing. And then just separately, if I can add, wondering if you could just speak to Jason Parks new role and how you could characterize the biggest near-term versus longer-term opportunities with that? \nJason Robins: Great question. So on the first one, Amazon has been a great partner of ours. We've really gotten a lot of value, and I think they have too out of the relationship and if there's ways we can expand it depending on what their future plans are, then that's certainly a discussion we would welcome. And I'd also note we have great relationships with a number of different parties that are rumored to be involved in the bidding. So wherever it lands, I look forward to hopefully finding ways to build relationships and bring great content to customers and partner with other great organizations. So we'll have to see how that plays out.\n And then in terms of Jason Parks role, as you may know, Jason actually just turned the reins over to Alan officially, I think, like a day or 2 ago. So he's been working hard on the queue and on everything else just like the rest of us. And I think where he's had some spare bandwidth, he's really dove into the Jackpocket integration, which obviously is a very immediate term thing that we need to really make sure we do a good job with. So that's been his immediate-term focus. I think as he rolls off this CFO role and Alan rolls in, I think you'll see him start to have more time free up. And my expectation is that areas like payments and AI will be a major focus for him in the next 6 to 12 months. So more to come there, but really, I think, looking at things that, hence the title can be more medium- to long-term transformational for DraftKings as well as obviously making sure given how important the Jackpocket integration is that we do a great job there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Katz with Jefferies. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [ Ara Mattias ] for David Katz. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask how you're thinking about AI, maybe high level, but in terms of range of uses and responsible gaming. \nJason Robins: Yes. I'm excited you asked that. This is one of the areas that I know a lot of companies are talking about, and we certainly agree can really be impactful in a significant and transformational way to DraftKings in the future. So we're all in on it. I think some of the early momentum we've gotten and really the focus for us is utilizing best-in-class third-party applications. Right now, we're using multiple tools from about 5 to 10 vendors. And we're testing a variety of different use cases across the company, things that improve our product like rapid prototyping and sprint metrics supporting and also initiatives that improve efficiency like code refactoring, code review and marketing asset creation.\n And then obviously, being customer-centric, customer experience is at the center of our AI initiatives, including using AI to help model and detect signs of problem gaming. So that we can properly fag things for our player intervention team to go and investigate. So lots of really good stuff there. And I think we're just scratching the surface. It's super early, but our focus is not on trying to build proprietary tech as much as it is. I mean we may build some on top of it, but it's really getting in there and using best-in-class third-party tools and figuring out the proper applications to drive value for DraftKings. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord Genuity. \nMichael Graham: I wanted to help -- ask you to help us think through the platform becoming more of a mass-market entertainment product in some of your more mature states like New Jersey, are you seeing penetration slow down there? Is it hitting a J-curve type of dynamic? And could you also address what's going on with GGR concentration at the top end of the customer base? Is it becoming a little more spread out or more concentrated? Just hit on some of those dynamics. \nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question. I mean, all of our older states, and you have to remember, there's still even New Jersey, it's still only 5.5 years in. So they're all still really growing nicely. In fact, if you take sort of a same-store view of our 2018 to 2022 states, we grew net revenue about 40% year-over-year in Q1. So really healthy growth in our existing states. And I think we'll continue to see that as we improve product and also just as the industry develops and the TAM increases.\n As far as the concentration, we're seeing it actually trend a little bit away from that. So definitely, as with any industry, there is a cohort of customers that spend a lot. And that drives a decent amount of the revenue. But I think especially relative to other companies in the industry, we're much more diversified. And the trend we're seeing is more and more casual is coming to the market, particularly as you noted, in older states, I think as more people come into the market, that percentage of casual increases. So definitely something that we're seeing trend in that direction. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Chaiken with Mizuho. \nBenjamin Chaiken: You mentioned promo expense was down over 700 basis points year-over-year, which is clearly generating a lot of operating leverage on net revenue. I would love to hear your thoughts around maybe what's driving the improvement? Is it just the natural evolution of the existing customers who are happy to use the product? Is DraftKings becoming more accurate and efficient how you target? Or is it a function of just kind of entering less states? It'd be good to hear any color on what you think the biggest drivers are of the traction and then the largest opportunities going forward? \nJason Robins: Yes. I mean I think the biggest thing is the natural evolution and you mentioned this in your last point. A lot of that comes from entering some new states. So last year, in Q1, we launched Ohio and Massachusetts. This year, we launched North Carolina, Vermont, which are still 2 big states, but populations -- combined population in North Carolina and Vermont is definitely lower than Massachusetts and Ohio. Secondly, just as the customer base matures, we're seeing an increase in the ratio of existing customer volume to new customer volume, which is naturally bringing down the promo rate.\n So a lot. In fact, the majority of it is just the natural maturity of states. And as you noted, having a lower percentage of the population launched in Q1 this year than last year. Secondly, we always are working to optimize, and the team has done a fantastic job over the last year really finding ways to lean in, in places that are working and cut in places that aren't. And I think that's made a lot of improvement also in the year-over-year drop. And there's still a ton of opportunity there. I mean we're just scratching the surface on some of this stuff. And I think the level at which we can kind of personalize the experiences will also help us increase return and optimize promo and we're just scratching the surface there, too. So there's a lot of upside on that line item. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. \nBrandt Montour: So the iGaming market accelerated in the 1Q growth rate for the overall market, you guys accelerated your iGaming growth rate. Jason, I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on what was driving that at the market level if it was you and your peers, better marketing, better cross-sell and if you think you saw more -- or you guys at least did you saw more acceleration on the MAU side or the ARPMUP side? \nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question. I think that a lot of it is just momentum of the industry, and we're seeing it in sports, too. Just a lot of new customers coming in and a lot of people that are crossing over from sports into iGaming. I also do think that some of it has been product driven. We've made a lot of improvements to our product, many of which we noted on our earnings call earlier, on the scripted part of the earnings call earlier. So definitely a combination of those things. And then I think, certainly, on the marketing side, we've improved as well. That's definitely been a little more recent. So I don't know how much of that's driven the industry growth. But I think we found some wins in the recent days that have helped us acquire customers more efficiently as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist. \nBarry Jonas: First off, congrats, Alan, on the new role. I wanted to ask about technology. Smaller competitors talk about narrowing the gap. And we know you're not standing still, but are there more specific parts of the product you think you'll be able to maintain your competitive edge over time better than others? \nJason Robins: Absolutely. I mean, first, sports, in particular, but really all online gaming products are incredibly complicated. There's a ton going on. I think, first and foremost, having a lot of scale and a very wide customer base gives us an advantage because we have more data and more data points to model and to improve personalization and make other decisions off of. Secondly, as you noted, we continue to invest and being at scale gives us a much larger revenue base to invest in product and engineering. And so we continue to lean in there. And I think that there's a ton we can do to improve the product that will hopefully be revenue additive and certainly will be competitively differentiated.\n The other thing that I would say is that a lot of what we're focused on now. Yes, we continue to focus on customer-facing features, but a lot of what we're focused on now are kind of behind the curtain type of things that help us optimize hold rate and trading, things that help us personalize experiences that retain and create stickier customers. Those things are harder to copy because it's not an obvious consumer-facing feature that somebody can say, \"Oh, yes, I'm just going to figure out how to do that.\" Oftentimes, it's invisible to the front end. So I think there's a lot of advantage that can be maintained long term and those sorts of things as well as sort of just the inherent advantages of scale and robustness of data size and size and efficacy of product and engineering team. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. \nDaniel Politzer: I want to touch a bit on iGaming again. One of your closest competitors in that market seems to be gaining some share momentum. Could you maybe talk about the promotional environment and how you think about kind of the share outlook for yourselves as we look forward? \nJason Robins: Yes. I mean I think what you're seeing, which probably isn't surprising, it's the same dynamic emerging in iGaming as in OSB. So on the one hand, I think that, that gives a lot of sort of clarity in terms of investors of what long-term market structure could look like, which is good. And I think for us, we just continue to focus on trying to deliver the best customer experience. And I think if we do that, we'll maximize our long-term share of the pie. But I do want to note that share is not the only metric. Obviously, everybody follows that, and that's a lot of questions. But we're focused on being the most profitable company in the space and making the most money. So I think that's ultimately how we define share of the space, not GGR share. Obviously, GGR share is a helpful metric to look at, but bottom line share is the most important thing. \nDaniel Politzer: And then just one quick housekeeping. Did you guys give an actual hold for the first quarter? I know you gave the structural, but if you could provide actual , that would be helpful. \nJason Robins: Yes, I think we've said about 9.5%. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. \nJed Kelly: Great. Just can you talk about MAU trends? I thought it was down in the first quarter, realized you were comping some state launches. But can you speak to that? And then just as a follow-up, you're launching your new Pick6 product. Can you talk about how that can help you build your database in states where sports betting is not yet legal. \nJason Robins: So on the first one, are you talking about like versus consensus because we were up on MUPs year over... \nJed Kelly: No, I just I'm talking -- it was down sequentially... \nJason Robins: From last quarter. \nJed Kelly: Yes. So first quarter... \nJason Robins: That's just seasonality. Yes, that's just seasonality. That typically happens. And I think the biggest thing also that drove that was the state launches actually probably even more than seasonality, to be honest, that's what you're seeing there is the state launches. We had Ohio and Massachusetts launch in Q1 of last year. So that drove a lot of MAU in that quarter. So I don't -- there's nothing kind of other than that going on there. And then sorry, what was your second question? \nJed Kelly: Just on how does your Pick6 product help you build up your databases in states where sports betting is not yet legal? \nJason Robins: Yes, it's a great question. I mean, Pick6 is our latest fantasy product. I think we're pretty excited about it. We think it's something that could definitely as all of our fantasy products have helped us build the database in states that aren't yet legal. And also just create additional revenue and new ways to engage with our customers. So you nailed it, that's kind of the goal there. And I think we haven't done a lot to innovate in fantasy until the last year or so. And I think the team is energized and focused on getting back to innovation in the fantasy space as well, and this is a great example of that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. \nBernard McTernan: Jason, given the increased news flow this year about state tax rates potentially going higher in some areas, if there was an existing or relatively mature state increased taxes, what would the impact be? And then what levers would you have to offset that and over what time frame? \nJason Robins: Yes. So first, I do think states understand that there is still a very large illegal market. That's not going away. And in order for us to continue to be able to be competitive and not drive customers back to that market and also continue to take customers out of that market because there's still quite a few even in the most mature states that they need to keep tax rates at a reasonable level. So I do expect that, that will be the case. But we're prepared either way. I mean in the end, the cost has to get absorbed by the consumer if the government raises taxes.\n So there's various levers to do that. Also, we could lower external marketing, which I think will be also partially just driven by the fact that if taxes go up, we're going to have to create better margins and that will be a lever that we'll have to pull as well. But like I said, I think that states do understand that any sort of negative impacts to the consumer offering that companies would have to take where tax rates increase would really be counter to the notion that we're trying to drive activity from the illegal market to the legal market, which has enormous number of benefits, only one of which is generating taxes. \n So I think states get that, and I expect that maybe there'll be 1 or 2 here and there that look to do that, but I don't think many of them will. And I even think the ones that are getting a lot more information now. And my expectation is that we'll be able to convince them that it's not a good policy decision. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jordan Bender with Citizens JMP. \nJordan Bender: Going off at Jason Park's new role in the payment processing, how should we be speaking about what that looks like to bring your payment costs more in line with your long-term goal. Is it coming through initiatives like bringing down the interchange rate that you're paying or more strategic like bringing some or all of that technology in-house? \n And then, Jason, I just have a follow-up. In your prepared remarks, I think you said the new state launch should add to EBITDA in the back half of the year, is that to say that the paybacks are just way ahead of any states that have been launched in the past? \nJason Robins: Yes. So on the first question, it's still early, so I don't have a lot of specifics, but I think the types of things that Jason will be looking at are consumer-facing optimizations, like are there ways that we can motivate consumers to use lower-cost payment methods as well as other sorts of medium- to longer-term solutions like in-housing of certain pieces. So really don't know where it's going to go because it's very much an exploratory. And as I noted earlier, he just turned over the reins to Alan in the last day or 2. So I haven't really had a chance. He hasn't really had a chance to dig in there yet. But I do expect there's a lot of opportunity there.\n And just to clarify one thing, you mentioned in order to reach our long-term levels. Right now, we are tracking to where we have set expectations long term as far as payment costs go. I think this is really looking for opportunities for upside above and beyond that. We feel like already we're based on the trajectory of our current business, and this isn't just for payment processing, it's across all the different metrics of the KPIs that we have, we feel good about that trajectory. So this is really about looking for additional upside above and beyond what we shared at Investor Day last year.\n And then I'm sorry, what was the second question? \nJordan Bender: Yes. Just a follow-up. In your prepared remarks, I thought you said that the 2 new spaces that were just launched should add to EBITDA in the back half of the year. Just -- is that -- did I hear that correctly? \nJason Robins: You did. Yes. So that is baked into our guide. And you're right. I think the last -- it's really been a trend not just with these 2, but with the last year or 2 of states. Last year, we noted Ohio and Massachusetts, both contributed positively by Q4. I think this year, our expectation is that the 2 that we launched, North Carolina and Vermont will actually contribute possibly to the entire back half of the year. So I think it's just another example of how we continue to get better and better at optimizing our state launch playbook, we're able to capture a tremendous amount of value in a much shorter period of time with a much more efficient level of investment than we did, say, 3, 4 years ago. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. \nChad Beynon: Jason, I wanted to ask really what gave you the confidence to raise the structural hold to 10.5%. Obviously, it's early in the year. Is that just kind of a combination of what you're seeing with pre-match, legs of parlays, in play, et cetera? Any color around that would be helpful. \nJason Robins: That's exactly right. It's really a function of some of the product enhancements we've made in what we're seeing that due to our parlay mix and average leg count. Progressive parlay as an example, is a much higher average leg count than a typical parlay. So that's been one of the many examples of contributors. We also are right now in the process of rolling out across states cash out for SGP, which is another lever, I think. So it's really a testament to the work the team has done to drive that mix and average leg count. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. \nRyan Sigdahl: How do you think about pricing going forward? Our checks indicated DraftKings offers the most competitive or best odds for consumers while also generating industry plus hold due to the bet mix. So kind of a win-win there. But how much of a competitive advantage do you think that is as it relates to customer retention? \nJason Robins: Yes. I think for most markets, the price is the price. So I think when it comes to like being able to have optimal pricing for, say, some of the lesser bet markets, there are some customers that may line shop. I don't think it's the majority of them, but some do. And then there's other bet types that tend to have more line shopping like futures bets. But most of the mainstream bets, the player props, the game lines, the over unders are typically fairly comparable.\n That said, we always make sure that we're competitive. And so we're not trying to win on price, but we're also not trying to have worse pricing than anyone else out there. And I think you noted this, but the real sweet spot is if you have great models and your pricing is tight, you can actually hold better and continue to be super competitive on the pricing side. Those things are not at odds at all.\n And the other thing I would mention is -- and this is also a really important part about having great models and tight pricing, the market uptime can be much higher, which I think particularly for live betting is a significant advantage if customers are trying to live that and can't get through, then they're going to go somewhere else. So that's another real advantage to having tight pricing and strong models. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Stantial with Stifel. \nJeffrey Stantial: Jason, it's been several quarters now of pretty meaningful upside from user acquisition retention and monetization trends. As time goes on, are you seeing sort of the relative impact for each of those individual drivers shift around? In other words, are you seeing user acquisition surprise to the upside more so than monetization relative to trends last year or the inverse or is the relative contribution of each state mostly constant. \nJason Robins: At any point in time, there's definitely something that you're more like, wow, that is just crushing what we expected. But I will say last few years, really, the last 2 years in particular, it's been across the board. I mean this last sort of quarter and particularly in April, it's been customer acquisition, for sure, which I think was true for Q4 and Q1, but I also -- I've seen significant increases to LTVs made over that period of time, too, our player activity and retention levels have been higher than ever. So I think as we improve the product and also as we just get more data and continue to do the analysis, continue to optimize, continue to build better tools that allow the teams to trade and also tools on the marketing side that allow the teams to get data to optimize the marketing better. Same thing with promos.\n We're just -- again, we're at that stage, I think, the industry or the company where there's just so much that's obvious that we can do, and it's just cranking through all of it, and it's really moving metrics across the entire value chain. So I can't point to any one thing overall, but you are correct that at any point in time, you might be like, wow, we had a great quarter from  a customer acquisition standpoint. But often that comes with a great quarter from a retention standpoint, too, because a lot of times the same things that you're doing to drive acquisition also drive great activation and retention. \nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jason Robins for any closing remarks. \nJason Robins: Thank you all for joining us on today's call. As you can see, DraftKing is off to a fantastic start for 2024, and we're really excited about the rest of this year and beyond. I look forward to speaking with you over the coming weeks and hope you all stay safe and well. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Robins",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you all for joining. DraftKings is off to an outstanding start in 2024, and we're excited to be raising our outlook for the year. There are 5 important takeaways as we reflect on our first quarter results and the rest of the year. \n First, our revenue growth is strong as we continue to efficiently acquire new customers, deepen our engagement with existing customers, improve our structural Sportsbook hold percentage and optimize promotional deployment. Revenue grew 53% year-over-year in the first quarter, and our increased revenue guidance midpoint implies 34% year-over-year growth for fiscal year 2024. \n Secondly, we delivered successful Sportsbook launches in Vermont and North Carolina. We acquired customers efficiently and a population penetration rates consistent with prior launches. We expect both states to contribute positively to adjusted EBITDA for the second half of 2024. \n Third, we continue to focus on driving product innovation and customer centricity. Our platform and overall customer experience are rapidly improving. And as a result, we are achieving excellent customer retention and participation across sports and games. \n Fourth, we continue to focus on driving operational efficiency across the organization. We expect adjusted EBITDA flow-through percentage of 53% for fiscal year 2024 due to our largely at scale fixed cost structure and our continued optimization of marketing and promotions. \n Fifth, we are continuing to explore capital allocation options given the strong trajectory of our free cash flow. Beyond our financial highlights, there are 2 important topics I'd also like to briefly discuss. \n The first is responsible gaming. There have been several recent headlines on responsible gaming, a topic that has always been very important to DraftKings. Building products that our customers can enjoy responsibly is rooted in our DNA. And we believe that we are at the forefront of responsible gaming initiatives, including technology, processes, industry affiliations and internal leadership. We will continue to drive these initiatives in conjunction with our regulatory partners and industry participants to responsibly grow this industry to its full potential. \n Second, we continue to innovate on our products while focusing differentially on proprietary technology solutions. In Sportsbook, we made substantial progress on our efforts to shift our highest impact content into our in-house technology and modeling platforms, while also expanding unique offerings like our Progressive Parlay products across all states and all major sports. We are also launching a cash out for Same Game Parlay, which is a critical addition to our offering. \n In iGaming, with the completion of the migration of the GNOG platform onto our in-house technology stack, we achieved important milestone touching both content and technology expansion. We launched Must Hit By Jackpots, another popular variant powered by our proprietary Jackpots platform. And we also continued to expand our homegrown casino games portfolio with the launch of 8 new unique to DraftKings titles in the first quarter of 2024, including Rocket 2, the sequel to our popular original Rocket game. In closing, 2024 is shaping up to be another fantastic year for DraftKings. \n With that, I will turn it over to Alan Ellingson. Yes. I think this has been obviously a big topic for a few years now, and our understanding of it is better than ever. So first, just to explain, when we say we think that structural hold is XYZ, that is based on expected hold and then any differences are bet mix driven. So what that really means is that our bet mix came in better than we expected as it relates to projected hold. As far as how we're thinking about it going forward, I think we continue to believe that there's a lot of upside here. I know everybody wants to know what's the ceiling. I think the answer is we don't know. \n We continue to monitor metrics and all customer behavior, handle per active rates all look healthy as we continue to drive increased parlay mix and average leg count. So I think that will continue to be the focus as long as we continue to see healthy customer metrics and get positive feedback that our customers are enjoying the products we're putting out there. So we'll see how far we can get it. But right now, we do believe there's a good bit of upside still remaining. Yes. I mean we had an unbelievably efficient first quarter and it really continued into April. In fact, April, we had a 40% -- roughly 40% year-over-year decrease in our CAC. So I think it's just optimized performance and also really strong growth in the TAM and addressable market. So I think all of that is contributing to a really healthy and efficient marketing. And I give the team a lot of credit. They've worked hard over the last year or 2 to optimize. And if anything, I think we see maybe some opportunities now to invest a bit deeper. So really excited about the work that's been done there. Yes. So first, we hope have been very consistent in saying that we have a very high bar for M&A. We understand there's a lot of ways that we can deploy capital to return value to shareholders. And M&A and going on an M&A spree is not something that we're like, hey, this is all we can do with our capital. I do think that M&A will be a lever for us, but we're also practical about, one, how much to your question, we can write off at a time. I do think it is obviously a question of size, but to do materially sized transactions simultaneously, would be very challenging. So that's certainly something that we weigh in our mind.\n And I think secondly, we feel like our organic growth path is really strong right now. So we don't really feel particularly compelled to do M&A as a source of growth, anything -- we understand that the integration and other work required with M&A is actually a distraction from that organic growth. So I think a long way of saying, bar will continue to be high, never say never, but I think 2 at exactly at the same time of size would be challenging. And I think for us, really, we look at capital allocation as a broader question as well as resource and time allocation. And we don't just look at it as, hey, M&A is the answer on that. It's also what are all the other things, whether it's organic investments we can be making or other methods of returning capital and creating value for our shareholders. So that's something that we're mindful of as well. Yes, it's a great question. I mean, first, anytime we have multiple products in a market, it's a huge boon to LTV. And the cost is -- you already acquired the customer. So there might be a promo or something associated with getting them to adopt a new product. But it's really a fraction of what it costs to acquire the customer on the platform. Once you've already acquired them, cross-selling is incredibly effective. And very fast payback means of increasing not only LTV, but also short-term gross profit as well.\n The main funnel we're seeing is really sports to iGaming. We do see some iGaming to sports cross-sell be effective. And of course, we are cross-selling between all of our products. But really, when we find markets have both iGaming and sports, the much more effective funnel is to acquire them on sports and cross-sell them to iGaming. And actually, what I'm really excited about, once we close Jackpocket, is I think that will be a really effective funnel as well, really efficient funnel acquiring on lottery and cross-selling into OSB and iGaming. So very excited about that one. But the short answer is we try to cross-sell between all of our products, and it doesn't cost that much more once you've acquired the customer onto the platform to get them to try new products. Yes. I think it's a great question. Obviously, having gotten up and running in 50% of the country population-wise, also roughly 50% of the states in only a little over 5 years is fast. And so I think, naturally, you're going to see a little bit of a slowdown on the sports side and also when you consider the fact that about a little less than half of the remaining population resides in 3 states, that will kind of give you a sense of where the focus is. There's a lot of states left for sure, but there's only a handful of really big ones.\n And when you kind of extend beyond the top 3 into like 5, 6, 7 states, you're going to capture a lot of that. So obviously, we made a push in Georgia this year, came up a little short in several other states as well. I do think you'll see a couple of bills done later in the year on OSB. But as far as thinking out into 2025, I think the big focus will be on Texas. Texas, I think, has a real shot. It got through 1 chamber last year. And as you may know, the Texas legislature doesn't meet in 2024, so we're really gearing up for 2025.\n Also, I think that if you shift over to iGaming, that's probably where there's going to be a little bit more rapid once I think you start to see some momentum legislation because still just a lot of untapped population there. We're still only live in about 11% of the population. So I think that once the states that in certain regions start moving on iGaming more, you'll see a more rapid succession of them. And I also think that the need for tax revenues is going to increase. I think there's a little bit of a delay in that with some of the COVID-relief money that was sent to state. So I do expect to see some momentum pick up in iGaming.\n And I think that's where you might see the next kind of wave of states really quickly. And then as I noted, I think the focus in sports betting will be on a handful of large states. Obviously, we'll try to get bills pass wherever we can. But the real needle movers will be not just the top 3 I mentioned, but states like Georgia that are also very large states population-wise.\n And then I guess the last thing I'd note is, obviously, as you know, we're in the process of completing our Jackpocket transaction. And I think there's a ton of state expansion opportunity there. And the vast majority of it doesn't have to be legislative. It's done without legislative action. So really excited about the prospects of getting that business up and running in a lot of different states. And I think you will see some additional states come -- get up and running for Jackpocket before the end of the year. You nailed it. I mean I think I mentioned earlier, the CAC for April was roughly 40% lower year-over-year. I mean we are seeing as efficient marketing as we've seen since, I think, basically launching sportsbook. So really, really excited about that. I don't -- I mean, just to be clear, we're not going to have a massive increase. I think this is like optimization around the edges where we see an opportunity, maybe invest a little bit deeper in a couple of areas. But this isn't going to be like a major shift in strategy by any means. I think we're going to focus on as markets mature, seeing lower and lower external marketing spend. And at the same time, it's not going to be a straight line.\n There will be periods where we find good solid things that we can cut or just natural kind of market conditions lead to us cutting certain spend. And then there will be other times we identify windows where we can increase. And I think given some of the efficiency we've been seeing, we think there's an opportunity maybe for a little bit of a deeper investment. But like I said, it's a little bit. As you mentioned, it was not a huge move. It was just a slight increase in OpEx versus where we were before. And I think that's a sign of the strong revenue growth and unbelievable CACs that we're seeing. It's really both sides of the LTV and CAC equation. As I noted a moment ago, we had a really sharp decrease, about 40% better CAC in April this year than last year. And a continuation of really strong CACs through Q4 and Q1. And at the same time, we've also made a tremendous number of improvements to our product, to our CRM to our customer experience overall, which has led to stickier customers, our activity rates are higher than ever, and our handle and spend per customer is up. So I think we're just in a period of industry growth and still very early stage of the industry where a lot of things are just out there to be optimized and improved upon. And where I think the team is executing really well against both sides of the LTV and CAC equation right now. Great question. So on the first one, Amazon has been a great partner of ours. We've really gotten a lot of value, and I think they have too out of the relationship and if there's ways we can expand it depending on what their future plans are, then that's certainly a discussion we would welcome. And I'd also note we have great relationships with a number of different parties that are rumored to be involved in the bidding. So wherever it lands, I look forward to hopefully finding ways to build relationships and bring great content to customers and partner with other great organizations. So we'll have to see how that plays out.\n And then in terms of Jason Parks role, as you may know, Jason actually just turned the reins over to Alan officially, I think, like a day or 2 ago. So he's been working hard on the queue and on everything else just like the rest of us. And I think where he's had some spare bandwidth, he's really dove into the Jackpocket integration, which obviously is a very immediate term thing that we need to really make sure we do a good job with. So that's been his immediate-term focus. I think as he rolls off this CFO role and Alan rolls in, I think you'll see him start to have more time free up. And my expectation is that areas like payments and AI will be a major focus for him in the next 6 to 12 months. So more to come there, but really, I think, looking at things that, hence the title can be more medium- to long-term transformational for DraftKings as well as obviously making sure given how important the Jackpocket integration is that we do a great job there. Yes. I'm excited you asked that. This is one of the areas that I know a lot of companies are talking about, and we certainly agree can really be impactful in a significant and transformational way to DraftKings in the future. So we're all in on it. I think some of the early momentum we've gotten and really the focus for us is utilizing best-in-class third-party applications. Right now, we're using multiple tools from about 5 to 10 vendors. And we're testing a variety of different use cases across the company, things that improve our product like rapid prototyping and sprint metrics supporting and also initiatives that improve efficiency like code refactoring, code review and marketing asset creation.\n And then obviously, being customer-centric, customer experience is at the center of our AI initiatives, including using AI to help model and detect signs of problem gaming. So that we can properly fag things for our player intervention team to go and investigate. So lots of really good stuff there. And I think we're just scratching the surface. It's super early, but our focus is not on trying to build proprietary tech as much as it is. I mean we may build some on top of it, but it's really getting in there and using best-in-class third-party tools and figuring out the proper applications to drive value for DraftKings. Yes, it's a great question. I mean, all of our older states, and you have to remember, there's still even New Jersey, it's still only 5.5 years in. So they're all still really growing nicely. In fact, if you take sort of a same-store view of our 2018 to 2022 states, we grew net revenue about 40% year-over-year in Q1. So really healthy growth in our existing states. And I think we'll continue to see that as we improve product and also just as the industry develops and the TAM increases.\n As far as the concentration, we're seeing it actually trend a little bit away from that. So definitely, as with any industry, there is a cohort of customers that spend a lot. And that drives a decent amount of the revenue. But I think especially relative to other companies in the industry, we're much more diversified. And the trend we're seeing is more and more casual is coming to the market, particularly as you noted, in older states, I think as more people come into the market, that percentage of casual increases. So definitely something that we're seeing trend in that direction. Yes. I mean I think the biggest thing is the natural evolution and you mentioned this in your last point. A lot of that comes from entering some new states. So last year, in Q1, we launched Ohio and Massachusetts. This year, we launched North Carolina, Vermont, which are still 2 big states, but populations -- combined population in North Carolina and Vermont is definitely lower than Massachusetts and Ohio. Secondly, just as the customer base matures, we're seeing an increase in the ratio of existing customer volume to new customer volume, which is naturally bringing down the promo rate.\n So a lot. In fact, the majority of it is just the natural maturity of states. And as you noted, having a lower percentage of the population launched in Q1 this year than last year. Secondly, we always are working to optimize, and the team has done a fantastic job over the last year really finding ways to lean in, in places that are working and cut in places that aren't. And I think that's made a lot of improvement also in the year-over-year drop. And there's still a ton of opportunity there. I mean we're just scratching the surface on some of this stuff. And I think the level at which we can kind of personalize the experiences will also help us increase return and optimize promo and we're just scratching the surface there, too. So there's a lot of upside on that line item. Yes, it's a great question. I think that a lot of it is just momentum of the industry, and we're seeing it in sports, too. Just a lot of new customers coming in and a lot of people that are crossing over from sports into iGaming. I also do think that some of it has been product driven. We've made a lot of improvements to our product, many of which we noted on our earnings call earlier, on the scripted part of the earnings call earlier. So definitely a combination of those things. And then I think, certainly, on the marketing side, we've improved as well. That's definitely been a little more recent. So I don't know how much of that's driven the industry growth. But I think we found some wins in the recent days that have helped us acquire customers more efficiently as well. Absolutely. I mean, first, sports, in particular, but really all online gaming products are incredibly complicated. There's a ton going on. I think, first and foremost, having a lot of scale and a very wide customer base gives us an advantage because we have more data and more data points to model and to improve personalization and make other decisions off of. Secondly, as you noted, we continue to invest and being at scale gives us a much larger revenue base to invest in product and engineering. And so we continue to lean in there. And I think that there's a ton we can do to improve the product that will hopefully be revenue additive and certainly will be competitively differentiated.\n The other thing that I would say is that a lot of what we're focused on now. Yes, we continue to focus on customer-facing features, but a lot of what we're focused on now are kind of behind the curtain type of things that help us optimize hold rate and trading, things that help us personalize experiences that retain and create stickier customers. Those things are harder to copy because it's not an obvious consumer-facing feature that somebody can say, \"Oh, yes, I'm just going to figure out how to do that.\" Oftentimes, it's invisible to the front end. So I think there's a lot of advantage that can be maintained long term and those sorts of things as well as sort of just the inherent advantages of scale and robustness of data size and size and efficacy of product and engineering team. Yes. I mean I think what you're seeing, which probably isn't surprising, it's the same dynamic emerging in iGaming as in OSB. So on the one hand, I think that, that gives a lot of sort of clarity in terms of investors of what long-term market structure could look like, which is good. And I think for us, we just continue to focus on trying to deliver the best customer experience. And I think if we do that, we'll maximize our long-term share of the pie. But I do want to note that share is not the only metric. Obviously, everybody follows that, and that's a lot of questions. But we're focused on being the most profitable company in the space and making the most money. So I think that's ultimately how we define share of the space, not GGR share. Obviously, GGR share is a helpful metric to look at, but bottom line share is the most important thing. Yes, I think we've said about 9.5%. So on the first one, are you talking about like versus consensus because we were up on MUPs year over... From last quarter. That's just seasonality. Yes, that's just seasonality. That typically happens. And I think the biggest thing also that drove that was the state launches actually probably even more than seasonality, to be honest, that's what you're seeing there is the state launches. We had Ohio and Massachusetts launch in Q1 of last year. So that drove a lot of MAU in that quarter. So I don't -- there's nothing kind of other than that going on there. And then sorry, what was your second question? Yes, it's a great question. I mean, Pick6 is our latest fantasy product. I think we're pretty excited about it. We think it's something that could definitely as all of our fantasy products have helped us build the database in states that aren't yet legal. And also just create additional revenue and new ways to engage with our customers. So you nailed it, that's kind of the goal there. And I think we haven't done a lot to innovate in fantasy until the last year or so. And I think the team is energized and focused on getting back to innovation in the fantasy space as well, and this is a great example of that. Yes. So first, I do think states understand that there is still a very large illegal market. That's not going away. And in order for us to continue to be able to be competitive and not drive customers back to that market and also continue to take customers out of that market because there's still quite a few even in the most mature states that they need to keep tax rates at a reasonable level. So I do expect that, that will be the case. But we're prepared either way. I mean in the end, the cost has to get absorbed by the consumer if the government raises taxes.\n So there's various levers to do that. Also, we could lower external marketing, which I think will be also partially just driven by the fact that if taxes go up, we're going to have to create better margins and that will be a lever that we'll have to pull as well. But like I said, I think that states do understand that any sort of negative impacts to the consumer offering that companies would have to take where tax rates increase would really be counter to the notion that we're trying to drive activity from the illegal market to the legal market, which has enormous number of benefits, only one of which is generating taxes. \n So I think states get that, and I expect that maybe there'll be 1 or 2 here and there that look to do that, but I don't think many of them will. And I even think the ones that are getting a lot more information now. And my expectation is that we'll be able to convince them that it's not a good policy decision. Yes. So on the first question, it's still early, so I don't have a lot of specifics, but I think the types of things that Jason will be looking at are consumer-facing optimizations, like are there ways that we can motivate consumers to use lower-cost payment methods as well as other sorts of medium- to longer-term solutions like in-housing of certain pieces. So really don't know where it's going to go because it's very much an exploratory. And as I noted earlier, he just turned over the reins to Alan in the last day or 2. So I haven't really had a chance. He hasn't really had a chance to dig in there yet. But I do expect there's a lot of opportunity there.\n And just to clarify one thing, you mentioned in order to reach our long-term levels. Right now, we are tracking to where we have set expectations long term as far as payment costs go. I think this is really looking for opportunities for upside above and beyond that. We feel like already we're based on the trajectory of our current business, and this isn't just for payment processing, it's across all the different metrics of the KPIs that we have, we feel good about that trajectory. So this is really about looking for additional upside above and beyond what we shared at Investor Day last year.\n And then I'm sorry, what was the second question? You did. Yes. So that is baked into our guide. And you're right. I think the last -- it's really been a trend not just with these 2, but with the last year or 2 of states. Last year, we noted Ohio and Massachusetts, both contributed positively by Q4. I think this year, our expectation is that the 2 that we launched, North Carolina and Vermont will actually contribute possibly to the entire back half of the year. So I think it's just another example of how we continue to get better and better at optimizing our state launch playbook, we're able to capture a tremendous amount of value in a much shorter period of time with a much more efficient level of investment than we did, say, 3, 4 years ago. That's exactly right. It's really a function of some of the product enhancements we've made in what we're seeing that due to our parlay mix and average leg count. Progressive parlay as an example, is a much higher average leg count than a typical parlay. So that's been one of the many examples of contributors. We also are right now in the process of rolling out across states cash out for SGP, which is another lever, I think. So it's really a testament to the work the team has done to drive that mix and average leg count. Yes. I think for most markets, the price is the price. So I think when it comes to like being able to have optimal pricing for, say, some of the lesser bet markets, there are some customers that may line shop. I don't think it's the majority of them, but some do. And then there's other bet types that tend to have more line shopping like futures bets. But most of the mainstream bets, the player props, the game lines, the over unders are typically fairly comparable.\n That said, we always make sure that we're competitive. And so we're not trying to win on price, but we're also not trying to have worse pricing than anyone else out there. And I think you noted this, but the real sweet spot is if you have great models and your pricing is tight, you can actually hold better and continue to be super competitive on the pricing side. Those things are not at odds at all.\n And the other thing I would mention is -- and this is also a really important part about having great models and tight pricing, the market uptime can be much higher, which I think particularly for live betting is a significant advantage if customers are trying to live that and can't get through, then they're going to go somewhere else. So that's another real advantage to having tight pricing and strong models. At any point in time, there's definitely something that you're more like, wow, that is just crushing what we expected. But I will say last few years, really, the last 2 years in particular, it's been across the board. I mean this last sort of quarter and particularly in April, it's been customer acquisition, for sure, which I think was true for Q4 and Q1, but I also -- I've seen significant increases to LTVs made over that period of time, too, our player activity and retention levels have been higher than ever. So I think as we improve the product and also as we just get more data and continue to do the analysis, continue to optimize, continue to build better tools that allow the teams to trade and also tools on the marketing side that allow the teams to get data to optimize the marketing better. Same thing with promos.\n We're just -- again, we're at that stage, I think, the industry or the company where there's just so much that's obvious that we can do, and it's just cranking through all of it, and it's really moving metrics across the entire value chain. So I can't point to any one thing overall, but you are correct that at any point in time, you might be like, wow, we had a great quarter from  a customer acquisition standpoint. But often that comes with a great quarter from a retention standpoint, too, because a lot of times the same things that you're doing to drive acquisition also drive great activation and retention. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. As you can see, DraftKing is off to a fantastic start for 2024, and we're really excited about the rest of this year and beyond. I look forward to speaking with you over the coming weeks and hope you all stay safe and well. Thank you."

            "name": "Alan Ellingson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. I'll hit the highlights including our first quarter 2024 performance and our updated guidance for the year. Please note that all income statement measures discussed except for revenue, are on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA basis. As Jason mentioned, we are off to an outstanding start to the year. \n In the first quarter, we generated $1.175 billion of revenue, representing 53% year-over-year growth and $22 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing adjusted EBITDA flow through percentage of 60%. We achieved strong results across our core value drivers, customer acquisition, retention and engagement were excellent and resulted in higher-than-expected handle in the first quarter. \n Our structural Sportsbook hold percentage was slightly ahead of expectations at 9.8% and increased approximately 150 basis points year-over-year. Promotional reinvestment for OSB and iGaming continue to become more efficient year-over-year and improved by more than 700 basis points as a percentage of GGR. Adjusted gross margin increased more than 550 basis points year-over-year to 44% in the first quarter as a result of higher structural Sportsbook hold and improved promotional efficiency. \n Sales and marketing declined 11% on a year-over-year basis and was consistent with our expectations, both products and technology as well as general and administrative expenses were consistent with our expectations. As you are all aware, we are continuing to exert cost discipline across the organization while simultaneously increasing revenue on a year-over-year basis. \n Moving to our full year 2024 guidance, we are poised for a rapid increase in adjusted EBITDA due to continued strong revenue growth, coupled with our efficient fixed cost structure. On February 15, 2024, we guided fiscal year 2024 revenue of $4.65 billion to $4.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $410 million to $510 million. Today, we are improving our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $4.8 billion to $5 billion and our fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $460 million to $540 million. \n Importantly, the midpoints of our updated 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges implies a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA flow-through percentage of 53%. This attractive flow-through percentage is based on continued excellent performance across our core value drivers as we rapidly expand our gross margin and exert discipline on our cost structure, while simultaneously investing in promotion and marketing in accordance with our LTV to CAC targets. \n We will continue to focus on our dual goals of improving our financial expectations while also investing in customer acquisition and our product and technology capabilities. The $125 million improvement in our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance midpoint and $40 million improvement in our adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint breakdown as follows: customer acquisition, retention and engagement continue to exceed expectations due to marketing optimization initiatives and product advancements. These trends account for $165 million of the revenue improvement and $68 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. Structural Sportsbook hold percentage is increasing primarily as a result of momentum into our same game parlay offering. We now expect our structural Sportsbook hold percentage to approach 10.5% in fiscal year 2024, which accounts for $20 million of the revenue improvement and $14 million of the adjusted EBITDA improvement. \n Customer-friendly outcomes in late March and April were a headwind of $60 million and $42 million to our fiscal year 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, respectively. We continue to expect our adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 45% to 47% for the year, an improvement of 350 basis points at the midpoint compared to fiscal year 2023. We also continue to expect adjusted sales and marketing expense to decline modestly in fiscal year 2024. We.\n Finally, we expect to generate approximately $400 million in free cash flow in fiscal year 2024 based on approximately $120 million of annual capitalized expenditures and capitalized software development costs, as well as a modest source of cash from changes in net working capital combined with interest income. As a result, we expect our year-end 2024 cash and cash equivalents will be approximately $1.6 billion before our expected use of approximately $413 million in cash to fund our proposed acquisition of Jackpocket upon closing. \n That concludes our remarks. We will now open the line for questions. Yes, Robin, I'll speak to that. I think in the last few months, we've developed a lot more confidence than ever in our free cash flow trajectory for 2024 and beyond. To add some color, we recently kicked off our multiyear planning process. This is an exercise that touches all the functions verticals of the organization. And as part of this, we do evaluate potential uses of cash within our core business. We reevaluated the growth trends of the business and we look to maximize shareholder value. That does include potentially returning capital to our shareholders. So we anticipate we'll be able to share more specific details with you in the next quarter. But we're very comfortable with where we're at right now."
