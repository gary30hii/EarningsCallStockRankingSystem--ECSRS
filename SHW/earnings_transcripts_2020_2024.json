A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the Company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, and good morning everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered outstanding results in the fourth quarter. The momentum with which we exited the third quarter continued in the fourth quarter, with the pace of growth accelerating across our Pro Architectural and Industrial Customer segments. We saw continued unprecedented growth in our DIY business during the quarter, a double-digit increase in residential repaint solid expansion in new residential, modest improvements in commercial and property management, and high single-digit growth in our industrial segment. Fourth quarter 2020 consolidated sales increased 9.1% to $4.49 billion dollars. Consolidated gross margin increased 140 basis points to 47.4%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $206.5 million to $503.9 million. The fourth quarter of 2020 included $77.4 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense. The fourth quarter of 2019 included $119.3 million of acquisition-related amortization expense and other acquisition costs, and $71.3 million of other adjustments, which included non-cash impairment charges related to indefinite lived trademarks partially offset by a Brazil indirect tax credit. Excluding these items, consolidated profit before tax increased 19.1% to $581.3 million, with flow-through of 25%. Diluted net income per share in the quarter increased to $4.46 per share, from $2.66 per share a year ago. The fourth quarter of 2020 included acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.63 per share. The fourth quarter of 2019 included acquisition-related amortization expense and other adjustments of $1.61 per share as described in our press release. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 19.2% to $5.09 per share, from $4.27 per share. EBITDA grew to $733.9 million in the quarter or 16.3% of sales. Net operating cash grew to $844.8 million in the quarter or 18.8% of sales. All three of our operating segments delivered excellent top-line growth, margin expansion and strong flow through in the quarter. Segment margin in the Americas Group improved 270 basis points to 21.7% of sales, resulting primarily from operating leverage on the top-line growth and favorable mix. Flow-through was 51.3%. Adjusted segment margin in Consumer Brands Group improved 280 basis points to 13.6% of sales, resulting primarily from operating leverage on the double-digit top line growth. Flow-through was 34.6%. Adjusted segment margin in Performance Coatings Group improved 100 basis points to 14.4% of sales, driven by operating leverage on the high-single digit sales growth and lower input costs. Flow-through was 28.1%. Let me now turn the call over to John Morikis for additional commentary on 2020 along with our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2021. John?\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. The strong results in our fourth quarter led to another record year for Sherwin-Williams. My deepest appreciation and respect go out to all 61,000 members of our incredible global family and to our leadership team for everything they've done. While none of us anticipated the severity of this year's challenges, our people responded as they always do when facing adversity, with extraordinary effort, with determination and with resiliency. When it mattered most, this team delivered, and I'm incredibly grateful for all they do. To that end, our full-year 2020 results demonstrate the strength of our people, our business model and our solutions-based approach to meeting customer needs. We generated record sales despite the impacts of COVID-19. Cash from operations, net income and net income per diluted share also were in records and increased by double-digit percentages over 2019. I'd like to call out just a few full-year highlights in more detail. Sales increased 2.6%, including a negative impact of 1.1% related to currency translation, to a record $18.4 billion. Gross margin improved 240 basis points to 47.3%. EBITDA grew to a record $3.4 billion or 18.7% of sales. Segment margin expanded in all three business groups. Adjusted diluted net income per share, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and other items called out in our press release, increased 16.4% to $24.58 per share. Net operating cash for the year increased to a record $3.41 billion or 18.6% of sales. We returned approximately $2.93 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, an increase of 145% over the prior year. We invested $303.8 million in our business through capital expenditures. And we retired $400 million in debt, ending the year with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times. As Jim described, we achieved these record full-year results with a strong close to the year. Let me provide some more detail about our segment performance in the fourth quarter. In the Americas Group, fourth quarter sales increased by 9% over the same period a year ago, including just under 2 percentage points of price and a headwind of 1.2 percentage points related to unfavorable currency translation. Same-store sales in the US and Canada were up 9.3%. We saw consistent trends across the business in the quarter, and we significantly outpaced the rate of growth we delivered in our third quarter. In Residential Repaint, our largest segment, we delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Interior and exterior work were both strong. Existing home sales are robust, and contractors are reporting solid backlogs. I'm also pleased to report that once again we grew this segment by double-digits on a full-year basis. We continue to see great opportunities here for share gains going forward. Demand remained unprecedented in our DIY business where sales were up by a double-digit percentage for the fourth consecutive quarter. New residential also remained an area of strength for us with the rate of growth accelerating from mid-single digits in the third quarter-to-high single digits in the fourth quarter. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since summer, and customers are reporting solid order rates. We've not yet seen meaningful recovery in our commercial business, which was up slightly in the fourth quarter. The predominant theme remains that projects are being delayed rather than cancelled. Property maintenance was also up slightly in the quarter, though turnover in multifamily properties remains low. Protective and Marine was down by double-digit percentage where growth in our smaller customer segments such as Flooring, Bridge and Highway and Water and Wastewater treatment, was more than offset by softness in the Oil and Gas segment. We continue to aggressively pursue opportunities in all of these end markets. From a product perspective, sales in both Interior and Exterior paint were up by double-digit percentages, with Interior becoming a larger part of the mix than it was in the third quarter, as is normal for our fourth quarter. Heavy equipment sales also were up double digits in the quarter. Contractors typically invest in this type of equipment in anticipation of solid demand. In December we announced a 3% to 4% price increase to our US and Canada customers effective February 1. We would expect to realize approximately 1.5% from price in the first quarter and just under 2% in the following quarter. We opened 54 new stores for the full year in the US and Canada, partially offset by consolidation of underperforming stores, the majority of which were in Latin America. Along with these stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new product and productivity-enhancing services to drive additional growth. We're also pleased by a continuing uptick in the use of our e-commerce platform. Moving onto our Consumer Brands Group, we delivered sales growth of 13.6% in the quarter, including 1.4 percentage points of positive impact related to currency translation as DIY demand remained robust. Sales in North America increased in line with our mid-teens segment growth guidance. International demand was variable with Australia up low-double digits, Europe up low-single digits and Asia down mid-single digits, respectively. Our global supply chain organization continued to perform at a high level in the quarter, working collaboratively with our customers and businesses to help meet the strong demand. The strong sales growth, along with prior portfolio improvements and international cost reductions, drove this significant improvement in our margin performance. Last, let me comment on our fourth quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. Following an encouraging third quarter, we continued to build momentum across the business in the fourth quarter. Group sales increased by high single-digit percentage. The impact of currency translation was not material in the quarter. Price was positive in all regions, and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in Asia grew the fastest in the quarter, up by a strong double-digit percentage. Europe and Latin America also grew by double-digit percentages. North America sales were just slightly positive. From a divisional perspective, I'll start with our Coil Coatings business, where growth was up double digits in the quarter and positive in every region. This team continues to do a remarkable job at winning new accounts in all regions. We're also seeing the gradual resumption of selected commercial construction projects. Our Packaging Team also continues to deliver great results. Sales were up double digits in the quarter and positive in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. Our non-BPA coating continued to gain traction, and both we and our customers are investing in capacity expansion. Sales in the Industrial Wood division were up by a double-digit percentage in the quarter. Positive trends in new residential construction are driving increased demand for kitchen cabinetry, flooring, and furniture. We're especially encouraged by the return to growth in our General Industrial division, where sales were up by a high-single digit percentage in the quarter. We saw a meaningful improvement in portions of our Heavy Equipment, Building Products and Container segments as well as more General Finishing. We believe the strong performance was a mix of inventory restocking by some of our customers and growing in demand. Sales were up in all regions except North America, which was down about 1% but improved significantly from the third quarter. Sales were also slightly positive in the Automotive Refinish division in the quarter. Heightened social restrictions and lower than normal holiday travel due to a resurgence in COVID pressured miles driven and collision shop volume. Turning to our 2021 outlook, we see an operating environment with very solid North American new residential and residential repaint demand. The trajectory of recovery in Commercial and Property Maintenance is likely to be choppy and comparisons in DIY will be challenging. We anticipate Industrial demand will continue to improve as the year progresses. The impact of variables such as the timing of the COVID vaccine, the incoming US administration and proposed stimulus and infrastructure spending are hard to gauge at this point. That said, our team is skilled at adapting to any number of conditions. And we have many opportunities to grow share in all of our businesses. We'll continue to target growing at a rate that outpaces the market through customer-driven solutions based on innovation, value-added service and differentiated distribution. For the first quarter of 2021, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a high-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2020. We expect the Americas Group to be up high-single digits. We expect Consumer Brands to be up by a mid-teens percentage, and we expect Performance Coatings Group be up by mid-to-high-single digits. For the full year 2021, we expect net sales to increase by a mid-to-high single digit percentage. First half growth is expected to be stronger than second half given the negative impact COVID had on our first half a year ago. We expect the Americas Group to be up a mid-to-high-single-digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up or down by low-single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a mid-single-digit percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $23.87 to $24.67 per share compared to $22.08 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $2.53 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full-year 2021 earnings per share of $26.40 to $27.20, an increase of 9% at the midpoint over the $24.58 we delivered in 2020. One key assumption embedded in our outlook is that the market rate of inflation for our raw material basket will be up by a low-to-mid-single-digit percentage in 2021 compared to 2020, assuming no further escalation above our current outlook and no supply disruption. We expect to see year-over-year inflation in all four quarters, with the largest impact likely occurring in the middle two quarters. We expect the rate of inflation to be most significant on the petrochemical side of the basket. As we've demonstrated in the past, we will seek to offset these increased costs with pricing actions as appropriate. Let me close with some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Given volume growth, pricing actions and our ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, we expect full-year gross margin expansion. We expect to get SG&A leverage in 2021 by controlling costs tightly in non-customer facing functions. We'll continue to make investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to return to our normal cadence with around 80 new stores opening in the US and Canada in 2021. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, as well as systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform in the Home Center channel. These investments are embedded in our full-year guidance. We expect currency exchange will not have a material impact on sales for the full year. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. Our core CapEx guidance for the year is approximately $370 million. In addition to this core CapEx, we expect to make investments of approximately $100 million in 2021 related to our new headquarters and our new R&D facility project. Depreciation should be about $300 million, and amortization will be about $310 million. Interest expense should be about $340 million. We have $25 million of long-term debt due in 2021. Historically, we've targeted dividends at about 30% of our prior-year GAAP earnings. Next month, at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 23.5% to $6.62 per share, up from $5.36 last year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. 2020 was a very challenging year, and I'm incredibly proud of the way our team responded to deliver record sales and earnings. As 2021 begins, we're energized and more determined than ever to capitalize on the many opportunities we see in each one of our businesses. We believe the long-term fundamental strengths of our end markets remain intact. We're poised to thrive in 2021, and as I mentioned last quarter, we feel like we're just getting started in many ways. Our team is experienced, our goals are clear. Our solutions are many, and our confidence is high. We remain focused on delivering value for all of our stakeholders over the long term. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess, first off, on your fiscal year 2021 guidance, TAG up mid-to-high-single digits. Can you sort of walk us through your current view on the various subsegments in there? There has been some divergence thus far in Residential versus Commercial Construction in the US, how do you sort of expect that to evolve as the year unfolds?\nJohn Morikis: Ghansham, I'd say, first, we have great confidence in the market here. We've been working very hard as you know to position the company to strategically thrive whichever way the table tilts. So while there may be some shifts in the market, we believe we'll be able to capitalize on the opportunities regardless of which way the market may move. So let me just run through quickly to answer your question. I think from a New Residential standpoint, we think coming off a high-single digits in the fourth quarter, we believe that permits are strong, and our position in New Residential is very strong. As you know, we've got a terrific position with 18 of the top 20 homebuilders. And we expect that that momentum that they are experiencing will result in some nice gains for us. We're also very pleased with the gains that we've been making with the regional builders. So from a New Residential position, we're feeling really, really good. From a Residential Repaint position, I'd say that the strength that we mentioned earlier, double digits now for six consecutive years, give us a lot of confidence in the way that this business is moving. This is driven by both Interior/Exterior work as we talked about, and homeowners now beginning to let these painters back into their homes has us feeling really good, not only about the market itself but our growing position there. The backlog in this Residential Repaint business gives us additional confidence. There has been some question about any shift between do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me. And we believe that the do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me are both terrific opportunities. The do-it-yourself remains strong. Consumers are nesting and while there, they are choosing to jump on the opportunity to make an impactful difference in their home in a very reasonable project from an investment standpoint and time, so we're excited about the momentum that we have there as well. We're working hard. It's a relatively small percentage of our business overall, DIY, but our net promoter score even in these challenging times, both on the professional side and a DIY side are improving. So we're going to work hard to continue to retain those customers that have entered into our stores. Commercial improved significantly over the third quarter, down from double-digits to slightly positive. Still a recovery has been more muted here than the Residential Repaint and New Residential. Projects here are beginning to open back up, but with restrictions for distancing and number of people on the projects requiring PPE. So we're working closely with our contractors there. We navigate through these challenges, and we think it's a terrific opportunity for us to support our customers as they grow it in the new world here. And then finally in Property Maintenance, recovery in Property Maintenance as I mentioned earlier, remains slow but positive. Demographics here for apartments are favorable, it's just under pressure with turns. So maintenance in Property Management, in the area of apartments has been slow, but also in areas like hotels, restaurants, etc. We are seeing in the multifamily area investments - CapEx investments to upgrade properties. This has gained traction in areas somewhat influenced by the deurbanization. And this would be where you might have C-level properties going to B and B to A. Again we've got a terrific position here with relationships with 18 of the top 20 property management companies. So I'd say whichever - I walked through those kind of quickly, but whichever way these markets tilt we're, as I mentioned, feeling really good about that. So if homeowners, who now have been called back to work, end up back on the production line or traveling for their businesses or back in their offices, wherever those gallons are sold, we like the position that we are in to be able to capitalize on it. So we're really confident about that. And Jim, maybe you can take a moment just to talk about the macro data that supports our confidence.\nJim Jaye: Yes, John, sure. And good morning, Ghansham. If you look at the New Residential piece, obviously John mentioned it, but permits starts have been very strong since the summer. You look at in December they were up mid-single digit. The last three months it's up double digits on starts. Single family has been a bit stronger obviously then multifamily. You look at some of the other indicators. The 30-year fixed mortgage, still very supportive around 2.7 or so in December. US consumer confidence, a little bit shaky at this point, and unemployment still about 6, but we think everything that we're seeing, hearing from our customers on the new res side is very solid. And we've got the long-term view which we've articulated in the past about household formations continuing to be strong. If you look at Resi Repaint, existing home sales increased for the sixth consecutive month in December. They were up 23% year-over-year. Month supply is still pretty low. Median home prices are continuing to rise, so people have equity in their homes and feel good about repainting. You look at LIRA, the leading indicator of remodeling activity, is modestly more positive next year, and The National Association of Homebuilder Remodeling Index is also near record levels. So feel very good on that. Maybe commercial, just to wrap up real quickly, I think commercial as John characterized it, that the recovery is a little bit choppy there. I'd go back to what we said at our Analyst Day in the fall. Strong starts at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before the pandemic hit, many of those starts are now as we get into 2020 going to start, we think and get to the painting phase. So we should see some improvement there. I think what's still less clear is the pace of new starts heading into later this year. I think there'll be a recovery, but we'll have to see how strong that is.\nAl Mistysyn: Hey, Ghansham, this is Al Mistysyn, only one other comment to add, because of the way 2020 unfolded with a weaker first half and a stronger second half, it's important that we get off to a good start. And as we've talked about in the past with our Paint Stores Group North America having a strong second half of 2020, up mid-single digits, and then especially with the fourth quarter being up high-single digits, that typically translates to growth in our first half and gives us confidence about the Paint Store and Architectural volume to start the year into our first half. We saw a similar result with a strong second half of 2019, which was up high-single digit, and leading to a strong first quarter of 2020, which was up high-single digits. So that's what gives us the confidence on Architectural going into the first half of the year.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay, that's very thorough. Thank you so much. And then just real quick for my second question on the inflation side, I mean you're very specific in terms of raw materials, in terms of how that's going to sequence in 2021. You called out pricing in TAG. How should we think about performance pricing, like what have you announced so far? Three years ago we had an inflation cycle. The industry was distracted, including you guys closing up Valspar. How are you going to approach inflation differently in this particular inflation cycle? Thanks so much.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Ghansham. I think we're in a completely different spot than where we were when we closed Valspar in 2017. As you recall, there was not a lot of price out in the market relative to industrial as raw materials were increasing in '17. And then we collectively as an industry chased it for the following two years. I think we are ahead of it in the sense that we are out with price across different of our divisions. We have more price to go as Jim or as, John talked about. It's heavier on the petrochem side. And we are absolutely out in the market with price a little bit higher than what I would say you would see on our TAG Architectural business because of the higher increase we see on petrochem; so I think you're going to see a different environment. Plus, the other thing I would add is with our confidence in the growing volume, we expect volume to be stronger in this year relative to what it was back in 2017. And I think as we've talked about, that really is what the main driver of our margins are, and we'd expect a strong first half with volume in our Performance Coatings Group that will help offset some of the raw material impacts as well.\nGhansham Panjabi: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Ghansham.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Hi, good morning. Your administrative costs in the quarter were up, I don't know $65 million. Maybe they were up $55 million for the year. Did something unusual happen in the fourth quarter? And what's your outlook for administrative costs in 2021?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Jeff, if you look at the year-over-year in the fourth quarter, most of that increase was due to Brazilian tax credits and occurred in the fourth quarter. Aside from that, the remaining increases were due to higher comp and incentives, including stock-based compensation. We had a higher environmental expense in the quarter, and then we took the opportunity in the fourth quarter as we saw a stronger sales than what we had guided to - our guidance as you recalls was to be up three to seven. We ended up above the high end of that range at little bit over 9%. Some of the spending we delayed in IT infrastructure, and some of the digital initiatives across the enterprise we put some money back in there that drove that increase up a little bit. That was partially offset by a decrease in integration costs. If you look at our outlook for 2021, my expectation is interest expense will be pretty flat year-over-year. And then I would expect to be flat to down slightly on admin for the rest of the year.\nJeff Zekauskas: And then - thank you for that. And then from a strategic point of view, I don't think you bid on Tikkurila. Can you talk about why you didn't or why that would have been a good fit or a bad fit? Can you - can you reflect on that asset as relates to Sherwin-Williams?\nJohn Morikis: Jeff, I don't know that I want to talk about any one particular asset. I might give you our thinking overall and let you drive your own thinking to that. Our pipeline as we see it is robust, and we continue to evaluate what we believe are strategic fits for our company. And to us, we look at very unique and differentiated solutions and solutions that allow us to drive our customer success. And I just want to take a moment on this because I think it's important, our view is that when our customers are successful, we're successful. And when we're driving value for them, it allows us to create value for our shareholders. So we're focused on targets that drive those unique solutions. Our strategy is not going to be defined by what comes up for sale. And we're not trying to be everything to everyone nor trying to be everyone - or everywhere for everyone. We look proactively for targets that are kind of fits for our strategy, that fit us in geographic areas that we feel that are a gap, that provide a technology that we can leverage or adds to our distribution that fits our strategy. We believe we're uniquely positioned not to require acquisitions to grow. Our focus is on right now a prioritization of opportunities that we have and turning them into shareholder value. You're likely, Jeff, going to see us more doing bolt-ons more likely in the industrial space with targets to support what we call our right-to-win, not just commodities or not just a book of business. We're really focused in on those high-value areas that allow us to differentiate. So, a great example would be - and there's a lot of talk now about infrastructure, and not to say that we're only focused on Protective and Marine, but I think it gives a good example. If I take Bridge and Highway, as an example, you're likely going to see us on the Bridge side or as we say the HVI, the high value infrastructure, not just chasing commodities. So our view is that those acquisitions that fit our ability to differentiate with unique solutions allow us to create value, not just trying to be everything to everyone everywhere.\nAl Mistysyn: Jeff, the only thing I would add to that is we don't have a gun to our head. We've talked about this in the past, we believe we can grow organically. And if you look at the last two years, '19 and '20, we grew sales a modest 2.3% CAGAR. That's over $800 million incremental dollars. And with that though, we grew adjusted PBT just under $640 million of flow through of 77%. I think that talks to the strength of the model and the strategy that we put in place, and then when you look at our 2021 sales guidance to be up mid-to-high-single digits, we expect to accelerate that growth in 2021.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm just trying to contextualize the performance - the impressive performance in the fourth quarter and TAG north of 9% versus I think a 4.5% comp in the prior period. And I'm assuming, particularly in Residential Repaint, that your customers don't have complete access to their customers for COVID reason. So I'm just wondering if you can help us understand or if you know from your customers sort of what percentage of their book of business or their perspective book of business, they actually have complete access to sort of exiting the fourth quarter versus maybe where they were entering or in the third quarter, just so that we can get a sense of how the opportunities that's going to progress as we move through 2021.\nJohn Morikis: I think you should plan on the opportunities to be very solid. I don't have a number. I think it varies by customer and probably by geography, but as you would expect with over 3,000 sales reps and nearly 5,000 store managers out there every day working this customer, we have a very good feeling about what they're doing and through our CRM, we've got an understanding of the activity there, and I would tell you it's terrific. In a number of ways I would say the confidence that we have presents itself. The drive that we have in new account activity for further growth - there's an interesting fact. In 2020, we actually opened more new accounts, many of them in Residential Repaint in 2020 than we did in 2019. And so the visual I'd like for you to understand is that we've got this terrific customer base that's growing in their loyalty to us through the introduction of new products and innovative solutions, the digital platform. We've got a new living well introduction of products for our customers. I'd be happy to share with you in a moment here. We've got terrific service, the role that our reps play in helping these customers to be successful. So we've got homeowners who've been home that are anxious to have their homes painted after spending maybe a little more time in there than they appreciated earlier, a desire to maintain those, painting contractors whose loyalty to our company is growing, and a strong desire for us to not only take care of those that are doing business with us now, but to grow that. And I think we're hitting on a lot of those cylinders. So as I mentioned, six years of double-digit growth, and we expect that momentum to continue.\nVincent Andrews: If I could just ask on the raws and price, the February one start date versus I think last year was a June one start date, I mean what - what were you waiting for to make the price increase announcement and how - what caused the percentage increase that you chose? There are a lot of folks that are worried about further inflation in the back half and the crude oil chain further into petrochemicals or in TiO2. So are you confident that you took enough or should we think that maybe possibly you'll need to take more during the year if necessary?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Vincent. I would say the timing was really a function of the rapid increase we saw as the fourth quarter - in raw materials as the fourth quarter progressed. So we hadn't planned on going even that early because of where we thought the raw material environment was. As you know, we look at this every month, try to project what we think the basket is going to move, both with Architectural and Industrial, and when we saw the rapid increase with propylene, we adjusted the schedule and went out with a price that we think was right on Architectural. On industrial, because we had some businesses that we're still working through that process, I think it allows us to adjust what the price increases is going to be versus what we thought it was going to be. So we'll probably have to --- we're going to go out with a higher increase than what we had in Architectural. And here's the - as you know, as the year goes on, if we see raw material costs increasing more than what we have planned or what we have in our guidance, you know us, we have discipline. And we'll go out with another price increase. You saw that '10, '11 and '12 when we had to go out with five price increases in the 18-month period. That discipline is still there, and if we're not covering our costs, we'll have to go out again. But right now we feel comfortable with the price increases that are going into the market.\nVincent Andrews: Thanks for the detail and looking forward to a great 2021.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Vincent.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. I had two questions. One was you mentioned digital investment with the home centers. Could you get a little more specific in terms of what that is and how we should think of that strategically?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, I think there is a digital investment and a home center digital investment. So I want to make sure that you're clear with our comments there, Greg. We are very excited about our relationship. We share our definition of success with our Consumer Brands customers that has us leaning forward and anxious on growing - this growing opportunity. We're interested in retention of the customers that our customers are experiencing. And we're working with them in ways to help them do that. Rather that the specifics of those details come from those customers, and the timing will be explained by those customers. Internally, ours, we're very excited about that as well. I'd splinter that out into both the do-it-yourself, again lesser part of our business. We're spending a little bit of time on to serve those customers, quite a bit of investment and attention going towards our professional digital platform, Greg. In fact, we're going to be introducing in this first quarter a new initiative called Pro's Plus which is one suite of tools that are designed to make our customers more successful. And it's unique, and we think unique in a way that only Sherwin can bring it to the market in that it brings all elements to our customers, the in-store, the online, the rep, all of these in a way that we think will help our customers be more successful in their endeavors. So as I mentioned, we're rolling that out in the first quarter, and we're very excited about the impact that will have as well. But digital across the board, internally and externally, is something that we're focused on.\nGreg Melich: That's great. And the follow-up for Al is on leverage. The 2.4 times now with the amount of cash you generated last year. Where are you comfortable with that? Does that need to get down to two or are we at a point now that free cash flow should really just be generally buying back stock or investment M&A, whatever?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Greg, as I've talked, the target leverage that we are looking at was 2 to 2.5. I'm very comfortable at 2.4, and I think you're absolutely right. We're not going to pay down debt in 2021, and we'll use the free cash flow for M&A. And absent M&A, we're going to buy our stock back.\nGreg Melich: That's great. Good luck, guys.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Sison: Hey guys, nice end of the year there. So sort of taking a look at the sales growth that you guys put up in '19 and 2020, yet the '21 outlook is stronger. Yet the midpoint of your guidance for EPS is a little bit less, so just curious what - given that your sales growth is pretty good, but what's sort of holding back some of the EPS growth leverage relative to the last couple of years?\nAl Mistysyn: Mike, we did have a little bit of a tailwind in 2020 relative to raw materials. As we've talked about with raw materials going up low to mid - mid-to-high-single digits and the pricing that we have to put it to get on top of that, unfortunately that doesn't go to our bottom line as much. But I think we're excited about the 9% on top of a 16.4% increase to your point and expect segment operating margin improvement across all segments. We do expect to see modest gross margin expansion as we have the volume growth. We have the price increases to offset inflation, but then we also have this continuous improvement culture that we've talked about in the past. And I think the teams have done a really good job and have done a lot of hard work on different levers to keep driving our operating margin in particular, not just our gross margin. And you see that, I would say in our international businesses, even flat sales in our consumer businesses. And you see significant growth in our operating profit. You see that in our Performance Coatings Group with a 4% increase in our second half, and you see nice 40%-plus flow through on that. So I think depending on how the volumes flow through our second half, depending on how raw materials are in the high end and low end of that range will tell you if we in the midpoint, high end of our guidance. So, I think we're feeling really good about a 9% increase and including with a mid-to-high-single digit growth.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, with some very good investments for our future as well.\nAl Mistysyn: That's right.\nJohn Morikis: We're feeling good about it.\nMike Sison: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on TAG, and I apologize if I missed this. Are you planning any new stores this year, and are there any particular areas in the country that you're going to focus on? And then just sort of a comment, I hope you have a lot of orange and brown paint readily available given the Browns are finally on its way.\nJohn Morikis: Well, we love that you just made that comment, well most of us. Our Pittsburgh fan here, Al Mistysyn, is a Steeler fan, but the rest of us are right there with you. Yes, we do plan on continuing to invest in our stores. We just mentioned investments, and stores and reps are an important part of that. And we're going to be back into that range likely in the 80 to 100 as we go into 2021. And a lot of that I'll have to do with how this pandemic flows, but it's an important investment that we continue to expect to put fuel in that tank for sure.\nMike Sison: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess two things, one on the - if we assume that the DIY markets really didn't eat much into the do-it-for-me side, I guess, how much - is there a way to think about how much pent-up demand there is just given the COVID situation in 2020? And is this, in your opinion, do we have a multi-year catch-up or is this - can a lot of it be really made up in 2021?\nJohn Morikis: I think it's likely a longer build up than most would realize. I mean when you think, to your point, the do-it-for-me I think is a growing population. There was a DIY surge, about 60% of the people saying that they undertook some home improvement projects. We believe that the fact that there's such a backlog right now given the surge that we've already seen in DIY. When you talk to our painting contractors, we believe that there is still quite a bit of pent-up demand, and there is underlying long-term demand drivers we think that support that, the aging population, the home price appreciation, aging housing stock, the stock market appreciation, dual-income families. All of those we think continue to feed the do-it-for-me. And we're working really hard to be the one that those contractors turn to.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. That's - that's helpful. And then maybe just kind of tied to that, you indicated equipment sales were up double digits. Is there - do you have line of sight as to who the buyers are? Is it tied more to the do-it-for-me side of the market? Is it tied more to the new residential kind of market? I guess is there a way to think about that in terms of who the buyers are and maybe where that kind of accelerated growth may be coming from?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, I'd say that it seems to be strong across most segments, and the technology there is moving and our relationship with those customers. We want to be that go-to-shop for the residential repaint contractor that may be looking at the fact that they are a little shorter on labor than they would appreciate, and they see the opportunity to go faster and pick-up projects. So we want to be the go-to-supplier that can help educate them on how spray equipment could help their productivity and quality, so that along with - and we are seeing this as well a positive mix shift in quality. So we see a movement up in our quality for the same reasons. These painting contractors in many cases are finding labor painters that might be less experienced, and so spray equipment opportunities are one area to help their productivity as is the increase in quality to help minimize any call-backs or disruptions to the employer - to the homeowner while improving their productivity.\nAl Mistysyn: And John, as you know, I mean strong spray equipment sales is a leading indicator, and we've talked about this in the past particularly on the contractor base. That is a positive sign as we go into the first half of 2021.\nJohn McNulty: For sure. Thanks very much for the color.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nArun Viswanathan: Great, thanks. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the great performance in 2020. I guess maybe I'll ask the question on Consumer and Performance. Could you just walk us through how you see both of those segments kind of evolving through '21? Obviously, you got the tough comps in Consumer in '21. I think on your last call you may have indicated that maybe in those periods you showed negative growth in Consumer. Are you still thinking that way? And then similarly in performance, just given the weak Q2, do you think that the year would actually result in that segment being above your overall sales guidance? Thanks.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Arun, let me start with the consumer. And we've guided for the full year to be up or down low-single digits, and our expectation with DIY is that we'll see that strength certainly through the first quarter and most likely into the second quarter. And it just depends on whether that continues into our third quarter or not. And so, yes, we do have two - the middle quarters up over 20% in Consumer. But I think the team has done a lot of good work on helping our customers retain and/or gain a bigger share of the DIY sales. I think we'll see how results and the market share comes out, but we believe our customers are gaining share relative to their peers, in particular our largest customer in the home center channel. I think you're going to see the investments we made through the second half of 2020 across different programs, including the Pro, start paying dividends into 2021. Granted, it's a small base, but our expectations are high in that segment, the Pro segment, and I think we're doing a lot of the right things with driving that, and we'll see how that plays out as the year unfolds. When you look at Performance Coatings Group, a strong second half similar to what I talked about with our paints - North America Paint Stores, a strong - stronger second half, in particular a strong fourth quarter translates into strong performance in our first quarter. And as you mentioned going up against a soft second quarter, we're expecting that team to grow for the year mid-single digits. Could it be above our overall growth? Sure. It depends on what happens with infrastructure, what happens with the continued momentum we're seeing outside the US. And then really, we have a great opportunity and confidence in North America coming back. John talked about basically up low-single digits. That's about 50% of our Performance Coatings sales, and it's really encouraging to see General Industrial start picking up, which is our largest segment. Industrial Wood was up double digits, which is our second largest segment. So we feel like a lot of momentum and could it be higher than the overall company? Sure. But certainly strong first half.\nJohn Morikis: You know, Arun, I'd just add this result in the PCG business, Performance Coatings business, you got to give great credit to our team, our leadership there. When things were pretty dismal and things were looking pretty challenging, this team kept their chin up and leaning forward. I'm really proud of what they accomplished. I think everything - I agree with everything Al said. I'd also add that we're leaning forward with market share gains here as well, so we're not just simply we're not relying on the market to get better. There's been a lot of terrific work that's taken - been taken place in some of the most challenging times that many of us have been through. And they really positioned our Company well. I want to thank our leadership throughout PCG here. They've done a wonderful job, and we have high expectations of them going forward as a result of the great work they're doing.\nArun Viswanathan: Great, thanks. And I guess just as a quick follow-up on the capital allocation side, the M&A activity in this sector seems to have picked up quite appreciably. Are you seeing interesting opportunities out there or devaluations look a little too stretched for you? And if you are seeing opportunities, are they in anything in the digital or EV space or electrification space that you'd want to pursue? Maybe you can just comment on the M&A environment.\nJohn Morikis: I'd say our - I mentioned earlier, I think our pipeline is very robust. We have a number of projects that we're working on, some of which we expect to complete this year. I want to reiterate and reemphasize on both sides here, one that we don't feel as though we have a gun on our head with an absolute need for acquisitions in order to grow. I think we've proven that, and we're excited about what we see in front of us in the windshield that gives us great confidence with or without them. Now that said, on the other side, I want to be very clear, we are excited about some of these projects. We are very deliberate in what it is that we're doing. We're confident that that many of these would be a terrific fit, and we're working towards them. So we feel really good about what we have and what's out there.\nAl Mistysyn: And Arun, as we just talked about, our leverage ratio is within the target we want it. We have a strong balance sheet, we generate a ton of cash. And we're not worried about valuations. The valuations, as John talked about, we'll take a disciplined approach to it where we can get a return for our shareholders. And I think that's key, and I think we can get to the valuation that makes that happen.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Arun.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: Yes, thank you. Just thinking about the various end markets you have in TAG. Is it reasonable to assume that the paint you sell for new - for commercial projects versus what goes into a contractors resi repaint, is a shift towards a much higher-quality paint potentially with a higher-unit price and higher margin, is that - is that mix shift towards the resi repaint, has that been a meaningful benefit to you and do you record that in the 2% price comment that you made, John, out of the 9% same-store sales or is that mix shift benefit in price not included in that 2%?\nJohn Morikis: So Steve, I might suggest that you look at it in a slightly different way. Let me - let me introduce this thinking, that the positive mix shift that we're experiencing is actually in nearly every segment in TAG. So within commercial, if I could just isolate on commercial for one second, if you could imagine a project that was bid where COVID wasn't in the mind of the project estimator and they put this together, and all of a sudden now there is starts and stops and restrictions on how many people can be on a project and all the challenges that we all know. Now, you start to realize when the cost of labor is only 80% to 90% of the project, that incremental investment in a higher-quality product will actually increase their cost of goods from a paint perspective. But overall when you think about labor and the choppiness they're experiencing, it will actually make them more efficient, more profitable on that project. And so across all segments now, going beyond just the Commercial, what we are experiencing is exactly what you said, a positive mix shift in Residential Repaint. We might have painters with a little less experience, and so they don't want to be disruptive to the homeowner and have touch-up issues. They want to maybe get away with one less coat so they can get out of the home quicker, all these - durability. All of these different areas are important aspects of product mix shift in a positive direction, same with Commercial. New Residential, you look at the number of painters on a new home and the delay getting pushed out. So they want people to be able to come in, paint the home, get off with little call back or touch up. So we are experiencing this positive shift throughout our architectural business.\nSteve Byrne: That's helpful. Thank you. And just wanted to ask you about that Huawei brand that you acquired with Valspar. I recall in years past there was this thinking that you can reinvigorate that paint in China, whether it's to modify that store model or change the way it's promoted or the outreach to contractors, whatever. What's your view and outlook on that brand in China? Is that still best owner for you guys or where do you think the outlook is for that brand?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Steve, I think you have to look at it in maybe two different ways, one on the Performance Coatings side and then one on the Architectural side. And I'll just comment, the small impairment we took was more on the Performance Coatings side as we continue to drive our customers and our products to Sherwin-Williams brand and Valspar. On the architectural side, I think it's part of our strategy, and I'll let John tell you about it.\nJohn Morikis: Steve, one thing I think we've proved in a year with the pandemic is not a year you should try to reposition our Architectural brand in China. So I think as we move forward, there's a lot of work that we're working on. I do think there are a number of opportunities there. It is a relatively fragmented market. And there are terrific opportunities, and you should expect that we're continuing our work in establishing the most solid brand strategy moving forward - in 2020. We have high expectations for the team, but I would tell you that in 2020, we had to be somewhat understanding in that the consumer marketplace in China, with everything going on with the pandemic, was not a year we were going to gain a lot of ground in this area; so we're ramping that back up. We'll be doing a lot of testing. I wouldn't think that in 2021 we're going to move the needle by our Architectural sales in China, but we certainly believe it's a seed that needs to be planted for our future.\nSteve Byrne: Very good. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you, John. On the large dividend increase, are you trying to target a certain yield, and if so, what is that yield?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, David, you know, the 23.5% increase in the dividend to $6.62 represents 30% of our prior year EPS as reported. This has been a consistent policy of ours, and we've historically targeted that. I know you know we've gotten away from that briefly when we conserved cash through the integration of Valspar. But over the last couple of years last - this 2020, up 18.6, 2019 we're up over 31%, so we're back on that 30% of prior year EPS.\nDavid Begleiter: Got it. And, Al, just on the quarterly earnings progression, should it be typical this year in terms of percent of earnings in Q1 and Q2, etc., or should it be maybe a little bit different given the dynamics of the marketplace?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, David, as I talked about with the stronger sales in the first half that I'd expect to see with our Performance Coatings Group and our TAG, in particular in North American Architectural, because of the somewhat easier comps that we have in the second quarter, you would expect to see a stronger first half on sales and EPS growth than you would see in our second half. But in the second half, we still expect positive sales and EPS, it's just not going to be a strong as our first half.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, David.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nPJ Juvekar: Yes, hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Hey, John, you mentioned that you've been growing double-digit for last six years, clearly you gained share either in Residential Repaint or New Housing Construction or both. Who do you think is losing share? Is it independent dealer channel that has lost share or could it be some of your larger competitors? Can you just talk about where you - who you were taking the share from?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, PJ, we don't discriminate when it comes to share gains. So we're working every market. That's what beautiful about our industry. Every market is its own independent market, and you have to win. And I would say this, that with our view, many people look at our stores because of the storefront and think we're mainly a retail store. That's not the case. We are not the company that unlocks our door and hopes that things - good things happen. Give the TAG leadership, Pete Ippolito and his entire leadership team great credit for the aggressive view that they take. We're not waiting for things to happen. And so in each market, to answer your question, there is a - there is a plan. The plan includes who are those customers that we might know and we might be doing business with that we could expand our share of wallet with. And there are some that, for whatever reason, we've not earned their trust or their business, and it's up to that local team to get to know those customers and build that relationship. So it's not one contributor. It's - I wish it were that easy. It's challenging, but we get out there every day, and this team has a wonderful mentality. This team thinks about you eat what you kill. So you need to get out there every day and hunt and provide for your family. I love the mentality they have.\nPJ Juvekar: Great. And quickly, I'll be brief here, but good to see industrial economy broadening out or Industrial Coatings, were you surprised to see Heavy Duty Equipment come back so quickly in the recovery? Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: I was pleased to see it come back. I don't know that I would say surprised. We have a terrific leadership team in this business that is doing a wonderful job. To your point, there's been seven quarters of tough sledding, but we have really good momentum right now in three of the four regions posting double-digit gains. North America, while just slightly lagging, is trending very well. The back half of the quarter here in North America was strong, and we believe that Heavy Equipment, as well as many of these other segments that we're focused on, are really somewhat - some of them are recovering. Some of them as they recover might be rebuilding inventory. So, we're taking that into account as well. But this is a team that's aggressively out there. As I mentioned just now with TAG as far as market share gains, this team Karl Jorgenrud and his team are really working hard to gain ground, and we've got a lot of respect for them and the job they're doing.\nPJ Juvekar: Great. Well, your aggressiveness is showing in the results. So, thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Wonderful team we have here. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Morikis: Might be on mute, Chris. We're not hearing you.\nOperator: Yes. He may be on mute at the moment. Let me check that out, gentlemen. Actually looks like we'll move on to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Glinski: This is Tom Glinski on for Bob. So I was just wondering if you could give some color on the divergent trends between Australia and China in the Architectural markets.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, I'd say for us both are relatively small in what's happening for our business. Australia for us delivered flat growth for the year, significantly improved our profitability there. We've increased our efforts to develop the right platform for distribution there. And we're optimizing that platform; we've taken - I think, some really good steps in cost reduction and actions to improve the margins in Australia. And from a market standpoint, I think we're holding our own in China. As I just mentioned, I think there is the region for us in Architectural had a decline, but we believe going forward here, we have a lot of ground to be gained and a relatively small position to build on.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Tom, I would say it was a tale of two halves as well. As you know, the first half really got hit hard with COVID in China or in Asia in particular. So on a flat full year for Australia - Australia and Asia, you look at our second half both up double digits. So I think the focus of the teams and the opportunities that we have really showed in the second half, and we expect that to continue in the first half of 2021.\nTom Glinski: That's helpful and then just on the Performance Coatings side, you've discussed in the past potentially getting to operating margins around the 20% level. It sounds like pricing next year is going to be in the 3% range. Could you just talk about the outlook for margins in that business in 2021?\nJohn Morikis: First - I'm going to give it to Al, but I'm going to tell you that the resolve and conviction we have on getting there has never been stronger. We got a lot of confidence in what we're doing and the teams that are delivering it. So we know we're going to get there.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Tom, I think we've made good progress in 2021. If you look at our second half operating margin, it was up 100 basis points to 15.2%. Flow through was strong. And I mentioned this earlier, over 40% on sales that were up 4%. And if you look at the volume strength, we expect in 2021 in that business, we talked about a mid-single-digit growth rate. You have price in there. The rest is going to be volume - as well as all of the hard work the team has done over the past few years right-sizing their footprint outside the US, reducing complexity by driving reduced SKUs, SKU levels, consolidating platforms to try to get scale on certain raw materials, and so a lot of hard work to drive their operating margins. We expect operating margin expansion in 2021 on that mid-single-digit growth rate even with the raw material increases that we're talking about. And on top of that, we haven't talked about it much this year, but we still have facility projects in the pipeline to rationalize in 2021. Unfortunately, or just the reality of it, we pushed those back. And so we're probably about six months delayed on those, but they're still on the table. We're committed to completing those to help continue to drive our cost down, and you'll see us as volume continues to go, and we'll make more progress on that operating margin here in the next couple of years.\nTom Glinski: That's great, thanks guys.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.\nChristopher Parkinson: Great, thank you. I'm in the office, and apparently, I forgot how to use a headset. So just very quickly on the packaging front within PC you're beginning to see some long-term secular tailwinds emerge in beverage in particular, with many of your key customers expanding capacity in various geographies. There is this idea that this growth could accelerate to the mid-single digits in terms of volumes. Do you believe that's realistic, and also just on a global basis, how do you overall characterize your current competitive positioning? Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Chris. And I would say that we enjoy a good position, but we know that there are terrific opportunities out there from a market opportunity perspective. We do feel along with our customers that this is in fact a business that we want to invest in. Both our customers and Sherwin are continuing to invest both in technology and capacity. We are thrilled with this unique technology we have, our V70. It's the only epoxy non-BPA on the market. Others are acrylic or polyester, and this V70 is a game changer. It's more versatile. it doesn't require lines to be shut down for changeovers. The constant consistent mill thickness just gives more productivity to our customers. And so you're right, we're having discussions with them as they're asking us to be in different parts of the world to serve them. It's a unique solution for our customers. And when we talk about our ability to add value to our customers, this is exactly it. We've got 29 patents protecting this technology. It's unique, and it helps our customers in what they're trying to do. It's exactly where we want to be, help them to be successful.\nChristopher Parkinson: That's very helpful. And just returning to a previous question on new store openings, just as we get back into a more normalized environment, you've always been the first to stress that there still opportunities in some of your core markets in the Southeast, Midwest, etc., but just given the projected longevity of the health of US housing, what you're obviously hearing from your customers, is it perhaps still time to really focus in on some of the underpenetrated markets given the long tail? Any color would be appreciated. Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: The answer is yes, Chris. We absolutely - we love those opportunities, and you're exactly right. We're investing in the Southeast and Southwest areas where there is growth, and equally important to us is greater market share penetration in other parts of the country. And so we're not limiting ourselves on where we're going to grow. We are - we're married to success here. And so we're going to look for the right opportunities, and we're going to drill in and find them. And I've got confidence in that in our TAG leadership team to be able to do exactly that.\nChristopher Parkinson: Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes, good afternoon. Just one question with three parts I guess on the subject of share repurchases. As I look at some of the information from your press release, it looks like you repurchased quite a bit in the fourth quarter. And so I was wondering if you could comment on the dollar amount that you bought back in the quarter? Secondly, what the diluted share count would have been exiting the quarter. And then third, John, you talked a little bit about a robust M&A pipeline and desire to make bolt-ons there. I know it's early in the year, but sitting here today, I'd be curious to hear your view on potential balance between repurchases and M&A for 2021 if you have a strong feeling about that. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Kevin. Yes, we purchased 1.6 million shares in the fourth quarter for $1.15 billion, and as I talked about coming out of the third quarter, we had a little over $600 million of cash on our balance sheet. I talked about expecting to have a strong cash generation in our fourth quarter and putting that cash to work in M&A, and absent M&A, buying our stock back. So you can - you can extend that to the full year. We had such a strong cash generation, over $3.4 billion. We returned $2.9 billion to the shareholders as John talked about in his opening comments, a 145% increase. And that just goes to our disciplined approach to our capital allocation policy. We're not going to hold cash. We're going to invest in our business and Capex and our core below 2%, with our building and facility projects, that will be over 2% for a few years here. We're going to keep driving that dividend based on earnings growth and put 30% of prior year EPS. And then absent M&A, we're going to buy our stock back, and you saw that impact in our fourth quarter. That 1.6 million shares, Kevin, really because of the way the calc works, it might have impacted the fourth quarter a few hundred thousand shares for the year. It's probably not - not quite that much, just because of the math. But I'll let John go on the M&A.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, there's not much more to add. I think the point that Al made is an important one. Absent M&A, that we will be back in and buying stock. We don't - we feel we've got plenty of dry powder here, and we're excited about some of the targets that we're working on now, and we're continuing to fill that pipeline. But again, I want to be clear, while we're excited about it, we don't feel as though we have a gun pointed to our head. So we're not going to be out there just going to buy a book of business so that we can say that we're growing sales. There are going to be strategic fits and add value or we're really not interested.\nKevin McCarthy: Perfect. Thank you, both.\nJohn Morikis: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Zener: Good afternoon, John. Al, thanks for your time. Two questions, first the Industrial Wood, that's up nicely. Can you talk to the stability of the Asia business, which I know was affected by cabinet tariffs in the US versus perhaps the US shipments? And then the second question just so you have it. Your consumer margin framework, obviously this year at least you're discounting tough DIY comps, but you're also picking up a lot of volume in TAG, which is helping that business margin - that business's margin. What's your latest thinking on the longer-term margins there? Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Okay. I'll take the Industrial Wood, and I'll have Al jump on the Consumer margin. First, you're right. This has been a terrific rebound by a strong team. Colin Davie and his team in Industrial Wood have really been driving hard. We had growth in all regions, with three of four of our regions in double digits. The strength here that we're seeing is driven mainly in areas of kitchen cabinets, also furniture, and so when you talk about the longevity, I would say that gives us great confidence here. The backlog of orders ahead for furniture is very long. I mean some of these are out six months or more, just because of how strong orders are. So, I think our position is terrific. It's a position of strength driven off of not only just wonderful service and availability, but a growing and unique technology portfolio that helps our customers reach their goals of again terrific leadership team doing a really good job here in the face of adversity. I think they are proving our stripes here.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Ken, on the consumer margin, and you called out TAG as well. So I'm going to talk to a combined kind of architectural margin, if you will in - as the Consumer Group, our expectation even on top of a strong 2020 to have margin expansion not quite near what we saw in 2020, but the continued strong DIY that I talked about expectation to go through the first half. We'll see how that goes as it goes into our third quarter, but really you look at the strength in our TAG. And we talked about full year being up mid-to-high-single digits, and I would say typically as we talked about, our Paint Stores Group North America would be at the higher end of that range. We have a higher ongoing margin, if you will, and that will help drive that combined margin higher. And our expectation is, as you know we, when we set a new high watermark, our expectations are that our teams are going to exceed that high watermark.\nJohn Morikis: I would just add, I think the volume piece is a terrific opportunity as Al mentioned. I think on both sides we're looking for that. And again, I know I'm calling out a few leaders here, but we have opportunities. When we talk about consumer while the DIY side's starting here very strong, and we feel good about it. We still believe that there are terrific opportunities for growth in our Pro side. We've got Brian Padden leading that organization. Heidi Petz was in there before, now over in our stores. These two leaders have done a terrific job positioning us we believe for continued run there. And we can go on and on about TAG. There is a lot of jet fuel in that tank. I really believe - I've said this before, we feel inside this boardroom, we feel like we're just getting started. There's a lot of opportunities, a lot of levers to pull here and we are going to be pulling them hard\nKen Zener: Thank you very much.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nEdlain Rodriguez: Thank you, and good afternoon, guys. Just one quick one, I mean I know it's getting late, on M&A. You've talked about areas where you might want to add in the portfolio, such as Industrial or other value sectors, but are there parts of the current portfolio that are not the best fit for you, like even if you don't have to name them? Just trying to get a sense of how satisfied you are with the current portfolio.\nJohn Morikis: Yes so, just so we make sure I understand, are you suggesting - are you asking what areas are we not interested in?\nEdlain Rodriguez: No, what areas you might want to divest of the divestments.\nJohn Morikis: I'm sorry. You're right, we probably wouldn't talk about any specifics, but I would say that on a regular basis we are constantly evaluating every aspect of our business, everything from program - customer programs to brands to businesses, and we're always looking at how to drive that margin and success forward. And so even down to the stores, if we found stores in some Latin America or some outlying markets. We had some in Canada where we looked at the investments that we had and said, you know what, it's not going to get the return that the hurdle that we have for ourselves. So, I'm not going to call out any specific area, but I will tell you it's a it has to be a constant discussion that we have regularly. I think it's part of the discipline that we have here at Sherwin.\nAl Mistysyn: Edlain, I would tell you by our businesses, by our regions, we look at growth targets, we look at scale. We look at return on sales. We look at RONA, and we look at cash flow, and we set targets in the mid - medium-to-longer term. And if we don't think we are going to be able to achieve those targets, then we look to do something else with that business, and that's what's driving these decisions.\nEdlain Rodriguez: Okay, thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks. Just given the recent surge in orders on the New Resi side and the builders are starting to talk again about labor constraints, just curious if you're starting to see that at all on the contractor side? And are you experiencing any extended lag in starts to when you start to also get payment?\nJohn Morikis: When we get payment did you say?\nGarik Shmois: Yes.\nJohn Morikis: So, no, we've not experienced that. As far as the, the project flow, I don't - I wouldn't say that we're experiencing anything that's unique. I mean there have been challenges with labor. I think it's been somewhat consistent. I think there is more interest, if you will, on the part of builders to find quality products that will help accelerate construction towards close. And so, if - if you take a look at products that hide imperfections and touch up well, those are of greater interest, and so we are seeing some positive mix shift in this area.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. And I guess a follow-up question, just on mix. It doesn't sound like it, but would there be any concern that mix starts to reverse as you start to pursue price increases in TAG to offset inflation?\nJohn Morikis: No, actually it actually supports it more. What does come back to the point that I made earlier when you consider that labor represents about 80% to 90% of the cost of goods for most contractors, a higher quality product actually helps their efficiency, so we continue to see a positive mix shift; and we expect that to continue.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. Thanks, again. Best of luck.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of just Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Speer: Thanks, guys. I wanted to - I don't know if you will, but would it be possible for you to quantify the incremental growth investment in the fourth quarter and in 2020, particularly in Consumer Brands, and perhaps if any of that maybe is going to fall off in 2021?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Justin, I talked about on our third quarter call that you would - that historically, our fourth quarter SG&A tends to be flat with our third quarter, and you delever on a sequential basis. But I did expect to see year-over-year fourth quarter leverage, and we experienced that on a consolidated basis. I also highlighted that the level of investment we would make in the fourth quarter would be dependent on the amount of volume we are experiencing in the quarter. And as I talked about or as you see, our volume was higher in the quarter than our 3% to 7%. So, we took that opportunity to invest in our businesses, driven by Consumer and Performance Coatings, and there are some of those investments that were one-time, others that will be continuing. And the way I'd probably look at it is you're probably going to see - I'd go 50.5 on what may have been one-time versus ongoing. Some are just related quite honestly to the sales increase. But we have added head count in Consumer to go after the Pro and other investments that - in programs that we've made to help continue to retain the DIY sales that we've enjoyed this year. So - and that's - the other part of that is really looking to our first half, and the expectation - with the expectation that we have a strong first half on sales putting those investments in in the fourth quarter and really through the second half of the year are going to pay dividends for us looking out into the second half of 2021.\nJustin Speer: Excellent. And if you could, I just wanted to revisit Ken Zener's question on the Americas Group. Just wanted to better understand if maybe this is a shift in strategy because - or maybe the game has changed a little bit, but you've had a nice tailwind from commodities and maybe some temporal cost savings that - that's certainly helped swing profit higher this year for 2020, about basis points higher in the Americas Group. And now we're - you're telling us that 22% is the new normalized kind of run rate for TAG. I guess should - is that a difference because I know historically you kind of bumped up in that 20% range. And you used to maybe plow in a growth investment. Has the game or the market changed where this 22% is the right number for us to consider as a baseline?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, in TAG I would say we're going to continue to push that operating margin higher regardless of the economic environment. I think the team has done a really good job of pulling the different levers. First, as you know, Justin, is always growth. And when you're looking at TAG for 2021 for the year at mid to high single-digit growth, that allows us even in an inflationary environment to continue to invest back in our business for future growth, as well as growing our operating margin in the current year. So I think you could expect us to continue to drive that operating margin higher.\nJustin Speer: Excellent, thank you guys. I appreciate you squeaking me in.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Justin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Roberts: Yes, thanks. What's allowing you to grow in Auto Refinish? From everything we can see collision activity is down?\nJohn Morikis: Well, I think if you look at Auto, there's been a lot of really good work. And I would say this, that when we're looking at Auto, one of the things to recognize is this is a terrific example I think of the synergies that are out there as it relates to the acquisition. This Ultra 9K that we brought in brings in a terrific opportunity for us to bring solutions to our customers. I think if you look historically, John, I'd say Sherwin has been really well known for their primers and their clear coats. Ultra 9K brings a different application. It's a wet-on-wet application. It helps the technician get greater throughput, increasing productivity, and it actually helps considerably in their color matching capabilities. So I think the overall application, service and ability to help our customers increase their productivity is really what's driving it. And you're right, I mean we think this is a tough and tight market. Miles driven have been down about 75% of pre-COVID miles, and claims are down. This is a team that's not waiting, and they're out there moving aggressively with new technology. And we've been talking about this for a few quarters that we thought that this was a business that was kind of not getting the credit they deserve. A large part of it was the COVID miles and pressure hid some of that. I think you're starting to see what we've been expecting for some time, and we expect that momentum to continue.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the floor back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, Rob. And once again, just to close, a huge thank you to all of our employees around the world for a great 2020 performance. And I hope it came across in our call that we're excited about 2021 and the momentum we have across our business. One quick housekeeping item; we will be holding our Annual Financial Community Presentation on Tuesday, June 8, it will be a virtual event. Again, that date is Tuesday, June 8, and more details will be forthcoming. As always, I'll be available for your follow-up questions, as well my colleague, Eric Swanson. Look forward to speaking with all of you as we go forward in 2021. Thank you, again, for joining our call today. Have a great afternoon. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Al Mistysyn",
            "content": "Hey, Ghansham, this is Al Mistysyn, only one other comment to add, because of the way 2020 unfolded with a weaker first half and a stronger second half, it's important that we get off to a good start. And as we've talked about in the past with our Paint Stores Group North America having a strong second half of 2020, up mid-single digits, and then especially with the fourth quarter being up high-single digits, that typically translates to growth in our first half and gives us confidence about the Paint Store and Architectural volume to start the year into our first half. We saw a similar result with a strong second half of 2019, which was up high-single digit, and leading to a strong first quarter of 2020, which was up high-single digits. So that's what gives us the confidence on Architectural going into the first half of the year. Yes, Ghansham. I think we're in a completely different spot than where we were when we closed Valspar in 2017. As you recall, there was not a lot of price out in the market relative to industrial as raw materials were increasing in '17. And then we collectively as an industry chased it for the following two years. I think we are ahead of it in the sense that we are out with price across different of our divisions. We have more price to go as Jim or as, John talked about. It's heavier on the petrochem side. And we are absolutely out in the market with price a little bit higher than what I would say you would see on our TAG Architectural business because of the higher increase we see on petrochem; so I think you're going to see a different environment. Plus, the other thing I would add is with our confidence in the growing volume, we expect volume to be stronger in this year relative to what it was back in 2017. And I think as we've talked about, that really is what the main driver of our margins are, and we'd expect a strong first half with volume in our Performance Coatings Group that will help offset some of the raw material impacts as well. Jeff, the only thing I would add to that is we don't have a gun to our head. We've talked about this in the past, we believe we can grow organically. And if you look at the last two years, '19 and '20, we grew sales a modest 2.3% CAGAR. That's over $800 million incremental dollars. And with that though, we grew adjusted PBT just under $640 million of flow through of 77%. I think that talks to the strength of the model and the strategy that we put in place, and then when you look at our 2021 sales guidance to be up mid-to-high-single digits, we expect to accelerate that growth in 2021. Yes, Vincent. I would say the timing was really a function of the rapid increase we saw as the fourth quarter - in raw materials as the fourth quarter progressed. So we hadn't planned on going even that early because of where we thought the raw material environment was. As you know, we look at this every month, try to project what we think the basket is going to move, both with Architectural and Industrial, and when we saw the rapid increase with propylene, we adjusted the schedule and went out with a price that we think was right on Architectural. On industrial, because we had some businesses that we're still working through that process, I think it allows us to adjust what the price increases is going to be versus what we thought it was going to be. So we'll probably have to --- we're going to go out with a higher increase than what we had in Architectural. And here's the - as you know, as the year goes on, if we see raw material costs increasing more than what we have planned or what we have in our guidance, you know us, we have discipline. And we'll go out with another price increase. You saw that '10, '11 and '12 when we had to go out with five price increases in the 18-month period. That discipline is still there, and if we're not covering our costs, we'll have to go out again. But right now we feel comfortable with the price increases that are going into the market. Yes, Greg, as I've talked, the target leverage that we are looking at was 2 to 2.5. I'm very comfortable at 2.4, and I think you're absolutely right. We're not going to pay down debt in 2021, and we'll use the free cash flow for M&A. And absent M&A, we're going to buy our stock back. Mike, we did have a little bit of a tailwind in 2020 relative to raw materials. As we've talked about with raw materials going up low to mid - mid-to-high-single digits and the pricing that we have to put it to get on top of that, unfortunately that doesn't go to our bottom line as much. But I think we're excited about the 9% on top of a 16.4% increase to your point and expect segment operating margin improvement across all segments. We do expect to see modest gross margin expansion as we have the volume growth. We have the price increases to offset inflation, but then we also have this continuous improvement culture that we've talked about in the past. And I think the teams have done a really good job and have done a lot of hard work on different levers to keep driving our operating margin in particular, not just our gross margin. And you see that, I would say in our international businesses, even flat sales in our consumer businesses. And you see significant growth in our operating profit. You see that in our Performance Coatings Group with a 4% increase in our second half, and you see nice 40%-plus flow through on that. So I think depending on how the volumes flow through our second half, depending on how raw materials are in the high end and low end of that range will tell you if we in the midpoint, high end of our guidance. So, I think we're feeling really good about a 9% increase and including with a mid-to-high-single digit growth. That's right. Thanks, Mike. And John, as you know, I mean strong spray equipment sales is a leading indicator, and we've talked about this in the past particularly on the contractor base. That is a positive sign as we go into the first half of 2021. Yes, Arun, let me start with the consumer. And we've guided for the full year to be up or down low-single digits, and our expectation with DIY is that we'll see that strength certainly through the first quarter and most likely into the second quarter. And it just depends on whether that continues into our third quarter or not. And so, yes, we do have two - the middle quarters up over 20% in Consumer. But I think the team has done a lot of good work on helping our customers retain and/or gain a bigger share of the DIY sales. I think we'll see how results and the market share comes out, but we believe our customers are gaining share relative to their peers, in particular our largest customer in the home center channel. I think you're going to see the investments we made through the second half of 2020 across different programs, including the Pro, start paying dividends into 2021. Granted, it's a small base, but our expectations are high in that segment, the Pro segment, and I think we're doing a lot of the right things with driving that, and we'll see how that plays out as the year unfolds. When you look at Performance Coatings Group, a strong second half similar to what I talked about with our paints - North America Paint Stores, a strong - stronger second half, in particular a strong fourth quarter translates into strong performance in our first quarter. And as you mentioned going up against a soft second quarter, we're expecting that team to grow for the year mid-single digits. Could it be above our overall growth? Sure. It depends on what happens with infrastructure, what happens with the continued momentum we're seeing outside the US. And then really, we have a great opportunity and confidence in North America coming back. John talked about basically up low-single digits. That's about 50% of our Performance Coatings sales, and it's really encouraging to see General Industrial start picking up, which is our largest segment. Industrial Wood was up double digits, which is our second largest segment. So we feel like a lot of momentum and could it be higher than the overall company? Sure. But certainly strong first half. And Arun, as we just talked about, our leverage ratio is within the target we want it. We have a strong balance sheet, we generate a ton of cash. And we're not worried about valuations. The valuations, as John talked about, we'll take a disciplined approach to it where we can get a return for our shareholders. And I think that's key, and I think we can get to the valuation that makes that happen. Yes, Steve, I think you have to look at it in maybe two different ways, one on the Performance Coatings side and then one on the Architectural side. And I'll just comment, the small impairment we took was more on the Performance Coatings side as we continue to drive our customers and our products to Sherwin-Williams brand and Valspar. On the architectural side, I think it's part of our strategy, and I'll let John tell you about it. Yes, David, you know, the 23.5% increase in the dividend to $6.62 represents 30% of our prior year EPS as reported. This has been a consistent policy of ours, and we've historically targeted that. I know you know we've gotten away from that briefly when we conserved cash through the integration of Valspar. But over the last couple of years last - this 2020, up 18.6, 2019 we're up over 31%, so we're back on that 30% of prior year EPS. Yes, David, as I talked about with the stronger sales in the first half that I'd expect to see with our Performance Coatings Group and our TAG, in particular in North American Architectural, because of the somewhat easier comps that we have in the second quarter, you would expect to see a stronger first half on sales and EPS growth than you would see in our second half. But in the second half, we still expect positive sales and EPS, it's just not going to be a strong as our first half. Yes, Tom, I would say it was a tale of two halves as well. As you know, the first half really got hit hard with COVID in China or in Asia in particular. So on a flat full year for Australia - Australia and Asia, you look at our second half both up double digits. So I think the focus of the teams and the opportunities that we have really showed in the second half, and we expect that to continue in the first half of 2021. Yes, Tom, I think we've made good progress in 2021. If you look at our second half operating margin, it was up 100 basis points to 15.2%. Flow through was strong. And I mentioned this earlier, over 40% on sales that were up 4%. And if you look at the volume strength, we expect in 2021 in that business, we talked about a mid-single-digit growth rate. You have price in there. The rest is going to be volume - as well as all of the hard work the team has done over the past few years right-sizing their footprint outside the US, reducing complexity by driving reduced SKUs, SKU levels, consolidating platforms to try to get scale on certain raw materials, and so a lot of hard work to drive their operating margins. We expect operating margin expansion in 2021 on that mid-single-digit growth rate even with the raw material increases that we're talking about. And on top of that, we haven't talked about it much this year, but we still have facility projects in the pipeline to rationalize in 2021. Unfortunately, or just the reality of it, we pushed those back. And so we're probably about six months delayed on those, but they're still on the table. We're committed to completing those to help continue to drive our cost down, and you'll see us as volume continues to go, and we'll make more progress on that operating margin here in the next couple of years. Yes, Kevin. Yes, we purchased 1.6 million shares in the fourth quarter for $1.15 billion, and as I talked about coming out of the third quarter, we had a little over $600 million of cash on our balance sheet. I talked about expecting to have a strong cash generation in our fourth quarter and putting that cash to work in M&A, and absent M&A, buying our stock back. So you can - you can extend that to the full year. We had such a strong cash generation, over $3.4 billion. We returned $2.9 billion to the shareholders as John talked about in his opening comments, a 145% increase. And that just goes to our disciplined approach to our capital allocation policy. We're not going to hold cash. We're going to invest in our business and Capex and our core below 2%, with our building and facility projects, that will be over 2% for a few years here. We're going to keep driving that dividend based on earnings growth and put 30% of prior year EPS. And then absent M&A, we're going to buy our stock back, and you saw that impact in our fourth quarter. That 1.6 million shares, Kevin, really because of the way the calc works, it might have impacted the fourth quarter a few hundred thousand shares for the year. It's probably not - not quite that much, just because of the math. But I'll let John go on the M&A. Yes, Ken, on the consumer margin, and you called out TAG as well. So I'm going to talk to a combined kind of architectural margin, if you will in - as the Consumer Group, our expectation even on top of a strong 2020 to have margin expansion not quite near what we saw in 2020, but the continued strong DIY that I talked about expectation to go through the first half. We'll see how that goes as it goes into our third quarter, but really you look at the strength in our TAG. And we talked about full year being up mid-to-high-single digits, and I would say typically as we talked about, our Paint Stores Group North America would be at the higher end of that range. We have a higher ongoing margin, if you will, and that will help drive that combined margin higher. And our expectation is, as you know we, when we set a new high watermark, our expectations are that our teams are going to exceed that high watermark. Thanks, Ken. Edlain, I would tell you by our businesses, by our regions, we look at growth targets, we look at scale. We look at return on sales. We look at RONA, and we look at cash flow, and we set targets in the mid - medium-to-longer term. And if we don't think we are going to be able to achieve those targets, then we look to do something else with that business, and that's what's driving these decisions. Yes, Justin, I talked about on our third quarter call that you would - that historically, our fourth quarter SG&A tends to be flat with our third quarter, and you delever on a sequential basis. But I did expect to see year-over-year fourth quarter leverage, and we experienced that on a consolidated basis. I also highlighted that the level of investment we would make in the fourth quarter would be dependent on the amount of volume we are experiencing in the quarter. And as I talked about or as you see, our volume was higher in the quarter than our 3% to 7%. So, we took that opportunity to invest in our businesses, driven by Consumer and Performance Coatings, and there are some of those investments that were one-time, others that will be continuing. And the way I'd probably look at it is you're probably going to see - I'd go 50.5 on what may have been one-time versus ongoing. Some are just related quite honestly to the sales increase. But we have added head count in Consumer to go after the Pro and other investments that - in programs that we've made to help continue to retain the DIY sales that we've enjoyed this year. So - and that's - the other part of that is really looking to our first half, and the expectation - with the expectation that we have a strong first half on sales putting those investments in in the fourth quarter and really through the second half of the year are going to pay dividends for us looking out into the second half of 2021. Yes, in TAG I would say we're going to continue to push that operating margin higher regardless of the economic environment. I think the team has done a really good job of pulling the different levers. First, as you know, Justin, is always growth. And when you're looking at TAG for 2021 for the year at mid to high single-digit growth, that allows us even in an inflationary environment to continue to invest back in our business for future growth, as well as growing our operating margin in the current year. So I think you could expect us to continue to drive that operating margin higher. Thanks, John."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. The strong results in our fourth quarter led to another record year for Sherwin-Williams. My deepest appreciation and respect go out to all 61,000 members of our incredible global family and to our leadership team for everything they've done. While none of us anticipated the severity of this year's challenges, our people responded as they always do when facing adversity, with extraordinary effort, with determination and with resiliency. When it mattered most, this team delivered, and I'm incredibly grateful for all they do. To that end, our full-year 2020 results demonstrate the strength of our people, our business model and our solutions-based approach to meeting customer needs. We generated record sales despite the impacts of COVID-19. Cash from operations, net income and net income per diluted share also were in records and increased by double-digit percentages over 2019. I'd like to call out just a few full-year highlights in more detail. Sales increased 2.6%, including a negative impact of 1.1% related to currency translation, to a record $18.4 billion. Gross margin improved 240 basis points to 47.3%. EBITDA grew to a record $3.4 billion or 18.7% of sales. Segment margin expanded in all three business groups. Adjusted diluted net income per share, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and other items called out in our press release, increased 16.4% to $24.58 per share. Net operating cash for the year increased to a record $3.41 billion or 18.6% of sales. We returned approximately $2.93 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, an increase of 145% over the prior year. We invested $303.8 million in our business through capital expenditures. And we retired $400 million in debt, ending the year with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times. As Jim described, we achieved these record full-year results with a strong close to the year. Let me provide some more detail about our segment performance in the fourth quarter. In the Americas Group, fourth quarter sales increased by 9% over the same period a year ago, including just under 2 percentage points of price and a headwind of 1.2 percentage points related to unfavorable currency translation. Same-store sales in the US and Canada were up 9.3%. We saw consistent trends across the business in the quarter, and we significantly outpaced the rate of growth we delivered in our third quarter. In Residential Repaint, our largest segment, we delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Interior and exterior work were both strong. Existing home sales are robust, and contractors are reporting solid backlogs. I'm also pleased to report that once again we grew this segment by double-digits on a full-year basis. We continue to see great opportunities here for share gains going forward. Demand remained unprecedented in our DIY business where sales were up by a double-digit percentage for the fourth consecutive quarter. New residential also remained an area of strength for us with the rate of growth accelerating from mid-single digits in the third quarter-to-high single digits in the fourth quarter. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since summer, and customers are reporting solid order rates. We've not yet seen meaningful recovery in our commercial business, which was up slightly in the fourth quarter. The predominant theme remains that projects are being delayed rather than cancelled. Property maintenance was also up slightly in the quarter, though turnover in multifamily properties remains low. Protective and Marine was down by double-digit percentage where growth in our smaller customer segments such as Flooring, Bridge and Highway and Water and Wastewater treatment, was more than offset by softness in the Oil and Gas segment. We continue to aggressively pursue opportunities in all of these end markets. From a product perspective, sales in both Interior and Exterior paint were up by double-digit percentages, with Interior becoming a larger part of the mix than it was in the third quarter, as is normal for our fourth quarter. Heavy equipment sales also were up double digits in the quarter. Contractors typically invest in this type of equipment in anticipation of solid demand. In December we announced a 3% to 4% price increase to our US and Canada customers effective February 1. We would expect to realize approximately 1.5% from price in the first quarter and just under 2% in the following quarter. We opened 54 new stores for the full year in the US and Canada, partially offset by consolidation of underperforming stores, the majority of which were in Latin America. Along with these stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new product and productivity-enhancing services to drive additional growth. We're also pleased by a continuing uptick in the use of our e-commerce platform. Moving onto our Consumer Brands Group, we delivered sales growth of 13.6% in the quarter, including 1.4 percentage points of positive impact related to currency translation as DIY demand remained robust. Sales in North America increased in line with our mid-teens segment growth guidance. International demand was variable with Australia up low-double digits, Europe up low-single digits and Asia down mid-single digits, respectively. Our global supply chain organization continued to perform at a high level in the quarter, working collaboratively with our customers and businesses to help meet the strong demand. The strong sales growth, along with prior portfolio improvements and international cost reductions, drove this significant improvement in our margin performance. Last, let me comment on our fourth quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. Following an encouraging third quarter, we continued to build momentum across the business in the fourth quarter. Group sales increased by high single-digit percentage. The impact of currency translation was not material in the quarter. Price was positive in all regions, and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in Asia grew the fastest in the quarter, up by a strong double-digit percentage. Europe and Latin America also grew by double-digit percentages. North America sales were just slightly positive. From a divisional perspective, I'll start with our Coil Coatings business, where growth was up double digits in the quarter and positive in every region. This team continues to do a remarkable job at winning new accounts in all regions. We're also seeing the gradual resumption of selected commercial construction projects. Our Packaging Team also continues to deliver great results. Sales were up double digits in the quarter and positive in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. Our non-BPA coating continued to gain traction, and both we and our customers are investing in capacity expansion. Sales in the Industrial Wood division were up by a double-digit percentage in the quarter. Positive trends in new residential construction are driving increased demand for kitchen cabinetry, flooring, and furniture. We're especially encouraged by the return to growth in our General Industrial division, where sales were up by a high-single digit percentage in the quarter. We saw a meaningful improvement in portions of our Heavy Equipment, Building Products and Container segments as well as more General Finishing. We believe the strong performance was a mix of inventory restocking by some of our customers and growing in demand. Sales were up in all regions except North America, which was down about 1% but improved significantly from the third quarter. Sales were also slightly positive in the Automotive Refinish division in the quarter. Heightened social restrictions and lower than normal holiday travel due to a resurgence in COVID pressured miles driven and collision shop volume. Turning to our 2021 outlook, we see an operating environment with very solid North American new residential and residential repaint demand. The trajectory of recovery in Commercial and Property Maintenance is likely to be choppy and comparisons in DIY will be challenging. We anticipate Industrial demand will continue to improve as the year progresses. The impact of variables such as the timing of the COVID vaccine, the incoming US administration and proposed stimulus and infrastructure spending are hard to gauge at this point. That said, our team is skilled at adapting to any number of conditions. And we have many opportunities to grow share in all of our businesses. We'll continue to target growing at a rate that outpaces the market through customer-driven solutions based on innovation, value-added service and differentiated distribution. For the first quarter of 2021, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a high-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2020. We expect the Americas Group to be up high-single digits. We expect Consumer Brands to be up by a mid-teens percentage, and we expect Performance Coatings Group be up by mid-to-high-single digits. For the full year 2021, we expect net sales to increase by a mid-to-high single digit percentage. First half growth is expected to be stronger than second half given the negative impact COVID had on our first half a year ago. We expect the Americas Group to be up a mid-to-high-single-digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up or down by low-single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a mid-single-digit percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $23.87 to $24.67 per share compared to $22.08 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $2.53 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full-year 2021 earnings per share of $26.40 to $27.20, an increase of 9% at the midpoint over the $24.58 we delivered in 2020. One key assumption embedded in our outlook is that the market rate of inflation for our raw material basket will be up by a low-to-mid-single-digit percentage in 2021 compared to 2020, assuming no further escalation above our current outlook and no supply disruption. We expect to see year-over-year inflation in all four quarters, with the largest impact likely occurring in the middle two quarters. We expect the rate of inflation to be most significant on the petrochemical side of the basket. As we've demonstrated in the past, we will seek to offset these increased costs with pricing actions as appropriate. Let me close with some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Given volume growth, pricing actions and our ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, we expect full-year gross margin expansion. We expect to get SG&A leverage in 2021 by controlling costs tightly in non-customer facing functions. We'll continue to make investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to return to our normal cadence with around 80 new stores opening in the US and Canada in 2021. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, as well as systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform in the Home Center channel. These investments are embedded in our full-year guidance. We expect currency exchange will not have a material impact on sales for the full year. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. Our core CapEx guidance for the year is approximately $370 million. In addition to this core CapEx, we expect to make investments of approximately $100 million in 2021 related to our new headquarters and our new R&D facility project. Depreciation should be about $300 million, and amortization will be about $310 million. Interest expense should be about $340 million. We have $25 million of long-term debt due in 2021. Historically, we've targeted dividends at about 30% of our prior-year GAAP earnings. Next month, at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 23.5% to $6.62 per share, up from $5.36 last year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. 2020 was a very challenging year, and I'm incredibly proud of the way our team responded to deliver record sales and earnings. As 2021 begins, we're energized and more determined than ever to capitalize on the many opportunities we see in each one of our businesses. We believe the long-term fundamental strengths of our end markets remain intact. We're poised to thrive in 2021, and as I mentioned last quarter, we feel like we're just getting started in many ways. Our team is experienced, our goals are clear. Our solutions are many, and our confidence is high. We remain focused on delivering value for all of our stakeholders over the long term. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And we'll be happy to take your questions. Ghansham, I'd say, first, we have great confidence in the market here. We've been working very hard as you know to position the company to strategically thrive whichever way the table tilts. So while there may be some shifts in the market, we believe we'll be able to capitalize on the opportunities regardless of which way the market may move. So let me just run through quickly to answer your question. I think from a New Residential standpoint, we think coming off a high-single digits in the fourth quarter, we believe that permits are strong, and our position in New Residential is very strong. As you know, we've got a terrific position with 18 of the top 20 homebuilders. And we expect that that momentum that they are experiencing will result in some nice gains for us. We're also very pleased with the gains that we've been making with the regional builders. So from a New Residential position, we're feeling really, really good. From a Residential Repaint position, I'd say that the strength that we mentioned earlier, double digits now for six consecutive years, give us a lot of confidence in the way that this business is moving. This is driven by both Interior/Exterior work as we talked about, and homeowners now beginning to let these painters back into their homes has us feeling really good, not only about the market itself but our growing position there. The backlog in this Residential Repaint business gives us additional confidence. There has been some question about any shift between do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me. And we believe that the do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me are both terrific opportunities. The do-it-yourself remains strong. Consumers are nesting and while there, they are choosing to jump on the opportunity to make an impactful difference in their home in a very reasonable project from an investment standpoint and time, so we're excited about the momentum that we have there as well. We're working hard. It's a relatively small percentage of our business overall, DIY, but our net promoter score even in these challenging times, both on the professional side and a DIY side are improving. So we're going to work hard to continue to retain those customers that have entered into our stores. Commercial improved significantly over the third quarter, down from double-digits to slightly positive. Still a recovery has been more muted here than the Residential Repaint and New Residential. Projects here are beginning to open back up, but with restrictions for distancing and number of people on the projects requiring PPE. So we're working closely with our contractors there. We navigate through these challenges, and we think it's a terrific opportunity for us to support our customers as they grow it in the new world here. And then finally in Property Maintenance, recovery in Property Maintenance as I mentioned earlier, remains slow but positive. Demographics here for apartments are favorable, it's just under pressure with turns. So maintenance in Property Management, in the area of apartments has been slow, but also in areas like hotels, restaurants, etc. We are seeing in the multifamily area investments - CapEx investments to upgrade properties. This has gained traction in areas somewhat influenced by the deurbanization. And this would be where you might have C-level properties going to B and B to A. Again we've got a terrific position here with relationships with 18 of the top 20 property management companies. So I'd say whichever - I walked through those kind of quickly, but whichever way these markets tilt we're, as I mentioned, feeling really good about that. So if homeowners, who now have been called back to work, end up back on the production line or traveling for their businesses or back in their offices, wherever those gallons are sold, we like the position that we are in to be able to capitalize on it. So we're really confident about that. And Jim, maybe you can take a moment just to talk about the macro data that supports our confidence. Thank you, Ghansham. Yes, Jeff, if you look at the year-over-year in the fourth quarter, most of that increase was due to Brazilian tax credits and occurred in the fourth quarter. Aside from that, the remaining increases were due to higher comp and incentives, including stock-based compensation. We had a higher environmental expense in the quarter, and then we took the opportunity in the fourth quarter as we saw a stronger sales than what we had guided to - our guidance as you recalls was to be up three to seven. We ended up above the high end of that range at little bit over 9%. Some of the spending we delayed in IT infrastructure, and some of the digital initiatives across the enterprise we put some money back in there that drove that increase up a little bit. That was partially offset by a decrease in integration costs. If you look at our outlook for 2021, my expectation is interest expense will be pretty flat year-over-year. And then I would expect to be flat to down slightly on admin for the rest of the year. Jeff, I don't know that I want to talk about any one particular asset. I might give you our thinking overall and let you drive your own thinking to that. Our pipeline as we see it is robust, and we continue to evaluate what we believe are strategic fits for our company. And to us, we look at very unique and differentiated solutions and solutions that allow us to drive our customer success. And I just want to take a moment on this because I think it's important, our view is that when our customers are successful, we're successful. And when we're driving value for them, it allows us to create value for our shareholders. So we're focused on targets that drive those unique solutions. Our strategy is not going to be defined by what comes up for sale. And we're not trying to be everything to everyone nor trying to be everyone - or everywhere for everyone. We look proactively for targets that are kind of fits for our strategy, that fit us in geographic areas that we feel that are a gap, that provide a technology that we can leverage or adds to our distribution that fits our strategy. We believe we're uniquely positioned not to require acquisitions to grow. Our focus is on right now a prioritization of opportunities that we have and turning them into shareholder value. You're likely, Jeff, going to see us more doing bolt-ons more likely in the industrial space with targets to support what we call our right-to-win, not just commodities or not just a book of business. We're really focused in on those high-value areas that allow us to differentiate. So, a great example would be - and there's a lot of talk now about infrastructure, and not to say that we're only focused on Protective and Marine, but I think it gives a good example. If I take Bridge and Highway, as an example, you're likely going to see us on the Bridge side or as we say the HVI, the high value infrastructure, not just chasing commodities. So our view is that those acquisitions that fit our ability to differentiate with unique solutions allow us to create value, not just trying to be everything to everyone everywhere. Thank you, Jeff. I think you should plan on the opportunities to be very solid. I don't have a number. I think it varies by customer and probably by geography, but as you would expect with over 3,000 sales reps and nearly 5,000 store managers out there every day working this customer, we have a very good feeling about what they're doing and through our CRM, we've got an understanding of the activity there, and I would tell you it's terrific. In a number of ways I would say the confidence that we have presents itself. The drive that we have in new account activity for further growth - there's an interesting fact. In 2020, we actually opened more new accounts, many of them in Residential Repaint in 2020 than we did in 2019. And so the visual I'd like for you to understand is that we've got this terrific customer base that's growing in their loyalty to us through the introduction of new products and innovative solutions, the digital platform. We've got a new living well introduction of products for our customers. I'd be happy to share with you in a moment here. We've got terrific service, the role that our reps play in helping these customers to be successful. So we've got homeowners who've been home that are anxious to have their homes painted after spending maybe a little more time in there than they appreciated earlier, a desire to maintain those, painting contractors whose loyalty to our company is growing, and a strong desire for us to not only take care of those that are doing business with us now, but to grow that. And I think we're hitting on a lot of those cylinders. So as I mentioned, six years of double-digit growth, and we expect that momentum to continue. Thank you, Vincent. Yes, I think there is a digital investment and a home center digital investment. So I want to make sure that you're clear with our comments there, Greg. We are very excited about our relationship. We share our definition of success with our Consumer Brands customers that has us leaning forward and anxious on growing - this growing opportunity. We're interested in retention of the customers that our customers are experiencing. And we're working with them in ways to help them do that. Rather that the specifics of those details come from those customers, and the timing will be explained by those customers. Internally, ours, we're very excited about that as well. I'd splinter that out into both the do-it-yourself, again lesser part of our business. We're spending a little bit of time on to serve those customers, quite a bit of investment and attention going towards our professional digital platform, Greg. In fact, we're going to be introducing in this first quarter a new initiative called Pro's Plus which is one suite of tools that are designed to make our customers more successful. And it's unique, and we think unique in a way that only Sherwin can bring it to the market in that it brings all elements to our customers, the in-store, the online, the rep, all of these in a way that we think will help our customers be more successful in their endeavors. So as I mentioned, we're rolling that out in the first quarter, and we're very excited about the impact that will have as well. But digital across the board, internally and externally, is something that we're focused on. Thank you, Greg. Yes, with some very good investments for our future as well. We're feeling good about it. Well, we love that you just made that comment, well most of us. Our Pittsburgh fan here, Al Mistysyn, is a Steeler fan, but the rest of us are right there with you. Yes, we do plan on continuing to invest in our stores. We just mentioned investments, and stores and reps are an important part of that. And we're going to be back into that range likely in the 80 to 100 as we go into 2021. And a lot of that I'll have to do with how this pandemic flows, but it's an important investment that we continue to expect to put fuel in that tank for sure. Thank you. I think it's likely a longer build up than most would realize. I mean when you think, to your point, the do-it-for-me I think is a growing population. There was a DIY surge, about 60% of the people saying that they undertook some home improvement projects. We believe that the fact that there's such a backlog right now given the surge that we've already seen in DIY. When you talk to our painting contractors, we believe that there is still quite a bit of pent-up demand, and there is underlying long-term demand drivers we think that support that, the aging population, the home price appreciation, aging housing stock, the stock market appreciation, dual-income families. All of those we think continue to feed the do-it-for-me. And we're working really hard to be the one that those contractors turn to. Yes, I'd say that it seems to be strong across most segments, and the technology there is moving and our relationship with those customers. We want to be that go-to-shop for the residential repaint contractor that may be looking at the fact that they are a little shorter on labor than they would appreciate, and they see the opportunity to go faster and pick-up projects. So we want to be the go-to-supplier that can help educate them on how spray equipment could help their productivity and quality, so that along with - and we are seeing this as well a positive mix shift in quality. So we see a movement up in our quality for the same reasons. These painting contractors in many cases are finding labor painters that might be less experienced, and so spray equipment opportunities are one area to help their productivity as is the increase in quality to help minimize any call-backs or disruptions to the employer - to the homeowner while improving their productivity. Thank you, John. You know, Arun, I'd just add this result in the PCG business, Performance Coatings business, you got to give great credit to our team, our leadership there. When things were pretty dismal and things were looking pretty challenging, this team kept their chin up and leaning forward. I'm really proud of what they accomplished. I think everything - I agree with everything Al said. I'd also add that we're leaning forward with market share gains here as well, so we're not just simply we're not relying on the market to get better. There's been a lot of terrific work that's taken - been taken place in some of the most challenging times that many of us have been through. And they really positioned our Company well. I want to thank our leadership throughout PCG here. They've done a wonderful job, and we have high expectations of them going forward as a result of the great work they're doing. I'd say our - I mentioned earlier, I think our pipeline is very robust. We have a number of projects that we're working on, some of which we expect to complete this year. I want to reiterate and reemphasize on both sides here, one that we don't feel as though we have a gun on our head with an absolute need for acquisitions in order to grow. I think we've proven that, and we're excited about what we see in front of us in the windshield that gives us great confidence with or without them. Now that said, on the other side, I want to be very clear, we are excited about some of these projects. We are very deliberate in what it is that we're doing. We're confident that that many of these would be a terrific fit, and we're working towards them. So we feel really good about what we have and what's out there. Thank you, Arun. So Steve, I might suggest that you look at it in a slightly different way. Let me - let me introduce this thinking, that the positive mix shift that we're experiencing is actually in nearly every segment in TAG. So within commercial, if I could just isolate on commercial for one second, if you could imagine a project that was bid where COVID wasn't in the mind of the project estimator and they put this together, and all of a sudden now there is starts and stops and restrictions on how many people can be on a project and all the challenges that we all know. Now, you start to realize when the cost of labor is only 80% to 90% of the project, that incremental investment in a higher-quality product will actually increase their cost of goods from a paint perspective. But overall when you think about labor and the choppiness they're experiencing, it will actually make them more efficient, more profitable on that project. And so across all segments now, going beyond just the Commercial, what we are experiencing is exactly what you said, a positive mix shift in Residential Repaint. We might have painters with a little less experience, and so they don't want to be disruptive to the homeowner and have touch-up issues. They want to maybe get away with one less coat so they can get out of the home quicker, all these - durability. All of these different areas are important aspects of product mix shift in a positive direction, same with Commercial. New Residential, you look at the number of painters on a new home and the delay getting pushed out. So they want people to be able to come in, paint the home, get off with little call back or touch up. So we are experiencing this positive shift throughout our architectural business. Steve, one thing I think we've proved in a year with the pandemic is not a year you should try to reposition our Architectural brand in China. So I think as we move forward, there's a lot of work that we're working on. I do think there are a number of opportunities there. It is a relatively fragmented market. And there are terrific opportunities, and you should expect that we're continuing our work in establishing the most solid brand strategy moving forward - in 2020. We have high expectations for the team, but I would tell you that in 2020, we had to be somewhat understanding in that the consumer marketplace in China, with everything going on with the pandemic, was not a year we were going to gain a lot of ground in this area; so we're ramping that back up. We'll be doing a lot of testing. I wouldn't think that in 2021 we're going to move the needle by our Architectural sales in China, but we certainly believe it's a seed that needs to be planted for our future. Thank you. Thanks, David. Yes, PJ, we don't discriminate when it comes to share gains. So we're working every market. That's what beautiful about our industry. Every market is its own independent market, and you have to win. And I would say this, that with our view, many people look at our stores because of the storefront and think we're mainly a retail store. That's not the case. We are not the company that unlocks our door and hopes that things - good things happen. Give the TAG leadership, Pete Ippolito and his entire leadership team great credit for the aggressive view that they take. We're not waiting for things to happen. And so in each market, to answer your question, there is a - there is a plan. The plan includes who are those customers that we might know and we might be doing business with that we could expand our share of wallet with. And there are some that, for whatever reason, we've not earned their trust or their business, and it's up to that local team to get to know those customers and build that relationship. So it's not one contributor. It's - I wish it were that easy. It's challenging, but we get out there every day, and this team has a wonderful mentality. This team thinks about you eat what you kill. So you need to get out there every day and hunt and provide for your family. I love the mentality they have. I was pleased to see it come back. I don't know that I would say surprised. We have a terrific leadership team in this business that is doing a wonderful job. To your point, there's been seven quarters of tough sledding, but we have really good momentum right now in three of the four regions posting double-digit gains. North America, while just slightly lagging, is trending very well. The back half of the quarter here in North America was strong, and we believe that Heavy Equipment, as well as many of these other segments that we're focused on, are really somewhat - some of them are recovering. Some of them as they recover might be rebuilding inventory. So, we're taking that into account as well. But this is a team that's aggressively out there. As I mentioned just now with TAG as far as market share gains, this team Karl Jorgenrud and his team are really working hard to gain ground, and we've got a lot of respect for them and the job they're doing. Wonderful team we have here. Thank you. Might be on mute, Chris. We're not hearing you. Yes, I'd say for us both are relatively small in what's happening for our business. Australia for us delivered flat growth for the year, significantly improved our profitability there. We've increased our efforts to develop the right platform for distribution there. And we're optimizing that platform; we've taken - I think, some really good steps in cost reduction and actions to improve the margins in Australia. And from a market standpoint, I think we're holding our own in China. As I just mentioned, I think there is the region for us in Architectural had a decline, but we believe going forward here, we have a lot of ground to be gained and a relatively small position to build on. First - I'm going to give it to Al, but I'm going to tell you that the resolve and conviction we have on getting there has never been stronger. We got a lot of confidence in what we're doing and the teams that are delivering it. So we know we're going to get there. Thank you. Thanks, Chris. And I would say that we enjoy a good position, but we know that there are terrific opportunities out there from a market opportunity perspective. We do feel along with our customers that this is in fact a business that we want to invest in. Both our customers and Sherwin are continuing to invest both in technology and capacity. We are thrilled with this unique technology we have, our V70. It's the only epoxy non-BPA on the market. Others are acrylic or polyester, and this V70 is a game changer. It's more versatile. it doesn't require lines to be shut down for changeovers. The constant consistent mill thickness just gives more productivity to our customers. And so you're right, we're having discussions with them as they're asking us to be in different parts of the world to serve them. It's a unique solution for our customers. And when we talk about our ability to add value to our customers, this is exactly it. We've got 29 patents protecting this technology. It's unique, and it helps our customers in what they're trying to do. It's exactly where we want to be, help them to be successful. The answer is yes, Chris. We absolutely - we love those opportunities, and you're exactly right. We're investing in the Southeast and Southwest areas where there is growth, and equally important to us is greater market share penetration in other parts of the country. And so we're not limiting ourselves on where we're going to grow. We are - we're married to success here. And so we're going to look for the right opportunities, and we're going to drill in and find them. And I've got confidence in that in our TAG leadership team to be able to do exactly that. Thank you, Chris. Yes, there's not much more to add. I think the point that Al made is an important one. Absent M&A, that we will be back in and buying stock. We don't - we feel we've got plenty of dry powder here, and we're excited about some of the targets that we're working on now, and we're continuing to fill that pipeline. But again, I want to be clear, while we're excited about it, we don't feel as though we have a gun pointed to our head. So we're not going to be out there just going to buy a book of business so that we can say that we're growing sales. There are going to be strategic fits and add value or we're really not interested. Yes. Okay. I'll take the Industrial Wood, and I'll have Al jump on the Consumer margin. First, you're right. This has been a terrific rebound by a strong team. Colin Davie and his team in Industrial Wood have really been driving hard. We had growth in all regions, with three of four of our regions in double digits. The strength here that we're seeing is driven mainly in areas of kitchen cabinets, also furniture, and so when you talk about the longevity, I would say that gives us great confidence here. The backlog of orders ahead for furniture is very long. I mean some of these are out six months or more, just because of how strong orders are. So, I think our position is terrific. It's a position of strength driven off of not only just wonderful service and availability, but a growing and unique technology portfolio that helps our customers reach their goals of again terrific leadership team doing a really good job here in the face of adversity. I think they are proving our stripes here. I would just add, I think the volume piece is a terrific opportunity as Al mentioned. I think on both sides we're looking for that. And again, I know I'm calling out a few leaders here, but we have opportunities. When we talk about consumer while the DIY side's starting here very strong, and we feel good about it. We still believe that there are terrific opportunities for growth in our Pro side. We've got Brian Padden leading that organization. Heidi Petz was in there before, now over in our stores. These two leaders have done a terrific job positioning us we believe for continued run there. And we can go on and on about TAG. There is a lot of jet fuel in that tank. I really believe - I've said this before, we feel inside this boardroom, we feel like we're just getting started. There's a lot of opportunities, a lot of levers to pull here and we are going to be pulling them hard Yes so, just so we make sure I understand, are you suggesting - are you asking what areas are we not interested in? I'm sorry. You're right, we probably wouldn't talk about any specifics, but I would say that on a regular basis we are constantly evaluating every aspect of our business, everything from program - customer programs to brands to businesses, and we're always looking at how to drive that margin and success forward. And so even down to the stores, if we found stores in some Latin America or some outlying markets. We had some in Canada where we looked at the investments that we had and said, you know what, it's not going to get the return that the hurdle that we have for ourselves. So, I'm not going to call out any specific area, but I will tell you it's a it has to be a constant discussion that we have regularly. I think it's part of the discipline that we have here at Sherwin. Thank you. When we get payment did you say? So, no, we've not experienced that. As far as the, the project flow, I don't - I wouldn't say that we're experiencing anything that's unique. I mean there have been challenges with labor. I think it's been somewhat consistent. I think there is more interest, if you will, on the part of builders to find quality products that will help accelerate construction towards close. And so, if - if you take a look at products that hide imperfections and touch up well, those are of greater interest, and so we are seeing some positive mix shift in this area. No, actually it actually supports it more. What does come back to the point that I made earlier when you consider that labor represents about 80% to 90% of the cost of goods for most contractors, a higher quality product actually helps their efficiency, so we continue to see a positive mix shift; and we expect that to continue. Yes, thank you. Thanks, Justin. Well, I think if you look at Auto, there's been a lot of really good work. And I would say this, that when we're looking at Auto, one of the things to recognize is this is a terrific example I think of the synergies that are out there as it relates to the acquisition. This Ultra 9K that we brought in brings in a terrific opportunity for us to bring solutions to our customers. I think if you look historically, John, I'd say Sherwin has been really well known for their primers and their clear coats. Ultra 9K brings a different application. It's a wet-on-wet application. It helps the technician get greater throughput, increasing productivity, and it actually helps considerably in their color matching capabilities. So I think the overall application, service and ability to help our customers increase their productivity is really what's driving it. And you're right, I mean we think this is a tough and tight market. Miles driven have been down about 75% of pre-COVID miles, and claims are down. This is a team that's not waiting, and they're out there moving aggressively with new technology. And we've been talking about this for a few quarters that we thought that this was a business that was kind of not getting the credit they deserve. A large part of it was the COVID miles and pressure hid some of that. I think you're starting to see what we've been expecting for some time, and we expect that momentum to continue."

After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy during the pandemic. Let me begin with some high-level summary comments on the quarter. All comparisons are to the third quarter of 2019, unless otherwise stated. Sherwin-Williams delivered outstanding results in the third quarter. Total company consolidated sales were well above the original guidance we provided on July 28, and also slightly above the increased guidance we provided on September 29. We saw continued unprecedented demand in our DIY business during the quarter, double-digit growth in residential repaint, very solid demand in new residential and positive momentum across our industrial end markets. We delivered year-over-year improvement in gross margin and record profit before tax EBITDA, diluted net income per share and net operating cash. Third quarter 2020 consolidated sales increased 5.2% to $5.12 billion, inclusive of a negative currency impact of 0.9%. The estimated impact from COVID-19 on consolidated sales in the quarter was not material. Consolidated gross margin increased 220 basis points to 47.9%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $165.8 million or 23.4% to $875.6 million. Diluted net-net income per share increased 24.4% to $7.66 per share. The third quarter of 2020 included acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.63 per share. The third quarter of 2019 included acquisition-related amortization expense and other adjustments of $0.49 per share, as described in the Regulation G reconciliation table included in our press release. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 24.7% to $8.29 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $185.7 million to $1.11 billion, or 21.6% of sales. Net operating cash increased 54.3% year-to-date to $2.56 billion. From a segment perspective, sales in the Americas Group and Consumer Brands Group were in line with our updated guidance, while sales in Performance Coatings Group were slightly better than expected. All segment delivered very strong flow-through in the quarter. Segment margin in the Americas Group improved to 25.1% of sales, resulting from operating leverage on the topline growth, favorable mix, and lower input costs. Adjusted segment margin in Consumer Brands Group increased to 26.4% of sales, resulting from operating leverage on the strong double-digit topline growth, favorable product mix, lower input costs, and actions taken over the past year to improve our international operating margin. Adjusted segment margin in Performance Coatings Group increased to 16% of sales, driven by returning sales growth and lower input costs. Additional details on our segment performance are included in the slide deck provided with our press release and available on our IR website. Let me now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Morikis, for some additional commentary on the quarter and our outlook. John?\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Let me begin by expressing my appreciation to the over 61,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams for their continued determination and their resilience. I could not be more proud of this incredible team as they delivered record results in a very challenging environment. Our leadership team and their many years of collective experience have been true differentiators throughout this entire year, enabling us to drive significant improvement across many measures, while serving our customers at a very high level. We generated very solid sales growth in the quarter, with all three operating segments growing year-over-year, exceeding the original guidance we provided at the end of July and improving sequentially. The gross margin expansion in the quarter was driven by sales growth, effective pricing, favorable mix, and lower input costs. The industry basket of raw materials was down by a mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter compared to the prior year, though a bit less than what we saw in the second quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales in the quarter decreased slightly year-over-year to 27.5%. SG&A increased on a dollar basis as we continue to make investments to drive long-term growth. Let me talk a bit more about trends we're seeing in each of our segments before moving on to our outlook. In the Americas Group, we saw a significant sequential improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter in all regions and all segments served. Most regions and segments also delivered growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We're especially encouraged by the return of double-digit growth in residential repaint, our largest segment. Interior work has picked up significantly. As a reminder, this segment has been our fastest growing over the last several years and continues to offer us the largest opportunity for share gain. Sales in new residential also gained momentum in the quarter, and were up by mid-single-digits. Our DIY business delivered the biggest year-over-year percentage increase in the quarter, with COVID-related stay-at-home projects driving robust consumer demand throughout the quarter. Our customers business slowly improved but remained down low single-digits in the quarter. Our customers are telling us that job site conditions are stabilizing, and the predominant theme remains that projects are being delayed rather than canceled. The property maintenance segment remains under pressure as turnover in multifamily remains slow. Protective and marine remains our most challenging segment from a demand perspective. Access to job sites remains an issue on some projects. Demand remains particularly depressed in oil and gas, which is the segment's largest single-end market. Other areas such as flooring and water and wastewater treatment are moving in a more positive direction. We believe this business is well-positioned to take advantage of future potential, infrastructure investments and comps will start to become more favorable heading into next year. From a product perspective, strength in exterior paint continued as we generated low double-digit percentage growth in the quarter. Encouragingly, we also saw a significant pickup in interior paint, where sales were up by a high single-digit percentage overall and by double digits in the residential repaint segment. Additionally, spray equipment sales were up strong double digits in the quarter. This is another very encouraging sign of recovery as contractors are unlikely to invest in this type of equipment unless they anticipate significant demand. Pricing came in as we expected and was approximately 2% in the third quarter. We expect a similar level of effectiveness in the fourth quarter. We opened 24 new stores in the third quarter and 40 year-to-date in the U.S. and Canada. We anticipate opening a total of approximately 55 new stores for the full year in the U.S. and Canada. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products and productivity enhancing services to drive additional growth. We're also pleased by a continuing uptick in the use of our e-commerce platform. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. DIY demand remained robust in the quarter, driven by consumers continuing to focus on home improvement projects while nesting at home during the pandemic. We generated strong double-digit growth by working closely with our retail customers to capture this demand, most notably with Lowe's. Our global supply chain organization continued to perform admirably in the quarter, working collaboratively with our customers to help meet unprecedented demand. Internationally, every region generated year-over-year growth. Sales increased by double-digit percentages in Europe and Australia, and by a mid- single-digit percentage in Asia. Similar to second quarter, we leveraged the strong sales growth and favorable product mix to drive significant operating margin improvement compared to the prior year. Our margin improvement also reflects the terrific work this team has done over the last two years to improve our portfolio, including rationalizing SKUs, exiting the ACE private label business, and reducing costs in Europe and Australia. We continue to reinvest in this business to drive long-term growth for our partners, especially in the Handyman remodeler or pros who paint category. Lastly, let me comment on the trends in the Performance Coatings Group. We're encouraged by this segment's return to growth in the quarter, inclusive of a 1.4% headwind related to currency translation rate changes. As in the Americas Group, Performance Coatings Groups generated significant sequential improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter in all regions, in nearly all divisions. The majority of regions and divisions also delivered growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. From a regional perspective, Asia grew fastest in the quarter, up by a high single-digit percentage. Europe and Latin America both grew by low single-digit percentages. Our largest region in PCG, North America, was down in the quarter by a low single-digit percentage, where a slower recovery in the General Industrial Division offset growth in the other divisions. From a divisional perspective, I'll start with our packaging business, where our team continues to deliver great results. Sales were up high single digits and positive in every region for the quarter. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust, and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction. And both we and our customers are investing in capacity expansion. In coil coatings, the resumption of selected commercial construction projects, albeit slow, along with growth in appliances and strong new business wins across all regions led to mid single-digit growth in the quarter. We're very encouraged by the improved performance in industrial wood, where sales were up by a mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter. We believe the momentum we are seeing in kitchen cabinetry, flooring and furniture correlates to similar positive trends in new residential construction. We also returned to growth in automotive refinish in the quarter, where sales were up a low single-digit percentage. This team has done a very nice job driving new account growth by offering better solutions than our competitors. We estimate miles driven are currently at about 75% of pre-COVID levels. And collision shop volume across the industry is off by approximately 25%. We expect continued improvement in these trends. In general industrial, we were down by a low single-digit percentage in the quarter. While we're never pleased with the quarter, where the top line is down, this was a very significant improvement from the high double-digit decline we saw in the second quarter. There are several reasons for optimism in this business. Regionally, Asia was up double digits, and Europe was up mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. Latin America was positive on a currency-neutral basis, and while North America remained under pressure, we did see very meaningful sequential improvement. Moving on to our guidance. I'll remind you that our fourth quarter is a seasonally smaller one. We expect to see our normal sequential seasonal slowdown in U.S. architectural demand in the fourth quarter, similar to previous years. We're expecting continued favorable product mix in the quarter with DIY, res repaint and new residential growth, while not expecting material improvement in the other architectural segments or Protective & Marine. We also expect our interior products to become a bigger part of the mix in the quarter as we return to a more typical interior/exterior ratio for this time of year. On the industrial side of the business, we're encouraged by many of the positive trends I described a few moments ago. At the same time, dynamics related to customers' replenishment of inventory and the true pace of end market demand will likely cause continued choppiness in the pace of recovery in some end markets. Against this backdrop, we anticipate fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net sales will increase by 3% to 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Looking at our operating segments for the fourth quarter. We anticipate the Americas Group to be up by 4% to 6%, Consumer Brands Group be up a mid-to high-teens percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up or down a low single-digit percentage. For the full year 2020, we are revising our sales guidance upward from flat to up slightly, to up by a low single-digit percentage based on our improved fourth quarter outlook. On an operating segment basis for the full year, we anticipate the Americas Group to be up by a low single-digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up by a mid-teens percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be down by low to mid single-digit percentage. We expect to see gross margin expansion in the quarter. On SG&A, we will be making incremental investments in our long-term growth opportunities, and we do not expect to see as much SG&A leverage as in our third quarter. We are, again, increasing our diluted net income per share guidance for 2020 to be in the range of $21.49 to $21.79 per share compared to our most recent guidance of $20.96 to $21.46 per share and compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings per share guidance, includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $2.51 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2020 earnings per share of $24 to $24.30, an increase of 14.3% at the midpoint over the $21.12 we delivered last year. Embedded within our outlook is the assumption that the raw material basket will be lower for the full year by a mid-single-digit percentage. Based on our current outlook, we expect the fourth quarter will have less of a benefit than the first three quarters of the year, given recent sequential inflation in some commodities, in comparisons to the deflation we saw the latter half of 2019. Let me close with some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Our CapEx guidance for the year remains $280 million. This CapEx guidance includes a very modest amount of spending related to our new headquarters and R&D facility projects. Earlier this month, the company's Board of Directors approved a dividend of $1.34 per share, an increase of 18.6% over the $1.13 per share dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2019. We resumed open market share purchases during the third quarter, investing $404 million, purchased 600,000 shares of company common stock. Absent significant M&A, we expect to continue purchasing shares in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have a remarkable team at Sherwin-Williams, and they delivered outstanding results in the quarter by focusing on meeting customer needs. I'm truly grateful for their passion and their commitment, which has put us on track to deliver sales and earnings growth in this most challenging of years. We believe the long-term fundamental strengths of our end markets remain intact. There is tremendous opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses and, in many ways, we're just getting started. We remained very confident about the future and our ability to create shareholder value over the long term. This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning everybody.\nJohn Morikis: Good morning, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: I guess, first off, within TAG, the commercial and property maintenance sub-verticals improved significantly, relative to what you saw in 2Q. How do you disaggregate that improvement between pent-up demand from the 2Q dislocations versus an improvement in underlying growth? And then what time line do you think for each vertical is it reasonable for volumes to inflect higher year-over-year?\nJohn Morikis: Well, thank you for that question, Ghansham. I think the -- if you start with commercial, as you've mentioned, jobs are coming back online. And as we mentioned, sequentially, we've seen some improvement. I think when you look at the ramp-up there, I think a lot of that's going to have to do with the progress our contractors make on getting more painters out on projects, social distancing and the restrictions that go along with those requirements have proven somewhat challenging to our customers. So I'd say that as we go into 2021, we expect more and more progress, if you will, in that segment. You asked about each of the segments, and maybe I'll make one overarching comment regarding all the professional segments. And that is, as I've mentioned before, no one hopes for any experience like this pandemic that we're experiencing. That said, our commercial contractors, as well as every other contractor we serve has found this market to be a challenge. It might be getting approval to go in to work into one area, and getting pulled out for that area and pushed into another, start exterior, have someone say they might be going out of town, can you do an interior project? All of these create conflict for our customers. And at the same time, it creates the opportunity that we look for, which is to be there with solutions for our customers. And so we're working hard. I mentioned earlier, how grateful I am for our teams. Our teams in the field are doing just a wonderful job in responding into each one of these professional segments in a way that very few people can. As it relates to the segments, I might, again, here, begin with the way that I'm looking at these segments. And these, to me, represent favorable comps as we go into next year. If you start with residential repaint, and I'll give you a little color as to why I feel each of these are favorable comps. We are talking about coming out of a quarter with double-digit gains, but we're not hitting on all cylinders yet. The interior, while improving dramatically, offers a terrific opportunity for us as well as the opportunity to continue to grow share. Our TAG team, the leadership team and those terrific employees in the field, are actually growing our new accounts year-over-year this year, on the year with a pandemic, faster than we have previous years. So our new account growth in this area has just been terrific. So we see our progress in res repaint as exciting. But we're not complacent here. This offers -- this is the largest segment we have, but it also offers the greatest opportunity for market share growth. We feel coming into 2021, the fact that we've been running a large part of the year with a much smaller interior market as well as the share gains that we're gaining, we're excited about entering into next year. In new residential, same thing, comps are favorable going into next year for us. We finished the year here -- I'm sorry, the fourth quarter mid-single-digits up. But again, these are businesses that are just starting to ramp up our position here, exclusive relationships with 18 of the top 20 builders, really making progress in the regional and custom homebuilder who's really been hit the least throughout this process. But our position here, as we go into 2021, is really a strong one, particularly given the fact that there still remains a shortage of supply of homes in the marketplace. And our new residential customers are excited about the progress as they're making coming out of 2020 going into 2021. Talking about commercial, property management is another one. Again, terrific comps for us as we go into next year. Clearly, this business has been impacted by turns. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the lack of turns has had an impact on our business here. If you'll recall, during our financial community presentation, I mentioned that our customers are starting to see, sense, and hear more from their tenants about more movement and again, terrific position here with exclusives with 18 of the top 20 here and our customers are starting to feel like this is starting to move. We'll tell you more about this likely at the end of the next quarter, but we're feeling better about the progress here as we enter into 2021. So that's -- those are the professional sides. You didn't ask about the DIY side? But maybe, Al, if I could lean on you for a second here. Why don't we talk about DIY from a company perspective?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Thanks, John. This is Allen Mistysyn. We know DIY demand is a question for -- on everybody's mind moving into next year. Let me try to put some color around it, and try to quantify the increase. If I look at the second in third quarters together, sales this year are just slightly below last year. The combined DIY increase for Consumer Brands and our Americas Group is up 23% and represents about a quarter of our total sales in those quarters. The remaining 75% of the businesses segments are down approximately 6% and are sequentially trending better in the third quarter versus the second quarter. John talked about TAG and our expectations for strong res repaint, new res sales, turn to growth, commercial, property maintenance and then P&M being less of a headwind when in 2021 versus 2020 due to the easier comps. In our Consumer Brands Group, investments and customer programs to drive volume are expected to drive incremental sales growth into next year, but unlikely able to offset a more normal return to DIY demand. And then Performance Coatings Group is seeing strong packaging demand, which is expected to continue in early part of next year, continued improvement in auto refinish, industrial wood, and coil, with general industrial gradually returning to sustainable growth in North America. And Ghansham, it's really the investments we've been making in our programs, our reps, our tools and services to provide solutions to these customers that give us great confidence in our ability to grow those other segments to help offset that DIY potential harder comp next year.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. Thank you. And just for the second question, John, you mentioned that you expect demand to be choppy. That seems reasonable, given what we're seeing. You also have higher raw material costs that seem likely higher operating costs with freight, et cetera, and just cost to serve the customer, just given the omnichannel shift across your TAG store network. In that context, how should we think about pricing, as it relates to an early outlook for 2021? Thanks so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Ghansham. I'd say our response here is going to be pretty consistent with past discussions that we've had, Ghansham. As we look at all costs, the raw material baskets and everything that you laid out there from healthcare to energy, every aspect of the business, we look at that on a 30-day basis, every 30 days with our management team, we evaluate where we are. We make that decision. We immediately then proceed out with any increases that we've decided on, with a goal of talking to our cost customers first. Once we talk to the customers, then we bring it to the financial community. We've not announced any increases now, or we're not out with any right now. And should we, like I said, we'll be out in front of the customer first and then come to you.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. And, Ghansham, we're in the middle of our normal next year operating plan reviews with their divisions. And, as you know, we'll push back on our suppliers. We'll try to internalize and offset as much of the raw material and other increases as we can. And then, absent that, we'll have to look at a price increase.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thanks so much, you guys.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Ghansham.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much.\nJohn Morikis: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi. Good morning. Is DIY growth in the stores business very different than the rate of DIY growth in consumer brands in North America?\nJohn Morikis: No, they're very similar.\nAl Mistysyn: But, Jeff, as you know, DIY and our TAG organization is a much smaller percentage overall.\nJeff Zekauskas: Yeah. And in your Performance Coatings Group, you had very, very good growth in coil, but negative growth in general industrial. What's the difference between those two markets, so that coil is growing and general industrial is down?\nJohn Morikis: So it's the market that we serve, Jeff. If you look at coil, we've had the benefits of appliances, as an example, in coil as the commercial projects have picked up extrusion and some of the applications into the commercial space have been positive. And the other thing I'd say about the coil, give this team great credit. They have been winning business across all regions. So we talk a lot about share of wallet in our TAG business. But if I were to use that kind of description for our coil business, I'd say, they've been doing very well in that space as well. General industrial, if you look at those applications for coatings in our GI space, again, choppy is a good description here. We did have growth, as we talked about in a few of the geographies: Asia, Europe, LatAm, I believe, in local \u2013 in same currency would have been slightly positive. It's mainly the U.S., and it's a choppy market here in the U.S. for GI.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jeff\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. How would you characterize this COVID DIYer is being different from your legacy DIYer? Are they more inclined to buy higher quality paint? And are you \u2013 there's a couple of comments in your earnings release about product mix. And I was just curious whether you're seeing that in terms of whether it's in consumer or it's in TAG, are they buying higher quality paint?\nJohn Morikis: I'd say that we are seeing a positive mix shift, Steve. I would say that there is a difference between these customers. If you look at the DIY customer in a Sherwin store, they're typically looking for that specialty store experience. Al just mentioned, a small percentage of our business, 10%, roughly of our business. The expectations there are just that. They're looking for that specialty store service and expectations in areas that might include color, selection and so on. If you look at the overall, though, what I would say is that our experience this go around is that these are people that are, in general, home, as we've described, nesting, and in many cases, finding themselves looking at a wall that may not have been painted in the next decade. And I think I mentioned on one call that in some of our stores, they've kind of jokingly referred to these as what the heck projects, where they're sitting around, kind of bored out of their minds, and they're saying, 'What the heck. I might as well go ahead and paint this room.' The reason I share that with you is that we've often gotten a question about do we have a concern that we might be leveraging or mortgaging residential repaint customer sales to a DIY customer. We've not seen that. In fact, our residential repaint customers bidding activity is actually increasing not only sequentially but year-over-year. So our customers on the res repaint side are quoting more now this year than they were last year, and they are telling us that the success rate is actually increasing. So we have a DIY customer, who's home. They want a good experience. They are typically moving up and we have a res repaint customers backlog that's growing.\nAl Mistysyn: Steve, the only thing I would add to that is it's really by design in our Consumer Brands segment. The programs that they're putting in place, the training at store level, is really trying to drive to the higher-quality products because that \u2013 as we've talked about customer solutions, that helps them drive their top line and bottom line, and it also helps us drive our top line and bottom line.\nJohn Morikis: And overall, the customer ends up with the best experience. So it helps our brand position with our customers as well.\nSteve Byrne: And so you had what was a 3% same-store sales in TAG. Was that all priced, given there might have been a price/mix lift from this DIY initiative?\nAl Mistysyn: You could \u2013 price would have been a little bit below 2%. The rest is volume. The one thing I would point out, though, Steve, if you look at our North America stores at 3%, as you know, P&M has been a drag. If you backed out P&M, architectural would be up mid-single digits. So I put it in perspective to say if price is a little bit below 2% volume, would be more mid-single digits on architectural.\nSteve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nArun Viswanathan: Great, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the great results. I just wanted to ask about your comment on margins and SG&A. Could you elaborate on maybe some of the increases in SG&A you're expecting in Q4? And then maybe even to next year, do you think you've entered a new gross margin level, just given the volume uplift here and some of the cost reductions you guys have undertaken? Maybe you can just elaborate on some of those issues? Thanks.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Arun, as you know, since we don't go down item by item on the P& L for our guidance, but let me try to give you some color around our fourth quarter in general. First off, we believe we have a pretty strong fourth quarter, with adjusted EPS about 10% increase over \u2013 at the midpoint over a really strong fourth quarter last year that was up over 20%, on top of a 12% increase in the fourth quarter of '18. That tells you our flow-through is in the mid-20% range at the midpoint, while investing back in our business. And let me start by saying what we talked about at the second quarter \u2013 in the second quarter. What we talked about, at FCP is that, these are the investments in products, services, customer programs that provide solutions to our customers, allow them to grow share and be more successful. These are investments in new store and reps. In our e-commerce platform, North American stores, I talked about the consumer brand, investments and expanded customer programs that will allow our customers to sell more of the right gallons through the department, which helps drive their profitability. And then also performance coatings investments in reps, services and programs that add value to our customers, allow them to be more productive. And you talk about what that means going forward. And we believe this cycle is very, very similar to 2008. We continue to invest and lean forward into our customer success and these are the right investments. And the 3, 5, and 10-year compounded average growth rate of our North America architectural sales were high single digits coming out of that period and we believe that was a multiple of our market demand over the same period. So we believe this similar environment. We expect these current investments across all our segments allow us to grow multiple of end market demand over the mid and long term. The only other comment I would make on gross margin, Arun is that, in the fourth quarter, we do expect to see a typical seasonal architectural slowdown in demand, which does impact our gross margin. Historically, our third quarter is a stronger gross margin performance than the fourth quarter. Part of why we had such a strong performance last year here we did see a sequential improvement in our gross margin last year from third quarter to fourth quarter. And as you know, we get to year end, it's a small quarter, we get into inventories, LIFO, a number of adjustments that kind of drove that improved margin in last year.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks for that detail. And then also just wanted to ask about your capital allocation. You spent over $400 million on buybacks in the quarter. So nice to see that. Is that generally how you're going to be running the balance sheet now that, obviously, not building cash? Maybe you could just also discuss the M&A market, if there's any opportunities that you can take advantage of in the near future? Thanks.\nJohn Morikis: Al will talk about capital first, and then I'll talk about M&A.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Let me just highlight the fact we did have bigger amount of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter than normal. I would not read anything into this. We've not changed our capital allocation policy. And to your point, we are not going to hold cash. We'll put that cash to work. And it was really a timing issue at the end of the quarter. We have stronger receipts in the second half of September. The strong teams are generating stronger operating margin and cash flow from outside the U.S. that we're certainly going to keep bringing back to the U.S. and putting to work, but it's just a timing issue there. I think you're right. You look at the strong cash generation, $2.6 billion in the first nine months. We've returned over $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. That's an increase of 86% to last year, and then we've invested $190 million in the form of CapEx. And we also took the opportunity to reduce our debt by just under 400 that got our \u2013 really got our debt to EBITDA leverage back to 2.5. Going forward and looking out into next year, you're going to see the same type of process from us. And I'll let John talk about M&A.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. I'd say, first, Arun. I think it's important to acknowledge that in challenging times, I think you get a sense for how much discipline and conviction you have in your strategy. Things get tough, you can find your way to want to buy a book of business, or let's just buy sales or sales \u2013 that's not who we are. I'm really proud of our teams on an organic basis as well as in the M&A space. We've got a very defined strategy that we're working here. And we're very much determined to stay on that, and that great pride in the fact that our teams are doing just that. Now that said, I'm also very pleased with the progress that we're making in this area. We've got some very good discussions going on and feel good about the targets that we're pursuing. As a reminder, the targets that we pursue largely will be in the industrial space, targets that fill either a technology gap or strength in a region that would help us in accelerating our existing businesses and their goals or in establishing a position in a geography where we're underrepresented. Now that said, our goal is not to be everything to everyone, everywhere. So we talk a lot internally about our rights to win, and how we'll go about this and bring into the market a unique and differentiated value that would help us to create shareholder value. So I'm pleased with the progress, and I think the discussions have gone pretty well here.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, Arun.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nBob Koort: Thank you. John, just curious, to that end, in terms of \u2013 it sounds like mainly you're interested in bolt-ons. In the past, you've talked about maybe optimizing the portfolio. Are there also some assets you might look to invest? Are you pretty comfortable with the portfolio you have at today?\nJohn Morikis: Well, comfort is not a good word here at Sherwin-Williams. We don't like comfort, nor do we like complacency, Bob. I think you know that. So we're constantly reviewing programs, SKUs, brands, businesses. I think we owe that to our shareholders. So I think there's a very disciplined approach that we take. We're very blessed to have four terrific group Presidents that understand that, and lead that. It is not something that Al and I and David are pulling on. I think these are terrific leaders that understand how to make money, how to create shareholder value. So there's a constant review on all levels, from businesses, all the way down to the SKU, including programs. And those programs are sometimes difficult. If you're launching a program, it's your baby, you want to stay close to that. But I think these terrific leaders are demonstrating a willingness to look at every decision and ensure that it's creating value.\nBob Koort: And most of your markets, we sort of come to expect the performance that you delivered. It's been very strong. I'd say, a wide outlier was how well you did in refinish. So can you contextualize this for that? Of a $5 billion sales quarter, how much is auto refinish, and what markets you're in? And how did you capture that market share, that dramatic market share, relative to what the industry was doing? Thanks.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. So thank you, Bob, for that question, because it's an opportunity to talk about a wonderful team here there that's been working really hard. And it's been unfortunate because they've been gaining a lot of ground in the midst of a COVID experience that's not allowed those numbers to shine through. We don't quantify the size of the business itself, but I will tell you that it's been trending positive. To your question, or point, we believe that we're aggressively growing market share here. We think it's a combination of the technology. People have been asking about synergies with Valspar and Sherwin. This is an excellent example of some of those synergies that come through as we've combined the legacy Sherwin technology, along with the legacy Valspar technology, to come up with a system that's been -- well, been understatement to say, that's been well received. It's been terrific. I spent some time with these large customers who have converted many of those shops over to Sherwin. And I'd say it's a combination of the technology as well as the channel model that we have. Our own stores servicing these customers. We have the same mentality through our automotive stores as we do our own architectural stores. And it's working. And it's working aggressively, and it's a bit of a pun, but we plan on putting a lot of gas in this tank.\nJim Jaye: And Bob, this is Jim. What I'd add to that is auto, we saw growth in every region. So it wasn't just one niche there, it was every region that we operate.\nBob Koort: I like the gas on the tank.\nJohn Morikis: All right. Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nP.J. Juvekar:  Yes, good morning.\nJim Jaye: Hi, P.J.\nP.J. Juvekar: Your margins were up almost 600 basis points. Can you roughly break that down between what benefit you got from higher volumes versus lower input costs? And earlier, I think you mentioned the mix effect. Even if it's a rough breakdown, can you just give us an idea how that breaks down?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. P.J., I know you've heard me say this a bunch of times, but it always starts with volume. And I talked about the mid-single-digit volume growth in architectural and TAG, or North America paint stores, where they talk about the high 20%-plus growth in our Consumer Brands Group. And we started seeing a return to sales growth with our Performance Coatings Group. So that's always the biggest driver. We did talk about the favorable product mix, and it was a little bit less than what we saw in the second quarter. As you know, raw materials moderated some. And again, we talked about our third quarter being less of an impact than the second quarter. And then we also had pricing that we had put in earlier this year. So, if you wanted to force rank them, I'd start with volume being over -- well over half of the increase, and then the other three kind of bucket rest of it in fairly similar order or size.\nP.J. Juvekar: Okay. And John, a question for you. I mean, your execution on so far during this pandemic has been excellent. But just in case of scenario planning, if we have another wave of COVID, and it seems like it's already beginning, how do you think about the different businesses? Do you think DIY consumer will continue to be strong? And maybe the contractor recovery is a bit slower? I'm sure you're doing internal planning with all this, so can you just walk us through your -- how you're thinking in your decision entry?\nJohn Morikis: Sure, P.J., you're right, we do a lot of what we call war gaming out. And again, I'll come back to the points that I made earlier about the leadership teams that we have. We don't know exactly how it will unfold. What we are blessed with is a lot of experience, maybe I might refer to it as scar tissue, by teams at all levels that understand and can execute. And if you don't mind, maybe I could just take a second just to talk about why I have so much confidence in our ability to respond to whatever it might be. Because yes, you're right, we have thoughts and ideas of different scenarios. All of them come back to execution, and all of the execution comes back to the people that we have -- the terrific people we have in the field every day. So, if I could just take a second and explain why I feel so bullish about that. I mentioned in our financial community presentation last month, about the fact that our MTP program in our stores was reaching 40 years, and this is 40 years of recruiting outstanding talent, training and developing talent and retaining talent. And so when you ask, why do we have confidence and why we are able to execute? We're recruiting 1,500 college grads annually. That means we've got 10,000 of these college graduates throughout the company right now. When I say throughout the company, I'm not just talking about in TAG, I literally mean throughout the company. These are people that have maybe entered in through TAG. They understand our culture. They understand our strategy. They understand our expectations. They understand our aggressiveness. And that helps us so much. In fact, the fact that people come in through that management training program. In fact, 80% of our reps in our TAG business started their career in a store and that means they understand products, they understand logistics, customer service, everything that we have. And this allows us to promote from within. And so when we look at the leadership team that's responding to what your question is, which is what ifs? Well, we've got 70% of our TAG leadership, they started in these MTP programs. So they've started and they understand everything that we're asking our people and our stores to do. If you can imagine, having 70% of our leadership team have had that experience, and they know what to do. And that 70% then feeds our leadership. And I mentioned, at the financial community presentation, that talent pool continues to push up. We've got 6 group and Division Presidents that were MTPs, 26 Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents, and I was blesses a CEO to come through this. And what all that does is, it provides a clear line of sight to a career path that others can follow, and that helps our retention. And I believe, to answer your question, I think how we're able to do this is, it's the retention of wonderful talented people that have the skills, the resources and drives to be able to win. And I think that's the critical component in our strategy. And we've got a long history of it. And we've also got a long history of very low turnover. In fact, our turnover \u2013 voluntary turnover is around 7% to 8% and that's with nearly 5,000 stores. I don't think there are many companies that could push that out as a statistic, but we're proud of that. And what that then does is it drives the retention of our overall workforce. 7,000 of our employees have more than 20 years of service, and that's about 15% of our full-time employees. We're blessed to have that talent. And I think when you look at then all the way back, starting from the beginning, what does this allow us to do? Well, 80% of our reps in TAG, they have 5 years or more service. They've come through the stores, same with our industrial reps, by the way. But what this all means is we've got wonderful talent that we can retain. They're in a culture where they want to be. And so when this terrific leadership team takes the front and says, follow me, our people follow, and they execute better than anyone. And I'm a proud member and a small part of that because we win on the streets, and I'm really proud of what our teams are doing.\nP.J. Juvekar: Great, fantastic. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Thank you, PJ.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you, good morning. John, just going back to the SG&A investments in Q4, is there any way to quantify what the increase is either versus the prior year or versus Q3 in terms of this increase or this added investment?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, David, we haven't quantified them because we're just trying to tell you what we've done versus tell you what we're going to do. I would kind of frame it this way. In the fourth quarter, you do see seasonal reduction in sales related to architectural. Our typical cadence is our SG&A spending tends to be flat from the third quarter to fourth quarter, if you go back and look at it over a period of time. So you delever a little bit on a sequential basis. It doesn't -- I said we'll potentially delever a little bit year-over-year and not see as much benefit in SG&A as we saw in the third quarter. That's really dependent on -- I gave you a pretty wide sales range because of some of the uncertainties around different segments, general, industrial and some others that we had talked about. So as we see the continued sales momentum into November and December, that will tell me the cadence of what we can put in as investment. So we're trying to do the pedal and clutch, as one of our group presidents likes to talk about. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we're also looking at it from the long term, and that will tell you where SG&A comes in as a percent.\nDavid Begleiter: Very helpful. And now just going back to what you said earlier, are DIY sales up 23% combined in Q2 and Q3 year-over-year?\nJohn Morikis: That would be pretty close. Yes.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks David.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. A couple of questions on the subject of inventory. If I look at your own balance sheet, inventories decline\u2019s about 8% year-over-year in the third quarter, despite sales growth. And I suspect that many of your customers have been trying to manage for cash and liberate working capital as well. And so in that context, I'm wondering, do you expect to run assets harder than normal over the winter? And would you expect your customers to do the same, such that we might see a slightly different seasonal pattern through the first quarter of 2020, 2021 relative to normal?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Kevin, to your first point, you're right. With the impressive DIY demand we've seen, we've been not building inventory as much as just maintaining our -- keeping up with the sales out the door. We absolutely are going to run our supply chain harder this fourth quarter and going into the first quarter to build inventory ahead of the spring selling season. As far as how we work with our customers, we want to make sure we're building the right products and getting to them at the right time. We don't think it's about just loading up inventory at store level, whether it's our stores or our architectural and consumer customers, but we're working with them. And it's going to also depend on what the trend that we see in DIY demand out of -- coming into the winter here in November or December and the early part of next year, and then ramping up to the spring. So that's going to be a constant. And I would tell you, we are working with our customers on a daily, weekly, monthly basis to make sure we're getting them the right products that they need.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Kevin, I'd echo the point, and I'd like to just emphasize as we look, particularly on the consumer side. Heidi Petz and her team are working closely with each of those customers. We're going to drive inventory to support those customers. And if it means putting a little more in working capital, we'll do that, but we're going to serve those customers.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Kevin, I guess I'd be remiss if I didn't say on the other side, where we've been under a little bit of pressure on the Performance Coatings side. I think that team has done a really, really nice job controlling inventory, so we didn't build the wrong inventory. And they've got a lot of different programs in place to try to drive complexity out of that supply chain, whether it's SKU rationalizations, platform consolidations. And I give that team a lot of credit for maintaining a disciplined approach to inventory, whereas on the DIY side, we're just full out. We're making as much as we can possibly make.\nKevin McCarthy: That's really helpful. And then, as a second question for Jim, perhaps. I was curious about raw materials. You referenced some recent cost inflation probably since June is my guess. But just curious, if we flat line raw materials from October, what do you think that would say for the basket in 2021 versus 2020?\nJim Jaye: Yes, Kevin, what I would tell you in \u2013 just based on our commentary that we gave in our prepared remarks, I mean, third quarter was down a mid-single-digit range. And the third quarter was mainly driven, again, by lower costs on resins, monomer, solvents. Going into our fourth quarter, we think we're still going to see a benefit year-over-year, but maybe not as much. We've seen some sequential tick up in some of the feedstocks, propylene has ticked up here, ethylene has ticked up even HDPE on the packaging side has ticked up. So we're seeing that. I think we start to think about 2021. It's probably a little bit early to be thinking about 2021. We'll give you that view in January as we typically do. But again, what I would say from a directional perspective is a couple of things. We're seeing sequential increases. Certainly, we've seen a rise in oil prices, which are putting pressure on some of those feedstocks, they're not always totally connected, but there is some pressure there. We've seen the upstream capacity from refineries, crackers, PDH units, they're managing tighter through this pandemic. So we're seeing some tighter supply demand and scenarios there. And demand is picking up. So all of those could be factors that we're looking at. On the TiO2 side, again, we're watching that closely as well heading into next year. And it's all about, I think, what demand is going to do. To this point, North America and chloride been pretty stable. Chinese TiO2 players have been out with some increases here recently. So a lot of moving parts there, but still a benefit in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we just don't have a lot of clarity yet.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJim Jaye: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Andrews: Thanks very much. A quick one on interior paint, are you noticing any regional trends, whether it's a state level or just a section of the country level as it relates to interior, just thinking in terms of COVID virus trends, or is there any sort of differences between how fast interior is coming back to which part of the country you look at?\nJohn Morikis: Not really, Vincent. I'd say it was a bit slower in some of the more urban areas, but we are starting to see some pickup in those areas as well. So I can't just \u2013 I can't explain it. If people are just getting tired enough to the point where they're saying just come on in, or they're leaving, or what's happening, but we are \u2013 it's pretty well even across the country.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. And then just one last question on your cost side of the equation. In the stores, now that we're a few quarters into this, has it become apparent that you have higher costs associated with servicing customers because of COVID that you might need to recover next year, or is that not the case?\nJohn Morikis: Not the case.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Vincent.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you and good morning, everyone. If we could go back to the consumer brands and, in particular, for the DIY business. Can you talk about the margins and growth expectations when DIY slows down to a more normal environment post-COVID? And can you give us an idea as to how much you lowered the breakeven point when you look at what you did this year versus nine months versus last year?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah, Rosemarie. I would say, our expectations don't get any easier. We're expecting that the investments we're making in the programs across each of the customers are going to drive continued volume. And that could be on DIY. It could be on the Pro. We expect that, like we've done over this past year, is really focused on where we're not performing as well as we could be. And we talked about the improvements we've made in our international businesses. And just to kind of put that in perspective, I mean, our international sales for the quarter were up 26%. And flow-through is over 65%. So we're seeing the benefits of those actions as well as we had talked about the favorable product mix, and part of that was exiting the ACE private label business. We're looking at our cost structure on how we support that field organization and making those changes as we need to. So I wouldn't say, just because DIY slows, we should automatically expect to see our margins contract back to prior year levels. I think the high-teens to low 20s that we talked about. As you know, when we set a new high watermark, that is the new target, and we'll talk about what we expect on those operating margins going forward in the future here.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And. following up on that, is there a difference? And I know you cannot talk about customers specifically, but nevertheless, is there a difference between the profitability level at the Lowe's versus all of the other smaller type of retail?\nJohn Morikis: You're exactly right, Rosemarie. We're not going to talk about that.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Well, I said, I would try.\nJohn Morikis: You can repeat the question now.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And then looking at the interest expense level, just quickly, is that 83.3 million, a new level, or should we expect it to go down because of the timing of your debt repayment?\nAl Mistysyn: I'm sorry, Rosemarie, I lost the first half of that question.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Interest expense declined to $83.3 million in the third quarter. Is that a new level, or is it going to decline some more, depending on when we paid $400 million in this quarter?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah, it's probably a good estimate going forward. We're looking at some things with next year and even into the 2022 tranches to do something with. But I think that's a good level right now.\nRosemarie Morbelli: And at 2.5 times net leverage, it sounded based on previous comments that debt reduction is no longer a priority?\nAl Mistysyn: I would agree with that. We talked about not really looking to reduce debt coming into this year. But based on the circumstances, and what was happening, I thought it was prudent to take it down. So \u2013 but yeah, you are absolutely correct.\nRosemarie Morbelli: All right. Thank you.\nJim Jaye: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Harrison: Hi. Good morning.\nJim Jaye: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Harrison: I was wondering if you can talk about what you're seeing in the independent peak dealer channel within consumer? Are they seeing as robust of a DIY pickup as you guys have? I guess the question I'm trying to get to is, are they maintaining share, or are they continuing to see migration toward maybe your stores or other company-own stores as well as big box retailers?\nJohn Morikis: Hi, Mike, as you know, we don't get POS data from those independence. We do believe though that third quarter was strong across most of the independent dealers. It's an environment where they're probably doing pretty well. Hard to say that they're gaining or losing share right now, real time, but I would say that they are likely benefiting to some degree from the same nesting issue that most people in the paint business are in urgency right now as it relates to DIY.\nAl Mistysyn: I think, Mike, on the long-term, though, I think this channel will likely continue to lose share. The Pro DIY shift continues because we do believe it will go back. I know it's shifted a little bit to do-it-yourself in this cycle. But longer term, we expect this shift to go back to do-it-for-me, and the continued market share gains that we see in the home centers.\nMike Harrison: All right. And then in terms of the packaging business, your results there, that seems to be another area where you're doing quite a bit better than the underlying market or where some of your competitors are it sounds like beverage can demand is really strong. Is that an area where you have relatively higher share? Can you maybe talk about differences in your mix that might be contributing to the strength in that packaging business?\nJohn Morikis: Mike, I would tell you that is an area of strength for us. But I would tell you, as it relates to packaging, we've got a terrific team there that's doing a wonderful job as well as wonderful technology. I think we're growing share pretty aggressively in both food and beverage. And we expect that to continue.\nMike Harrison: All right. Thanks very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn McNulty: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. So you made some compelling comments earlier in the Q&A around, I guess, you kind of called them, easy comps. And so it kind of sets the Stage 4 for what should be volume growth next year. I guess, with that in mind and the fact that volumes tend to be the biggest drivers of your margins, should we be assuming that there's room for updraft in the margins as we look to 2021, or are there some offtakes that we need to be considering, whether it's raw materials or temporary cost rollbacks or mix or what have you that maybe hampers that a little bit? How should we be thinking about that?\nJohn Morikis: Hey, John, I'm going to have Al answer that, but I want to make sure that I correct it. We never said, easy comps, we said, favorable comps.\nJohn McNulty: A fair point, a fair point.\nJohn Morikis: In that entire TAG leadership team down there, having their chests suggesting that nothing is easy down there. They're doing want to acknowledge that and say that they're favorable, not easy. Now, Al, you could answer that.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah, John. We do expect to see a more normal demand environment as we go into next year. Some of the favorableness we saw in the two quarters that I talked about on favorable customer and product mix, some of the strength in DIY and volume that we're starting to see on performance coatings. So as a company, our mix of businesses is going to get to a more normal level is some of these businesses where we have opportunities start coming back. That being said, I mean, we're going through our planning process. We're going to continue to look at driving or operating margin leverage. And that's going to come from continued expansion in the gross margin and continued leverage on SG&A. And depending on what we see from a raw material environment, from a pricing environment, from a -- that will kind of tell me what we can continue to invest in or where we have to get more leverage on SG&A. But we're not that far along in that process yet. And as we have typically done, we'll come back to you at the end of the year with our 2021 guidance to give you more color around that.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Fair enough. And I appreciate the color. And then the other question would just be on the capital deployment side. When you look at the M&A pipeline that you see right now, would you say the bid asks have started to narrow at this point or are they still relatively widen? And you kind of need to see things kind of further shrink down on that before pulling the trigger? How should we be thinking about that?\nJohn Morikis: John, I'd say they're beginning to narrow down. We're feeling as though some of what's happening in the marketplace right now as people looking hard at the mirror and asking how much further and how much harder they want to run. And others that are saying, I want to be a little more realistic. So, I'd say that the gap is narrowed.\nJohn McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the color.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. Got two questions. Just on the pricing, has there been any pricing in Performance Coatings, especially considered in that there's a capacity increase that's now coming? And then I have a follow-up.\nJohn Morikis: On a targeted basis, there has been, Greg.\nGreg Melich: Okay. Could we say that overall that there was some help to the top line in Performance Coatings year-over-year?\nJohn Morikis: Yes.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Greg, I think the way I would look at that is because Performance Coatings businesses are so diverse and product quantities and the like, I mean, if you take FX out of it, in currency neutral, it'd be up 2.6. You probably could split that evenly between price and mix, because mix plays a part there and volume.\nGreg Melich: Got it. Thanks for that. And then on capital allocation, I just want to make sure I'm getting the pieces right here. Thanks for reminding us of how you're doing it with the dividends and the buybacks. CapEx, once you start working on the new headquarters and the R&D center and everything, should we expect that to go up to sort of sort of $400 million? I'm just trying to figure out, if the cash from ops are $2.5 billion that the balance sheet is de-levered?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Greg, we're going to have probably a couple -- two years here, where the facility projects are going to take us up over -- certainly, over $400 million. Depending on timing and where we're at in that construction process, it could approach $500 million for a year. So, it will be up about 2% for a couple of years. But long-term, we'll still trend it back below 2%.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then it sounds like this $400 million run rate for the buyback then could become a run rate, not just a quarter?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Greg, you look at $600 million, we had sitting on our balance sheet in the third quarter. I do expect to have, again, strong cash generation here in the fourth quarter and we'll use that excess cash to buy back stock.\nGreg Melich: That's great. Good luck everyone.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDuffy Fischer: Yes, good morning. Just question on China, because it's recovered much faster than other geographies, it's not a huge business for you. But can you go through kind of the end markets in coatings there? And how you see those coming out of this dip? And then second follow on to that would be, is China a fruitful area to look for M&A for you guys now that you've got more expertise there with the Valspar acquisition?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Duffy, I'd say that if you look at our Performance Coatings business, 5 of the -- actually, all 6 of the industrial businesses, 5 of the businesses were positive in the third quarter in Asia. We feel there's some good momentum there. And our ability to bring solutions to those customers, we think, helps to differentiate us. So yes, we expect that to continue to grow. I'll add in the architectural piece as well, although I don't know that you were asking that as much as maybe the industrial side. But we've got, I think a terrific opportunity long-term there. So we're doing some work there and some, we believe, good groundwork that will help generations down the road, not next quarter, as we establish the brand and channel for the architectural side. But if you look at our industrial businesses there, they're all pretty strong. And as far as M&A in that market, yes, we're interested in the right businesses there that could help to accelerate our strategy. Again, I'll go back to the very disciplined approach that we take here, which is not just buying a book of business, but something that brings value to our shareholders. We find the right targets in there that can help us, yes, we'd be interested.\nDuffy Fischer: Terrific. Thank you, guys.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Duffy.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Parkinson: Good morning guys. So just taking a step back from COVID factors. How should investors think about the key long-term growth pillars in PC? I assume packaging is just one area of growth enthusiasm, given your consistent outperformance already. But how should we think about the other substrates and your positioning in order to outgrow the respective end markets? So just trying to get a sense of your normalized PC growth algorithm? Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Chris, we do believe that we're growing faster than market right now. And you're right, packaging from a technical standpoint, approval process standpoint, nearly every aspect of packaging is pointing in our direction. So we're feeling really good about that. We talked about coil and the process that we've been going through and new wins or share of wallet, as we like to say, and we expect that to continue to grow. And so our expectations of that team are very high as well. I'd say, we didn't really talk all about it in great depth, but we're really proud of the industrial wood business and the performance. It wasn't long ago, that business was something like made your head hurt. But I'd say it's moving in the right direction here pretty aggressively, and that team is really demonstrating the fact that they've got their hands around this business moving in the right direction and got the lot of confidence, particularly when you look as I mentioned in the prepared remarks about the new residential business and the linkage between that industrial wood business and the growth there in industrial wood. Auto, we talked about the positioning that we've had and how we're growing there already, and it's just not been as visible as we would like because of we're only about 75% back on the road. So we often say, we don't want to be ambulance chasers, but the more roads on \u2013 the more cars on the road, the more refinished business there's going to be. And so we're feeling really good about this. Next, then come to areas GI that we've talked about. We love our position here. And to your point, or the question earlier, I believe, I think, Greg or Duffy asked about, our Asia position with leadership? And we look at that Valspar leadership that came with that acquisition. And we've often referred to that as the greatest infusion of talent in the company's history. And so when we look at the auto business and GI, we look at terrific technology and talent that has come here. And we expect to help \u2013 that to help up our business in this GI business. Aaron Erter, our Group President of this business, is really doing a wonderful job in a very challenging market, and we've got confidence that each one of these are going to drive. We talked earlier in the life cycle of this acquisition, about our goal to drive the operating margins here in the high teens, low 20s, and we have every bit of expectation and confidence that we're going to do that.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Chris, I'd just add to that point. I mean, you look at our third quarter small sales increase of 1.2% and a 110-point operating margin improvement. That just goes \u2013 and I got to highlight the team and give them credit, that goes to all the hard work. They've been putting in even the second half of last year as we saw things starting to slow outside of the U.S., they've done a really nice job of working on reducing complexity, reducing SKUs, improving their operations so that when they do get volume, they'll get more leverage on that volume coming out of this pandemic than when we went into it.\nChris Parkinson: Very helpful. And just the follow-up would be, when we're sitting back and thinking about DIY trends, just drilling down a little bit more, can you just comment on the end market demand for stains and sealants versus interior paints? It seems the former, on the demand front, was very strong and you had to rise to the challenge in terms of reduction. But if we're parsing that out next year, are there any major considerations on the best way to think about that as we head into 2021? Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: I think, Chris, it goes back to the DIY comment that I talked about the stain and sealants are in there, and it's part of that 25%. That's up \u2013 25% of our company, that's up over 20%. And I still think we have such great opportunities in the other 75% of our company to offset any declines in DIY that we see next year.\nJohn Morikis: We do. And we also have most powerful brands in those areas to build on as well. And a wonderful team that understands that, that we'll execute on that. So I think we will kind of be approaching this from both sides aggressively.\nChris Parkinson: Thank you very much.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Chris\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Bellinger: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. So first on the Consumer Brands segment, you characterized DIY demand is elevated throughout the entire quarter. Can you walk us through what you were seeing towards the end of Q3? Was that business strengthening further, even as you move into a typically lower volume Q4 period from a seasonality standpoint?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. David, it's pretty flat. I mean, if you look at it on a same-day basis, it's pretty flat throughout the quarter.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. Okay. And then just a follow up on an early earlier comment around the --?\nJohn Morikis: About what? I'm sorry?\nDavid Bellinger: The Pro business and the Pro contractor business. Can you just give us an update there in terms of project backlog and bids? Is there any way to quantify that trend? And you also mentioned an uptick in the sales of spray equipment. What has that told you about the business historically? And how long do the sales typically track higher after those type of purchases?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, I would say that we have seen and heard from our customers that the backlog has grown on the part of our contractors. That's evidenced by the fact that they are busy more and have more customers now allowing them in their homes, but still a long list of people that are hopeful that the projects would be coming in soon. I think some pace of that is going to increase with more allowing people in as they're going to be spending more time perhaps in their homes, preparing for the holidays, whatever it might be. So, I'd say that the backlog is good, strong and growing on the part of our residential repaying customers. So, as it relates to the spray equipment, I'd rather not give you any specifics on how long or what that means from a timing perspective. I will tell you that we see a direct correlation between the confidence of the spray equipment sales and the mentality of the contractor has before making that purchase. So, when they're plucking out a couple of thousand dollars or so on a piece of equipment, they're betting that these projects that they have coming up will allow them to pay for them. So, it's a good precursor for what's down the road.\nDavid Bellinger: That's fair. Appreciate the color here. Thanks guys.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nGarik Shmois: Hi thanks. Just a follow-up on the discussion of favorable comps in certain parts of TAG, thinking about commercial and property management, in particular, can these verticals be positive next year, just given some of the green shoots you're seeing right now?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Very much. So we're excited about this. Yes. I mean, these are -- I use the term I was thoughtful in using that term favorable comps. Yes. You got commercial down low single-digits, property maintenance, mid-single-digits here in the quarter, and we have a wonderful position here, great people, great products, great relationships. Yes. We're going to -- yes. The answer is yes.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Thanks. A follow-up question is just going back to a comment in the prepared remarks. If there's an infrastructure bill, say, in the first half of next year, how quickly could your wastewater business with Protective & Marine see the benefit?\nJohn Morikis: Well, so you're talking about how long before a bill is passed and paint is applied? I mean, it would vary, obviously, by project. But I'd say you could see that in a quarter or so, likely. That's a guess on my part. I'd say our position there is very strong, particularly on water and wastewater. It's been a good position and growing for us. But I'd say when you look at general \u2013 or I'm sorry, the protective and marine, and the contractors that typically do that type of work, those are typically areas that we do very well with. So as soon as it hits the Street, we would be right on top of that.\nGarik Shmois: Great. Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Garik.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Is there an opportunity to further optimize your store's footprint, given all the changes going on in the commercial real estate market, malls closing down and so forth? I'm sure not all of your stores are in the most optimum location?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah, John, we look at that on a regular basis. And the opportunity for us as markets turns, change and develop. And so the beauty of our approach is how we structure those decisions are as close to the customer as possible with support. So those decisions and opportunities are something that we leverage figuratively.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah, John, and I would just say, we have taken the opportunity to do that. We've closed. And when I say closed, it's a lease expiration that we then moved to a different location, about 16 stores in the U.S. and Canada. We did about six last year. So a little bit stronger pace this year than last year. But like John said, it's a regular process for us.\nJohn Roberts: All right. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Bosshard: Can you break out at all, within the pro business, the difference between interior and exterior growth on the res repaint side? I know that 4Q and 1Q are bigger interior quarters. Just trying to see what the momentum and the growth profile looks like between interior relative to exterior?\nJohn Morikis: Now, Eric, I would tell you that we've spoken about the double-digit growth that we've seen in exterior, the very strong high single-digit growth in interior. Obviously, the interior paint market is much larger than the exterior, but we're not going to provide any more detail on our sales of those products and help you understand that.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Eric, I think what I talked about in the -- either the second quarter, or at FCP, was the fact that in the out quarters are interior to exterior ratio is four to one, on the interior -- on the two biggest quarters, it's three to one. So it was a little bit less than that in our third quarter just because of the strength of exterior.\nEric Bosshard: And then the momentum within interior, is that stable, or is that month-to-month improving? And it couldn't even be anecdotal, John, I understand sort of detail of this, but just trying to get a sense on the comfort of consumers and pros getting more active interior?\nJohn Morikis: Eric, I'd say that it is an area of comfort and confidence that we have. It's moving. And as I mentioned earlier, it's, for the most part across the country, and for the most part, nearly all of our residential repaint customers. You'll hear some pockets of concern. But for the most part, I'd say there's a strong excitement inside our building about the interior growth.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin Hocevar: Everybody on the -- looking at Consumer Brands businesses, the Australia business, in particular. If we rerouted the clock, about year ago, this was an area of disappointment. But here we are, sales are growing strong double digits. I think you guys said total international up 26%. I don't know exactly what Australia is in there, but you guys said double digits. So curious it seems things have turned around. I'm curious how much of this is the product of the environment that everything is doing well versus the actions that you guys have taken to really improve the business? Curious of the progress that we've seen there?\nJohn Morikis: I'd say it's a little bit of both, Kevin. I'd say we've got a terrific leader. Brian Patton has done a very nice job of running all of those industrial -- I'm sorry, the international architectural businesses for us. This business, as you mentioned, delivered double-digit growth and it improved its profitability. And we think that we've definitely seen an increased effort to develop the right platform channels for distribution through our team. They've done a nice job of taking out costs and the actions associated with that are not always easy or fun, but this team did a really, really nice job of taking the right steps and right actions and a double-digit growth with reduced expenses, and you start to see an improved bottom line.\nKevin Hocevar: And then in terms of the guidance for the performance segment in the fourth quarter of sales being flat, plus or minus low single digits, it seems like -- it seems to imply that we kind of stall from what we saw in the third quarter, but it seems like momentum is building in all the different subsegments within the segment. It looks like the comps are a little bit easier in the fourth quarter. And I would think that FX would be better sequentially. So that all seems to add up to some acceleration, but it seems like the guidance implies kind of similar results in 4Q versus 3Q? So curious your thoughts there.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Kevin. I think one of the comments we made on GI is this an inventory build. Or are we going to be able to see sell-through on that inventory? And so -- and there's momentum. But outside some of these markets and some of these businesses, there's still choppiness that we're accounting for.\nJohn Morikis: I think yes, sequentially, we've seen improvement in -- the other thing they like to build on Al's point, even in these challenging times, the 5 global business units that sit in PCG all grew in all regions. So I mean, there's some pretty good momentum that we have coming along here.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. Thank you very much.\nA \u2013 Al Mistysyn: Thank you Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Speer: Hey good afternoon. Thanks guys. I just had a couple of questions, one being the SG&A side of the ledger. And I apologize if this has already been addressed. But on the Analyst Day, you mentioned you're making incremental growth investments in the fourth quarter, and you weren't going to see as much leverage there. Maybe -- can you articulate maybe how much margin headwind is expected from that investment? Maybe can you speak to the nature of those growth investments? And maybe how we should think about that going forward as you make those important growth -- continue to invest in your business?\nA \u2013 Al Mistysyn: Yes. Justin, what I try to say is, we haven't laid out the amounts that we're investing. Some of them get into very specific customers, others we'd rather tell you what we've done versus what we're going to do. But part of the leverage will depend on the cadence of how we put in new stores and reps across each of our segments, how much in the e-commerce platform are investing relative to what our volume looks like in the fourth quarter. If we're at the higher end of the volume, we may be able to get more investments in, and still see an improvement and get SG&A leverage year-over-year. If we're at the lower end of that volume range, we're probably not going to see leverage on SG&A, because I think it's important that we stay the course. We're taking a disciplined approach to it. We know it's the right thing to do long term. I'm not trying to get to a perfect quarter in the fourth quarter. But, we're managing it as we go through the quarter.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. And Justin, it sounds like you mentioned that you may have missed the earlier response. I think it's important to build on the point Al made earlier, which is \u2013 this is very similar to the 2008 run that we experienced. We've got a long-tenured leadership here at Sherwin. It's been through many of these movies here before. And we know how to invest. While it hits the SG&A line. I would tell you, Al and the other control \u2013 the group controllers that work with Al, there's a very disciplined approach in this. So this is not money that we look at spending, these are investments. A very high level of discipline and expectations come along with those investments.\nJustin Speer: Makes a lot of sense. I\u2019ll just leave it there. Appreciate your time and attention. Thank you, guys.\nJim Jaye: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Really appreciate your interest there entire leadership team. I hope you feel came through, we're very confident very optimistic about our fourth quarter prospects and where we're heading into 2021. I will be available along with my colleague Eric Swanson for your follow-ups today and the rest of the week. And please, contact Natalie Darr to get in the queue. So thanks again for your interest. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect your line lines at this time.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Al Mistysyn",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, John. This is Allen Mistysyn. We know DIY demand is a question for -- on everybody's mind moving into next year. Let me try to put some color around it, and try to quantify the increase. If I look at the second in third quarters together, sales this year are just slightly below last year. The combined DIY increase for Consumer Brands and our Americas Group is up 23% and represents about a quarter of our total sales in those quarters. The remaining 75% of the businesses segments are down approximately 6% and are sequentially trending better in the third quarter versus the second quarter. John talked about TAG and our expectations for strong res repaint, new res sales, turn to growth, commercial, property maintenance and then P&M being less of a headwind when in 2021 versus 2020 due to the easier comps. In our Consumer Brands Group, investments and customer programs to drive volume are expected to drive incremental sales growth into next year, but unlikely able to offset a more normal return to DIY demand. And then Performance Coatings Group is seeing strong packaging demand, which is expected to continue in early part of next year, continued improvement in auto refinish, industrial wood, and coil, with general industrial gradually returning to sustainable growth in North America. And Ghansham, it's really the investments we've been making in our programs, our reps, our tools and services to provide solutions to these customers that give us great confidence in our ability to grow those other segments to help offset that DIY potential harder comp next year. Yeah. And, Ghansham, we're in the middle of our normal next year operating plan reviews with their divisions. And, as you know, we'll push back on our suppliers. We'll try to internalize and offset as much of the raw material and other increases as we can. And then, absent that, we'll have to look at a price increase. But, Jeff, as you know, DIY and our TAG organization is a much smaller percentage overall. Steve, the only thing I would add to that is it's really by design in our Consumer Brands segment. The programs that they're putting in place, the training at store level, is really trying to drive to the higher-quality products because that \u2013 as we've talked about customer solutions, that helps them drive their top line and bottom line, and it also helps us drive our top line and bottom line. You could \u2013 price would have been a little bit below 2%. The rest is volume. The one thing I would point out, though, Steve, if you look at our North America stores at 3%, as you know, P&M has been a drag. If you backed out P&M, architectural would be up mid-single digits. So I put it in perspective to say if price is a little bit below 2% volume, would be more mid-single digits on architectural. Thank you, Steve. Yes, Arun, as you know, since we don't go down item by item on the P& L for our guidance, but let me try to give you some color around our fourth quarter in general. First off, we believe we have a pretty strong fourth quarter, with adjusted EPS about 10% increase over \u2013 at the midpoint over a really strong fourth quarter last year that was up over 20%, on top of a 12% increase in the fourth quarter of '18. That tells you our flow-through is in the mid-20% range at the midpoint, while investing back in our business. And let me start by saying what we talked about at the second quarter \u2013 in the second quarter. What we talked about, at FCP is that, these are the investments in products, services, customer programs that provide solutions to our customers, allow them to grow share and be more successful. These are investments in new store and reps. In our e-commerce platform, North American stores, I talked about the consumer brand, investments and expanded customer programs that will allow our customers to sell more of the right gallons through the department, which helps drive their profitability. And then also performance coatings investments in reps, services and programs that add value to our customers, allow them to be more productive. And you talk about what that means going forward. And we believe this cycle is very, very similar to 2008. We continue to invest and lean forward into our customer success and these are the right investments. And the 3, 5, and 10-year compounded average growth rate of our North America architectural sales were high single digits coming out of that period and we believe that was a multiple of our market demand over the same period. So we believe this similar environment. We expect these current investments across all our segments allow us to grow multiple of end market demand over the mid and long term. The only other comment I would make on gross margin, Arun is that, in the fourth quarter, we do expect to see a typical seasonal architectural slowdown in demand, which does impact our gross margin. Historically, our third quarter is a stronger gross margin performance than the fourth quarter. Part of why we had such a strong performance last year here we did see a sequential improvement in our gross margin last year from third quarter to fourth quarter. And as you know, we get to year end, it's a small quarter, we get into inventories, LIFO, a number of adjustments that kind of drove that improved margin in last year. Yeah. Let me just highlight the fact we did have bigger amount of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter than normal. I would not read anything into this. We've not changed our capital allocation policy. And to your point, we are not going to hold cash. We'll put that cash to work. And it was really a timing issue at the end of the quarter. We have stronger receipts in the second half of September. The strong teams are generating stronger operating margin and cash flow from outside the U.S. that we're certainly going to keep bringing back to the U.S. and putting to work, but it's just a timing issue there. I think you're right. You look at the strong cash generation, $2.6 billion in the first nine months. We've returned over $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. That's an increase of 86% to last year, and then we've invested $190 million in the form of CapEx. And we also took the opportunity to reduce our debt by just under 400 that got our \u2013 really got our debt to EBITDA leverage back to 2.5. Going forward and looking out into next year, you're going to see the same type of process from us. And I'll let John talk about M&A. Yeah. P.J., I know you've heard me say this a bunch of times, but it always starts with volume. And I talked about the mid-single-digit volume growth in architectural and TAG, or North America paint stores, where they talk about the high 20%-plus growth in our Consumer Brands Group. And we started seeing a return to sales growth with our Performance Coatings Group. So that's always the biggest driver. We did talk about the favorable product mix, and it was a little bit less than what we saw in the second quarter. As you know, raw materials moderated some. And again, we talked about our third quarter being less of an impact than the second quarter. And then we also had pricing that we had put in earlier this year. So, if you wanted to force rank them, I'd start with volume being over -- well over half of the increase, and then the other three kind of bucket rest of it in fairly similar order or size. Thank you, PJ. Yes, Kevin, I'd echo the point, and I'd like to just emphasize as we look, particularly on the consumer side. Heidi Petz and her team are working closely with each of those customers. We're going to drive inventory to support those customers. And if it means putting a little more in working capital, we'll do that, but we're going to serve those customers. Yeah, Rosemarie. I would say, our expectations don't get any easier. We're expecting that the investments we're making in the programs across each of the customers are going to drive continued volume. And that could be on DIY. It could be on the Pro. We expect that, like we've done over this past year, is really focused on where we're not performing as well as we could be. And we talked about the improvements we've made in our international businesses. And just to kind of put that in perspective, I mean, our international sales for the quarter were up 26%. And flow-through is over 65%. So we're seeing the benefits of those actions as well as we had talked about the favorable product mix, and part of that was exiting the ACE private label business. We're looking at our cost structure on how we support that field organization and making those changes as we need to. So I wouldn't say, just because DIY slows, we should automatically expect to see our margins contract back to prior year levels. I think the high-teens to low 20s that we talked about. As you know, when we set a new high watermark, that is the new target, and we'll talk about what we expect on those operating margins going forward in the future here. I'm sorry, Rosemarie, I lost the first half of that question. Yeah, it's probably a good estimate going forward. We're looking at some things with next year and even into the 2022 tranches to do something with. But I think that's a good level right now. I would agree with that. We talked about not really looking to reduce debt coming into this year. But based on the circumstances, and what was happening, I thought it was prudent to take it down. So \u2013 but yeah, you are absolutely correct. I think, Mike, on the long-term, though, I think this channel will likely continue to lose share. The Pro DIY shift continues because we do believe it will go back. I know it's shifted a little bit to do-it-yourself in this cycle. But longer term, we expect this shift to go back to do-it-for-me, and the continued market share gains that we see in the home centers. Yeah, John. We do expect to see a more normal demand environment as we go into next year. Some of the favorableness we saw in the two quarters that I talked about on favorable customer and product mix, some of the strength in DIY and volume that we're starting to see on performance coatings. So as a company, our mix of businesses is going to get to a more normal level is some of these businesses where we have opportunities start coming back. That being said, I mean, we're going through our planning process. We're going to continue to look at driving or operating margin leverage. And that's going to come from continued expansion in the gross margin and continued leverage on SG&A. And depending on what we see from a raw material environment, from a pricing environment, from a -- that will kind of tell me what we can continue to invest in or where we have to get more leverage on SG&A. But we're not that far along in that process yet. And as we have typically done, we'll come back to you at the end of the year with our 2021 guidance to give you more color around that. Yes, Greg, I think the way I would look at that is because Performance Coatings businesses are so diverse and product quantities and the like, I mean, if you take FX out of it, in currency neutral, it'd be up 2.6. You probably could split that evenly between price and mix, because mix plays a part there and volume. Yes, Greg, we're going to have probably a couple -- two years here, where the facility projects are going to take us up over -- certainly, over $400 million. Depending on timing and where we're at in that construction process, it could approach $500 million for a year. So, it will be up about 2% for a couple of years. But long-term, we'll still trend it back below 2%. Yes, Greg, you look at $600 million, we had sitting on our balance sheet in the third quarter. I do expect to have, again, strong cash generation here in the fourth quarter and we'll use that excess cash to buy back stock. Yes. Chris, I'd just add to that point. I mean, you look at our third quarter small sales increase of 1.2% and a 110-point operating margin improvement. That just goes \u2013 and I got to highlight the team and give them credit, that goes to all the hard work. They've been putting in even the second half of last year as we saw things starting to slow outside of the U.S., they've done a really nice job of working on reducing complexity, reducing SKUs, improving their operations so that when they do get volume, they'll get more leverage on that volume coming out of this pandemic than when we went into it. I think, Chris, it goes back to the DIY comment that I talked about the stain and sealants are in there, and it's part of that 25%. That's up \u2013 25% of our company, that's up over 20%. And I still think we have such great opportunities in the other 75% of our company to offset any declines in DIY that we see next year. Thanks, Chris Yeah, John, and I would just say, we have taken the opportunity to do that. We've closed. And when I say closed, it's a lease expiration that we then moved to a different location, about 16 stores in the U.S. and Canada. We did about six last year. So a little bit stronger pace this year than last year. But like John said, it's a regular process for us. Yeah. Eric, I think what I talked about in the -- either the second quarter, or at FCP, was the fact that in the out quarters are interior to exterior ratio is four to one, on the interior -- on the two biggest quarters, it's three to one. So it was a little bit less than that in our third quarter just because of the strength of exterior. Thanks, Eric. Yes, Kevin. I think one of the comments we made on GI is this an inventory build. Or are we going to be able to see sell-through on that inventory? And so -- and there's momentum. But outside some of these markets and some of these businesses, there's still choppiness that we're accounting for."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Let me begin by expressing my appreciation to the over 61,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams for their continued determination and their resilience. I could not be more proud of this incredible team as they delivered record results in a very challenging environment. Our leadership team and their many years of collective experience have been true differentiators throughout this entire year, enabling us to drive significant improvement across many measures, while serving our customers at a very high level. We generated very solid sales growth in the quarter, with all three operating segments growing year-over-year, exceeding the original guidance we provided at the end of July and improving sequentially. The gross margin expansion in the quarter was driven by sales growth, effective pricing, favorable mix, and lower input costs. The industry basket of raw materials was down by a mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter compared to the prior year, though a bit less than what we saw in the second quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales in the quarter decreased slightly year-over-year to 27.5%. SG&A increased on a dollar basis as we continue to make investments to drive long-term growth. Let me talk a bit more about trends we're seeing in each of our segments before moving on to our outlook. In the Americas Group, we saw a significant sequential improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter in all regions and all segments served. Most regions and segments also delivered growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We're especially encouraged by the return of double-digit growth in residential repaint, our largest segment. Interior work has picked up significantly. As a reminder, this segment has been our fastest growing over the last several years and continues to offer us the largest opportunity for share gain. Sales in new residential also gained momentum in the quarter, and were up by mid-single-digits. Our DIY business delivered the biggest year-over-year percentage increase in the quarter, with COVID-related stay-at-home projects driving robust consumer demand throughout the quarter. Our customers business slowly improved but remained down low single-digits in the quarter. Our customers are telling us that job site conditions are stabilizing, and the predominant theme remains that projects are being delayed rather than canceled. The property maintenance segment remains under pressure as turnover in multifamily remains slow. Protective and marine remains our most challenging segment from a demand perspective. Access to job sites remains an issue on some projects. Demand remains particularly depressed in oil and gas, which is the segment's largest single-end market. Other areas such as flooring and water and wastewater treatment are moving in a more positive direction. We believe this business is well-positioned to take advantage of future potential, infrastructure investments and comps will start to become more favorable heading into next year. From a product perspective, strength in exterior paint continued as we generated low double-digit percentage growth in the quarter. Encouragingly, we also saw a significant pickup in interior paint, where sales were up by a high single-digit percentage overall and by double digits in the residential repaint segment. Additionally, spray equipment sales were up strong double digits in the quarter. This is another very encouraging sign of recovery as contractors are unlikely to invest in this type of equipment unless they anticipate significant demand. Pricing came in as we expected and was approximately 2% in the third quarter. We expect a similar level of effectiveness in the fourth quarter. We opened 24 new stores in the third quarter and 40 year-to-date in the U.S. and Canada. We anticipate opening a total of approximately 55 new stores for the full year in the U.S. and Canada. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products and productivity enhancing services to drive additional growth. We're also pleased by a continuing uptick in the use of our e-commerce platform. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. DIY demand remained robust in the quarter, driven by consumers continuing to focus on home improvement projects while nesting at home during the pandemic. We generated strong double-digit growth by working closely with our retail customers to capture this demand, most notably with Lowe's. Our global supply chain organization continued to perform admirably in the quarter, working collaboratively with our customers to help meet unprecedented demand. Internationally, every region generated year-over-year growth. Sales increased by double-digit percentages in Europe and Australia, and by a mid- single-digit percentage in Asia. Similar to second quarter, we leveraged the strong sales growth and favorable product mix to drive significant operating margin improvement compared to the prior year. Our margin improvement also reflects the terrific work this team has done over the last two years to improve our portfolio, including rationalizing SKUs, exiting the ACE private label business, and reducing costs in Europe and Australia. We continue to reinvest in this business to drive long-term growth for our partners, especially in the Handyman remodeler or pros who paint category. Lastly, let me comment on the trends in the Performance Coatings Group. We're encouraged by this segment's return to growth in the quarter, inclusive of a 1.4% headwind related to currency translation rate changes. As in the Americas Group, Performance Coatings Groups generated significant sequential improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter in all regions, in nearly all divisions. The majority of regions and divisions also delivered growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. From a regional perspective, Asia grew fastest in the quarter, up by a high single-digit percentage. Europe and Latin America both grew by low single-digit percentages. Our largest region in PCG, North America, was down in the quarter by a low single-digit percentage, where a slower recovery in the General Industrial Division offset growth in the other divisions. From a divisional perspective, I'll start with our packaging business, where our team continues to deliver great results. Sales were up high single digits and positive in every region for the quarter. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust, and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction. And both we and our customers are investing in capacity expansion. In coil coatings, the resumption of selected commercial construction projects, albeit slow, along with growth in appliances and strong new business wins across all regions led to mid single-digit growth in the quarter. We're very encouraged by the improved performance in industrial wood, where sales were up by a mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter. We believe the momentum we are seeing in kitchen cabinetry, flooring and furniture correlates to similar positive trends in new residential construction. We also returned to growth in automotive refinish in the quarter, where sales were up a low single-digit percentage. This team has done a very nice job driving new account growth by offering better solutions than our competitors. We estimate miles driven are currently at about 75% of pre-COVID levels. And collision shop volume across the industry is off by approximately 25%. We expect continued improvement in these trends. In general industrial, we were down by a low single-digit percentage in the quarter. While we're never pleased with the quarter, where the top line is down, this was a very significant improvement from the high double-digit decline we saw in the second quarter. There are several reasons for optimism in this business. Regionally, Asia was up double digits, and Europe was up mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. Latin America was positive on a currency-neutral basis, and while North America remained under pressure, we did see very meaningful sequential improvement. Moving on to our guidance. I'll remind you that our fourth quarter is a seasonally smaller one. We expect to see our normal sequential seasonal slowdown in U.S. architectural demand in the fourth quarter, similar to previous years. We're expecting continued favorable product mix in the quarter with DIY, res repaint and new residential growth, while not expecting material improvement in the other architectural segments or Protective & Marine. We also expect our interior products to become a bigger part of the mix in the quarter as we return to a more typical interior/exterior ratio for this time of year. On the industrial side of the business, we're encouraged by many of the positive trends I described a few moments ago. At the same time, dynamics related to customers' replenishment of inventory and the true pace of end market demand will likely cause continued choppiness in the pace of recovery in some end markets. Against this backdrop, we anticipate fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net sales will increase by 3% to 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Looking at our operating segments for the fourth quarter. We anticipate the Americas Group to be up by 4% to 6%, Consumer Brands Group be up a mid-to high-teens percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up or down a low single-digit percentage. For the full year 2020, we are revising our sales guidance upward from flat to up slightly, to up by a low single-digit percentage based on our improved fourth quarter outlook. On an operating segment basis for the full year, we anticipate the Americas Group to be up by a low single-digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up by a mid-teens percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be down by low to mid single-digit percentage. We expect to see gross margin expansion in the quarter. On SG&A, we will be making incremental investments in our long-term growth opportunities, and we do not expect to see as much SG&A leverage as in our third quarter. We are, again, increasing our diluted net income per share guidance for 2020 to be in the range of $21.49 to $21.79 per share compared to our most recent guidance of $20.96 to $21.46 per share and compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings per share guidance, includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $2.51 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2020 earnings per share of $24 to $24.30, an increase of 14.3% at the midpoint over the $21.12 we delivered last year. Embedded within our outlook is the assumption that the raw material basket will be lower for the full year by a mid-single-digit percentage. Based on our current outlook, we expect the fourth quarter will have less of a benefit than the first three quarters of the year, given recent sequential inflation in some commodities, in comparisons to the deflation we saw the latter half of 2019. Let me close with some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Our CapEx guidance for the year remains $280 million. This CapEx guidance includes a very modest amount of spending related to our new headquarters and R&D facility projects. Earlier this month, the company's Board of Directors approved a dividend of $1.34 per share, an increase of 18.6% over the $1.13 per share dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2019. We resumed open market share purchases during the third quarter, investing $404 million, purchased 600,000 shares of company common stock. Absent significant M&A, we expect to continue purchasing shares in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have a remarkable team at Sherwin-Williams, and they delivered outstanding results in the quarter by focusing on meeting customer needs. I'm truly grateful for their passion and their commitment, which has put us on track to deliver sales and earnings growth in this most challenging of years. We believe the long-term fundamental strengths of our end markets remain intact. There is tremendous opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses and, in many ways, we're just getting started. We remained very confident about the future and our ability to create shareholder value over the long term. This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Good morning, Ghansham. Well, thank you for that question, Ghansham. I think the -- if you start with commercial, as you've mentioned, jobs are coming back online. And as we mentioned, sequentially, we've seen some improvement. I think when you look at the ramp-up there, I think a lot of that's going to have to do with the progress our contractors make on getting more painters out on projects, social distancing and the restrictions that go along with those requirements have proven somewhat challenging to our customers. So I'd say that as we go into 2021, we expect more and more progress, if you will, in that segment. You asked about each of the segments, and maybe I'll make one overarching comment regarding all the professional segments. And that is, as I've mentioned before, no one hopes for any experience like this pandemic that we're experiencing. That said, our commercial contractors, as well as every other contractor we serve has found this market to be a challenge. It might be getting approval to go in to work into one area, and getting pulled out for that area and pushed into another, start exterior, have someone say they might be going out of town, can you do an interior project? All of these create conflict for our customers. And at the same time, it creates the opportunity that we look for, which is to be there with solutions for our customers. And so we're working hard. I mentioned earlier, how grateful I am for our teams. Our teams in the field are doing just a wonderful job in responding into each one of these professional segments in a way that very few people can. As it relates to the segments, I might, again, here, begin with the way that I'm looking at these segments. And these, to me, represent favorable comps as we go into next year. If you start with residential repaint, and I'll give you a little color as to why I feel each of these are favorable comps. We are talking about coming out of a quarter with double-digit gains, but we're not hitting on all cylinders yet. The interior, while improving dramatically, offers a terrific opportunity for us as well as the opportunity to continue to grow share. Our TAG team, the leadership team and those terrific employees in the field, are actually growing our new accounts year-over-year this year, on the year with a pandemic, faster than we have previous years. So our new account growth in this area has just been terrific. So we see our progress in res repaint as exciting. But we're not complacent here. This offers -- this is the largest segment we have, but it also offers the greatest opportunity for market share growth. We feel coming into 2021, the fact that we've been running a large part of the year with a much smaller interior market as well as the share gains that we're gaining, we're excited about entering into next year. In new residential, same thing, comps are favorable going into next year for us. We finished the year here -- I'm sorry, the fourth quarter mid-single-digits up. But again, these are businesses that are just starting to ramp up our position here, exclusive relationships with 18 of the top 20 builders, really making progress in the regional and custom homebuilder who's really been hit the least throughout this process. But our position here, as we go into 2021, is really a strong one, particularly given the fact that there still remains a shortage of supply of homes in the marketplace. And our new residential customers are excited about the progress as they're making coming out of 2020 going into 2021. Talking about commercial, property management is another one. Again, terrific comps for us as we go into next year. Clearly, this business has been impacted by turns. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the lack of turns has had an impact on our business here. If you'll recall, during our financial community presentation, I mentioned that our customers are starting to see, sense, and hear more from their tenants about more movement and again, terrific position here with exclusives with 18 of the top 20 here and our customers are starting to feel like this is starting to move. We'll tell you more about this likely at the end of the next quarter, but we're feeling better about the progress here as we enter into 2021. So that's -- those are the professional sides. You didn't ask about the DIY side? But maybe, Al, if I could lean on you for a second here. Why don't we talk about DIY from a company perspective? Thanks, Ghansham. I'd say our response here is going to be pretty consistent with past discussions that we've had, Ghansham. As we look at all costs, the raw material baskets and everything that you laid out there from healthcare to energy, every aspect of the business, we look at that on a 30-day basis, every 30 days with our management team, we evaluate where we are. We make that decision. We immediately then proceed out with any increases that we've decided on, with a goal of talking to our cost customers first. Once we talk to the customers, then we bring it to the financial community. We've not announced any increases now, or we're not out with any right now. And should we, like I said, we'll be out in front of the customer first and then come to you. Thank you, Ghansham. Good morning, Jeff. No, they're very similar. So it's the market that we serve, Jeff. If you look at coil, we've had the benefits of appliances, as an example, in coil as the commercial projects have picked up extrusion and some of the applications into the commercial space have been positive. And the other thing I'd say about the coil, give this team great credit. They have been winning business across all regions. So we talk a lot about share of wallet in our TAG business. But if I were to use that kind of description for our coil business, I'd say, they've been doing very well in that space as well. General industrial, if you look at those applications for coatings in our GI space, again, choppy is a good description here. We did have growth, as we talked about in a few of the geographies: Asia, Europe, LatAm, I believe, in local \u2013 in same currency would have been slightly positive. It's mainly the U.S., and it's a choppy market here in the U.S. for GI. Thank you, Jeff I'd say that we are seeing a positive mix shift, Steve. I would say that there is a difference between these customers. If you look at the DIY customer in a Sherwin store, they're typically looking for that specialty store experience. Al just mentioned, a small percentage of our business, 10%, roughly of our business. The expectations there are just that. They're looking for that specialty store service and expectations in areas that might include color, selection and so on. If you look at the overall, though, what I would say is that our experience this go around is that these are people that are, in general, home, as we've described, nesting, and in many cases, finding themselves looking at a wall that may not have been painted in the next decade. And I think I mentioned on one call that in some of our stores, they've kind of jokingly referred to these as what the heck projects, where they're sitting around, kind of bored out of their minds, and they're saying, 'What the heck. I might as well go ahead and paint this room.' The reason I share that with you is that we've often gotten a question about do we have a concern that we might be leveraging or mortgaging residential repaint customer sales to a DIY customer. We've not seen that. In fact, our residential repaint customers bidding activity is actually increasing not only sequentially but year-over-year. So our customers on the res repaint side are quoting more now this year than they were last year, and they are telling us that the success rate is actually increasing. So we have a DIY customer, who's home. They want a good experience. They are typically moving up and we have a res repaint customers backlog that's growing. And overall, the customer ends up with the best experience. So it helps our brand position with our customers as well. Al will talk about capital first, and then I'll talk about M&A. Yeah. I'd say, first, Arun. I think it's important to acknowledge that in challenging times, I think you get a sense for how much discipline and conviction you have in your strategy. Things get tough, you can find your way to want to buy a book of business, or let's just buy sales or sales \u2013 that's not who we are. I'm really proud of our teams on an organic basis as well as in the M&A space. We've got a very defined strategy that we're working here. And we're very much determined to stay on that, and that great pride in the fact that our teams are doing just that. Now that said, I'm also very pleased with the progress that we're making in this area. We've got some very good discussions going on and feel good about the targets that we're pursuing. As a reminder, the targets that we pursue largely will be in the industrial space, targets that fill either a technology gap or strength in a region that would help us in accelerating our existing businesses and their goals or in establishing a position in a geography where we're underrepresented. Now that said, our goal is not to be everything to everyone, everywhere. So we talk a lot internally about our rights to win, and how we'll go about this and bring into the market a unique and differentiated value that would help us to create shareholder value. So I'm pleased with the progress, and I think the discussions have gone pretty well here. Well, comfort is not a good word here at Sherwin-Williams. We don't like comfort, nor do we like complacency, Bob. I think you know that. So we're constantly reviewing programs, SKUs, brands, businesses. I think we owe that to our shareholders. So I think there's a very disciplined approach that we take. We're very blessed to have four terrific group Presidents that understand that, and lead that. It is not something that Al and I and David are pulling on. I think these are terrific leaders that understand how to make money, how to create shareholder value. So there's a constant review on all levels, from businesses, all the way down to the SKU, including programs. And those programs are sometimes difficult. If you're launching a program, it's your baby, you want to stay close to that. But I think these terrific leaders are demonstrating a willingness to look at every decision and ensure that it's creating value. Yeah. So thank you, Bob, for that question, because it's an opportunity to talk about a wonderful team here there that's been working really hard. And it's been unfortunate because they've been gaining a lot of ground in the midst of a COVID experience that's not allowed those numbers to shine through. We don't quantify the size of the business itself, but I will tell you that it's been trending positive. To your question, or point, we believe that we're aggressively growing market share here. We think it's a combination of the technology. People have been asking about synergies with Valspar and Sherwin. This is an excellent example of some of those synergies that come through as we've combined the legacy Sherwin technology, along with the legacy Valspar technology, to come up with a system that's been -- well, been understatement to say, that's been well received. It's been terrific. I spent some time with these large customers who have converted many of those shops over to Sherwin. And I'd say it's a combination of the technology as well as the channel model that we have. Our own stores servicing these customers. We have the same mentality through our automotive stores as we do our own architectural stores. And it's working. And it's working aggressively, and it's a bit of a pun, but we plan on putting a lot of gas in this tank. All right. Thanks, Bob. Sure, P.J., you're right, we do a lot of what we call war gaming out. And again, I'll come back to the points that I made earlier about the leadership teams that we have. We don't know exactly how it will unfold. What we are blessed with is a lot of experience, maybe I might refer to it as scar tissue, by teams at all levels that understand and can execute. And if you don't mind, maybe I could just take a second just to talk about why I have so much confidence in our ability to respond to whatever it might be. Because yes, you're right, we have thoughts and ideas of different scenarios. All of them come back to execution, and all of the execution comes back to the people that we have -- the terrific people we have in the field every day. So, if I could just take a second and explain why I feel so bullish about that. I mentioned in our financial community presentation last month, about the fact that our MTP program in our stores was reaching 40 years, and this is 40 years of recruiting outstanding talent, training and developing talent and retaining talent. And so when you ask, why do we have confidence and why we are able to execute? We're recruiting 1,500 college grads annually. That means we've got 10,000 of these college graduates throughout the company right now. When I say throughout the company, I'm not just talking about in TAG, I literally mean throughout the company. These are people that have maybe entered in through TAG. They understand our culture. They understand our strategy. They understand our expectations. They understand our aggressiveness. And that helps us so much. In fact, the fact that people come in through that management training program. In fact, 80% of our reps in our TAG business started their career in a store and that means they understand products, they understand logistics, customer service, everything that we have. And this allows us to promote from within. And so when we look at the leadership team that's responding to what your question is, which is what ifs? Well, we've got 70% of our TAG leadership, they started in these MTP programs. So they've started and they understand everything that we're asking our people and our stores to do. If you can imagine, having 70% of our leadership team have had that experience, and they know what to do. And that 70% then feeds our leadership. And I mentioned, at the financial community presentation, that talent pool continues to push up. We've got 6 group and Division Presidents that were MTPs, 26 Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents, and I was blesses a CEO to come through this. And what all that does is, it provides a clear line of sight to a career path that others can follow, and that helps our retention. And I believe, to answer your question, I think how we're able to do this is, it's the retention of wonderful talented people that have the skills, the resources and drives to be able to win. And I think that's the critical component in our strategy. And we've got a long history of it. And we've also got a long history of very low turnover. In fact, our turnover \u2013 voluntary turnover is around 7% to 8% and that's with nearly 5,000 stores. I don't think there are many companies that could push that out as a statistic, but we're proud of that. And what that then does is it drives the retention of our overall workforce. 7,000 of our employees have more than 20 years of service, and that's about 15% of our full-time employees. We're blessed to have that talent. And I think when you look at then all the way back, starting from the beginning, what does this allow us to do? Well, 80% of our reps in TAG, they have 5 years or more service. They've come through the stores, same with our industrial reps, by the way. But what this all means is we've got wonderful talent that we can retain. They're in a culture where they want to be. And so when this terrific leadership team takes the front and says, follow me, our people follow, and they execute better than anyone. And I'm a proud member and a small part of that because we win on the streets, and I'm really proud of what our teams are doing. Yes, David, we haven't quantified them because we're just trying to tell you what we've done versus tell you what we're going to do. I would kind of frame it this way. In the fourth quarter, you do see seasonal reduction in sales related to architectural. Our typical cadence is our SG&A spending tends to be flat from the third quarter to fourth quarter, if you go back and look at it over a period of time. So you delever a little bit on a sequential basis. It doesn't -- I said we'll potentially delever a little bit year-over-year and not see as much benefit in SG&A as we saw in the third quarter. That's really dependent on -- I gave you a pretty wide sales range because of some of the uncertainties around different segments, general, industrial and some others that we had talked about. So as we see the continued sales momentum into November and December, that will tell me the cadence of what we can put in as investment. So we're trying to do the pedal and clutch, as one of our group presidents likes to talk about. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we're also looking at it from the long term, and that will tell you where SG&A comes in as a percent. That would be pretty close. Yes. Thanks David. Yes, Kevin, to your first point, you're right. With the impressive DIY demand we've seen, we've been not building inventory as much as just maintaining our -- keeping up with the sales out the door. We absolutely are going to run our supply chain harder this fourth quarter and going into the first quarter to build inventory ahead of the spring selling season. As far as how we work with our customers, we want to make sure we're building the right products and getting to them at the right time. We don't think it's about just loading up inventory at store level, whether it's our stores or our architectural and consumer customers, but we're working with them. And it's going to also depend on what the trend that we see in DIY demand out of -- coming into the winter here in November or December and the early part of next year, and then ramping up to the spring. So that's going to be a constant. And I would tell you, we are working with our customers on a daily, weekly, monthly basis to make sure we're getting them the right products that they need. Yes, Kevin, I guess I'd be remiss if I didn't say on the other side, where we've been under a little bit of pressure on the Performance Coatings side. I think that team has done a really, really nice job controlling inventory, so we didn't build the wrong inventory. And they've got a lot of different programs in place to try to drive complexity out of that supply chain, whether it's SKU rationalizations, platform consolidations. And I give that team a lot of credit for maintaining a disciplined approach to inventory, whereas on the DIY side, we're just full out. We're making as much as we can possibly make. Not really, Vincent. I'd say it was a bit slower in some of the more urban areas, but we are starting to see some pickup in those areas as well. So I can't just \u2013 I can't explain it. If people are just getting tired enough to the point where they're saying just come on in, or they're leaving, or what's happening, but we are \u2013 it's pretty well even across the country. Not the case. Thanks, Vincent. You're exactly right, Rosemarie. We're not going to talk about that. You can repeat the question now. Hi, Mike, as you know, we don't get POS data from those independence. We do believe though that third quarter was strong across most of the independent dealers. It's an environment where they're probably doing pretty well. Hard to say that they're gaining or losing share right now, real time, but I would say that they are likely benefiting to some degree from the same nesting issue that most people in the paint business are in urgency right now as it relates to DIY. Mike, I would tell you that is an area of strength for us. But I would tell you, as it relates to packaging, we've got a terrific team there that's doing a wonderful job as well as wonderful technology. I think we're growing share pretty aggressively in both food and beverage. And we expect that to continue. Thank you, Mike. Hey, John, I'm going to have Al answer that, but I want to make sure that I correct it. We never said, easy comps, we said, favorable comps. In that entire TAG leadership team down there, having their chests suggesting that nothing is easy down there. They're doing want to acknowledge that and say that they're favorable, not easy. Now, Al, you could answer that. John, I'd say they're beginning to narrow down. We're feeling as though some of what's happening in the marketplace right now as people looking hard at the mirror and asking how much further and how much harder they want to run. And others that are saying, I want to be a little more realistic. So, I'd say that the gap is narrowed. On a targeted basis, there has been, Greg. Yes. Yes. Duffy, I'd say that if you look at our Performance Coatings business, 5 of the -- actually, all 6 of the industrial businesses, 5 of the businesses were positive in the third quarter in Asia. We feel there's some good momentum there. And our ability to bring solutions to those customers, we think, helps to differentiate us. So yes, we expect that to continue to grow. I'll add in the architectural piece as well, although I don't know that you were asking that as much as maybe the industrial side. But we've got, I think a terrific opportunity long-term there. So we're doing some work there and some, we believe, good groundwork that will help generations down the road, not next quarter, as we establish the brand and channel for the architectural side. But if you look at our industrial businesses there, they're all pretty strong. And as far as M&A in that market, yes, we're interested in the right businesses there that could help to accelerate our strategy. Again, I'll go back to the very disciplined approach that we take here, which is not just buying a book of business, but something that brings value to our shareholders. We find the right targets in there that can help us, yes, we'd be interested. Thanks Duffy. Yes, Chris, we do believe that we're growing faster than market right now. And you're right, packaging from a technical standpoint, approval process standpoint, nearly every aspect of packaging is pointing in our direction. So we're feeling really good about that. We talked about coil and the process that we've been going through and new wins or share of wallet, as we like to say, and we expect that to continue to grow. And so our expectations of that team are very high as well. I'd say, we didn't really talk all about it in great depth, but we're really proud of the industrial wood business and the performance. It wasn't long ago, that business was something like made your head hurt. But I'd say it's moving in the right direction here pretty aggressively, and that team is really demonstrating the fact that they've got their hands around this business moving in the right direction and got the lot of confidence, particularly when you look as I mentioned in the prepared remarks about the new residential business and the linkage between that industrial wood business and the growth there in industrial wood. Auto, we talked about the positioning that we've had and how we're growing there already, and it's just not been as visible as we would like because of we're only about 75% back on the road. So we often say, we don't want to be ambulance chasers, but the more roads on \u2013 the more cars on the road, the more refinished business there's going to be. And so we're feeling really good about this. Next, then come to areas GI that we've talked about. We love our position here. And to your point, or the question earlier, I believe, I think, Greg or Duffy asked about, our Asia position with leadership? And we look at that Valspar leadership that came with that acquisition. And we've often referred to that as the greatest infusion of talent in the company's history. And so when we look at the auto business and GI, we look at terrific technology and talent that has come here. And we expect to help \u2013 that to help up our business in this GI business. Aaron Erter, our Group President of this business, is really doing a wonderful job in a very challenging market, and we've got confidence that each one of these are going to drive. We talked earlier in the life cycle of this acquisition, about our goal to drive the operating margins here in the high teens, low 20s, and we have every bit of expectation and confidence that we're going to do that. We do. And we also have most powerful brands in those areas to build on as well. And a wonderful team that understands that, that we'll execute on that. So I think we will kind of be approaching this from both sides aggressively. Yes. David, it's pretty flat. I mean, if you look at it on a same-day basis, it's pretty flat throughout the quarter. About what? I'm sorry? Yes, I would say that we have seen and heard from our customers that the backlog has grown on the part of our contractors. That's evidenced by the fact that they are busy more and have more customers now allowing them in their homes, but still a long list of people that are hopeful that the projects would be coming in soon. I think some pace of that is going to increase with more allowing people in as they're going to be spending more time perhaps in their homes, preparing for the holidays, whatever it might be. So, I'd say that the backlog is good, strong and growing on the part of our residential repaying customers. So, as it relates to the spray equipment, I'd rather not give you any specifics on how long or what that means from a timing perspective. I will tell you that we see a direct correlation between the confidence of the spray equipment sales and the mentality of the contractor has before making that purchase. So, when they're plucking out a couple of thousand dollars or so on a piece of equipment, they're betting that these projects that they have coming up will allow them to pay for them. So, it's a good precursor for what's down the road. Yes. Very much. So we're excited about this. Yes. I mean, these are -- I use the term I was thoughtful in using that term favorable comps. Yes. You got commercial down low single-digits, property maintenance, mid-single-digits here in the quarter, and we have a wonderful position here, great people, great products, great relationships. Yes. We're going to -- yes. The answer is yes. Well, so you're talking about how long before a bill is passed and paint is applied? I mean, it would vary, obviously, by project. But I'd say you could see that in a quarter or so, likely. That's a guess on my part. I'd say our position there is very strong, particularly on water and wastewater. It's been a good position and growing for us. But I'd say when you look at general \u2013 or I'm sorry, the protective and marine, and the contractors that typically do that type of work, those are typically areas that we do very well with. So as soon as it hits the Street, we would be right on top of that. Thanks, Garik. Yeah, John, we look at that on a regular basis. And the opportunity for us as markets turns, change and develop. And so the beauty of our approach is how we structure those decisions are as close to the customer as possible with support. So those decisions and opportunities are something that we leverage figuratively. Thanks, John. Now, Eric, I would tell you that we've spoken about the double-digit growth that we've seen in exterior, the very strong high single-digit growth in interior. Obviously, the interior paint market is much larger than the exterior, but we're not going to provide any more detail on our sales of those products and help you understand that. Eric, I'd say that it is an area of comfort and confidence that we have. It's moving. And as I mentioned earlier, it's, for the most part across the country, and for the most part, nearly all of our residential repaint customers. You'll hear some pockets of concern. But for the most part, I'd say there's a strong excitement inside our building about the interior growth. Yeah. Thank you. I'd say it's a little bit of both, Kevin. I'd say we've got a terrific leader. Brian Patton has done a very nice job of running all of those industrial -- I'm sorry, the international architectural businesses for us. This business, as you mentioned, delivered double-digit growth and it improved its profitability. And we think that we've definitely seen an increased effort to develop the right platform channels for distribution through our team. They've done a nice job of taking out costs and the actions associated with that are not always easy or fun, but this team did a really, really nice job of taking the right steps and right actions and a double-digit growth with reduced expenses, and you start to see an improved bottom line. I think yes, sequentially, we've seen improvement in -- the other thing they like to build on Al's point, even in these challenging times, the 5 global business units that sit in PCG all grew in all regions. So I mean, there's some pretty good momentum that we have coming along here. Yes. And Justin, it sounds like you mentioned that you may have missed the earlier response. I think it's important to build on the point Al made earlier, which is \u2013 this is very similar to the 2008 run that we experienced. We've got a long-tenured leadership here at Sherwin. It's been through many of these movies here before. And we know how to invest. While it hits the SG&A line. I would tell you, Al and the other control \u2013 the group controllers that work with Al, there's a very disciplined approach in this. So this is not money that we look at spending, these are investments. A very high level of discipline and expectations come along with those investments. Thanks, Jason."

After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJim Jaye: Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy during the pandemic. Let me begin with some high level summary comments on the quarter. All comparisons are to the second quarter of 2019, unless otherwise stated. Overall Sherwin-Williams delivered a very good second quarter given the environment. Total company consolidated sales were in line with the updated guidance we provided on June 22 with sequential improvement in each month of the quarter. Despite sales being down for the quarter, we delivered year-over-year improvement in gross margin, profit before tax, EBITDA, diluted net income per share and net operating cash. Second quarter 2020 consolidated sales decreased 5.6% to $4.6 billion, inclusive of negative currency impact of negative 1.5%. The estimated negative impact from COVID-19 on consolidated sales was approximately 8%. Consolidated gross margin increased 330 basis points to 48% from 44.7%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $71.7 million or 10.6% to $747.4 million. Diluted net income per share increased 28.8% to $6.48 per share from $5.03 per share. The second quarter of 2020 included acquisition related amortization expense of $0.62 per share. The second quarter of 2019 included acquisition related amortization expense and other adjustments of $1.54 per share. As described in the Regulation G reconciliation table included in our press release. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.1% to $7.10 from $6.57. Adjusted EBITDA increased $57.5 million to $979 million or 21.3% of sales. Net operating cash increased 42% year-to-date to $1.07 billion or 12.3% of sales. Segments sales were also in line with the updated guidance we provided on June 22. Segment margin in The Americas Group improved to 23.8% of sales, driven by favorable customer and product mix, lower input costs and reduced spending. Adjusted segment margin in the consumer brands group increased to 26.5% of sales, resulting from operating leverage on the nearly 22% top line growth and lower input costs, as well as actions taken over the past year to improve our international operating margins. Adjusted segment margin in the Performance Coatings Group decreased to 13.6% of sales, where lower input costs and good spending control were able to offset some, but not all of the impact of the high teens sales decline. Additional details on our segment performance are included in the slide deck provided with our press release and available on our website. Let me now turn the call over to John Morikis, for some additional commentary on the quarter and our outlook. John?\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Let me begin by thanking the more than 60,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams for their continued determination and resilience under very challenging circumstances. As I mentioned on our last call, our senior leaders have persevered through several previous crises. Their experience has been a true differentiator during this time and enabled us to deliver significant improvement across many measures in the quarter. Our entire team has my appreciation and respect, as they continue to serve our customers at a high level. The quarter played out better than we anticipated with the pace of year-over-year decline decreasing sequentially throughout the quarter. Consolidated sales were down by a mid teens percentage in April, but came out of the quarter with June flat to last year. The pace of recovery was faster than expected in some end markets, which led us to revise our sales guidance on June 22. As Jim mentioned, gross margin in the quarter expanded to 48%, driven by favorable customer and product mix and lower input costs. The industry basket of raw materials was down by mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter compared to the prior year. In terms of cost control, our team quickly developed and began implementing a comprehensive contingency plan in March to adjust to the pandemic. We reduced the SG&A spending in the quarter by $40 million, but also maintain strategic investments to support long-term growth. Let me talk a bit about trends we\u2019re seeing in each of our segments before moving on to our outlook. In The Americas Group, we\u2019re now into the summer painting season and no one is better positioned to serve professional painters than we are. We\u2019ve safely and responsibly opened all our store sales force in the U.S. and Canada and customers in all segments tell us they\u2019re eager to get back to work. Last quarter, we commented that we believed that we were seeing a pause in demand rather than demand destruction. We still believe this is the case based on the momentum we saw in multiple segments as the quarter progressed. While we don\u2019t typically comment on the pace of business by month, I would like to provide a few data points that maybe helpful given the current extraordinary circumstances. In DIY our business continued to grow at an unprecedented pace and was robust throughout the quarter. After DIY, new residential and residential repaint were the best performers in the quarter and both recovered to deliver positive growth in June. Commercial improved in each month of the quarter and was down slightly in June. Property maintenance and protective and marine also improved sequentially, but have not yet returned to grow. From a product perspective, exterior paint is recovering faster than interior paint, as you would expect due to social distancing requirements. Exterior paint sales increased by mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter and with June being the strongest month in the quarter. The interior paint sales decreased by low-single-digit percentage in the quarter, but improved throughout the quarter, finishing June flat to last year. Additionally, spray equipment pump sales are often a good indicator of future demand as contractors are unlikely to invest in this type of equipment, unless they anticipate significant future demand. Spray equipment and pump sales were down mid single digits in the quarter, but recovered to finish strong in the month of June. Pricing came in as we expected and was approximately 2% in the second quarter. We expect a similar level of effectiveness in the third quarter. We still anticipate opening approximately 50 new stores this year, while continuing to focus on adding sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products and productivity enhancing services. We also continue to invest in our e-commerce platform and we\u2019re pleased with the continuing uptick in usage. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. DIY demand surged throughout the quarter, driven by consumers nesting and tackling home improvement projects during the pandemic. We generated strong double-digit growth by working closely with our retail customers to capture this demand, most notably Lowe\u2019s, our exclusive national home center partner. Our global supply chain organization continued to adapt and invest during the quarter, including pivoting from 5 gallon pails to single gallon cans on multiple production lines to help meet the unprecedented DIY demand. Internationally, we saw positive growth in Europe, while China and Australia remained soft. We leveraged the strong sales growth to drive significant operating margin improvement compared to the prior year. Our margin improvement also reflects the benefit of actions taken over the past year to focus our portfolio, including rationalizing SKUs, exiting the ACE private label business, streamlining our European business, and reducing costs in Asia and Australia. This enhanced profitability will enable us to reinvest in the business to drive long-term growth for our retail partners, especially in the Handyman remodeler, pros who paint category. Lastly, let me comment on the trends in the Performance Coatings Group. Demand improved sequentially across the group in the quarter, though the pace of improvement remained variable by geography and business unit. From a geographic perspective, Asia was the strongest performer in the quarter, down by a low-single-digit percentage. All other regions were down by double-digit percentages, though North America was significantly better than Europe and Latin America. In packaging, sales were positive in every region for the quarter and were up a high-single-digit percentage. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. In coil coatings, the resumption of selected commercial construction projects drove sequential improvements during the quarter, including exiting the quarter positively in June. This improvement aligns with my earlier comments on commercial construction within the TAG segment, which improved sequentially in the quarter. In industrial wood, we saw sequential sales improvement during the quarter. Many of the end markets served by this business including furniture, kitchen cabinetry and flooring are influenced by trends in new residential construction, which has gained momentum in our TAG business as I mentioned earlier. In general industrial, most end markets including heavy equipment, agriculture, transportation and general finishing, remained soft, though the business did improve sequentially. Encouragingly, general industrial was up high-single digits in Asia for the quarter. All other regions were down double-digit percentages in the quarter. In automotive refinish, miles driven and traffic congestion remain at reduced levels. We saw sequential improvement in the business during the quarter, though a return to growth continues to depend on the lifting of stay-at-home orders and the resumption of more normal travel routines. Certainly, the pandemic is not over, and numerous uncertainties in the economic environment remain. However, to the extent that economies are beginning to shift from the containment phase to the recovery phase of the pandemic, our team is energized and engaged to capture current opportunities and deliver above market growth. We anticipate third quarter demand to improve sequentially from the second quarter but softness to continue in some end markets in the U.S., and internationally for the remainder of 2020. Against this backdrop, we anticipate third quarter 2020 consolidated net sales will be up or down by a low-single-digit percentage versus the third quarter of 2019. Looking at our operating segments for the third quarter, we anticipate The Americas Group to be flat to up by a low-single digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up a low-double digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be down by low to mid-single digit percentage. For the full year 2020, we\u2019re revising our sales guidance upward modestly to approximately flat with last year. This guidance reflects continued uncertainties in the timing and pace of improvement in the U.S. and global operating environments. On an operating segment basis for the full year, we anticipate The Americas Group to be flat to up by a low-single-digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up by a high-single-digit percentage, and Performance Coatings Group to be down by a low to mid-single-digit percentage. We are revising our diluted net income per share guidance for 2020 to be in the range of $19.21 to $20.71 per share compared to our previous guidance of $16.46 to $18.46 per share, and compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $2.54 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2020 earnings per share of $21.75 to $23.25, an increase of 6.5% at the midpoint over the $21.12 we delivered last year. Embedded within our outlook is the assumption that the industry raw material basket will be lower for the full year by a mid-single digit percentage. Based on our current outlook, we expect the second quarter will be the most beneficial in terms of year-over-year deflation. We expect the second half benefit will be less than the first half benefit, given comparisons to the deflation we saw in the back half of 2019. Let me close with some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remains the strength of the company. At June 30, 2020, we had $188 million in cash, and approximately $3 billion of unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities. Our leverage ratio improved to 2.8 times on total debt to adjusted EBITDA compared to 3.3 times a year ago. Given the improving sequential demand we are seeing in several end markets, we\u2019re raising our CapEx guidance for the year from $180 million to $280 million. This is largely related to architectural and packaging capacity expansions restarting. This CapEx guidance includes a minimal amount of spending related to our new headquarters and R&D facility project. Earlier this month, the company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $1.34 per share, an increase of 18.6% over the $1.13 per share dividend paid in the second quarter of 2019. We are committed to maintain this dividend increase throughout the rest of 2020. In May, we paid off $429 million in 2.25% notes that were due. Our next long-term debt maturity is $25 million due in 2021, followed by $660 million due in 2022. We paused open market share purchases during the second quarter, believing it inappropriate to be buying shares at a time when we were forced to adjust our workforce and pause multiple spending programs. Again, given a stabilizing environment, we would expect to return to repurchases in the second half of the year, with a minimum goal of offsetting dilution from options. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have a long tenured and experienced management team that has successfully managed the company through many challenging times. They have demonstrated this ability once again over the last several months, and I\u2019m confident they will continue to deliver strong results. We also believe the long-term fundamental strengths of our end markets remain intact. We have the people, the products and the services to help our customers succeed. We remain very confident about the future and our ability to create shareholder value over the long-term. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Parkinson: Thank you. So, you seem to have some pretty solid margin results, especially in Consumer. I wish \u2013 I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a testament to a few different variables, but primarily the amount of volumes just moving through the system and leveraging what you\u2019ve been refining as your U.S. cost base. You\u2019ve often spoken about 20% annualized margins in Consumer Brands from 13% level to time of the Valspar acquisition. Can you update us on your long-term thoughts on this target and what you\u2019ve learned further about this platform in a COVID-19 environment? Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Hey, Chris, this is Al Mistysyn. Hope you\u2019re doing well. Yes, I think we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making on operating margin within Consumer Brand. I think you\u2019re right; it\u2019s too soon to come off our long-term margin target of that 20% range. As we\u2019ve always talked about, volume is the single biggest driver of leverage across all our businesses. And with the unprecedented surge we\u2019re seeing in DIY across all channels, that is absolutely driving the majority of the margin improvement. And you would expect, and we expect that the demand will return to more normalized levels as the year progresses. That being said, there absolutely is good cost control taking place in North America. As you recall, we exited the ACE business last year. That helped improve our gross margin, our operating margin. We took action to reduce our footprint and costs around that. And we\u2019ve also taken action, as John talked about in his opening remarks, on our international businesses. We\u2019ve commented before, the performance of those businesses haven\u2019t been up to what we expect. I think the team has done a nice job with a variety of things; pricing actions, SKU rationalizations to make those operations more efficient, cost reductions and even in \u2013 we talked about the European flow through. In our first quarter we saw a nice similar improvement in flow through on our second quarter, and then even in Asia and Australia where we saw sales backwards, we\u2019re still positive on profit. So there\u2019s a number of factors that are allowing us to drive these margins, but volume is always first.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. And Chris, I would just add a couple of other items. One is, I do think we\u2019re operating more efficiently this year versus last year in serving our customers. I think that\u2019s a tribute to our global supply chain team doing a really terrific job and better planning and execution. We\u2019re more efficient I think this year in serving our customers; we\u2019re optimizing our supply chain better. We\u2019re doing this, I might add, while investing CapEx in areas such as our filling lines and dealing with the COVID challenges that everyone is dealing with. And I\u2019d like to just call out our global supply chain team during this really challenging time, this COVID issue. There\u2019s a team that\u2019s working 24/7 throughout all of this to serve our customers and to help our customers win. So I think we\u2019re being a little more effective in utilizing and optimizing our supply chain. You also asked about the COVID-19 environment and what we\u2019re learning. And I would say for me, what that\u2019s done is it\u2019s really reinforced the importance of our strategy. We have long spoken about this approach that we\u2019re taking on really driving value for our shareholders by focusing on what\u2019s right, where our customers value our solutions. And the other approach that I\u2019d say is we\u2019re really focused on covering all the bases. And I think what\u2019s happening right now, you asked about the DIY, is a great example. We\u2019ve got a terrific focus on our residential repaint. But we\u2019ve also been really focused on helping our customers grow DIY. And we take that approach in each of the markets we serve. So, whichever way the table tilts, we want to be first-in-line right there. So if it\u2019s DIY versus res repaint, if it\u2019s new residential versus remodeling, if it\u2019s commercial \u2013 new versus commercial repaint or whatever segment pops up, we want to be number one there.\nChris Parkinson: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And the second question that I have is just it does appear that you have some potential emerging I would characterize them as structural tailwinds in both resi repaint and likely new resi, based on what some of your customers are talking about for the second half, but probably more importantly for 2021. Can you just update us on your general housing views? Any comments on reverse urbanization? And just your efforts to accelerate share gains? And if you could sneak in a comment also about how that\u2019s playing into your intermediate to long-term outlook versus the non-resi and protective fronts, which look a little less bullish, that would greatly be appreciated. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Well, you pretty much covered the entire company with that question, Chris, so yes.\nChris Parkinson: I apologize.\nJohn Morikis: No. It\u2019s good. It\u2019s good. We love it. Let me start with the res repaint. We did see sequential improvement in the quarter. It turned positive in June largely driven by the exteriors that we talked about. We do see customers delaying interior work, that\u2019s related to the COVID-19 as you would expect. It\u2019s very uncommon to hear of projects that have been canceled, so we expect the interior to return, albeit probably gradually. To your point about our share gains there in res repaint, it is an area of focus. We are very pleased with the performance and we\u2019ve been talking quite a while about this idea of new accounts and share of wallet. And we\u2019re really trying to drive this. And we\u2019re really trying to bring more solutions to our customers right now than ever before. And this is an environment where our solutions add value. Complexity and challenges that our customers face, they allow us to demonstrate our solutions. And we are we believe uniquely positioned to help our customers to deliver. They want high quality projects. They want product on time. They want it efficiently. And they want to make more money. And we help them do that. And I believe when you dial it down, and there\u2019s a lot of detail into it, but if you look at it, I think it\u2019s \u2013 our stores are where they\u2019re needed, our products are where they\u2019re needed, our innovation is where it\u2019s needed. Our people are trained, they\u2019re knowledgeable. We hire the best. We do everything we can to keep them. Our voluntary turnover is in single digits, so we\u2019ve built these terrific relationships with customers and we work really hard to make them successful. And while these customers are experiencing delays or new regulations, if it\u2019s COVID or just emotions that they\u2019re dealing with customers, there\u2019s no room for errors, no room for disruptions. And our stores and our reps and those relationships help us tremendously. As it relates to commercial, I would say we saw sequential improvement in the second quarter, the pace of recovery, I would say has been more muted than the residential side. Projects have started to reopen and may have some limitations to them as our contractors are learning to work with social distancing and the limits around them of how many workers can be on a project and its slowing efficiency for our contractors. As a reminder I might say that new commercial starts are typically painted 12 to 18 months after the ground is broken. So we\u2019ve got a little runway here. But as far as we see, this is again a terrific opportunity. These are contractors who \u2013 these are typically very large projects. They\u2019re bid projects so they\u2019re competitive and these customers; they don\u2019t want delays or problems. And they learn to lean on our teams to be able to run their project successfully. Trend wise, I would say that the \u2013 when you look at the Architectural Billings Index, it\u2019s improved sequentially. In May, it was 32. It\u2019s now in June up to 40, still below the 50 expansion threshold that shows it\u2019s growing. But we remain pretty optimistic about this. It\u2019s \u2013 particularly in the area of new construction. While our customers are challenged, we think that it\u2019s a terrific way for us to be able to demonstrate what it is that we do and why it\u2019s special. And the last thing I would say is we\u2019re working really, really hard here in the area of specifications both in product and color. And that\u2019s an important metric that we monitor. So we actually gauge. When we talk with you folks about why we have confidence and we do, it\u2019s driven by the number of color requests we get, the number of data sheets and information we get. We monitor all of that. And the pipeline looks very good to us. So we\u2019re feeling good about our position, feeling good about what our customers are telling us, and we\u2019re really feeling good about the ability of our people to be able to deliver for them. What was the last one you talked about? The protective and marine or the industrial side. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve seen \u2013 we\u2019ve seen sequential improvement during the quarter. It\u2019s not returned back into year-over-year growth. Protective and marine, about 40% of our sales are tied to oil and gas, and that\u2019s obviously fallen sharply over the last quarter. Major oil and gas companies have delayed CapEx projects, which will continue to impact our results. But these aren\u2019t decorative products that we\u2019re talking about \u2013 or projects, I mean that we\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re most often very corrosive environments and they require corrosion control to protect the assets and protect safety of the employees and those around it as well as the environment. So we\u2019re focused on that business to continue to grow, there\u2019s still penetration opportunities. We\u2019re also focused on other areas like water, waste water, the flooring, the rail and we\u2019re gaining very good ground there. But given the weight that we have in the oil and gas, we expect while we\u2019re gaining in some of these other segments, we would expect to see meaningful growth what\u2019s most likely beginning in 2021 in protective and marine.\nChris Parkinson: Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Long answer, Chris. That was a long question, so.\nChris Parkinson: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. With volumes down in the quarter, did you dip into lower cost inventory layers in your cost of goods sold?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Jeff, we\u2019re \u2013 as you know, we\u2019re a LIFO, last in, first out, kind of company, so you might see a little bit of that. But we churn our raw materials so quickly, especially in this kind of environment on the architectural side with DIY, it\u2019s not meaningful in that respect because of the turns that we get. The just-in-time inventory that our suppliers do a great job keeping up with us and this environment, with the DIY surge that we talked about, a lot of impact on gallon cans and other specific raw materials related to that. So it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re churning our inventories very quickly on raw materials.\nJeff Zekauskas: So what really happened in terms of the gross margin in the second quarter? In that year-over-year, maybe your sales are down $275 million and your gross profits are flat to up, and your gross margin is up about 300 basis points. And even versus the first quarter, maybe your incremental gross margin is 70%. What was the thing \u2013 was it really volume in the Consumer Brands business or like what unusual thing happened in the second quarter so you have your cost of goods sold down, I don\u2019t know 10% or 11% year-over-year?\nAl Mistysyn: Right. No, Jeff, I think there\u2019s a number of things that are occurring in our second quarter that give us a tailwind. You bring up \u2013 you talk about the volume through our Consumer Brands Group that we just talked about on the previous question with Chris. When you see that kind of volume, and in our first quarter, we also talked about customer and mix change. And that\u2019s across really each of the segments. In some respects, you got TAG that we talked about with DIY and res repaint performing better than the other segments. We talked about from a product standpoint exterior growing faster than interior, paint growing faster than non-paint. I talked about the exiting of the ACE business that as you know it was a drag on our gross margin. That helps. And then we did see \u2013 as John talked about in the opening comments, lower raw material costs. And we expected to see that in our second quarter with the way raw materials trended last year and with our second quarter likely being our biggest year-over-year change. And then even \u2013 I would say, even within our Performance Coatings Group with the different segment growths and the different region growths, there\u2019s a mix there that helps. And then finally, as TAG performs better than Performance Coatings, that segment mix gives you some lift. So it\u2019s really a combination of a number of those things happening. But I would say with PCG, for example, the consumer businesses outside of the U.S., this is hard work being done over the past year to get us in line for whatever happens. And when volume comes back, I would expect to see both of those areas even improve faster.\nJeff Zekauskas: All right. Great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s a remarkable margin.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nGhansham Panjabi: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nJohn Morikis: Good morning, Ghansham.\nGhansham Panjabi: Yes, so on the do-it-yourself growth, you saw explosive demand towards the end of the first quarter, and clearly that level was sustained throughout the second quarter. Was the 20% plus increase in Consumer Brands for 2Q purely matching demand or was there some level of inventory replenishment as well? And just more broadly at the company level, including at TAG, how are you kind of thinking about any sort of do-it-yourself fatigue, given that some of the demand increase is potentially just a pull forward of activity as well?\nJohn Morikis: Well, let me just start with \u2013 I think what you\u2019re getting at is the service to the retailers. Is that correct when you talk about service?\nGhansham Panjabi: Correct.\nJohn Morikis: Well, we\u2019ve seen obviously an unprecedented level here. And the surge has been some \u2013 invited some challenge, obviously. Our teams have adapted I would say, Ghansham, decisively and quickly. But the surge was significant, and it\u2019s created some challenges. We\u2019re uniquely positioned, I think, at Sherwin-Williams to utilize assets that others might not have. And I would tell you we\u2019re pulling every lever possible. We\u2019re determined. But I would say that we\u2019re still chasing. We believe that we\u2019ll be in a position to begin building inventory again as we come out of the third quarter, going into the fourth quarter, into the first quarter. But right now, we\u2019re focused on meeting demand. And again I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t call out this terrific effort by the global supply chain team with everything they\u2019re doing in this environment, but also the ability to work with our customers. These are unprecedented times, not only for us, but also our customers. So the better line of sight that we have to be able to isolate in on what are the most important skews and working with them to deliver is really what we\u2019re after. And this is a new experience. We\u2019ll come out of this better. And we\u2019ll likely sit with our customers at the end of the year and talk about inventory levels as we begin next season. And if we need to step up and put more in inventory to serve our customers, we\u2019re going to take care of our customers. As it relates to DIY, I think fatigue as you mentioned it, we don\u2019t support that attitude by any customer, by the way. Reality is that we find that the more customers are home, more \u2013 and different customers are coming in. And in our stores, it\u2019s often referred to as it\u2019s a COVID project, where people have been in their home for some time and they might have a bedroom that they\u2019ve never really considered repainting. And they realize that it\u2019s very affordable and highly impactful project. And they tackle it. The beauty of it is, is that what we\u2019re finding is very little overlap from customers coming in. And while I\u2019m sure there are some, but it seems to be very little where customers are talking about this was a project that I was going to have a contractor do and I\u2019m going to tackle it myself. These are what we\u2019re getting from our customers in our stores are customers that are looking at a wall that\u2019s probably not been painted, likely wouldn\u2019t have been painted, and they\u2019re painting them. And so through our stores, it\u2019s a relatively small percentage. There\u2019s a nice gain. It\u2019s only 10% sales through our stores. But through our retail partners we\u2019re doing everything we can to make that an easy experience so that it\u2019s not just one project. We want it to be easy. Your question is, do they have fatigue? We want to make it a wonderful experience so it\u2019s an easy, impactful experience that they went through seamlessly and they want to do more. And we\u2019re working with our retail customers to capture those customers and make them repeat customers going forward.\nAl Mistysyn: And Ghansham, I\u2019d just add. It\u2019s not only an investment in inventory that we\u2019re doing, I think our global supply chain has come up with a number of creative solutions to expand capacity of the key product lines where we\u2019re chasing demand. And that\u2019s everything from investing in capital to retrofit 5 gallon lines which are predominantly pro to gallon lines as John talked about in the opening remarks. It\u2019s finding where we may have capacity in industrial sites that have the ability to make an exterior stain product line and ramping that quality process up and to make sure we\u2019re providing the right quality and the right process but doing it quickly to try to improve our filling rates across all the different channels. So it\u2019s not just investments in inventory, we\u2019re looking at all areas to expand our capacity.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, and you look at those assets, those facilities that are producing stain, for example, for our industrial wood where we\u2019ve got capacity right now, and these are highly technical products. So the finished product to the consumer is every good \u2013 every bit as good as if it had been manufactured in existing plant because the tight specs we operate on the industrial side. So it\u2019s really the best of asset utilizations you can get.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. And then just for my second question, given the recurrence of COVID in the southern states of the U.S., have you seen any directional shifts in demands specific to states like Florida and Texas? And do you anticipate having to make some adjustments to your sales floors being open? Thanks so much.\nJohn Morikis: We don\u2019t at this time anticipate having to adjust sales floors. I would tell you that our customers and our employees love those sales floors open, but number one is the safety of our employees. So we\u2019ll stay close to it. As of right now, we\u2019ve not. And I\u2019m not sure if you were asking about the shift of business to the southern states? If you were, I would say, we\u2019ll take it anywhere it comes. If it\u2019s in that market and it starts moving aggressively, we\u2019ll do everything we can to serve those customers wherever they are.\nGhansham Panjabi: Got it. Thanks so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Ghansham.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nBob Koort: Thank you. Good morning.\nAl Mistysyn: Good morning, Bob.\nBob Koort: I wanted to ask about China. One of your big competitors, I think they\u2019ve got an even larger business than you on the deco side there, and talked about trends getting about back to where they were before by the end of the quarter. So I was wondering, is there anything in particular to your business the cities you serve, the routes to market that would make it different and sort of what are your prospects there given that we hope maybe that the lockdown ending sooner there you would see a sooner response. Maybe something about the DIY versus pro or do-it-for-me or how can you help us characterize the trends in China?\nJohn Morikis: Well, there\u2019s very little if any DIY business there typically in China. But the approach that I would take first off is that it\u2019s a relatively small percentage of our business. We saw sales in Asia that were down significantly in the second quarter largely as a result of the COVID pandemic in architectural. We think that that\u2019s a slower recovery in the architectural business there. But again, it\u2019s really a very, very small piece of our business. We\u2019re there really looking at the future. We\u2019re investing in the right people, the right \u2013 we\u2019re doing a lot of branding work, doing a lot of research. We\u2019ve got a couple of really good tests going on right now that have gotten a little cloudy with everything that\u2019s been going on, on different aspects of our business, so. I think you should expect from our perspective that to be a bigger part of the business down the road, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going be anything that\u2019s going be material in the next quarter or even next year.\nBob Koort: Got you. Let me ask you on commercial construction broadly. Obviously, you got the coil business there and you do see some of that activity through your stores group. Is there some angst that you\u2019re going have a W kind of recovery there where we get some of the backlog finally gets through but then the commercial markets just aren\u2019t as strong given all the work from home and other issues out there? What do you sort of see as the path-forward into the second half and into 2021 for commercial construction-related activity?\nJohn Morikis: Well, to your point, we are close to that through the commercial business through our TAG business and through coil. I would say in our coil business, the resumption of select projects, it drove sequential improvement during the quarter. And I would say that so much so that we finished June positive in June. So I mean we see that momentum moving in the right direction. Not sure if there\u2019s going be an air pocket or a gap, if it does happen or when it will happen. What we\u2019re doing, Bob, we\u2019re working really hard right now to minimize any impact. We call it \u2013 I call it a pothole. We\u2019re driving down the road here. We\u2019re doing everything we can to fill that pothole. And the beauty of our model, the direct model, is that we can control that. And so we\u2019re working with our customers to understand where those projects are. So we\u2019re not waiting for customers to call and place an order or go online to place an order. We\u2019re attacking this. We know the specifications. We\u2019re trying to get more products specified. We know those projects. We know the painting contractors that are on those commercial projects. And we\u2019re leveraging our strategy, and we\u2019re capitalizing on the segments that we offer to offset whatever might be coming down the road. So I\u2019d say no one\u2019s positioned like we are to capitalize on these opportunities. But rest assured, we\u2019re not a retailer that just simply opens a door and waits for people to come in. We\u2019re out there right now hunting. We know that there might be a hole in the road. We\u2019re not waiting. We\u2019re aggressively going after it to fill it. Depending on what it looks like if there\u2019s a gap or not and how much there is, we\u2019ll find out if we experience one. But I would say this, if we do experience one, we think it will be short-lived.\nBob Koort: Terrific. Thanks for the help.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. So, John, you were just talking there about your folks are out there hunting, and I recalled part one of the ways you motivate that sales force within The Americas Group to be aggressive and out there on the hunt was a reasonably large portion of their comp was variable. Can you remind me what that is? And while it incentivizes effort, does it also contribute to lower cost of goods when there is a slowdown in sales?\nJohn Morikis: Its \u2013 for our reps, it\u2019s about a 60/40. We do not look at this as a cost saving mechanism, Steve, at all. I\u2019d say, like everyone, we expect that our employees are motivated by our incentive plans. That\u2019s why we have them. But I would say, one of our executives this morning, I was speaking with mentioned a keyword to me, pride. Pride in what we do, pride in who we are, pride in wanting to win. And I\u2019d say, this team we\u2019re leading right now, I\u2019d call them goats. These are the best. And there\u2019s an element here of incentives, and we want them to be out there to provide for their families. But they\u2019re driven by far more than that. There\u2019s a sense of pride in what we do. And we want to win. And we don\u2019t want to win by a little bit. We want to really, really win. I\u2019m going to stop right there. There\u2019s a lot of really good people doing what\u2019s right there.\nSteve Byrne: And so just getting back to the cost of goods decline in TAG was so significant. Can you break that out? What portion of that was lower raw material cost? And what were the key drivers there? I think you also had some store closures. Was that a contributor? Can you just lay that all out a little bit, please?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Why don\u2019t I take the stores, and then I\u2019ll ask Al to talk about the rest there for a second. So year-over-year, we have 68 more stores this year versus last year, given what we laid in last year. We have 178 more reps this year versus last year. For the year, we\u2019ve opened 16 new stores in North America. And that\u2019s offset by the closure of about 33 stores. 24 of those were in Latin America, nine in North America. Steve, the way I\u2019d point to the Latin America closures were these were underperforming stores in persistently soft markets. That\u2019s the way I would characterize those. The nine in North America that were closed were mainly stores in Canada that were underperforming. And we did have some stores in North America with lease expirations that we\u2019ll plan to relocate. We do expect to open 50 new stores this year, down from our originally planned 80 to 100 due to the COVID. But you should expect us to ramp back up into that 80 to 100 going forward.\nAl Mistysyn: And Steve, the TAG, starting with their customer and product mix that I talked about earlier, the DIY and res repaint performed better than the other segments, exterior versus interior and paint versus non-paint helped drive margin improvement. On the raw material side, we\u2019ve talked about ROS moderating. It\u2019s less of an impact on our architectural businesses, but it is still helping in pricing. We went out with a 3% to 4% price increase to offset other inflationary items, whether it\u2019s wages, healthcare, and the like, and that price increase is performing as expected and its effectiveness of around 2%. And then the last thing, I would say is, the team did a really nice job pivoting and really reducing discretionary spending, cutting travel very rapidly, and our SG&A was even down year-over-year, so all those helped drive that operating margin higher.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. John and Al, just looking at TAG, looking at the margins in Q3, how should we be thinking about the incremental margins either year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter given what you\u2019re seeing on ROS and volumes here?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, David, I mean we\u2019re not going to give guidance on individual segments. But you look at a couple \u2013 I\u2019ll give you a couple of data points to hopefully help you out. One is, we\u2019re going up against a strong third quarter in TAG of last year. Same-store sales were up in North America a little over 8%. They had strong operating leverage on those sales. And so we\u2019re going to go up against a pretty tough quarter. We\u2019re going to start investing back in the business, as John talked about, the advertising and merchandising that we paused is going to come into our third quarter, but we also expect to see better volume. As we talked about, same-store sales were down in the second quarter, 6.9%, our forecast right now in the third quarter for sales to be flat to up low-single-digits. And as we talked about, the better volumes we can put through our North America stores and the chain, the better leverage we get. So, whether we see sequential margin improvement will depend on where that volume comes in. If it\u2019s at the higher end of our range, we have a shot at getting sequential improvement. If not, it\u2019s going be difficult to get there. And then, year-over-year, the way ROS kind of have unfolded through last year and into this year and the product mix benefit I still expect to get in the third quarter, year-over-year, I do expect to see some modest improvement.\nDavid Begleiter: That\u2019s very helpful, Al. Appreciate that. And lastly, just on ROS, Al, where are you seeing raw materials decline? And specifically, on TiO2, what\u2019s your expectation for pricing in the back half of the year?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. David, I\u2019ll take that one. What we saw in our second quarter, the industry basket of ROS was down by mid-single-digits year-over-year and that was really driven by resins and solvents, and we don\u2019t provide the specific dollars in the quarter, but you can see that positive trend reflected in our year-over-year gross margin improvement. If we look at our outlook kind of going forward, our second quarter we expect will probably be the biggest benefit year-over-year. We still will see \u2013 and that\u2019s really because we\u2019re going to see tougher comparisons in the second half of the year. We do expect that the second half raw material basket will be down by mid-single-digit percentage overall, similar to the first half. And as Al mentioned a moment ago, it\u2019s a little more heavily weighted towards the industrial part of our business than \u2013 the benefit will be a little more there than on the architectural side. So for the full year, we\u2019re going to be down mid-single-digits or that\u2019s the expectation on ROS and that\u2019s compared to our \u2013 earlier this year, we said it would be down low single. So we\u2019re seeing some good benefit there again driven by resins and solvents. If you look at the petrochem side of the basket, we\u2019re seeing lower year-over-year propylene and ethylene pricing. More recently though what I would say is we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a sequential tick up in ethylene and propylene contracts and we\u2019ll see how that plays out as the year goes forward. On the TiO2 side of the basket, we\u2019re still anticipating stable pricing trends in the back half. Some of the third-party forecast that we look at are reflecting a little bit more economic resiliency than some of the prior forecasts, sustained by the DIY demand. I would say the North American TiO2 market has been the most stable and we have seen some indications of lower sulfate TiO2 pricing internationally. But as you know, the majority of our TiO2 buy is chloride-based TiO2, which we really haven\u2019t seen movement there. So to sum that up, again, we\u2019re going to \u2013 similar kind of in the back half, down mid-single-digits on the ROS basket led by the resins and solvent piece.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Andrews: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Maybe on DIY paint packaging, we\u2019re hearing from a variety of sources that that\u2019s starting to get tight and there are some concerns about price increases on DIY paint packaging into the back half of the year and into next year. Is that something that you\u2019re anticipating? Is this something you need to get ahead of potentially with pricing into the retail channels?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Vince, it remains to be seen if there is a gap in supply or that we are stressing our packaging suppliers for share with this unprecedented increase in demand, but we\u2019re working very closely with them. We do not expect an increase in price in the second half on packaging. And as far as a price increase, like we always do, we\u2019ll try to manage our costs first and we\u2019ll look at it as the second half unfolds and decide if an increase is needed based on the current environment, but we\u2019re not expecting an increase in our second half.\nVincent Andrews: Okay, very good. And then, just maybe you could talk a little bit about the M&A environment in both directions. Is your pipeline getting more active on the buy side? And as you\u2019ve gone through the portfolio again in the COVID environment, is there anything that you might be looking to sell?\nJohn Morikis: Well, on both sides, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re always active. There are a number of projects that we\u2019re engaged in and I\u2019d say the gap, if you will, of pretty wide margin in the midst of the COVID seems to be narrowing and good discussions are taking place. I really, really appreciate the leadership of our team here where David Sewell and our Head of Strategy, Bryan Young, are working with our leadership teams to really make sure that we\u2019re staying the course of our strategy. In times like this, people can lose their way a bit and just be out looking for sales or looking for opportunities. That\u2019s not us and we\u2019ve got a very deliberate strategy that we use that we stay true to and we\u2019re working that, and there are opportunities and we\u2019re hoping to continue to move through those aggressively. On the other side, to your point, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated if it be programs or products that are not fits, that do not fit in our company, that we take action. And I\u2019d say that we\u2019ve continued that same discipline of reviewing these programs, products, SKUs, stores, businesses, brands, everything, and you should expect that we continue to do that. When businesses fall short of the threshold that we have, to create shareholder value, we\u2019ll take action.\nVincent Andrews: Thanks very much.\nJohn Morikis: But we\u2019ll talk to our teams and the businesses before we take that public.\nVincent Andrews: Appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Hi. Thanks. I had two follow-ups: one is on gross margins; and then, the second is on the e-commerce and some of the learnings you\u2019ve gotten there. First on the gross margins, if I heard all this and pieced it together correctly, it sounds like the 330 bps expansion was roughly split between raw material price gap versus mix, and the reason the gross margins might be up less year-over-year in the second half is not raw materials per se, because you have the rest of the price increase, but it could be that some of the mix that\u2019s been extreme in the last few months starts to normalize. Am I taking that too far?\nJohn Morikis: No. I wouldn\u2019t. I think you\u2019re directionally accurate. I think in the third quarter, you wouldn\u2019t expect to see the DIY trends that we saw in the second quarter. The raw materials is a tailwind, but not as big of a tailwind in the second quarter. I guess, you know what, Greg, the way I would kind of gauge the DIY in the product mix is, if you look at our second and third quarters together between product and customer mix, I estimate a little bit below 1% of an impact, so you\u2019re directionally right there.\nGreg Melich: Got it. So, another way to think of it is the 330 bps was probably a little more than 1 point of mix, 100 bps of mix in the second quarter?\nJohn Morikis: That\u2019s approximately correct.\nGreg Melich: Yes. And then, on e-commerce, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, John, I think how the platform did well. I think last quarter you gave us some metrics on how many people used it and I know there\u2019s a lot of conversion to curbside and sort of all hands on deck. Any numbers you can give to us in terms of the number of customers, whether they be DIY\u2019ers or pros or contractors that started to use the platform, how engaged they are with it to help see how that could drive loyalty and growth?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. I\u2019d maybe characterize it this way, Greg. Our platform is certainly \u2013 we are witnessing strong utilization and increased metrics in all categories that we track. The idea here is pretty simple, it allows customers more efficiency in not only ordering products, but also in communicating with their reps and their store managers, and we want to build on this incredible relationship that we enjoy. These contractors as well as now a growing number of DIY customers are learning to rely on our people. On the professional side, these contractors would tell you that those reps and those store managers are part of their team, they\u2019re part of the contractor\u2019s team, and this is an extra step in helping our customers through our people. So, I might describe it as the last mile just got made that much easier, and we want the contractor feeling like they\u2019re part of our team and we\u2019re part of their team. And earlier, I talked about the complexity and the challenges that they\u2019re facing right now and the inability to absorb delays and run profitable efficient projects. I would tell you that this platform is helping our customers on the professional side to run much more efficiently and we absolutely see loyalty increasing. We ask a lot of questions and the most important one that I think we ask is who helps you make more money, and that gap is getting wider and we enjoy that. As it relates to the DIY side, we clearly have experienced a number of new customers using this platform on the DIY side. Our scores there are going up dramatically and it\u2019s working quite well. We\u2019re investing here heavily, because we believe this is another great opportunity for differentiation.\nGreg Melich: As a percentage of customers, is that more take up on the pro side or with DIY?\nJohn Morikis: Pro side.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. RPM indicated that quarantining has brought out the inner DIY\u2019er in a number of people who maybe didn\u2019t think of themselves as DIY\u2019er before. I thought DIY versus pro in residential repaint was mostly demographics driven. So, if we go out a year from now or 18 months from now, do you think we normalize that\u2019s there or do you think we structurally kind of shift up a little bit here?\nJohn Morikis: I think we normalize. I think if you look in the past and compare to what\u2019s happened historically, John, we\u2019ve seen these shifts temporarily during unique times. But what we also have to take into consideration is an aging demographic, home price appreciation, aging housing starts. In the last recession to your point, the DIY grew, but not huge amounts and it wasn\u2019t protracted. So, we think that there are some shifts that occur during these times while people are home, as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s affordable, it\u2019s impactful, and you can make a difference. But overall, every time we\u2019ve seen this and we expect it going forward. And quite frankly, another stat that I didn\u2019t share earlier, I shared it maybe in the comments about the res repaint. The reason I say this with confidence, we \u2013 listening to our customers, they\u2019re telling us in June of 2020, they have more bids going out than they had in June of 2019. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the trend.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDuffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. First, congrats on a bang-up quarter. I wanted to dig in, this is year three for the big Lowe\u2019s switchover and last year you had talked a little bit, you weren\u2019t quite where you wanted to be operationally, now obviously this year, big year just macro from the market side. But is that system now set up where you like \u2013 where your reps are able to go in and help them sell and you\u2019re kind of hitting on all cylinders there or how long do you think that takes to get \u2013 you never get to the endpoint, but to kind of a cruising altitude I guess?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. You\u2019re right. There is no finish line in anything that we do, Duffy. So, I like the way you characterize that. Marvin and his team at Lowe\u2019s, Bill Boltz and Joe McFarland, these are wonderful leaders. They\u2019re driving for improvement and we want to help them. And they\u2019re giving us access, they\u2019re allowing our teams to work with their teams, and we believe that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity ahead of us. We\u2019re on a runway and we\u2019re screaming down it. But I think together, there\u2019s a lot more that we can do and we\u2019re looking forward to that. I think these are two wonderful organizations that work together can do a lot. And we like that for two reasons, both the DIY side, but also as a professional that prefers a home center experience that\u2019s typically, we call them the pro that paints. They might be a remodeler, they might be doing different professional projects, and they pick up paint as part of that experience, and they prefer the home center with the product choices. And so our ability to help them be more successful is an important part of our strategy and we look forward to that. So there\u2019s a lot more to be done.\nDuffy Fischer: Great. And then, you mentioned you\u2019re increasing CapEx in the back half by $100 million, which is a very large sum for you guys versus your historic CapEx. Is that new plants or what is that \u2013 new capacity that you need to bring online, what is it that we get with that extra $100 million?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Duffy, as I talked on our first quarter call, the reduction in CapEx was really pausing some of these architectural and packaging capacity expansions. As we saw the sales trends come through the second quarter, we restarted those expansion plans, just because they could take 12 months to 16 months to get an expansion of good \u2013 a sizable expansion in place and that takes our CapEx up to $280 million which is still about 1.5% of sales. So, as long as \u2013 I think we\u2019re trying to control CapEx below that 2%, we\u2019ve done that pretty much over the last few years and we\u2019ll continue to do that. But we need the capacity and we\u2019re going to start those projects back up.\nDuffy Fischer: Perfect. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nTruman Patterson: Hi. Good afternoon, guys, and a great quarter. First, just wanted to follow up on a prior question, your resi repaint contractor, I believe you said in June that interior got back to flat. Could you just give an update for July? I\u2019m really trying to understand whether or not in the second wave areas of COVID that are having another flare-up, whether or not we\u2019re seeing that interior contractor business on the repaint side really get impacted and forward impacts us.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. I don\u2019t know that we want to get into too much detail here. Let me just give you maybe some insight. I\u2019d say that in more rural areas I would describe it as there\u2019s more likely a business as usual than in more metro areas. We are experiencing more customers penetrating the home in the interior, but it\u2019s still spotty. And I would tell you that the bids that I mentioned earlier have a lot of people feeling really good on the contractor side, because they\u2019re not just exterior bids that they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re doing both bidding for interior and exterior. So, I think it\u2019s just a matter of time and it\u2019s starting to roll in and our customers are feeling good, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just going be a light switch that\u2019s going to come back online.\nJohn Morikis: Okay. What I\u2019d add to that Truman is just that, as we said, DIY continues to be a strong performer and the resi repaint and the new res continue to be the ones that are sort of leading the recovery while commercial and property maintenance are also improving, but resi and resi repaint continue to be sort of the leaders in the clubhouse.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And then, next question on gross margin. You all are already at 48% in the second quarter. Just hoping you can give some updated thoughts on your long-term gross margin targets, because I think we\u2019re bumping up towards the high end of them.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Truman, as you know, our long-term gross margin target is at 45% to 48%. I would say over time, we\u2019ll continue to look at adjusting that, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to do that at this point. The demand surge and the trends that we\u2019re seeing and the product mix, customer mix, we talked about these being shorter term. We\u2019ll get through \u2013 we expect to get the positive trends through this quarter, but go back to some more normalized levels. And then, I think we\u2019ve got to see how the recovery in our Performance Coatings comes out to say \u2013 before we\u2019re ready to say we think we should move that long-term target up. I think we\u2019ve done a lot of work through our different segments, through our different divisions and regions to really drive complexity out of our supply chain and be more efficient, and those will pay off when demand and volume start to pick up again, but I\u2019m just not ready to raise that target just yet.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun, your line is live. You may proceed with your questions.\nArun Viswanathan: Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Good morning. Apologies for that. Yes. I guess my first question is just on the guidance. So, the midpoint being $22.50 now, I guess excluding the amortization and charges, I guess, maybe you can just kind of lay out maybe some of the factors that maybe could drive you to the upper end of that range. Would it be kind of maybe a swifter recovery in performance or would it be maybe a longer tail on consumer? Yeah. Maybe just provide some details on maybe the upper end of the guidance. Thanks.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Arun, I think it starts with the sales volumes in our TAG organization. We, like I mentioned earlier, are going up against a tougher third quarter, but a tougher fourth quarter as well. But as TAG drives volume, we get a lot of operating leverage on that volume. And you mentioned it, if the DIY surge continues longer than we expect, again, we expect to get a nice operating leverage there. And then, our Performance Coatings Group, the trends that John talked about sequentially through the second quarter, if some of those pick up faster, whether it\u2019s auto refinish, GI, industrial wood, which are probably on the farther end of the scale of where we think \u2013 let me rephrase that, auto refinish more in the middle, GI and industrial wood at the longer end of the scale of recovery, if those do pick up back quicker, yes, I think we can see ourselves to the high end of that range.\nArun Viswanathan: So, it sounds like it\u2019s mostly volume-driven. And then, just I guess maybe thinking longer-term, maybe you can just give us your perspective on your business. You benefited quite heavily from the shift to do-it-for-me over the last several years and now we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a shift back to DIY. I guess, A, do you think that\u2019s structural? And then, B, I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about your paint stores business longer term. You\u2019re often grown in the 1.5 to 2 times market rate, it seems like you\u2019re poised to increase that now maybe to 2 or 3 times the market rate. So, I guess maybe just stress those two issues and see if I\u2019m thinking about that the correct way. Thanks.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. On our stores, I think we\u2019re just getting started. I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity and we\u2019ve got a wonderful team that\u2019s executing well and we\u2019re excited about where we\u2019re going, and there\u2019s a lot of really good things in the pipeline that we\u2019re excited to talk to you about in the future. Regarding the do-it-yourself versus do-it-for-me, as I mentioned earlier, we think that we\u2019ve seen this movie before. There is a shift to do-it-yourself, it gradually shifts back, and those are based on fundamentals, an aging population, dual income, the pension or market wealth that\u2019s created, home values that are improving. And quite frankly, a general focus on life, the quality of life and people enjoy the benefit and the impact of a newly painted room or home, and not all of them enjoy doing it themselves, but it\u2019s a relatively inexpensive but impactful experience. And we don\u2019t quite frankly care how it\u2019s applied. We just want to make sure it\u2019s our product going on, and it could be a do-it-yourselfer or it could be a do-it-for-me, it could be \u2013 and we talked about remodel or new home. We just \u2013 we have teams focused on every square field, every corner of the room. We just want to be there when that gallon is sold and be the one that\u2019s providing that solution.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks. Good luck on the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Petrie with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nP.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. This is P.J. Juvekar. Good morning or good afternoon. Just couple of quick ones on DIY. DIY did well across all big boxes. I was wondering if you and your partner there gained share. Do you feel you gained share and what happened to retail prices this year?\nAl Mistysyn: I think it\u2019s a little early to tell if we\u2019ve gained share. I\u2019d tell you we\u2019re not satisfied and I think you\u2019d be disappointed in us if we were. So, we\u2019re still working to improve regardless of if we\u2019re gaining share or not. There\u2019s still a lot of opportunity and we want to work with our retail partners to be able to capture that share. I\u2019m sorry, your second question, was what?\nP.J. Juvekar: On the pricing on the retail side, paint pricing?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. I think that\u2019s a better answer coming from our customers themselves than us commenting on.\nP.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then, just one more on DIY. Are you trying to get some DIY customers in your stores through your digital app and any progress there or strategy there? Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Again, as mentioned earlier, it\u2019s about 10% of our store business, so it\u2019s a relatively small percentage and there are customers that prefer a specialty store experience, and if they\u2019re going to make that decision, we\u2019d hope that they choose ours. But I know that you\u2019ve been in our stores and you\u2019ve seen how we\u2019re modeled and what we do, I think there\u2019s a large percentage of that contractor business that is out there for us to gain and that\u2019s mainly the focus of our stores.\nP.J. Juvekar: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn McNulty: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on cash flows. Normally your second half is always a much stronger quarter \u2013 or excuse me, half and you tend to see about 70% of your free cash at least in the last few years in the back half. I guess given the strength that you saw in the second quarter, should we still be assuming that or is it a little bit more of a wonky kind of year where maybe the front end has a little bit more than normal? How should we be thinking about that?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. John, I think you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s kind of a wonky year with strength in DIY, certainly through our stores, they\u2019re not going on account. Our working capital is lower in our first half. As John talked about, we\u2019re going to start building inventory coming out of our third quarter into our fourth quarter and that will be a little bit of a headwind in our second half as far as cash is concerned. And then, the profitability that we saw in the first half, because of the tougher comp in the second half and some of the product and customer mix and things I talked about earlier, you just aren\u2019t going see a big of an improvement when you look at our full year guidance. But we\u2019re going to build inventory and that\u2019s going to be a little bit of a drag on our cash in the second half. It still should be positive year-over-year, but not quite as positive.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Good afternoon. Wanted to ask about your packaging coatings business, I think you mentioned it grew at a high-single-digit pace. In recent weeks, we\u2019ve been hearing about aluminum can shortages and I\u2019m curious as to whether you\u2019ve observed that and perhaps it would be a high-class problem if it\u2019s a problem at all. But can you \u2013 are there enough cans out there for you to continue to grow rapidly in the business?\nJohn Morikis: There is plenty of opportunity for us to grow. This is the strongest performer that we have in our industrial business. I mentioned the sales up high-single-digits. To your point, demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. We have a terrific and unique technology in our V70 coating that continues to win and convert new customers, new lines, and it\u2019s because of the flexibility, the speed, the ease of application, our customers are running more efficiently through the plans to be able to do that. So, yes, we expect this business to continue to grow, it\u2019s another area with wonderful leadership, great technology, great customers and we\u2019re putting a lot of fuel in this tank.\nKevin McCarthy: Good to hear. And then secondly, wanted to follow up on e-commerce. Are your margins through the e-commerce channel today higher, lower or similar to the same sale through a traditional channel? And as you continue to grow rapidly from a smaller base, how might that evolve? Just trying to get a sense for if and when this could become a meaningful swing factor in margin analysis moving forward?\nJohn Morikis: Kevin, I think you should model in as basically the same margins.\nKevin McCarthy: Easy enough. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Stevenson: Hey. This is Jeff Stevenson on for Garik. How are you?\nJohn Morikis: Hey, Jeff.\nJeff Stevenson: Hey. My first question was just on the outlook for the auto refinish business. Are you seeing any improvement as lockdowns are eased, miles driven have improved, and maybe even a shift away from mass transit?\nJohn Morikis: We do see the improvement. We saw it sequentially as the quarter unfolded and we expect that to continue. Again, we\u2019ve spoke in the last couple of calls about the technology and our play here and the performance of this business and it\u2019s moving in the right direction, obviously, but miles driven and traffic congestion would help this business. This is a business that when you look at the drivers, given what we\u2019ve done with this business over the last 18 to 24 months, resumption of more normal travel routines will benefit us significantly.\nJeff Stevenson: Okay, great. And then, in new residential, you mentioned the sequential improvement in June. But as we look at the back half, are you seeing an acceleration similar to what builders are seeing? And then, two, are you seeing any problem with contractor labor as housing starts start to accelerate?\nJohn Morikis: We are experiencing some contractor labor issues, not only in new residential, commercial, even res repaint and you wouldn\u2019t think that given the unemployment rate. But I\u2019ve spoken with a number of contractors who have mentioned that it\u2019s difficult for them to find people, qualified people that are willing to work, given the unemployment rates that they\u2019re receiving. So, it is an issue. I would say to your question about the trend, many of our builders \u2013 first, we do see it, largely because of our position in the market. We\u2019ve got a terrific position in the national homebuilders. We\u2019ve talked about having 18 of the top 20 national homebuilders in exclusive relationships and we\u2019ve been making very good penetration in the regional builders. And let me just take a slight detour and say our national account business, outside of just the builder, that our national account business in total across all our U.S. stores platform, the activity there is fantastic. So we\u2019re really leveraging our platform and really trying to drive the differentiation between us and others. That said, back on the builder, we are clearly enjoying this partnership with our builders. They are experiencing \u2013 many of them have said June was their best month ever. And so, we believe that the quarter bodes well for the future. The other point of differentiation I would make that we\u2019re hearing from our builders is that they continue to reference our ability to offer the services that we provide, both the reps and inventory, close to them as an important lever. Many of them have asked other suppliers to come visit us here in Cleveland to understand what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re doing it. And I think that when you look at our position, it\u2019s become more pronounced given some of the challenges that some builders have had with disruptions in other categories. For us, it\u2019s terrific business, it\u2019s 5 gallon bucket, so it\u2019s easy to serve us, it doesn\u2019t have an impact on the do-it-yourself business, it allows us to serve them well and we can execute for these national homebuilders across the country like no one else can.\nJeff Stevenson: Thanks and congrats on the great quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Bosshard: Thank you. In terms of the interior business, John, I know that you talked briefly about it, but just curious in terms of the momentum on the interior side. I know you indicated that contractors are more bullish and that\u2019s looking at the business in total. But curious about what the trends are on in terms of interior? And then, also if you could remind us of the interior/exterior mix within the stores by 2Q, 3Q, 4Q? Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: So, let me point \u2013 I think Eric to reiterate again, my comments I think on the trends, I might point back to the bidding activity that we\u2019re experiencing with our customers, the fact that in June, there were more bids this year versus last year in a growing percentage now including the interior. So, the \u2013 I\u2019m trying to give you some color without getting into specific numbers to be truthful with you, but we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. The fact is, is that our customers are recognizing that it\u2019s not going be this afternoon if they\u2019re in someone\u2019s home, but they\u2019re using virtual tools to estimate. Their customers are interested in having their homes painted. There is a sense of wanting to almost get their place in line. And our customers enjoy that, because it allows them to tackle the exterior which is turning out to be an excellent exterior season for our contractors and they\u2019re enjoying the opportunity that many of these interior projects or these customers are getting in line with the expectation that those homes are going be painted by these same pros.\nAl Mistysyn: And Eric, on the interior-to-exterior ratio and the out-quarters, first quarter, fourth quarter, it\u2019s about 4:1. As you get into the two middle quarters, as the weather improves in the Midwest and Eastern, it trend to that 3:1, in a normal environment, it\u2019s probably a little less than that through these next second and third quarters because of the trends we\u2019re seeing.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So, I\u2019d like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Jaye for any additional closing comments.\nJim Jaye: Yes. Thank you, Jessie, and thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call today. Just one reminder, I\u2019d like to tell you that we\u2019ll be hosting our virtual Financial Community Presentation on Tuesday, September 29, so registration details will be coming out on that soon. Look for that. We hope you\u2019ll be able to join us for that. And as always, Eric Swanson and myself will be available for your follow-up questions the rest of this week and into next week. So, thank you so much. Have a great day and stay safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Al Mistysyn",
            "content": "Hey, Chris, this is Al Mistysyn. Hope you're doing well. Yes, I think we're pleased with the progress we're making on operating margin within Consumer Brand. I think you're right; it's too soon to come off our long-term margin target of that 20% range. As we've always talked about, volume is the single biggest driver of leverage across all our businesses. And with the unprecedented surge we're seeing in DIY across all channels, that is absolutely driving the majority of the margin improvement. And you would expect, and we expect that the demand will return to more normalized levels as the year progresses. That being said, there absolutely is good cost control taking place in North America. As you recall, we exited the ACE business last year. That helped improve our gross margin, our operating margin. We took action to reduce our footprint and costs around that. And we've also taken action, as John talked about in his opening remarks, on our international businesses. We've commented before, the performance of those businesses haven't been up to what we expect. I think the team has done a nice job with a variety of things; pricing actions, SKU rationalizations to make those operations more efficient, cost reductions and even in \u2013 we talked about the European flow through. In our first quarter we saw a nice similar improvement in flow through on our second quarter, and then even in Asia and Australia where we saw sales backwards, we're still positive on profit. So there's a number of factors that are allowing us to drive these margins, but volume is always first. Yes, Jeff, we're \u2013 as you know, we're a LIFO, last in, first out, kind of company, so you might see a little bit of that. But we churn our raw materials so quickly, especially in this kind of environment on the architectural side with DIY, it's not meaningful in that respect because of the turns that we get. The just-in-time inventory that our suppliers do a great job keeping up with us and this environment, with the DIY surge that we talked about, a lot of impact on gallon cans and other specific raw materials related to that. So it's \u2013 we're churning our inventories very quickly on raw materials. Right. No, Jeff, I think there's a number of things that are occurring in our second quarter that give us a tailwind. You bring up \u2013 you talk about the volume through our Consumer Brands Group that we just talked about on the previous question with Chris. When you see that kind of volume, and in our first quarter, we also talked about customer and mix change. And that's across really each of the segments. In some respects, you got TAG that we talked about with DIY and res repaint performing better than the other segments. We talked about from a product standpoint exterior growing faster than interior, paint growing faster than non-paint. I talked about the exiting of the ACE business that as you know it was a drag on our gross margin. That helps. And then we did see \u2013 as John talked about in the opening comments, lower raw material costs. And we expected to see that in our second quarter with the way raw materials trended last year and with our second quarter likely being our biggest year-over-year change. And then even \u2013 I would say, even within our Performance Coatings Group with the different segment growths and the different region growths, there's a mix there that helps. And then finally, as TAG performs better than Performance Coatings, that segment mix gives you some lift. So it's really a combination of a number of those things happening. But I would say with PCG, for example, the consumer businesses outside of the U.S., this is hard work being done over the past year to get us in line for whatever happens. And when volume comes back, I would expect to see both of those areas even improve faster. Thanks Jeff. And Ghansham, I'd just add. It's not only an investment in inventory that we're doing, I think our global supply chain has come up with a number of creative solutions to expand capacity of the key product lines where we're chasing demand. And that's everything from investing in capital to retrofit 5 gallon lines which are predominantly pro to gallon lines as John talked about in the opening remarks. It's finding where we may have capacity in industrial sites that have the ability to make an exterior stain product line and ramping that quality process up and to make sure we're providing the right quality and the right process but doing it quickly to try to improve our filling rates across all the different channels. So it's not just investments in inventory, we're looking at all areas to expand our capacity. Good morning, Bob. And Steve, the TAG, starting with their customer and product mix that I talked about earlier, the DIY and res repaint performed better than the other segments, exterior versus interior and paint versus non-paint helped drive margin improvement. On the raw material side, we've talked about ROS moderating. It's less of an impact on our architectural businesses, but it is still helping in pricing. We went out with a 3% to 4% price increase to offset other inflationary items, whether it's wages, healthcare, and the like, and that price increase is performing as expected and its effectiveness of around 2%. And then the last thing, I would say is, the team did a really nice job pivoting and really reducing discretionary spending, cutting travel very rapidly, and our SG&A was even down year-over-year, so all those helped drive that operating margin higher. Yes, David, I mean we're not going to give guidance on individual segments. But you look at a couple \u2013 I'll give you a couple of data points to hopefully help you out. One is, we're going up against a strong third quarter in TAG of last year. Same-store sales were up in North America a little over 8%. They had strong operating leverage on those sales. And so we're going to go up against a pretty tough quarter. We're going to start investing back in the business, as John talked about, the advertising and merchandising that we paused is going to come into our third quarter, but we also expect to see better volume. As we talked about, same-store sales were down in the second quarter, 6.9%, our forecast right now in the third quarter for sales to be flat to up low-single-digits. And as we talked about, the better volumes we can put through our North America stores and the chain, the better leverage we get. So, whether we see sequential margin improvement will depend on where that volume comes in. If it's at the higher end of our range, we have a shot at getting sequential improvement. If not, it's going be difficult to get there. And then, year-over-year, the way ROS kind of have unfolded through last year and into this year and the product mix benefit I still expect to get in the third quarter, year-over-year, I do expect to see some modest improvement. Yes. Vince, it remains to be seen if there is a gap in supply or that we are stressing our packaging suppliers for share with this unprecedented increase in demand, but we're working very closely with them. We do not expect an increase in price in the second half on packaging. And as far as a price increase, like we always do, we'll try to manage our costs first and we'll look at it as the second half unfolds and decide if an increase is needed based on the current environment, but we're not expecting an increase in our second half. Yes, Duffy, as I talked on our first quarter call, the reduction in CapEx was really pausing some of these architectural and packaging capacity expansions. As we saw the sales trends come through the second quarter, we restarted those expansion plans, just because they could take 12 months to 16 months to get an expansion of good \u2013 a sizable expansion in place and that takes our CapEx up to $280 million which is still about 1.5% of sales. So, as long as \u2013 I think we're trying to control CapEx below that 2%, we've done that pretty much over the last few years and we'll continue to do that. But we need the capacity and we're going to start those projects back up. Yes. I don't know that we want to get into too much detail here. Let me just give you maybe some insight. I'd say that in more rural areas I would describe it as there's more likely a business as usual than in more metro areas. We are experiencing more customers penetrating the home in the interior, but it's still spotty. And I would tell you that the bids that I mentioned earlier have a lot of people feeling really good on the contractor side, because they're not just exterior bids that they're doing, they're doing both bidding for interior and exterior. So, I think it's just a matter of time and it's starting to roll in and our customers are feeling good, but I don't think it's just going be a light switch that's going to come back online. Yes. Truman, as you know, our long-term gross margin target is at 45% to 48%. I would say over time, we'll continue to look at adjusting that, but I don't think we're ready to do that at this point. The demand surge and the trends that we're seeing and the product mix, customer mix, we talked about these being shorter term. We'll get through \u2013 we expect to get the positive trends through this quarter, but go back to some more normalized levels. And then, I think we've got to see how the recovery in our Performance Coatings comes out to say \u2013 before we're ready to say we think we should move that long-term target up. I think we've done a lot of work through our different segments, through our different divisions and regions to really drive complexity out of our supply chain and be more efficient, and those will pay off when demand and volume start to pick up again, but I'm just not ready to raise that target just yet. Yes. Arun, I think it starts with the sales volumes in our TAG organization. We, like I mentioned earlier, are going up against a tougher third quarter, but a tougher fourth quarter as well. But as TAG drives volume, we get a lot of operating leverage on that volume. And you mentioned it, if the DIY surge continues longer than we expect, again, we expect to get a nice operating leverage there. And then, our Performance Coatings Group, the trends that John talked about sequentially through the second quarter, if some of those pick up faster, whether it's auto refinish, GI, industrial wood, which are probably on the farther end of the scale of where we think \u2013 let me rephrase that, auto refinish more in the middle, GI and industrial wood at the longer end of the scale of recovery, if those do pick up back quicker, yes, I think we can see ourselves to the high end of that range. I think it's a little early to tell if we've gained share. I'd tell you we're not satisfied and I think you'd be disappointed in us if we were. So, we're still working to improve regardless of if we're gaining share or not. There's still a lot of opportunity and we want to work with our retail partners to be able to capture that share. I'm sorry, your second question, was what? Yes. I think that's a better answer coming from our customers themselves than us commenting on. Yes. John, I think you're absolutely right. It's kind of a wonky year with strength in DIY, certainly through our stores, they're not going on account. Our working capital is lower in our first half. As John talked about, we're going to start building inventory coming out of our third quarter into our fourth quarter and that will be a little bit of a headwind in our second half as far as cash is concerned. And then, the profitability that we saw in the first half, because of the tougher comp in the second half and some of the product and customer mix and things I talked about earlier, you just aren't going see a big of an improvement when you look at our full year guidance. But we're going to build inventory and that's going to be a little bit of a drag on our cash in the second half. It still should be positive year-over-year, but not quite as positive. And Eric, on the interior-to-exterior ratio and the out-quarters, first quarter, fourth quarter, it's about 4:1. As you get into the two middle quarters, as the weather improves in the Midwest and Eastern, it trend to that 3:1, in a normal environment, it's probably a little less than that through these next second and third quarters because of the trends we're seeing."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Let me begin by thanking the more than 60,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams for their continued determination and resilience under very challenging circumstances. As I mentioned on our last call, our senior leaders have persevered through several previous crises. Their experience has been a true differentiator during this time and enabled us to deliver significant improvement across many measures in the quarter. Our entire team has my appreciation and respect, as they continue to serve our customers at a high level. The quarter played out better than we anticipated with the pace of year-over-year decline decreasing sequentially throughout the quarter. Consolidated sales were down by a mid teens percentage in April, but came out of the quarter with June flat to last year. The pace of recovery was faster than expected in some end markets, which led us to revise our sales guidance on June 22. As Jim mentioned, gross margin in the quarter expanded to 48%, driven by favorable customer and product mix and lower input costs. The industry basket of raw materials was down by mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter compared to the prior year. In terms of cost control, our team quickly developed and began implementing a comprehensive contingency plan in March to adjust to the pandemic. We reduced the SG&A spending in the quarter by $40 million, but also maintain strategic investments to support long-term growth. Let me talk a bit about trends we're seeing in each of our segments before moving on to our outlook. In The Americas Group, we're now into the summer painting season and no one is better positioned to serve professional painters than we are. We've safely and responsibly opened all our store sales force in the U.S. and Canada and customers in all segments tell us they're eager to get back to work. Last quarter, we commented that we believed that we were seeing a pause in demand rather than demand destruction. We still believe this is the case based on the momentum we saw in multiple segments as the quarter progressed. While we don't typically comment on the pace of business by month, I would like to provide a few data points that maybe helpful given the current extraordinary circumstances. In DIY our business continued to grow at an unprecedented pace and was robust throughout the quarter. After DIY, new residential and residential repaint were the best performers in the quarter and both recovered to deliver positive growth in June. Commercial improved in each month of the quarter and was down slightly in June. Property maintenance and protective and marine also improved sequentially, but have not yet returned to grow. From a product perspective, exterior paint is recovering faster than interior paint, as you would expect due to social distancing requirements. Exterior paint sales increased by mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter and with June being the strongest month in the quarter. The interior paint sales decreased by low-single-digit percentage in the quarter, but improved throughout the quarter, finishing June flat to last year. Additionally, spray equipment pump sales are often a good indicator of future demand as contractors are unlikely to invest in this type of equipment, unless they anticipate significant future demand. Spray equipment and pump sales were down mid single digits in the quarter, but recovered to finish strong in the month of June. Pricing came in as we expected and was approximately 2% in the second quarter. We expect a similar level of effectiveness in the third quarter. We still anticipate opening approximately 50 new stores this year, while continuing to focus on adding sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products and productivity enhancing services. We also continue to invest in our e-commerce platform and we're pleased with the continuing uptick in usage. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. DIY demand surged throughout the quarter, driven by consumers nesting and tackling home improvement projects during the pandemic. We generated strong double-digit growth by working closely with our retail customers to capture this demand, most notably Lowe's, our exclusive national home center partner. Our global supply chain organization continued to adapt and invest during the quarter, including pivoting from 5 gallon pails to single gallon cans on multiple production lines to help meet the unprecedented DIY demand. Internationally, we saw positive growth in Europe, while China and Australia remained soft. We leveraged the strong sales growth to drive significant operating margin improvement compared to the prior year. Our margin improvement also reflects the benefit of actions taken over the past year to focus our portfolio, including rationalizing SKUs, exiting the ACE private label business, streamlining our European business, and reducing costs in Asia and Australia. This enhanced profitability will enable us to reinvest in the business to drive long-term growth for our retail partners, especially in the Handyman remodeler, pros who paint category. Lastly, let me comment on the trends in the Performance Coatings Group. Demand improved sequentially across the group in the quarter, though the pace of improvement remained variable by geography and business unit. From a geographic perspective, Asia was the strongest performer in the quarter, down by a low-single-digit percentage. All other regions were down by double-digit percentages, though North America was significantly better than Europe and Latin America. In packaging, sales were positive in every region for the quarter and were up a high-single-digit percentage. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. In coil coatings, the resumption of selected commercial construction projects drove sequential improvements during the quarter, including exiting the quarter positively in June. This improvement aligns with my earlier comments on commercial construction within the TAG segment, which improved sequentially in the quarter. In industrial wood, we saw sequential sales improvement during the quarter. Many of the end markets served by this business including furniture, kitchen cabinetry and flooring are influenced by trends in new residential construction, which has gained momentum in our TAG business as I mentioned earlier. In general industrial, most end markets including heavy equipment, agriculture, transportation and general finishing, remained soft, though the business did improve sequentially. Encouragingly, general industrial was up high-single digits in Asia for the quarter. All other regions were down double-digit percentages in the quarter. In automotive refinish, miles driven and traffic congestion remain at reduced levels. We saw sequential improvement in the business during the quarter, though a return to growth continues to depend on the lifting of stay-at-home orders and the resumption of more normal travel routines. Certainly, the pandemic is not over, and numerous uncertainties in the economic environment remain. However, to the extent that economies are beginning to shift from the containment phase to the recovery phase of the pandemic, our team is energized and engaged to capture current opportunities and deliver above market growth. We anticipate third quarter demand to improve sequentially from the second quarter but softness to continue in some end markets in the U.S., and internationally for the remainder of 2020. Against this backdrop, we anticipate third quarter 2020 consolidated net sales will be up or down by a low-single-digit percentage versus the third quarter of 2019. Looking at our operating segments for the third quarter, we anticipate The Americas Group to be flat to up by a low-single digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up a low-double digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be down by low to mid-single digit percentage. For the full year 2020, we're revising our sales guidance upward modestly to approximately flat with last year. This guidance reflects continued uncertainties in the timing and pace of improvement in the U.S. and global operating environments. On an operating segment basis for the full year, we anticipate The Americas Group to be flat to up by a low-single-digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up by a high-single-digit percentage, and Performance Coatings Group to be down by a low to mid-single-digit percentage. We are revising our diluted net income per share guidance for 2020 to be in the range of $19.21 to $20.71 per share compared to our previous guidance of $16.46 to $18.46 per share, and compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $2.54 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2020 earnings per share of $21.75 to $23.25, an increase of 6.5% at the midpoint over the $21.12 we delivered last year. Embedded within our outlook is the assumption that the industry raw material basket will be lower for the full year by a mid-single digit percentage. Based on our current outlook, we expect the second quarter will be the most beneficial in terms of year-over-year deflation. We expect the second half benefit will be less than the first half benefit, given comparisons to the deflation we saw in the back half of 2019. Let me close with some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remains the strength of the company. At June 30, 2020, we had $188 million in cash, and approximately $3 billion of unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities. Our leverage ratio improved to 2.8 times on total debt to adjusted EBITDA compared to 3.3 times a year ago. Given the improving sequential demand we are seeing in several end markets, we're raising our CapEx guidance for the year from $180 million to $280 million. This is largely related to architectural and packaging capacity expansions restarting. This CapEx guidance includes a minimal amount of spending related to our new headquarters and R&D facility project. Earlier this month, the company's Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $1.34 per share, an increase of 18.6% over the $1.13 per share dividend paid in the second quarter of 2019. We are committed to maintain this dividend increase throughout the rest of 2020. In May, we paid off $429 million in 2.25% notes that were due. Our next long-term debt maturity is $25 million due in 2021, followed by $660 million due in 2022. We paused open market share purchases during the second quarter, believing it inappropriate to be buying shares at a time when we were forced to adjust our workforce and pause multiple spending programs. Again, given a stabilizing environment, we would expect to return to repurchases in the second half of the year, with a minimum goal of offsetting dilution from options. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have a long tenured and experienced management team that has successfully managed the company through many challenging times. They have demonstrated this ability once again over the last several months, and I'm confident they will continue to deliver strong results. We also believe the long-term fundamental strengths of our end markets remain intact. We have the people, the products and the services to help our customers succeed. We remain very confident about the future and our ability to create shareholder value over the long-term. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Yes. And Chris, I would just add a couple of other items. One is, I do think we're operating more efficiently this year versus last year in serving our customers. I think that's a tribute to our global supply chain team doing a really terrific job and better planning and execution. We're more efficient I think this year in serving our customers; we're optimizing our supply chain better. We're doing this, I might add, while investing CapEx in areas such as our filling lines and dealing with the COVID challenges that everyone is dealing with. And I'd like to just call out our global supply chain team during this really challenging time, this COVID issue. There's a team that's working 24/7 throughout all of this to serve our customers and to help our customers win. So I think we're being a little more effective in utilizing and optimizing our supply chain. You also asked about the COVID-19 environment and what we're learning. And I would say for me, what that's done is it's really reinforced the importance of our strategy. We have long spoken about this approach that we're taking on really driving value for our shareholders by focusing on what's right, where our customers value our solutions. And the other approach that I'd say is we're really focused on covering all the bases. And I think what's happening right now, you asked about the DIY, is a great example. We've got a terrific focus on our residential repaint. But we've also been really focused on helping our customers grow DIY. And we take that approach in each of the markets we serve. So, whichever way the table tilts, we want to be first-in-line right there. So if it's DIY versus res repaint, if it's new residential versus remodeling, if it's commercial \u2013 new versus commercial repaint or whatever segment pops up, we want to be number one there. Well, you pretty much covered the entire company with that question, Chris, so yes. No. It's good. It's good. We love it. Let me start with the res repaint. We did see sequential improvement in the quarter. It turned positive in June largely driven by the exteriors that we talked about. We do see customers delaying interior work, that's related to the COVID-19 as you would expect. It's very uncommon to hear of projects that have been canceled, so we expect the interior to return, albeit probably gradually. To your point about our share gains there in res repaint, it is an area of focus. We are very pleased with the performance and we've been talking quite a while about this idea of new accounts and share of wallet. And we're really trying to drive this. And we're really trying to bring more solutions to our customers right now than ever before. And this is an environment where our solutions add value. Complexity and challenges that our customers face, they allow us to demonstrate our solutions. And we are we believe uniquely positioned to help our customers to deliver. They want high quality projects. They want product on time. They want it efficiently. And they want to make more money. And we help them do that. And I believe when you dial it down, and there's a lot of detail into it, but if you look at it, I think it's \u2013 our stores are where they're needed, our products are where they're needed, our innovation is where it's needed. Our people are trained, they're knowledgeable. We hire the best. We do everything we can to keep them. Our voluntary turnover is in single digits, so we've built these terrific relationships with customers and we work really hard to make them successful. And while these customers are experiencing delays or new regulations, if it's COVID or just emotions that they're dealing with customers, there's no room for errors, no room for disruptions. And our stores and our reps and those relationships help us tremendously. As it relates to commercial, I would say we saw sequential improvement in the second quarter, the pace of recovery, I would say has been more muted than the residential side. Projects have started to reopen and may have some limitations to them as our contractors are learning to work with social distancing and the limits around them of how many workers can be on a project and its slowing efficiency for our contractors. As a reminder I might say that new commercial starts are typically painted 12 to 18 months after the ground is broken. So we've got a little runway here. But as far as we see, this is again a terrific opportunity. These are contractors who \u2013 these are typically very large projects. They're bid projects so they're competitive and these customers; they don't want delays or problems. And they learn to lean on our teams to be able to run their project successfully. Trend wise, I would say that the \u2013 when you look at the Architectural Billings Index, it's improved sequentially. In May, it was 32. It's now in June up to 40, still below the 50 expansion threshold that shows it's growing. But we remain pretty optimistic about this. It's \u2013 particularly in the area of new construction. While our customers are challenged, we think that it's a terrific way for us to be able to demonstrate what it is that we do and why it's special. And the last thing I would say is we're working really, really hard here in the area of specifications both in product and color. And that's an important metric that we monitor. So we actually gauge. When we talk with you folks about why we have confidence and we do, it's driven by the number of color requests we get, the number of data sheets and information we get. We monitor all of that. And the pipeline looks very good to us. So we're feeling good about our position, feeling good about what our customers are telling us, and we're really feeling good about the ability of our people to be able to deliver for them. What was the last one you talked about? The protective and marine or the industrial side. I'd say we've seen \u2013 we've seen sequential improvement during the quarter. It's not returned back into year-over-year growth. Protective and marine, about 40% of our sales are tied to oil and gas, and that's obviously fallen sharply over the last quarter. Major oil and gas companies have delayed CapEx projects, which will continue to impact our results. But these aren't decorative products that we're talking about \u2013 or projects, I mean that we're talking about. They're most often very corrosive environments and they require corrosion control to protect the assets and protect safety of the employees and those around it as well as the environment. So we're focused on that business to continue to grow, there's still penetration opportunities. We're also focused on other areas like water, waste water, the flooring, the rail and we're gaining very good ground there. But given the weight that we have in the oil and gas, we expect while we're gaining in some of these other segments, we would expect to see meaningful growth what's most likely beginning in 2021 in protective and marine. Long answer, Chris. That was a long question, so. Good morning, Ghansham. Well, let me just start with \u2013 I think what you're getting at is the service to the retailers. Is that correct when you talk about service? Well, we've seen obviously an unprecedented level here. And the surge has been some \u2013 invited some challenge, obviously. Our teams have adapted I would say, Ghansham, decisively and quickly. But the surge was significant, and it's created some challenges. We're uniquely positioned, I think, at Sherwin-Williams to utilize assets that others might not have. And I would tell you we're pulling every lever possible. We're determined. But I would say that we're still chasing. We believe that we'll be in a position to begin building inventory again as we come out of the third quarter, going into the fourth quarter, into the first quarter. But right now, we're focused on meeting demand. And again I'd be remiss if I didn't call out this terrific effort by the global supply chain team with everything they're doing in this environment, but also the ability to work with our customers. These are unprecedented times, not only for us, but also our customers. So the better line of sight that we have to be able to isolate in on what are the most important skews and working with them to deliver is really what we're after. And this is a new experience. We'll come out of this better. And we'll likely sit with our customers at the end of the year and talk about inventory levels as we begin next season. And if we need to step up and put more in inventory to serve our customers, we're going to take care of our customers. As it relates to DIY, I think fatigue as you mentioned it, we don't support that attitude by any customer, by the way. Reality is that we find that the more customers are home, more \u2013 and different customers are coming in. And in our stores, it's often referred to as it's a COVID project, where people have been in their home for some time and they might have a bedroom that they've never really considered repainting. And they realize that it's very affordable and highly impactful project. And they tackle it. The beauty of it is, is that what we're finding is very little overlap from customers coming in. And while I'm sure there are some, but it seems to be very little where customers are talking about this was a project that I was going to have a contractor do and I'm going to tackle it myself. These are what we're getting from our customers in our stores are customers that are looking at a wall that's probably not been painted, likely wouldn't have been painted, and they're painting them. And so through our stores, it's a relatively small percentage. There's a nice gain. It's only 10% sales through our stores. But through our retail partners we're doing everything we can to make that an easy experience so that it's not just one project. We want it to be easy. Your question is, do they have fatigue? We want to make it a wonderful experience so it's an easy, impactful experience that they went through seamlessly and they want to do more. And we're working with our retail customers to capture those customers and make them repeat customers going forward. Yes, and you look at those assets, those facilities that are producing stain, for example, for our industrial wood where we've got capacity right now, and these are highly technical products. So the finished product to the consumer is every good \u2013 every bit as good as if it had been manufactured in existing plant because the tight specs we operate on the industrial side. So it's really the best of asset utilizations you can get. We don't at this time anticipate having to adjust sales floors. I would tell you that our customers and our employees love those sales floors open, but number one is the safety of our employees. So we'll stay close to it. As of right now, we've not. And I'm not sure if you were asking about the shift of business to the southern states? If you were, I would say, we'll take it anywhere it comes. If it's in that market and it starts moving aggressively, we'll do everything we can to serve those customers wherever they are. Thank you, Ghansham. Well, there's very little if any DIY business there typically in China. But the approach that I would take first off is that it's a relatively small percentage of our business. We saw sales in Asia that were down significantly in the second quarter largely as a result of the COVID pandemic in architectural. We think that that's a slower recovery in the architectural business there. But again, it's really a very, very small piece of our business. We're there really looking at the future. We're investing in the right people, the right \u2013 we're doing a lot of branding work, doing a lot of research. We've got a couple of really good tests going on right now that have gotten a little cloudy with everything that's been going on, on different aspects of our business, so. I think you should expect from our perspective that to be a bigger part of the business down the road, I don't think it's going be anything that's going be material in the next quarter or even next year. Well, to your point, we are close to that through the commercial business through our TAG business and through coil. I would say in our coil business, the resumption of select projects, it drove sequential improvement during the quarter. And I would say that so much so that we finished June positive in June. So I mean we see that momentum moving in the right direction. Not sure if there's going be an air pocket or a gap, if it does happen or when it will happen. What we're doing, Bob, we're working really hard right now to minimize any impact. We call it \u2013 I call it a pothole. We're driving down the road here. We're doing everything we can to fill that pothole. And the beauty of our model, the direct model, is that we can control that. And so we're working with our customers to understand where those projects are. So we're not waiting for customers to call and place an order or go online to place an order. We're attacking this. We know the specifications. We're trying to get more products specified. We know those projects. We know the painting contractors that are on those commercial projects. And we're leveraging our strategy, and we're capitalizing on the segments that we offer to offset whatever might be coming down the road. So I'd say no one's positioned like we are to capitalize on these opportunities. But rest assured, we're not a retailer that just simply opens a door and waits for people to come in. We're out there right now hunting. We know that there might be a hole in the road. We're not waiting. We're aggressively going after it to fill it. Depending on what it looks like if there's a gap or not and how much there is, we'll find out if we experience one. But I would say this, if we do experience one, we think it will be short-lived. Thanks, Bob. Its \u2013 for our reps, it's about a 60/40. We do not look at this as a cost saving mechanism, Steve, at all. I'd say, like everyone, we expect that our employees are motivated by our incentive plans. That's why we have them. But I would say, one of our executives this morning, I was speaking with mentioned a keyword to me, pride. Pride in what we do, pride in who we are, pride in wanting to win. And I'd say, this team we're leading right now, I'd call them goats. These are the best. And there's an element here of incentives, and we want them to be out there to provide for their families. But they're driven by far more than that. There's a sense of pride in what we do. And we want to win. And we don't want to win by a little bit. We want to really, really win. I'm going to stop right there. There's a lot of really good people doing what's right there. Yes. Why don't I take the stores, and then I'll ask Al to talk about the rest there for a second. So year-over-year, we have 68 more stores this year versus last year, given what we laid in last year. We have 178 more reps this year versus last year. For the year, we've opened 16 new stores in North America. And that's offset by the closure of about 33 stores. 24 of those were in Latin America, nine in North America. Steve, the way I'd point to the Latin America closures were these were underperforming stores in persistently soft markets. That's the way I would characterize those. The nine in North America that were closed were mainly stores in Canada that were underperforming. And we did have some stores in North America with lease expirations that we'll plan to relocate. We do expect to open 50 new stores this year, down from our originally planned 80 to 100 due to the COVID. But you should expect us to ramp back up into that 80 to 100 going forward. Yes. David, I'll take that one. What we saw in our second quarter, the industry basket of ROS was down by mid-single-digits year-over-year and that was really driven by resins and solvents, and we don't provide the specific dollars in the quarter, but you can see that positive trend reflected in our year-over-year gross margin improvement. If we look at our outlook kind of going forward, our second quarter we expect will probably be the biggest benefit year-over-year. We still will see \u2013 and that's really because we're going to see tougher comparisons in the second half of the year. We do expect that the second half raw material basket will be down by mid-single-digit percentage overall, similar to the first half. And as Al mentioned a moment ago, it's a little more heavily weighted towards the industrial part of our business than \u2013 the benefit will be a little more there than on the architectural side. So for the full year, we're going to be down mid-single-digits or that's the expectation on ROS and that's compared to our \u2013 earlier this year, we said it would be down low single. So we're seeing some good benefit there again driven by resins and solvents. If you look at the petrochem side of the basket, we're seeing lower year-over-year propylene and ethylene pricing. More recently though what I would say is we've seen a little bit of a sequential tick up in ethylene and propylene contracts and we'll see how that plays out as the year goes forward. On the TiO2 side of the basket, we're still anticipating stable pricing trends in the back half. Some of the third-party forecast that we look at are reflecting a little bit more economic resiliency than some of the prior forecasts, sustained by the DIY demand. I would say the North American TiO2 market has been the most stable and we have seen some indications of lower sulfate TiO2 pricing internationally. But as you know, the majority of our TiO2 buy is chloride-based TiO2, which we really haven't seen movement there. So to sum that up, again, we're going to \u2013 similar kind of in the back half, down mid-single-digits on the ROS basket led by the resins and solvent piece. Well, on both sides, I'd say, we're always active. There are a number of projects that we're engaged in and I'd say the gap, if you will, of pretty wide margin in the midst of the COVID seems to be narrowing and good discussions are taking place. I really, really appreciate the leadership of our team here where David Sewell and our Head of Strategy, Bryan Young, are working with our leadership teams to really make sure that we're staying the course of our strategy. In times like this, people can lose their way a bit and just be out looking for sales or looking for opportunities. That's not us and we've got a very deliberate strategy that we use that we stay true to and we're working that, and there are opportunities and we're hoping to continue to move through those aggressively. On the other side, to your point, I think we've demonstrated if it be programs or products that are not fits, that do not fit in our company, that we take action. And I'd say that we've continued that same discipline of reviewing these programs, products, SKUs, stores, businesses, brands, everything, and you should expect that we continue to do that. When businesses fall short of the threshold that we have, to create shareholder value, we'll take action. But we'll talk to our teams and the businesses before we take that public. No. I wouldn't. I think you're directionally accurate. I think in the third quarter, you wouldn't expect to see the DIY trends that we saw in the second quarter. The raw materials is a tailwind, but not as big of a tailwind in the second quarter. I guess, you know what, Greg, the way I would kind of gauge the DIY in the product mix is, if you look at our second and third quarters together between product and customer mix, I estimate a little bit below 1% of an impact, so you're directionally right there. That's approximately correct. Yes. I'd maybe characterize it this way, Greg. Our platform is certainly \u2013 we are witnessing strong utilization and increased metrics in all categories that we track. The idea here is pretty simple, it allows customers more efficiency in not only ordering products, but also in communicating with their reps and their store managers, and we want to build on this incredible relationship that we enjoy. These contractors as well as now a growing number of DIY customers are learning to rely on our people. On the professional side, these contractors would tell you that those reps and those store managers are part of their team, they're part of the contractor's team, and this is an extra step in helping our customers through our people. So, I might describe it as the last mile just got made that much easier, and we want the contractor feeling like they're part of our team and we're part of their team. And earlier, I talked about the complexity and the challenges that they're facing right now and the inability to absorb delays and run profitable efficient projects. I would tell you that this platform is helping our customers on the professional side to run much more efficiently and we absolutely see loyalty increasing. We ask a lot of questions and the most important one that I think we ask is who helps you make more money, and that gap is getting wider and we enjoy that. As it relates to the DIY side, we clearly have experienced a number of new customers using this platform on the DIY side. Our scores there are going up dramatically and it's working quite well. We're investing here heavily, because we believe this is another great opportunity for differentiation. Pro side. I think we normalize. I think if you look in the past and compare to what's happened historically, John, we've seen these shifts temporarily during unique times. But what we also have to take into consideration is an aging demographic, home price appreciation, aging housing starts. In the last recession to your point, the DIY grew, but not huge amounts and it wasn't protracted. So, we think that there are some shifts that occur during these times while people are home, as I mentioned earlier, it's affordable, it's impactful, and you can make a difference. But overall, every time we've seen this and we expect it going forward. And quite frankly, another stat that I didn't share earlier, I shared it maybe in the comments about the res repaint. The reason I say this with confidence, we \u2013 listening to our customers, they're telling us in June of 2020, they have more bids going out than they had in June of 2019. So we're feeling pretty good about the trend. Yes. You're right. There is no finish line in anything that we do, Duffy. So, I like the way you characterize that. Marvin and his team at Lowe's, Bill Boltz and Joe McFarland, these are wonderful leaders. They're driving for improvement and we want to help them. And they're giving us access, they're allowing our teams to work with their teams, and we believe that there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us. We're on a runway and we're screaming down it. But I think together, there's a lot more that we can do and we're looking forward to that. I think these are two wonderful organizations that work together can do a lot. And we like that for two reasons, both the DIY side, but also as a professional that prefers a home center experience that's typically, we call them the pro that paints. They might be a remodeler, they might be doing different professional projects, and they pick up paint as part of that experience, and they prefer the home center with the product choices. And so our ability to help them be more successful is an important part of our strategy and we look forward to that. So there's a lot more to be done. Okay. What I'd add to that Truman is just that, as we said, DIY continues to be a strong performer and the resi repaint and the new res continue to be the ones that are sort of leading the recovery while commercial and property maintenance are also improving, but resi and resi repaint continue to be sort of the leaders in the clubhouse. Yes. On our stores, I think we're just getting started. I think there's a lot of opportunity and we've got a wonderful team that's executing well and we're excited about where we're going, and there's a lot of really good things in the pipeline that we're excited to talk to you about in the future. Regarding the do-it-yourself versus do-it-for-me, as I mentioned earlier, we think that we've seen this movie before. There is a shift to do-it-yourself, it gradually shifts back, and those are based on fundamentals, an aging population, dual income, the pension or market wealth that's created, home values that are improving. And quite frankly, a general focus on life, the quality of life and people enjoy the benefit and the impact of a newly painted room or home, and not all of them enjoy doing it themselves, but it's a relatively inexpensive but impactful experience. And we don't quite frankly care how it's applied. We just want to make sure it's our product going on, and it could be a do-it-yourselfer or it could be a do-it-for-me, it could be \u2013 and we talked about remodel or new home. We just \u2013 we have teams focused on every square field, every corner of the room. We just want to be there when that gallon is sold and be the one that's providing that solution. Yes. Again, as mentioned earlier, it's about 10% of our store business, so it's a relatively small percentage and there are customers that prefer a specialty store experience, and if they're going to make that decision, we'd hope that they choose ours. But I know that you've been in our stores and you've seen how we're modeled and what we do, I think there's a large percentage of that contractor business that is out there for us to gain and that's mainly the focus of our stores. There is plenty of opportunity for us to grow. This is the strongest performer that we have in our industrial business. I mentioned the sales up high-single-digits. To your point, demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. We have a terrific and unique technology in our V70 coating that continues to win and convert new customers, new lines, and it's because of the flexibility, the speed, the ease of application, our customers are running more efficiently through the plans to be able to do that. So, yes, we expect this business to continue to grow, it's another area with wonderful leadership, great technology, great customers and we're putting a lot of fuel in this tank. Kevin, I think you should model in as basically the same margins. Hey, Jeff. We do see the improvement. We saw it sequentially as the quarter unfolded and we expect that to continue. Again, we've spoke in the last couple of calls about the technology and our play here and the performance of this business and it's moving in the right direction, obviously, but miles driven and traffic congestion would help this business. This is a business that when you look at the drivers, given what we've done with this business over the last 18 to 24 months, resumption of more normal travel routines will benefit us significantly. We are experiencing some contractor labor issues, not only in new residential, commercial, even res repaint and you wouldn't think that given the unemployment rate. But I've spoken with a number of contractors who have mentioned that it's difficult for them to find people, qualified people that are willing to work, given the unemployment rates that they're receiving. So, it is an issue. I would say to your question about the trend, many of our builders \u2013 first, we do see it, largely because of our position in the market. We've got a terrific position in the national homebuilders. We've talked about having 18 of the top 20 national homebuilders in exclusive relationships and we've been making very good penetration in the regional builders. And let me just take a slight detour and say our national account business, outside of just the builder, that our national account business in total across all our U.S. stores platform, the activity there is fantastic. So we're really leveraging our platform and really trying to drive the differentiation between us and others. That said, back on the builder, we are clearly enjoying this partnership with our builders. They are experiencing \u2013 many of them have said June was their best month ever. And so, we believe that the quarter bodes well for the future. The other point of differentiation I would make that we're hearing from our builders is that they continue to reference our ability to offer the services that we provide, both the reps and inventory, close to them as an important lever. Many of them have asked other suppliers to come visit us here in Cleveland to understand what we're doing and how we're doing it. And I think that when you look at our position, it's become more pronounced given some of the challenges that some builders have had with disruptions in other categories. For us, it's terrific business, it's 5 gallon bucket, so it's easy to serve us, it doesn't have an impact on the do-it-yourself business, it allows us to serve them well and we can execute for these national homebuilders across the country like no one else can. So, let me point \u2013 I think Eric to reiterate again, my comments I think on the trends, I might point back to the bidding activity that we're experiencing with our customers, the fact that in June, there were more bids this year versus last year in a growing percentage now including the interior. So, the \u2013 I'm trying to give you some color without getting into specific numbers to be truthful with you, but we're feeling pretty good about it. The fact is, is that our customers are recognizing that it's not going be this afternoon if they're in someone's home, but they're using virtual tools to estimate. Their customers are interested in having their homes painted. There is a sense of wanting to almost get their place in line. And our customers enjoy that, because it allows them to tackle the exterior which is turning out to be an excellent exterior season for our contractors and they're enjoying the opportunity that many of these interior projects or these customers are getting in line with the expectation that those homes are going be painted by these same pros."

Thank you for joining The Sherwin-Williams Company\u2019s Review of First Quarter 2020 Results and our Outlook for the Second Quarter and Full Fiscal Year of 2020. With us on today's call are John Morikis Chairman and CEO; David Sewell, President and COO; Allen Mistysyn, CFO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously and listen only-mode by issuer direct via the internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at sherwin.com beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. It will be available until Wednesday May 13 of 2020 at 5:00 PM Eastern time. This conference call would include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S federal securities laws with respect to sale, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statements speaks only as of the date on what such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the Company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the Company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to question. I will now turn the call or for John Morikis.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Jesse. Good morning everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy during the pandemic. Given the extraordinary circumstances over the last quarter, we've changed our typical format a bit today to provide you with some additional perspective. After my opening remarks, I'll turn the call over to Jim Jaye, our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for some short comments on our first quarter results. David Sewell, our President and Chief Operating Officer will follow Jim, and provide you with details on how we're responding to the pandemic. After David's remarks, I'll share some color on what we're seeing across our various end markets before turning it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Allen Mistysyn, who will provide you with our revised outlook for the year. Let me begin today by thanking the more than 60,000 employees of Sherman-Williams for their courage, determination, and resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their extraordinary effort to serve each other, our customers, our company and our communities during this challenging time truly has been inspiring. This wonderful team has my deepest appreciation and my deepest respect, and I'm confident in their ability to meet the challenges ahead of us. Clearly, we're in a much different economic environment than anyone could have imagined when we provided our 2020 outlook back in January. More than 26 million have filed for unemployment benefits in the U.S. alone since mid-March and other geographies also remain under significant pressure. Sherman-Williams is not immune from these realities. We are seeing major near-term impacts to demand in most of our end markets. We have a long-tenured and experienced management team that has successfully managed the Company through a number of challenging times, recession in the early 2000, the 2008-2009 financial collapse, and the integration of Valspar, the largest acquisition in the Company's long history. Our entire global team remains undaunted and has taken actions to navigate this crisis. We remain very confident in our ability to manage the near-term impacts we're seeing, while positioning ourselves for continued long-term success. We've developed and are executing a comprehensive response to the pandemic, focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, our customers, our company, and our communities. We're implementing multi-phased contingency plans across our businesses to adjust to the near-term business environment. We are well positioned from a balance sheet and liquidity perspective. We've adapted in order to stay connected to our customers through this crisis, including modified operations in our stores and increased use of e-commerce and other technology. We believe we're seeing a pause in demand in many of our end markets rather than destruction of demand. We believe the long-term fundamentals remain intact. We intend to continue strategic investments that support profitable growth. These include continued investments in our stores, our products, our e-commerce platform, and other initiatives as we look for opportunities to expand our business. But before moving ahead, I'd like to thank our team again for remaining focused and delivering on our first quarter plan, even as the COVID pandemic began to impact us. Let me now turn the call to Jim Jaye for some additional comments on the quarter.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. In addition to this morning's press release and our commentary on today's call, we've provided a slide deck on our website with additional information. All comparisons in my remarks are to the first quarter of 2019 unless otherwise stated. Overall Sherwin-Williams delivered a strong first quarter that was line with our expectation, with year-over-year improvement in sales, gross margin, profit before tax, EBITDA, diluted net income per share and net operating cash. First quarter 2020 consolidated sales increased 2.6% to $4.15 billion, and consolidated gross margin increased to 45.6% from 42.9%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $93.4 million to $392.3 million. Diluted net income per share for the first quarter of 2020 increased to $3.46 per share from $2.62 per share. The first quarter of 2020 includes acquisition related amortization expense of $0.62 per share, and the first quarter of 2019 includes acquisition related costs and other adjustments of $0.98 per share, as described in the Regulation G reconciliation table included in our press release. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share, increased 13.3% to $4.08 from $3.60. Adjusted EBITDA increased $48 million to $623.1 million or 15% of sale. Cash from operations was $54.9 million, an increase of $91 million year-over-year in the quarter. As is typical for us in the first quarter, we use cash to build inventory levels in advance of the busier spring and summer selling season. We continue to monitor the demand environment closely. From a segment perspective, the Americas grew same-store sales by 7.4% and improved segment margin by 140 basis points. Consumer brands group and performance coatings group also delivered improved segment margin performance. Additional details on our segment performance are included in the slide deck I referenced previously. Let me now turn the call over to David Sewell for some specific comments and how we are responding to the pandemic. David.\nDavid Sewell: Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Let me also add my sincere thanks to our entire global team. Without a doubt, our incredibly talented and dedicated employees remain our most important asset and we have implemented a wide range of temporary policies and protocols over the last two months to protect their health and safety. These actions include enhanced paid sick and/or family leave, alternate flexible and remote work arrangement, visitor and employee screening protocols, social distancing best practices, additional PPE and sanitary procedures, and we have established a global crisis response team among many other measures. We also took the unprecedented step of temporarily closing our paint stores sales force to further protect employees as we move to serving customers with curbside pickup and delivery option. As for our customers, we provide essential products and services that are helping painters create and maintain clean and healthy living environment and healthcare facilities, manufacturing plants, residences, and for other vital infrastructure. Many of these contractors have expressed their gratitude to us for keeping our stores open and enabling them to keep their businesses running, doing their jobs, generating income and supporting their family. We're also supporting industrial customers in mission critical areas, such as food and beverage packaging, healthcare equipment, food manufacturing, water treatment, and energy infrastructure. During the crisis, we have delivered critical coatings product to producers of ventilators, oxygen tanks, and hospital bed frame. At this time, all major architectural and industrial plants and distribution service centers are in operation. The utilization rates vary based on manufacturing site and customers serve. We have had no significant issues with raw material availability or supply. We've had a very small number of North American stores closed intermittently during the crisis related to varying government borders. The vast majority of stores remain open. All of our businesses have developed and are executing on multi-phased contingency plan to adjust to the near -term business environment. We have taken targeted action to reduce costs, pause or eliminate certain programs, cut general expenses and delayed filling open positions. We've also made adjustments to a small percentage of our workforce through involuntary leaves and reductions in force. We have additional levers we can pull, if necessary. Through all of this, our employees continue to support the communities where they live and work. To-date, we have donated hundreds of thousands of masks, gloves and lab coats to those on the frontlines fighting the virus. We have also manufactured and donated hand sanitizers to many hospitals throughout the country. Our entire team remains focused and determined as we manage through this crisis, and we're confident we will emerge from this as a stronger company.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, David. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe we are seeing a positive demand rather than destruction of demand, and we continue to feel confident in the long term trajectory of our end markets. While some economies cautiously begin taking steps to reopen, the pace and scale at which this will happen is far from clear. We believe April will be the most challenging month of our second quarter from a comparison perspective, with some gradual improvement as the quarter progresses. Whether the recovery gains momentum in the second half of 2020 or not until 2021 remains to be seen, we believe providing additional granularity on our end markets and how they might begin to emerge from the current environment may be helpful to investors. Let me begin in the Americas group with our North American stores. Again, first quarter trends were very strong with same-store sales 7.4%, reflecting robust underlying demand. We've seen a dramatic near-term pause brought on by the pandemic, with all end markets except DIY being significantly impacted. In residential repaint, customers are delaying interior work related to social distancing concerns and having painting contractors in their home. We expect this demand to return gradually as the pandemic subside, and customers and contractors implement appropriate protective measures. We expect texture repaint work to gain momentum near-term, which will help to offset some of the interior softness. In new residential, starts were strong double digits to begin the year as workers return from stay-at-home orders, work on these homes should resume. Our national homebuilding customers remain positive long term, though cancellations have increased and order rates have soften near-term. Activity should eventually improve as mortgage rates are low in the supply of homes is limited. As a reminder, there's about a 90 to 120 day lag from the time construction begins to the painting phase. In new commercial, many of our customers were reporting strong backlogs and our first quarter sales were up mid-single digit. Construction has been deemed as essential in most locations and jobs in progress will be completed. Work is largely continuing albeit it at a slower pace due to increased job site restrictions and labor challenges. We start to be delayed in the second quarter. So we're optimistic that they will pick back up to the economy begins to reopen more broadly. In property maintenance, overall renters demographics are favorable though apartment terms have slowed dramatically near-term. Management companies remain positive and expect renter movements begin quickly once the economy reopens. Maintenance related to hotels and restaurants is likely to return more slowly. Some CapEx projects have been put on hold in some areas due to local mandate. Our DIY business is strong as consumers are nesting and using stay-at-home time to work on affordable home improvement projects such a painting. We expect our DIY business to remain solid in the second quarter before returning more normal low-single digit rates as stay-at-home orders are lifted. In protective and marine approximately 40% of our sales are tied to oil and gas, which has fallen sharply over the last quarter. Major oil and gas companies are suspended or delayed capital expenditure projects, which have and will continue to impact our results. Conversely, our sales in other end markets such as water and wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical, flooring, rail and marine remain as planned, which will help to offset the softness from weaker oil and gas. While we're seeing short-term disruptions and headwind, the long term drivers we've cited in the past remain intact, including household formations and demographic trends. Given these long term drivers, we intend to continue to invest in our business. We anticipate opening approximately 50 new stores this year, while continuing to focus on sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products and productivity enhancing services. Moving on to an update for consumer brands group. DIY demand in North America continues to be strong as stay-at-home mandates of increased home improvement demand. Sales of homes and other retail channel partners continue to perform well and we are encouraged by growth process with multiple customers in this channel. Looking at our international businesses, we expect our sales to be under considerable pressures through the second quarter. Our expectation is for these businesses to slowly return to more normal activity in the third quarter as the economies of the world begin to open. Lastly, let me comment on trends in performance coatings group. Overall, we anticipate industrial demand recovering more slowly than architectural demand. From a geographic perspective, North America remains the largest region performance coatings and was our strongest performer prior to the pandemic. We would expect it to be true going forward. We have started to see some recovery in China at a slower pace than anticipated. We expect continued pressure in Europe and Latin America. In packaging, demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. We anticipate strong continued demand and additional business wins driven by sustainability trends, and our non- BPA Valpure V70 coatings. In coil coatings, we're seeing a temporary pause and slower pace from commercial construction projects. Jobs in progress will eventually resume and coupled with the continued capture of new business, we expect this business to remain one of our best performers. In general industrial, we're seeing substantial demand weakness in various end markets, including heavy equipment, agriculture, transportation, and general finishing. We expect this recovery will be slow and we'll see continued pressure throughout the rest of 2020. In industrial wood, softness across various end markets including furniture, kitchen cabinetry and flooring has continued. It is difficult to forecast the timing of improvement though many of the same drivers influencing you new housing could benefit business. In automotive refinish, the business has been impacted by the various state home mandates that have been instituted across the country. The decrease in miles driven has led to a decrease in collisions. The pace of recovery in this business will depend on how quickly stay-at-home orders are lifted, and people begin to return to their normal routine. Let me reiterate that while we are seeing near-term pressure across most markets we serve, we're confident in a long term trajectory. Now, I'll turn the call over to Allen Mistysyn, our Chief Financial Officer to talk more specifically about our revised 2020 guidance, our cash and liquidity position, and our approach to capital allocation. Al?\nAllen Mistysyn: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We anticipate the negative impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and global economies will most likely continue through the second quarter. We do not expect immediate meaningful improvement ahead in most end markets we serve and we're unable to predict when any noticeable improvement in those end markets will occur. Given the near-term trends and indicators we see at this time, we anticipate second quarter 2020 consolidated net sale would decrease by a low to mid-teens percentage versus the second quarter of 2019. Looking at our operating segments for the second quarter, we anticipate the Americas group to be down by a low double digit to mid teen percentage, consumer brands group to beat up by a high single digit to low double digit percentage and performance coatings group to be down a high teen percentage. For the full year 2020, we are revising our sales guidance to reflect uncertainties and the timing and pace of improvement in the U.S. and global operating environment. If economic conditions begin returning to normal in the third quarter of 2020, and continue improving through the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year consolidated net sales to be flat to down a low single digit percentage. If economic conditions do not materially improve until the first quarter of 2021, we anticipate full year 2020 consolidated net sales to decrease by a mid to high single digit percentage. This revised full year 2020 consolidated sales guidance is compared to our previous full year guidance of an increase of 2% to 4%. On an operating segment basis for the full year, we anticipate the Americas Group to be flat to down by a mid single digit percentage, consumer brands group to be up or down by a low single digit percentage and performance coatings group to be down by a high single digit to low double digit percentage. Considering our revised range of potential sale, we are revising our diluted net income for common share for 2020 to be in the range of $16.46 to $18.46 per share, compared to our previous guidance of $19.91 to $20.71 per share and compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings per share guidance include acquisition related amortization expense of approximately $2.54 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2020 earnings per share of $19 to $21. One key assumption embedded in our outlook is the raw material deflation we expect to realize for full year 2020. We expect the raw material basket to be lower year-over-year by a low single digit percentage. Switching to our balance sheet which along with our liquidity position remained strength of the Company, at March 31, 2020, we had $239 million in cash and $2.5 billion of unused capacity under our revolving credit facility. At the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio improved 3.1 times on net debt to adjusted EBITDA compared to 3.5 times a year ago. As Jim noted earlier, during the first quarter, we use cash to build architectural inventory level in advance of the spring and summer selling season. However, our teams reacted quickly, slowing demand, various businesses in region where it occurred and aggressively reduced inventory which helped reduce our year-over-year working capital of $151 million. You have completed a number of actions over the past year to reduce our risk and improve our financial flexibility. We recently completed a bond issuance in March for $500 million of 10-year note at 2.3%, this $500 million of 30 year note at 3.3%. These are the lowest coupon rates in the history of the Company. The proceeds of these issuances reduce to complete a tender offer for 500 million of 2.75% note due in 2022 will also be used to pay off the 429 million, 2.25% note that are coming due in May. Our next long-term debt maturity in 2021 is $25 million. In the first quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our company stock and increased our quarterly dividend by 18.6% to $1.34 per share. We are committed to maintaining this dividend increase through the rest of 2020. As David mentioned, we are executing contingency plan to reduce spending and conserve cash. As part of those plans, we are lowering our full year 2020 capital expenditure forecast from $320 million to $180 million and temporarily delaying our share repurchases until we see improvement in the end markets we serve. Finally, we have put a pause on spending related to our new headquarters and R&D facility project but continue to work various planning process. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Parkinson: So, I'll leave this fairly open ended, but do you speak to some of the key trends in the Americas group, such as the sustainability of the DIY boost? Any color on the magnitude of the divergence between exterior and interior paint trends? And just how to think about things on a sub-regional basis for what you're seeing in April? Are there any differences between for instance, the Southeast versus the Northeast?\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Chris. First, I would say regarding the DIY business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the nesting phenomenon, if you will, as our customers, it's largely the result of their spending more time at home. And we believe that that will continue largely through the stay-at-home orders. Historically, if you look at the underlying principles that have us believing that this gradually shifts back to the, do it for me as opposed to DIY primarily. We think those are still intact. Those are the aging demographics, the home appreciation, the aging housing stock. And that, as well, I would say that if you look at the last recession in DIY, it grew, not in huge amounts, but it was not protracted either. Here, we have a much more significant jump in DIY business and we're experiencing it DIY business in our stores, for those customers that are still preferring a more specialty store experience and through many of our customers and our consumer brands business and we're working hard to serve them as well. As it relates to your next question regarding the, what was it, interior versus exterior? Both were up double-digits in the first quarter, and we expect that as the season starts to turn a little bit here that we'll start to see more lift in the exterior business as a result of more contractors, getting the go ahead from homeowners. In some cases right now are preferring not to have -- many cases right now are preferring not to have painting contractors enter their home. And regionally, you asked a question, what we see regionally. I'd say that we are starting to see more estimating, and I would say the close rates in those estimates are growing. Largely in Southeast and Southwest right now, they're lagging in the Northeast and in the Midwest, which you would expect heavily influenced by what's happening in New York, what's happening in Illinois and Michigan. So, I'd say, going back to the point that we referenced a few times in the prepared remarks. We'll go structurally there's not been much shift. So, we expect this, do-it-yourself to continue short-term, gradually shift back to do-it-for me, and we love our position with those customers to be able to capitalize on that.\nChris Parkinson: Also just as a carrier of that, can you just very quickly just break out the trends in P&M across the Americas group and PC, just if you go through the oil and gas protective insect corrosion and then just the smell and rain? Just anything changing there in terms of your thought process?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. So, I'd say in P&M, we mentioned that that represents about 40% -- I'm sorry, oil and gas represents about 40% of our P&M business to our stores. And we have a very strong position there. I'd say that the oil prices have had an impact primarily in the upstream business, where your offshore shale et cetera, midstream, wood storage. Downstream, I'd say in refining and cracking is still quite a bit of investment going on. What I'm really pleased with is the shift that our teams are putting into place that pivot to where the business is not as certainly where we are. We have a strong very strong position in those areas that are under pressure. We got wonderful talent, wonderful products, and we're doing a very good job I believe in moving into some of those areas that are underserved by Sherwin right now in the oil and gas as well as other areas that we mentioned. Those are the water, wastewater, food and beverage even pharmaceutical flooring. So this is a pretty experienced team we have here. And we're taking advantage of those experiences, the scar tissue, if you will, from some of the past experiences. We're not waiting for things to happen. We're trying to capitalize and drive things to make them happen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nGhansham Panjabi: Hey, John, just kind of picking up on the live few comments, right. So your comments are being that says sort of pause in demand versus necessarily a disruption in demand, but some of the metrics in terms of U.S. unemployment and start of market to change dramatically over the past couple of months. I guess what gives you confidence that apart from the dislocation that you and others will see 2Q that this is in fact a pause versus something that's going to have a tail with it?\nJohn Morikis: So, I think in each markets, when we look at the drivers of those segments, we look through and understand we think was a pretty good line of site on what's going to happen. I think if you look at for example in new residential, we feel there is a pause that there is a fundamental need for housing in the country, and that while the short term traffic in models and the feedback that we're getting from our large new residential customers clearly indicate some concern with the shorter term. We're not running the quarter, I mean, running the Company to have a great second quarter here. And that's it. We're doing the best we can with the cards that we were dealt with the in the second quarter. But we're looking at the fundamentals and we believe that if you go by segment, do our business that there are some various sound fundamentals in areas where there is some softness. We're not waiting. We're moving into those areas that offer opportunity. And so segment by segment we're dissecting our business understand we have the right people doing the right things to capitalize on those opportunities.\nAllen Mistysyn: Got it and I just add to that. And that's partly why, the unpredictability about how our segments come out of this and timing of that, that's why if you will bifurcated the guidance to say okay. If we see things start improving in the third quarter and then continue to improve in the fourth quarter. We think flat to down low-single digit, but it the true recovery doesn't start until the first quarter of 2021. We're looking at that mid-to-high single digit down estimates. So we perfectly understand the uncertainty, so that's why we are giving a range of the timing of when we expect the businesses to come back.\nGhansham Panjabi: And then, just on the DIY piece that you're benefiting from in the stores group power of consumers engaging with your associates. I mean generally your stores offer very high, but then for consumers, how are your associates pivoting towards this new reality of social distancing. And then just sort of related to that, are you seeing any from a high level standpoint, are you see any specific trends that are visible in terms of maybe DIY piece being a bit more price-sensitive in terms of the choice of pick? Thanks.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you for that question because it gives you a terrific opportunity to recognize a wonderful team. We've got a terrific leadership team and Peter Ippolito and [indiscernible] and all our division presidents there. But more importantly, as strong as those leaders are, we've got just a wonderful team in our stores and are close to customers and sales reps that are doing a terrific job. And your question gives me just that the opportunity to thank this wonderful team for everything they're doing. You're right, it's changed things. We are a curbside only. So, it's given us an opportunity to leverage some of the investments that we've made in our digital platform. We have orders coming in via the digital platform that we've been invested in with a much greater utilization so we're excited about that. And I would tell you, we've been inundated with emails and notes and even phone calls from customers that have gone out of their way to, to comment and recognize our employees and their willingness to work with people. We've gotten utilizing a color fulfillment so customers can go online order colors and have them into their homes in relatively short period of time. And our people in the stores are eager to help these people, over the phone to make sure that they're taken care of. And then the transaction takes place, it's a contact a transaction when these employee or these customers pull up into our stores and their product is ordered to the back of the car. I don't know I couldn't tell him how many points of contact I've had with people recognizing that's a wonderful service and approach that we're taking. And that's in on our stores, I would say that we were blessed with a number of really, really strong and good customers on our consumer brands team, and [Eddie Peps] and [Keith Velora] [indiscernible] the two leaders running that businesses really helped us to try to be as responsive as we can to that important segment and channel to our customers. And we're trying to in-still as much as we can in our learning's from our store site into those customers and vice versa and just really providing solutions to our customers. So, we're really excited about this and say that the trend that we're seeing in our DIY business is exciting on the consumer side as well as our stores.\nGhansham Panjabi: And the pricing sensitivity fees?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, I'd say that on pricing we continue to see a positive mix in our business. I say that my side contractors, who recognize that 90% of their projects are labor costs many homeowners, particularly those that are shopping at a Sherwin-Williams store, are typically willing to pay a little more to get the finished that they're looking for, and to have it be as productive as possible. So, we are seeing a positive mix shift in both the a pro or contractor business that we see as well as the do-it-yourself.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: I guess two points. So, on the raw material side, down low-single-digit, just given what we've seen in oil prices and propylene, it seems a little bit on the low side. Can you give us a little bit of color into what you're seeing in the various baskets for raw materials, and how you're thinking about how they trend throughout the year?\nJohn Morikis: Sure and good morning, John. What I would say is given the significant decline in crude as you point out, we do expect to realize lower year-over-year raw material costs throughout the remainder of 2020. The full year will be down by low-single-digit percentage as we talked about compared to our prior estimate of being flat for the year. I think the rate in the second half of the year will depend largely on how the downstream derivatives like propylene and ethylene react to the declines in crude. And I would say also if demand is not improved through the second half of the year, then we could potentially see a more meaningful benefit. The majority of the benefit year-over-year is going to be on that resins solvent side. If you take a look at the TiO2 side, I think we've seen strong demand there in the first quarter and the second quarter, but it's probably too soon to fully understand the supply demand impact and the effect on pricing there. I would say at this point we do anticipate stable to potentially lower prices for TiO2 in the back half. Historically weaker global demand has resulted in lower pricing. But again, I think the decline that we're expecting to see in the basket is tied more on the petrochemical side and it's really going to depend on how propylene and ethylene response.\nJohn McNulty: And then I guess in the stores business, so if I understand it correctly, you shut down the front part of the store kind of in late March. Is there a way to think about how much sales dipped when you went just to curbside pickup and just so that we can kind of think about when these required closures and that type of thing and how to think about the snapback? Can you give us a little bit of color or anecdotes on that?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. It's hard to say exactly how much of a decline we're seeing, but we saw, but in our second quarter guidance, we're talking about the America's group download double-digit to mid-teen. I think, just commentary as we've seen April progressed, the weekly sales on architectural have improved week to week from a dollar volume standpoint. As a reminder, April, was there a toughest comp a year ago? If you think about how North American same-store progressed to the second quarter last year's April was a strongest quarter and then it took down and then it took down in June. So we were fully expecting April toughest comparison. So that's what makes it a little bit harder to gauge how much is related to the shelter in place and the changes to our sales floor.\nAllen Mistysyn: John, I would add just though, David Sewell here our COO has got all our businesses leaning forward in a very positive way. So, I'm a bit more optimistic, I might say, in the sense that we've come into this business with a pretty strong performance, a strong comp store sale number. And David has our teams, every one of them, including our stores, taking the activities. Right now that will help us grow even faster coming out of it. And so, the activity that we have in new accounts and product demos and information, this is probably some of the most impressive time we've had. Because we have had some customers on the professional side that has had interior projects that have been delayed, they're not able to get on the exterior projects. And so it's provided our teams more accessibility to some of these customers. And our new account activity is actually up as a result of this. Our demos of new products are up. So, you've start to David and our teams not only in our stores and all of them for what we're doing during these times. And so I guess what you're asking, as these stores close, how quickly do they rebound. Our desire, really strong desires to come out of this much stronger than even what we were before.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nArun Viswanathan: I wanted to go back to the comments you made earlier. I guess you referenced potential for opening 15 new stores this year. Maybe you can just discuss how you see that playing out? Are there particular regions that you're targeting? And if you could relate that to some of the performance that you saw in Q1 or Q2 that you're seeing right now, are you targeting areas where maybe you're seeing some weaker performance regionally or is it just underpin penetrated areas?\nJohn Morikis: It varies by division. We are looking at in some areas what we call still in markets where we have underserved markets in areas that we might have more penetration, but we're missing some gas in this. A lot of areas, quite frankly, that we're just not happy with our performance yet. And in the area of market share and our position and we've got a long way to go. And so I'd say, it's kind of a balance between the two. We'd like to take advantage of our position in the market, while providing more accessibility to our customers. And at the same time we have to get after some of these markets that are underserved.\nArun Viswanathan: And then just as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask about the refinish business as well. We all in miles driven dropped significantly. Maybe just give us your thoughts you've had some growth recently in the last couple of years through a bigger business for you now. So, did you comment on that business and what you see for the outlook there?\nJohn Morikis: Sure. You're right, we've seen a mile driven down considerably, and we expected that impact could be for another 30 to 45 days following the end of the stay-at-home order. So a little bumpy right now if you will and that business no pun intended. But our teams are really doing a nice job there. I think, I've mentioned last quarter, it was a bold statement and I stand by it. I think our position in this auto refinish businesses as strong as it's been since I've been on this floor of the building here and a lot of confidence in our leadership in automotive, a lot of confidence in our performance coatings team and what we're doing. I think we've got a lot of determination in this business to outperform. We're going to have to get some cars on the road be able to see some of that though. I say here though, as well if I could. The effort that we have and the connectivity and virtual learning and the virtual demos that our teams are initiating here in other area out of adversity sometimes comes the best. We've had a lot of things that we've been working on that we've been able to accelerate. And we believe it's helping to convert some of these customers. Some of them were on the fence before assemble it just come online before the pandemic. And, again, we expect to be able to capitalize on this as we come out.\nArun Viswanathan: And just lastly, I know you've talked about evaluating your business in Australia.Could you just comment on where you stand there and the progress that's been made?\nJohn Morikis: Sure. The virus impact on Australia has been severe as well. We're 100% contact with there. But, I'd say we've started to address to your question our SG&A in our position long before the pandemic. And I'd say that our judgments not only in Australia, but I'd say in Europe, even in Asia. If you look at Europe, we have a 70% flow through on our business there. Australia we've taken -- we think the appropriate SG&A steps there as well as in Asia. Prior to the pandemic, we believe right size some of the business there and it made some very difficult decisions in some areas. And we've invested in some other areas to be able to capitalize on our growth. So I wouldn't limit it to just Australia. I think we're taking what we believe to be the appropriate aggressive steps for these businesses to drive the operating margins. We've said time and time again, we're constantly looking at programs, we're looking at brands. We're looking businesses even stores every element of our business. If it's helping us reach our goals, we want to put our foot on the gas. If not, we're making difficult decisions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: Yes, thank you for taking my questions. Just curious about your North American consumer business, your guidance for second quarters is quite robust. Is the trend that you're seeing in April, representative of your outlook for the second quarter? Are you seeing and that strong of a volume growth during the month of April?\nJohn Morikis: I would say unprecedented growth in April.\nAllen Mistysyn: I'll agree with that Steve. And we really started seeing it kick-in about mid-March and that trend has not only continued but accelerated in April.\nSteve Byrne: And, David Sewell made some comments about trimming the sales force or the personnel in, in the tag group in his remarks. Can you just comment on what you expect SG&A to be in the second quarter versus the first?\nDavid Sewell: Yes, we are not trimming just to be clear. We're not trimming personnel in our tag organization. In fact, we'll continue to invest as John talked about it in new stores. We will see the trend in SG&A decline in our in our second quarter. Because of the sales shortfall, we probably won't see the percent of sales improve. But the steps that David talked about in our contingency planning, they're material and as he talked about as we see demand and the trends in demand develop, we have other levers, ready to go to poll, if we need to, but we are not going to be cutting our stores organization.\nJohn Morikis: Steve, maybe just to make sure, I'm not sure what you may have picked up or the way we may have said it, but we're always looking at our investments and there are times in our normal business that we might be skinning down in an area and invest in other areas, but I think the idea that is important to hear is our stores businesses, very sound fundamental business that, that we expect to put more gas in that tank every chance we can.\nSteve Byrne: And if I can just squeeze one more in about housing starts, are your -- are your contractors indicating to you that, it's a slow down driven by a delayed permitting? Or are they also seeing any problems with labor?\nJohn Morikis: I don't know that the labor issues coming up right now. I think the, let me go back to the very first part of your question. We don't think that the fundamentals have changed and neither has our position in that market and we feel the gap in The Sherwin-Williams value proposition is wide and I'd say it's growing wider. If you look at rate and this may go back to the question Ghansham asked, so why we have confidence? If you look at, rates are, low housing supply is limited, and while there's some short-term impact to the business, we feel as though the fundamentals are still there. I remind you that we have an exclusive relationship with 18 of the top 20 nationals and front of regionals where we have the opportunity there. We have exclusive with 73 of the top 100. So, there's more opportunity there for us to leverage. And I would tell you that, the value that we bring in distribution our reps, the products even the design tools and local training are really areas that we're focusing on. And so, I'd say our customers right now for the most part are dealing with the short term. But I would tell you the discussions that we're having with them. In fact, last week alone we had discussions with, top all top 10 builders that reached out to us wanting to ensure of our supply chain and our capability to serve them. And I can assure you we're ready more than ready to serve that's part of what gives us confidence. There's going to be some bumps in the road in this quarter no question and maybe rolling a little bit into the two three, who knows that terrific relationships we're going to be right there with them. No one has the responsiveness to serve our customers. I show them lamps.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Koort: I wanted to ask about the CapEx reduction, pretty dramatic decline. I know you've mentioned, John only 50 new store openings, which maybe is about half of what is -- well, is that the bulk of that decline or where else are we seeing the CapEx reduction?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Bob. Within our global supply chain, we are paring back some of the capacity projects that we had scheduled at the start of this year, going into next year. I would tell you that, that decrease of 140 million -- what we'll do throughout the year is monitor again how the demand trends are developing. And as we see -- for instance, our stores architectural start building back up, we'll turn some of those back on, the timing that causes the delay. But I think the 140 million would be kind of your max case. And then, as we see things turn around, we'll start investing back in our plans, in our distribution centers, in the automation to help with our continuous improvement projects and operating efficiencies and things like that.\nRobert Koort: And I'm sorry if I missed it out, but you gave some guidance on second quarter TAG sales. Did you comment on what the daily receipts in April suggested? We were thinking down 30% or something pretty huge and then moderating, is that reasonable?\nJohn Morikis: Actually, our receipts have held up pretty well. I think maybe as we get into early May, we're going to see a gap but then start improving as we get towards the second half of May and into June as -- because as I mentioned, as we look at the progress in our weekly sales, that keeps improving. As we are staying close to our customers, we're not getting a lot of concern about bad debt or solvency of our customers. So right now, as we look at it, I do expect a little bit of slowdown here in early May and maybe mid-May, but then pick up -- start picking up again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question\nP.J. Juvekar: Hi, John, Al and the team. Good to hear from you. How much of your -- how much is your online ordering up in the quarter from contractors or DIY? And how much of these orders are curbside pickup versus delivery? And longer term, do you think that's a new trend that will remain in place post-COVID?\nJohn Morikis: So, you're probably not going to like these answers, other than online is significant. Curbside versus delivery, I'd say the largest part of our -- I'd say it's probably on the contractor side pretty evenly split. Obviously the Do It Yourself curbside delivered right outside of our stores. And I would say regarding the future, yes, we want our customers using this system. We believe it helps in our customers\u2019 efficiency. We think it helps our efficiency. It allows us to be a better partner to them and allows our customers to move seamlessly through our business and really begin utilizing the tools and resources that we have much better. \nDavid Sewell: Yes, P.J., it remains to be seen if curbside has staying power. I think by and large know when you look at residential repaint contractors, they liked the interaction with our stores. They like the interaction with our reps. On the DIY side, I think there's some color counseling that, that they like to get while coming into our stores and currently they're really not getting that interaction. So we'll see, they may have some staying power, but I do think there's still a lot of interaction and support they get from our stores on making recommendations on colors and different things like that. \nJohn Morikis : But I might add though, P.J. that, the curbside aspect of it, we think that has legs and that, that will continue, as one of the outtakes that customers enjoy, in some cases, the ability to get in and get out. The majority of the customers that come into the morning, start their business, have their crews at our stores, can still do that and those that want to come in and zip out, we'll offer the best of both. \nP.J. Juvekar: And just related to that, let's say in the future, it's an online order followed by delivery. Does that lower barriers to entry in the business or is it an advantage for you, because you have a local store and you can get there faster?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, I\u2019d say it's a huge advantage to us. It's really no different when you think about it. The customer picking up the phone and requesting an order and having us deliver that product to them, it's really no different from that aspect. But I would say that we really enjoy this store platform that we have and the ability to do both, the multipoint distribution capability. We're 30 minutes from you anywhere. And our ability to deliver in quick turnaround or with quick responsiveness, we think is important. But it's also a foundation we believe, because those customers that are in every morning, they're building a partnership with our employees. There's a loyalty that grows. And I'd say that loyalty grows both ways. It grows with the customer to Sherwin and Sherwin to the customer. And we think that distribution is one and albeit one very important aspect of the stores. But we really value our role in our customer success. And I'd say we may have value more than others, because we have a terrific relationship with these customers. But I'd say these are valuable important in building the partnership and that partnership includes problem solving for the customers, training, job management, helping them really run their business and it evolves. It evolves from just a transaction to a strong relationship. And I would tell you 35 years ago when I was in a store, I built some of those strong relationships. And unfortunately about a year and a half ago, I lost mom. And I would tell you, I was shocked. When I went back home and found a few contractors that I served, when I was a store manager that came back and spent time with me there. I think I share that story, because I think it captures the essence of what we do in our stores. We build strong relationships and they last and delivery is important, but we do a lot more than just deliver. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Andrews: Just want to ask on the Americas Group guidance for the second quarter and the rest of the year. We've talked about this on prior calls, but you've really been gaining a lot of market share. And by my estimation the second quarter you kind of lapped that step up in share again that really started to take hold in the second quarter last year, in that really bad weather period. So when you think about what you're telling us about 2Q and what you're telling us about the balance of the year, is that reflective of sort of how you think the overall do it for me, or just general paint industry is going to do? Or are you still baking in that you're going to continue to gain share even though the comps are may be getting a little harder?\nJohn Morikis : We're going to gain share. We've been very clear on that. We're going to gain share and we're just getting started. I look at what's happening and what we're doing during this time and the work that, that leadership team and what they're delivering and I\u2019d say we've got the best people in the field, the best store managers, best reps, they\u2019ve got great resources. And we're making investments, Vincent, during these times that we expect to come out as pretty strong. \nDavid Sewell: And Vincent, when you look at those -- we look at the long-term and we got an SG&A question earlier. But as we keep adding reps, we keep adding stores, we invest in the product innovation and e-commerce platform. This is just the confidence that will exit the environment and position better to grow multiple in the end market. And to highlight that point is -- similar to what we saw coming out of the 2008 and '09 recession, and I'll highlight for you, the three, five and 10 year compounded average growth rate of architectural sales in our North America stores grew at a high-single-digit rate in each of those three categories which we believe was a multiple of the end market. And we believe the same dynamics are in this situation.\nVincent Andrews: As a follow up, one of the other things we've talked a lot about over the last few years, when we had a low unemployment environment, it was a bit challenging and in periods where there was pent up demand from bad weather to prosecute that demand. But obviously, as we go through the summer, we're unfortunately going to have some pretty unattractive unemployment numbers. And I'm just wondering, have your customers talked to you about they're actually able to go out and hire more painters now. And so maybe we will see a benefit from that, at least for some period of time over the next few quarters? \nJohn Morikis: We might, I think it's a little bit early for that, but we might. And again, that's where I want to feel like I'm preaching on this store platform. But I mean if our customers are hiring people that might be less skilled or less experienced, that's where we can shine for them. We work with those customers. It's just the products that we provide and the rheology that we use in our products to make sure that they flow in level better than others, the touch up, the fact that we own our colorants and how the touch up is easier and better. All of that allows maybe a less experienced or less skilled or growing in skill maybe painter to be a producer for our painting contractors. So we like this type of environment where we can shine. And that's what we'll continue to really try to leverage as we move through this process.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Harrison: Wondering, John, if you can quantify how many of your stores are closed in North America right now? And are those all situations where you've been restricted by the government or are there situations where you have a handful of stores and you've decided to consolidate business from that handful into one or two locations? \nJohn Morikis: Yes, Mike, let me have David Sewell answer that one. \nDavid Sewell : Hi, Mike. Right now we probably have close to 30 stores in North America that are closed. Those are all -- all those stores are due to government mandate. The team is doing a really nice job in trying to fulfill orders and deliveries from other locations that are open. And then as that continues to hopefully open up those stores, we will immediately open up when the government allow. \nMike Harrison: And also I was wondering a little bit about the cadence of demand from contractors as we're probably going to see some slowing in existing home sales and some of these commercial projects may get deferred, your competitor yesterday talked of the coming air pocket in some of that commercial business in particular. Is that something that you see as well or do you think it's going to be steadier? \nJohn Morikis: I think there is structures coming out of the ground right now, while there was some delay in getting on those; one, because of the stay in place or stay home; and the other, in some of those areas where they're allowing workers to come in with restrictions. So, there'll be likely some delay in those. But our customers are still feeling good about those. The other thing I would mention is, we track very closely requests for specs, for colors, for data sheets, all things that we look at as data points in helping us to understand kind of the trend and they're very strong. And so we think short-term there's going to be some bumpiness in this quarter. We get that again, second quarter is going to be a challenge. We're going to get through that. And as our contractors and our specifiers and our architects are working on projects, we're going to be the ones right there with them helping them. \nMike Harrison: And then just quickly, you guys introduced this microbicidal paint a couple of years ago, Paint Shield. Has that been tested for effectiveness against this coronavirus and are you getting an increased interest in that product for either commercial or residential applications right now?\nJohn Morikis: We do but it's not a virus -- it\u2019s not a coating that kills virus. That is a microbicrobial, very easy to say. So, it'll kill some bacteria, but it will not kill a virus. Now that said, we've had an interest as overall health and well-being, the concern of ensuring that you have as safe an environment as possible has helped us in this area. And we do have more interest on that product. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. \nKevin McCarthy: I was wondering if you can speak to the price contribution embedded in your same-store sales growth. I think you had an increase of 3% to 4% on January 1, perhaps you can lighten us as to how much of that has been realized at this point?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Kevin, that increase has gone as expected and we've realized just under 2% of effectiveness in the quarter. We do expect that to get a little bit better into the second quarter but progressing as planned.\nKevin McCarthy: And then secondly, Al, with regard to capital allocation. As we paused share repurchase activity, is it safe to say that M&A activity is likewise paused for some period of time or how would you characterize level of interest for full timer larger acquisitions at this point? \nAllen Mistysyn: Well, we have a lot of interest in the acquisition. I think what we're continuing to do is work with the teams on generating the targets and filling our pipeline. Obviously, in this environment, it is challenging. That being said, I feel very good about our liquidity, the amount of cash we generate. With 2.5 billion in available liquidity sources, we've done a lot of work pushing our near-term maturities out. So, I feel very good about our balance sheet and our capacity to make M&A as we come out of this and we and we see some of these targets may be coming to the market. So I feel very good about our position.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: John, Al, how should we think about decremental margin in your various businesses in Q2 here?\nAllen Mistysyn: When you say decremental margin with all the businesses except for our consumer brands being down, what I think you see is all the actions that these groups have taken in continuous improvement, I point to our Performance Coatings Group who -- as we saw demand through the second half of last year slowing, they really have done a nice job controlling costs, improving even -- how their operations are, you saw nice pickup in their first quarter operating margin was up. So, I think, the way I look at it is all the actions that we've taken coming into this, and all the actions we're taking now, I would not expect to see -- it's not dollar for dollar decrement if you will, I think you're going to see better than that. How much? Obviously, it depends on volume. And -- but I think we've done and taken the right action. \nJohn Morikis: Yes, I think if you look at that business, particularly the Performance Coatings Group, strong leader Aaron Erter and Todd is in there that are -- for the last over a year period have been really driving -- have a wonderful leadership team beneath them that are really driving expense reductions down to be in a position to leverage everything that we can here. So, I think there's been a lot of good work and it'll only continue.\nDavid Begleiter: And John just in Consumer Brands very strong results, are you gaining share in this business or it\u2019s just the underlying growth of the market as we see it right now?\nJohn Morikis: It is early to tell. I think, right now we're working very hard to be the best supplier we can and as data comes out, we'll know better. But right now we're trying to build the brand, products and make sure that we're servicing our customers better than anyone else could.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nTruman Patterson: So John and Al, you all have touched on this quite a bit, but I'm hoping to ask it a little bit differently. In the Americas Group, you're expecting the second quarter sales to be down low-double-digits to mid-teens. And then for the full year, flat to down mid-single-digits. At the low end of the four year guidance I think it implies that revenues improve to kind of a mid-single- digit decline in 3Q and 4Q. Could you just walk us through how you all are getting there? And maybe some of the assumptions that you're making that even at the low end we're going to try to improve versus the second quarter.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Truman. As we start seeing where this is really going to come in and as we start seeing states start opening up and the shelter in place executive orders are removed and job sites start opening up more and we can get back to work, I think as that progresses through the quarter, I expect to see improvement in the trends in the weekly sales rates. And then when you get to the third quarter and the fourth quarter, I expect that to continue. Exterior, even in the second quarter coming into the third quarter, on res repaint, there's opportunities as John talked about.  I mean, there are commercial projects that are in place today that need to get painted. There are housing units in place today that need to get painted and we expect those to happen here. It's just timing. So -- and as we carry the additional stores and reps that we put in last year and that we're putting in this year, you would expect the ramp up as we get through the third and fourth quarter. \nTruman Patterson: And then on the Performance Coatings demand, you're expecting it down high-single-digits to low-double-digits in 2020. Could you just give us an idea of whether you're seeing any of the pricing contracts start to soften, especially in the face of a lower raw material environment?\nAllen Mistysyn: Truman, make sure just jump on the pricing. The amount of sales we have indexed or tied to an index is probably less than 10% within Performance Coatings, it's less than 3% overall. I just think historically -- and I'll even go back to my experience from 2000 and 2001, industrial just seems to be a slower recovery than the architectural side of our business. Asia-Pacific, which is by and large back to work, is slowly coming -- growing. But I think you'll see China in particular, pick up a lot faster as the U.S. and European economies start getting back on their feet. Our business has a significant component that's export related. And then it's just -- what do you think Europe and Asia -- or I'm sorry, Europe and in North America, how we come out of that. So, it's going to be a little choppy across businesses, across geographies, but like we talked about, I mean, packaging is going strong. We expect that to continue as we get back to work and people driving their cars. We'll start seeing auto refinish picked up as John mentioned. So I just think the cadence is a little bit slower than architectural. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. I'm glad you're all well. You gave us the June quarter sales guidance, but not earnings guidance. Where in your cost structure is the most uncertainty that you can't flow that through? Is it in labor costs or the stores\u2019 cost, raw materials but what are you most uncertain about there in your cost structure?\nAllen Mistysyn : John, we haven't -- we've given sales guidance only through '18 and '19. I've got no reason to start giving EPS quarterly guidance now. I don't think there's uncertainty around our cost structure. I think the plan, the actions we've taken to reduce our costs, reduce our discretionary spending, hold open item, are all are going to impact the second quarter. But we're not managing the company for the second quarter. We're managing it for the long-term. And we're really looking at the recovery coming out of the third and fourth quarter and really drive our momentum into 2021. That's what we're looking at.\nJohn Roberts: Then to come in earlier on the raw material basket being down low-single-digit percent. I assume that\u2019s a price index for the raw materials? Do you have significant inventory of raw materials to work down, your dollar purchases of raws will be down more than that low-single percent?\nAllen Mistysyn: John. Really the vast majority of our dollars are in bulk tanks at our factory. We're not buying ahead of any material nature. We're staying close to our suppliers and making sure they're able to service us. And in particular, I would say, the team has done a very good job of managing this rapidly increasing unprecedented DIY demand. I think they're retrofitting plants, they\u2019re moving products around to build capacity. And our suppliers have done a terrific job making sure we have the raw materials needed to keep up with that demand. And I think our procurement teams and our global supply chain team need to get a lot of credit for that. But no reason that we would be buying ahead on raw material. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop capital. Please proceed with your question. \nGarik Shmois: Thanks. I just want to be clear, just on the 2Q Consumer Brands guidance. Does that include the ACE exit and your softer Asian fundamentals? Because if it does, it does seem that the retail piece is running mid-teens if not better if I'm not mistaken?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, it does include both of those. Just one comment on the ACE business that we exited. Because we're getting towards the end of that agreement, I mean we are shipping ACE, the final I would say inventories of the private label in this quarter, it'll be all done. So I would say that from a quarterly standpoint, the second quarter is probably the least impacted and then third quarter will get back to a little heavier, then fourth quarter moderate a little bit just because it's a small quarter. And it does include Asia as well.\nGarik Shmois: Just want to also follow up just on the comment earlier around exterior here in the Americas gaining momentum. Just wanted to see, is this just seasonal or are you seeing an increase in contractor backlogs as kind of driving some of that momentum that you identified earlier?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, I think it's a number of drivers. I think certainly seasonal. When you look at sequential improvement, there's a piece of that. I'd say that our teams are doing a very nice job of really focusing on this business through contractor relationships and as well through product technology. You may recall last quarter I talked about a product that's FlexTemp. We're having really good feedback and interest from residential customers as well as new residential. This is a product that can be applied down to 35 degrees or up to 120 degrees without sacrificing performance or application. And so, it's that type of innovation along with the service and the relationships that we're building in our stores that has us believing that we're going to grow here and outpace the market. \nOperator: Thank you. We'll move on to our next question, which comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. \nDavid Bellinger: So, comparable sales, again very strong here. Can you talk about what you were seeing early in the quarter from an underlying demand perspective? It seems overall housing metrics were improving in a pretty good state. And regarding the early trends of Q2, how long do you think that DIY\u2019s performance, the outperformance there gets pulled up. Is there some potential pull forward in demand out of the back half of the year? \nJohn Morikis: I will take a first run at this and let Al jump in. When you asked about our run early, I would say life was really, really good. We were having -- we thought this was the year and we still again feel the fundamentals are there, but we were smoking. On DIY I'd say -- and Al I can come back, if you want to add anything on that? \nAllen Mistysyn: DIY, I'd say that it's hard to say if you're pulling forward, there might be some of that, we\u2019ll have to see how it unfolds. When you think about the professionals that are going in and doing homes, often times what you'll find is DIY customers more willing to take on projects like a small room, bedroom, living room, whatever, not typically two story foyers, often times exterior is off limits just because the scope of the work there was scaffolding and then the work that goes there and you want to try to complete a project, those projects typically take a longer time. So, DIY consumers are typically more focused on smaller, more manageable projects. And what you see is a lot of activity right now. And quite frankly, we like it. We think that the idea that, that not just the short-term benefits of having customers purchasing products, but the idea that customers are enjoying the benefits of a repaint, we think is a positive longer term. These customers can get an idea of the impact that a relatively low cost investment can have on their home and certainly their mental well-being in the time like this when a lot of people have a lot of anxiety and stress, it's relatively inexpensive.  Some of them they\u2019ll tackle themselves and if some of them down the road say, what I got to go back to work, but this room would look well, look nice, painted as well, then that might carry over as well. But what to see if it's a pull forward, we've mortgaged some of that or not? \nJohn Morikis: I think that it will slow as people get back to work and if unemployment ticks up, we don't expect to see a continued surge in DIY. And we're also monitoring on the res repaint side. We believe and again we'll see how this plays out. But by and large that the people that want to do a DIY project aren't going to hire a contract, but people that tend to hire contract, painting contractors to do the work, are going to continue to hire painting contractors. We're not expecting a big hit in our res repaint due to the surge in DIY, and certainly on exteriors, as we talked before. Typically those are going to be done by painting contractors.\nDavid Bellinger: God if that's all very, very helpful. And if you could tie your comment there I think towards the pricing increases planned throughout the year. Has there been any data that suggests customer pushback on higher pricing in this environment? And how is that shaping your thinking towards further pricing opportunities from you? Thank you very much. \nJohn Morikis: It's not impacted as we can see right now the choice of products. In fact as I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing a positive mix shift in quality. And just like we have in the past, we get together monthly as a management team, review our total cost basket and we make decisions on a monthly basis. And when we do that we talk to our employees, our customers and then we share with the financial community.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with G.Research. please proceed with your question.\nRosemarie Morbelli: I was wondering if you -- one area we didn\u2019t talk about clearly is Latin America. Could you give us a feel for what is happening there in terms of the demand, the shutdown if any or the lack of shutdown, actually, which may create more issues going forward?\nJohn Morikis: Sure. Rosemarie, let\u2019s Chile is likely maybe best described as the closest to having normal operations. I'd say Argentina and Ecuador for the most part are closed for most of the time. In Mexico, about 60% of our stores are operating normally and roughly balanced, are running on curbside or -- we got a small, a very small percentage close but for the most part it\u2019s split between the normal and curbside. And then Brazil, I'd say roughly about 34 of our stores are closed. And the remaining open about which is about 53%. Those 53% represents over 70% of our gallon. And so that's through our own stores there. If you look at our business to our dealers, about half of our dealers are closed and about 60% of the home centers are closed but offerings delivery only. So a little bit of a mix in Brazil. \nAllen Mistysyn: And Rosemarie I just add, in the first quarter, if you look at the impact of FX on our Latin America team it was in the mid-teens and embedded in our Q2 guidance is that accelerate as we see the devaluation in the real, Argentinean peso, the Mexican peso. So that's going to be an additional drag on those businesses in second quarter.\nRosemarie Morbelli: So in the past few years, you\u2019ve given us a number of stores in Latin America and in North America, you have now put them both together. Are you still closing down stores in that region?\nJohn Morikis: Last quarter, we did close eight in Latin America. And I think this goes back Rosemarie to the point that I made earlier about our ongoing, I\u2019d call it a pretty rigorous review of businesses, brands, customer programs, other investments and we've closed eight. And those were in areas that were persistently soft markets. We've got a terrific leadership team down here as well. And David and that team are working closely together to evaluate every one of these operations.  They're going to stand on their own or they make tough decisions. And we've made some tough decisions. And we'll continue to look at that business. We want to continue to grow that business. There are some dynamics in that market that makes it little more challenging. But we've got a lot of upside potential we should be in as well. \nRosemarie Morbelli: And then lastly if I may. Can you talk a little about any changes in the competitive environment? Everyone is trying to gain share. Everyone is trying to offset the impact of the pandemic. Can you give us a feel for what\u2019s going on in the marketplace?\nJohn Morikis: Are you talking just whole in general or?\nRosemarie Morbelli: Yes. In general, but if you can look at the different areas you're doing business in? \nJohn Morikis: Yes, it'd be hard to do that for every part of the company and every region. Maybe I could make this statement that we have a lot of respect for our competitors. A very good global competitors and there are a lot of really good regional competitors. Everyone's business is different. These are really challenging times. We're going to do what's right strategically for us and our customers through our strategic vision and model that works for us. And other companies may be taking a different path. But we have a lot of respect for them and it keeps us motivated and driven. It's a healthy paranoia, if you will, because good competition makes you better, we've got a lot of really good competitors. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich : I have two, one is on pricing. You mentioned architectural. Could you talk about Performance Coatings Group, the pricing environment there given everything that\u2019s going on? And then I have a follow-up on stores.\nJohn Morikis: Greg, as you know, we\u2019ve kind of been chasing the price and raw material through '18 and '19. So, we did go out with selective price increases in the first -- early in 2020. We talked about the small number of contracts we have on indexing. But I think the dynamics within our Performance Coatings Group are similar to the dynamics that we talk about in our architectural, and that is, we continue to invest in innovation that helps our customers be more effective, more efficient, drive faster line of speeds on their manufacturing lines to drive their total cost of application down. And it's really what we're looking at to move off of just price kind of cost metrics. And I think that's important to continue to focus on and we will continue to do that. And continue to expand our services to our customers to drive growth for both of us. \nAllen Mistysyn: Help them make more money, help them achieve their goals. Help solve their problems, everything we can do.\nGreg Melich: Great. And then second on the stores business. What percentage of the orders are you now taking via e-commerce, whether it be either the app or website as opposed to just I guess the phone or walk in order? And are there any products that your customers especially new accounts are asking that you add to the assortment in this environment where you can really leverage the stores network?\nJohn Morikis: Regarding the online. I would say this way, Greg. It's a growing, it's a high percentage growth, but it's relatively low overall. So while we're excited with the percentage, it's off of a relatively low phase as we're really now getting behind this. We expect that to continue. And we're going to come out of this better as a result of it.  As far as products that our customers are asking for it, yes, there's some and we're looking into them. We\u2019re likely to find them on our shelves before we talk about that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Are the social distancing practices of Sherwin-Williams uniform across its store network, or are they different in different states? And how do you expect them to evolve from now to the end of the year? Will the state set your guidelines for will you set them?\nDavid Sewell: Hi, this is David. Thanks for the question. We have some standard protocols that we follow for social distancing. As our stores come back, the team has done a phenomenal job. There will be details on floors, we will be guiding walkways. So, it's a little different dynamics than say at our manufacturing plant, where Joe Baxter and his team have done a great job of ensuring strong social distancing practices. We follow CDC guidelines at a minimum. We have some healthcare professionals that we consult with as well. So we take that very seriously. And we try to go above and beyond everywhere we can.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. And when you think about the next year or two in terms of the value of paint, we're going to go through a period where raw materials are going to come down quite a lot, the consumer is going to be distressed, the contractor market is going to be much loser. Now, Sherwin really likes to price for value as do many coatings companies. Do you think we're going to go through more of a deflationary period in terms of product pricing and paint with raw materials coming down and the margins being good? Or do you think we're going to have more of a continuation of the pattern before the recession, where there would be intermittent general price increases as a base case?\nJohn Morikis : Jeff, I think, an important element to keep in mind is the cost structure of a contractor. When you mentioned the Sherwin stores 90% of the cost of goods for a painting contractor is labor. And so our focus is on driving the efficiency and productivity and profitability of that customer through innovative products and services and we'll continue to invest in areas that will help them to do that. And we believe in turn our position with that customer improves and it improves from a loyalty, usage and acceptance standpoint. And so not our intent -- we know we have to be competitive in the marketplace at the price of entry, if you will, into the market. We'll continue to ensure that we're competitive, but we'll also be making those investments we think that will help justify the price that we're charging our customers. \nAllen Mistysyn: And Jeff, I think that's a very important point by continuing to invest in that innovation and making the painting contractor more effective where they can get more jobs done, the same number of people makes it -- paint such a small portion of their costs. But I would point to, \u201810, \u201811 and \u201812 when we saw the big run up in costs, raw material costs and they rolled over and we by and large held our price \u201813 through \u201816 and we saw a nice improvement in our gross margin. But you can only do that if you\u2019re continuing to invest in products and services that are going to continue to help the painting contractors make more money. \nJohn Morikis: Yes, you can't offer commodity products and services and ask for specialty store margins or pricing. \nOperator: My next question is from Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question. \nChristopher Perrella: A quick question on inventory levels with the rapid drop in demand, actually you\u2019re guys building into the spring for robust business. I think Al touched on this a little bit. Where are your raw material standing and what to the best of your estimate is a working capital impact in second quarter? \nJohn Morikis: Yes, so Chris, we I think did a very good job of managing our inventory. And I would just say that the raw material inventory is much smaller part of our overall inventory, but we did a much better job, a very good job of managing inventory down where we saw weakness in demand and that helped contribute to the 151 million improvement we saw in working capital in our first quarter. I think you're going to -- and we do and did build architectural inventory to what we had planned coming into the season as we're seeing a little bit softer or we're seeing softer sales in our TAG group. We're still seeing, like we've talked about that unprecedented increase in the DIY through the home center channel. So, you've seen a switch and I talked about it earlier about our global supply chain. I mean we're building and producing every gallon we can and we're continuing to look and work with our customers on getting the right products made, getting the right product and inventory into the store shelves, both in our stores and with our retail partners.  So, it's definitely varies. Packaging, we're building inventory as much as we can across all the regions because we continue to see strong demand. But I can assure you we'll continue to manage our inventories lower. And we've done a lot of different things. We've cut -- we have more communication between the selling organization and our supply chain. We've cut batch sizes, we cut safety stock. We've gone to more of a make and ship model in some cases versus make -- versus make to stock. So there\u2019s a lot of leverage that we've pulled and will continue to pull as the demand environment unfolds. \nChristopher Perrella: And one quick one with the implied sales -- with the sales guidance for 2Q, is there any implied channel draw down in your Performance business? Or is that all basically straight volume out of your factory to the customer?\nJohn Morikis: It's all volume out of the factory. So again I think in those markets in particular, the team has done a nice job of driving inventory down, so just more out of the factories. \nOperator: Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. I'd like to pass the floor back over to management for any additional concluding comments.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, Jesse. This is Jim Jaye. I just wanted to thank everyone for their questions and interest today. And I hope it came through very clearly on our confidence and determination to manage through this near-term as we go forward. Before we sign off today, I just want to do a housekeeping note to all of you. We will be postponing our Annual Financial Community presentation, which was scheduled for June 3rd in New York City this year. It's our intent to reschedule that event hopefully later this year. We don't have that date yet but as we have details, we'll let us know whether that's going to be a virtual presentation or not. So, thank you. As always, I along with my colleague Eric Swanson will be available for follow-ups. And please contact Natalie Darr in our office to be added to the queue. And thank you. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Once again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Sewell",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Let me also add my sincere thanks to our entire global team. Without a doubt, our incredibly talented and dedicated employees remain our most important asset and we have implemented a wide range of temporary policies and protocols over the last two months to protect their health and safety. These actions include enhanced paid sick and/or family leave, alternate flexible and remote work arrangement, visitor and employee screening protocols, social distancing best practices, additional PPE and sanitary procedures, and we have established a global crisis response team among many other measures. We also took the unprecedented step of temporarily closing our paint stores sales force to further protect employees as we move to serving customers with curbside pickup and delivery option. As for our customers, we provide essential products and services that are helping painters create and maintain clean and healthy living environment and healthcare facilities, manufacturing plants, residences, and for other vital infrastructure. Many of these contractors have expressed their gratitude to us for keeping our stores open and enabling them to keep their businesses running, doing their jobs, generating income and supporting their family. We're also supporting industrial customers in mission critical areas, such as food and beverage packaging, healthcare equipment, food manufacturing, water treatment, and energy infrastructure. During the crisis, we have delivered critical coatings product to producers of ventilators, oxygen tanks, and hospital bed frame. At this time, all major architectural and industrial plants and distribution service centers are in operation. The utilization rates vary based on manufacturing site and customers serve. We have had no significant issues with raw material availability or supply. We've had a very small number of North American stores closed intermittently during the crisis related to varying government borders. The vast majority of stores remain open. All of our businesses have developed and are executing on multi-phased contingency plan to adjust to the near -term business environment. We have taken targeted action to reduce costs, pause or eliminate certain programs, cut general expenses and delayed filling open positions. We've also made adjustments to a small percentage of our workforce through involuntary leaves and reductions in force. We have additional levers we can pull, if necessary. Through all of this, our employees continue to support the communities where they live and work. To-date, we have donated hundreds of thousands of masks, gloves and lab coats to those on the frontlines fighting the virus. We have also manufactured and donated hand sanitizers to many hospitals throughout the country. Our entire team remains focused and determined as we manage through this crisis, and we're confident we will emerge from this as a stronger company. Yes, we are not trimming just to be clear. We're not trimming personnel in our tag organization. In fact, we'll continue to invest as John talked about it in new stores. We will see the trend in SG&A decline in our in our second quarter. Because of the sales shortfall, we probably won't see the percent of sales improve. But the steps that David talked about in our contingency planning, they're material and as he talked about as we see demand and the trends in demand develop, we have other levers, ready to go to poll, if we need to, but we are not going to be cutting our stores organization. Yes, P.J., it remains to be seen if curbside has staying power. I think by and large know when you look at residential repaint contractors, they liked the interaction with our stores. They like the interaction with our reps. On the DIY side, I think there's some color counseling that, that they like to get while coming into our stores and currently they're really not getting that interaction. So we'll see, they may have some staying power, but I do think there's still a lot of interaction and support they get from our stores on making recommendations on colors and different things like that. And Vincent, when you look at those -- we look at the long-term and we got an SG&A question earlier. But as we keep adding reps, we keep adding stores, we invest in the product innovation and e-commerce platform. This is just the confidence that will exit the environment and position better to grow multiple in the end market. And to highlight that point is -- similar to what we saw coming out of the 2008 and '09 recession, and I'll highlight for you, the three, five and 10 year compounded average growth rate of architectural sales in our North America stores grew at a high-single-digit rate in each of those three categories which we believe was a multiple of the end market. And we believe the same dynamics are in this situation. Hi, Mike. Right now we probably have close to 30 stores in North America that are closed. Those are all -- all those stores are due to government mandate. The team is doing a really nice job in trying to fulfill orders and deliveries from other locations that are open. And then as that continues to hopefully open up those stores, we will immediately open up when the government allow. Hi, this is David. Thanks for the question. We have some standard protocols that we follow for social distancing. As our stores come back, the team has done a phenomenal job. There will be details on floors, we will be guiding walkways. So, it's a little different dynamics than say at our manufacturing plant, where Joe Baxter and his team have done a great job of ensuring strong social distancing practices. We follow CDC guidelines at a minimum. We have some healthcare professionals that we consult with as well. So we take that very seriously. And we try to go above and beyond everywhere we can."

            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We anticipate the negative impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and global economies will most likely continue through the second quarter. We do not expect immediate meaningful improvement ahead in most end markets we serve and we're unable to predict when any noticeable improvement in those end markets will occur. Given the near-term trends and indicators we see at this time, we anticipate second quarter 2020 consolidated net sale would decrease by a low to mid-teens percentage versus the second quarter of 2019. Looking at our operating segments for the second quarter, we anticipate the Americas group to be down by a low double digit to mid teen percentage, consumer brands group to beat up by a high single digit to low double digit percentage and performance coatings group to be down a high teen percentage. For the full year 2020, we are revising our sales guidance to reflect uncertainties and the timing and pace of improvement in the U.S. and global operating environment. If economic conditions begin returning to normal in the third quarter of 2020, and continue improving through the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year consolidated net sales to be flat to down a low single digit percentage. If economic conditions do not materially improve until the first quarter of 2021, we anticipate full year 2020 consolidated net sales to decrease by a mid to high single digit percentage. This revised full year 2020 consolidated sales guidance is compared to our previous full year guidance of an increase of 2% to 4%. On an operating segment basis for the full year, we anticipate the Americas Group to be flat to down by a mid single digit percentage, consumer brands group to be up or down by a low single digit percentage and performance coatings group to be down by a high single digit to low double digit percentage. Considering our revised range of potential sale, we are revising our diluted net income for common share for 2020 to be in the range of $16.46 to $18.46 per share, compared to our previous guidance of $19.91 to $20.71 per share and compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings per share guidance include acquisition related amortization expense of approximately $2.54 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2020 earnings per share of $19 to $21. One key assumption embedded in our outlook is the raw material deflation we expect to realize for full year 2020. We expect the raw material basket to be lower year-over-year by a low single digit percentage. Switching to our balance sheet which along with our liquidity position remained strength of the Company, at March 31, 2020, we had $239 million in cash and $2.5 billion of unused capacity under our revolving credit facility. At the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio improved 3.1 times on net debt to adjusted EBITDA compared to 3.5 times a year ago. As Jim noted earlier, during the first quarter, we use cash to build architectural inventory level in advance of the spring and summer selling season. However, our teams reacted quickly, slowing demand, various businesses in region where it occurred and aggressively reduced inventory which helped reduce our year-over-year working capital of $151 million. You have completed a number of actions over the past year to reduce our risk and improve our financial flexibility. We recently completed a bond issuance in March for $500 million of 10-year note at 2.3%, this $500 million of 30 year note at 3.3%. These are the lowest coupon rates in the history of the Company. The proceeds of these issuances reduce to complete a tender offer for 500 million of 2.75% note due in 2022 will also be used to pay off the 429 million, 2.25% note that are coming due in May. Our next long-term debt maturity in 2021 is $25 million. In the first quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our company stock and increased our quarterly dividend by 18.6% to $1.34 per share. We are committed to maintaining this dividend increase through the rest of 2020. As David mentioned, we are executing contingency plan to reduce spending and conserve cash. As part of those plans, we are lowering our full year 2020 capital expenditure forecast from $320 million to $180 million and temporarily delaying our share repurchases until we see improvement in the end markets we serve. Finally, we have put a pause on spending related to our new headquarters and R&D facility project but continue to work various planning process. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your question. Got it and I just add to that. And that's partly why, the unpredictability about how our segments come out of this and timing of that, that's why if you will bifurcated the guidance to say okay. If we see things start improving in the third quarter and then continue to improve in the fourth quarter. We think flat to down low-single digit, but it the true recovery doesn't start until the first quarter of 2021. We're looking at that mid-to-high single digit down estimates. So we perfectly understand the uncertainty, so that's why we are giving a range of the timing of when we expect the businesses to come back. John, I would add just though, David Sewell here our COO has got all our businesses leaning forward in a very positive way. So, I'm a bit more optimistic, I might say, in the sense that we've come into this business with a pretty strong performance, a strong comp store sale number. And David has our teams, every one of them, including our stores, taking the activities. Right now that will help us grow even faster coming out of it. And so, the activity that we have in new accounts and product demos and information, this is probably some of the most impressive time we've had. Because we have had some customers on the professional side that has had interior projects that have been delayed, they're not able to get on the exterior projects. And so it's provided our teams more accessibility to some of these customers. And our new account activity is actually up as a result of this. Our demos of new products are up. So, you've start to David and our teams not only in our stores and all of them for what we're doing during these times. And so I guess what you're asking, as these stores close, how quickly do they rebound. Our desire, really strong desires to come out of this much stronger than even what we were before. I'll agree with that Steve. And we really started seeing it kick-in about mid-March and that trend has not only continued but accelerated in April. Yes, Kevin, that increase has gone as expected and we've realized just under 2% of effectiveness in the quarter. We do expect that to get a little bit better into the second quarter but progressing as planned. Well, we have a lot of interest in the acquisition. I think what we're continuing to do is work with the teams on generating the targets and filling our pipeline. Obviously, in this environment, it is challenging. That being said, I feel very good about our liquidity, the amount of cash we generate. With 2.5 billion in available liquidity sources, we've done a lot of work pushing our near-term maturities out. So, I feel very good about our balance sheet and our capacity to make M&A as we come out of this and we and we see some of these targets may be coming to the market. So I feel very good about our position. When you say decremental margin with all the businesses except for our consumer brands being down, what I think you see is all the actions that these groups have taken in continuous improvement, I point to our Performance Coatings Group who -- as we saw demand through the second half of last year slowing, they really have done a nice job controlling costs, improving even -- how their operations are, you saw nice pickup in their first quarter operating margin was up. So, I think, the way I look at it is all the actions that we've taken coming into this, and all the actions we're taking now, I would not expect to see -- it's not dollar for dollar decrement if you will, I think you're going to see better than that. How much? Obviously, it depends on volume. And -- but I think we've done and taken the right action. Yes, Truman. As we start seeing where this is really going to come in and as we start seeing states start opening up and the shelter in place executive orders are removed and job sites start opening up more and we can get back to work, I think as that progresses through the quarter, I expect to see improvement in the trends in the weekly sales rates. And then when you get to the third quarter and the fourth quarter, I expect that to continue. Exterior, even in the second quarter coming into the third quarter, on res repaint, there's opportunities as John talked about.  I mean, there are commercial projects that are in place today that need to get painted. There are housing units in place today that need to get painted and we expect those to happen here. It's just timing. So -- and as we carry the additional stores and reps that we put in last year and that we're putting in this year, you would expect the ramp up as we get through the third and fourth quarter. Truman, make sure just jump on the pricing. The amount of sales we have indexed or tied to an index is probably less than 10% within Performance Coatings, it's less than 3% overall. I just think historically -- and I'll even go back to my experience from 2000 and 2001, industrial just seems to be a slower recovery than the architectural side of our business. Asia-Pacific, which is by and large back to work, is slowly coming -- growing. But I think you'll see China in particular, pick up a lot faster as the U.S. and European economies start getting back on their feet. Our business has a significant component that's export related. And then it's just -- what do you think Europe and Asia -- or I'm sorry, Europe and in North America, how we come out of that. So, it's going to be a little choppy across businesses, across geographies, but like we talked about, I mean, packaging is going strong. We expect that to continue as we get back to work and people driving their cars. We'll start seeing auto refinish picked up as John mentioned. So I just think the cadence is a little bit slower than architectural. John, we haven't -- we've given sales guidance only through '18 and '19. I've got no reason to start giving EPS quarterly guidance now. I don't think there's uncertainty around our cost structure. I think the plan, the actions we've taken to reduce our costs, reduce our discretionary spending, hold open item, are all are going to impact the second quarter. But we're not managing the company for the second quarter. We're managing it for the long-term. And we're really looking at the recovery coming out of the third and fourth quarter and really drive our momentum into 2021. That's what we're looking at. John. Really the vast majority of our dollars are in bulk tanks at our factory. We're not buying ahead of any material nature. We're staying close to our suppliers and making sure they're able to service us. And in particular, I would say, the team has done a very good job of managing this rapidly increasing unprecedented DIY demand. I think they're retrofitting plants, they're moving products around to build capacity. And our suppliers have done a terrific job making sure we have the raw materials needed to keep up with that demand. And I think our procurement teams and our global supply chain team need to get a lot of credit for that. But no reason that we would be buying ahead on raw material. Yes, it does include both of those. Just one comment on the ACE business that we exited. Because we're getting towards the end of that agreement, I mean we are shipping ACE, the final I would say inventories of the private label in this quarter, it'll be all done. So I would say that from a quarterly standpoint, the second quarter is probably the least impacted and then third quarter will get back to a little heavier, then fourth quarter moderate a little bit just because it's a small quarter. And it does include Asia as well. DIY, I'd say that it's hard to say if you're pulling forward, there might be some of that, we'll have to see how it unfolds. When you think about the professionals that are going in and doing homes, often times what you'll find is DIY customers more willing to take on projects like a small room, bedroom, living room, whatever, not typically two story foyers, often times exterior is off limits just because the scope of the work there was scaffolding and then the work that goes there and you want to try to complete a project, those projects typically take a longer time. So, DIY consumers are typically more focused on smaller, more manageable projects. And what you see is a lot of activity right now. And quite frankly, we like it. We think that the idea that, that not just the short-term benefits of having customers purchasing products, but the idea that customers are enjoying the benefits of a repaint, we think is a positive longer term. These customers can get an idea of the impact that a relatively low cost investment can have on their home and certainly their mental well-being in the time like this when a lot of people have a lot of anxiety and stress, it's relatively inexpensive.  Some of them they'll tackle themselves and if some of them down the road say, what I got to go back to work, but this room would look well, look nice, painted as well, then that might carry over as well. But what to see if it's a pull forward, we've mortgaged some of that or not? And Rosemarie I just add, in the first quarter, if you look at the impact of FX on our Latin America team it was in the mid-teens and embedded in our Q2 guidance is that accelerate as we see the devaluation in the real, Argentinean peso, the Mexican peso. So that's going to be an additional drag on those businesses in second quarter. Help them make more money, help them achieve their goals. Help solve their problems, everything we can do. And Jeff, I think that's a very important point by continuing to invest in that innovation and making the painting contractor more effective where they can get more jobs done, the same number of people makes it -- paint such a small portion of their costs. But I would point to, \u201810, \u201811 and \u201812 when we saw the big run up in costs, raw material costs and they rolled over and we by and large held our price \u201813 through \u201816 and we saw a nice improvement in our gross margin. But you can only do that if you're continuing to invest in products and services that are going to continue to help the painting contractors make more money."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jesse. Good morning everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy during the pandemic. Given the extraordinary circumstances over the last quarter, we've changed our typical format a bit today to provide you with some additional perspective. After my opening remarks, I'll turn the call over to Jim Jaye, our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for some short comments on our first quarter results. David Sewell, our President and Chief Operating Officer will follow Jim, and provide you with details on how we're responding to the pandemic. After David's remarks, I'll share some color on what we're seeing across our various end markets before turning it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Allen Mistysyn, who will provide you with our revised outlook for the year. Let me begin today by thanking the more than 60,000 employees of Sherman-Williams for their courage, determination, and resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their extraordinary effort to serve each other, our customers, our company and our communities during this challenging time truly has been inspiring. This wonderful team has my deepest appreciation and my deepest respect, and I'm confident in their ability to meet the challenges ahead of us. Clearly, we're in a much different economic environment than anyone could have imagined when we provided our 2020 outlook back in January. More than 26 million have filed for unemployment benefits in the U.S. alone since mid-March and other geographies also remain under significant pressure. Sherman-Williams is not immune from these realities. We are seeing major near-term impacts to demand in most of our end markets. We have a long-tenured and experienced management team that has successfully managed the Company through a number of challenging times, recession in the early 2000, the 2008-2009 financial collapse, and the integration of Valspar, the largest acquisition in the Company's long history. Our entire global team remains undaunted and has taken actions to navigate this crisis. We remain very confident in our ability to manage the near-term impacts we're seeing, while positioning ourselves for continued long-term success. We've developed and are executing a comprehensive response to the pandemic, focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, our customers, our company, and our communities. We're implementing multi-phased contingency plans across our businesses to adjust to the near-term business environment. We are well positioned from a balance sheet and liquidity perspective. We've adapted in order to stay connected to our customers through this crisis, including modified operations in our stores and increased use of e-commerce and other technology. We believe we're seeing a pause in demand in many of our end markets rather than destruction of demand. We believe the long-term fundamentals remain intact. We intend to continue strategic investments that support profitable growth. These include continued investments in our stores, our products, our e-commerce platform, and other initiatives as we look for opportunities to expand our business. But before moving ahead, I'd like to thank our team again for remaining focused and delivering on our first quarter plan, even as the COVID pandemic began to impact us. Let me now turn the call to Jim Jaye for some additional comments on the quarter. Thank you, David. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe we are seeing a positive demand rather than destruction of demand, and we continue to feel confident in the long term trajectory of our end markets. While some economies cautiously begin taking steps to reopen, the pace and scale at which this will happen is far from clear. We believe April will be the most challenging month of our second quarter from a comparison perspective, with some gradual improvement as the quarter progresses. Whether the recovery gains momentum in the second half of 2020 or not until 2021 remains to be seen, we believe providing additional granularity on our end markets and how they might begin to emerge from the current environment may be helpful to investors. Let me begin in the Americas group with our North American stores. Again, first quarter trends were very strong with same-store sales 7.4%, reflecting robust underlying demand. We've seen a dramatic near-term pause brought on by the pandemic, with all end markets except DIY being significantly impacted. In residential repaint, customers are delaying interior work related to social distancing concerns and having painting contractors in their home. We expect this demand to return gradually as the pandemic subside, and customers and contractors implement appropriate protective measures. We expect texture repaint work to gain momentum near-term, which will help to offset some of the interior softness. In new residential, starts were strong double digits to begin the year as workers return from stay-at-home orders, work on these homes should resume. Our national homebuilding customers remain positive long term, though cancellations have increased and order rates have soften near-term. Activity should eventually improve as mortgage rates are low in the supply of homes is limited. As a reminder, there's about a 90 to 120 day lag from the time construction begins to the painting phase. In new commercial, many of our customers were reporting strong backlogs and our first quarter sales were up mid-single digit. Construction has been deemed as essential in most locations and jobs in progress will be completed. Work is largely continuing albeit it at a slower pace due to increased job site restrictions and labor challenges. We start to be delayed in the second quarter. So we're optimistic that they will pick back up to the economy begins to reopen more broadly. In property maintenance, overall renters demographics are favorable though apartment terms have slowed dramatically near-term. Management companies remain positive and expect renter movements begin quickly once the economy reopens. Maintenance related to hotels and restaurants is likely to return more slowly. Some CapEx projects have been put on hold in some areas due to local mandate. Our DIY business is strong as consumers are nesting and using stay-at-home time to work on affordable home improvement projects such a painting. We expect our DIY business to remain solid in the second quarter before returning more normal low-single digit rates as stay-at-home orders are lifted. In protective and marine approximately 40% of our sales are tied to oil and gas, which has fallen sharply over the last quarter. Major oil and gas companies are suspended or delayed capital expenditure projects, which have and will continue to impact our results. Conversely, our sales in other end markets such as water and wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical, flooring, rail and marine remain as planned, which will help to offset the softness from weaker oil and gas. While we're seeing short-term disruptions and headwind, the long term drivers we've cited in the past remain intact, including household formations and demographic trends. Given these long term drivers, we intend to continue to invest in our business. We anticipate opening approximately 50 new stores this year, while continuing to focus on sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products and productivity enhancing services. Moving on to an update for consumer brands group. DIY demand in North America continues to be strong as stay-at-home mandates of increased home improvement demand. Sales of homes and other retail channel partners continue to perform well and we are encouraged by growth process with multiple customers in this channel. Looking at our international businesses, we expect our sales to be under considerable pressures through the second quarter. Our expectation is for these businesses to slowly return to more normal activity in the third quarter as the economies of the world begin to open. Lastly, let me comment on trends in performance coatings group. Overall, we anticipate industrial demand recovering more slowly than architectural demand. From a geographic perspective, North America remains the largest region performance coatings and was our strongest performer prior to the pandemic. We would expect it to be true going forward. We have started to see some recovery in China at a slower pace than anticipated. We expect continued pressure in Europe and Latin America. In packaging, demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. We anticipate strong continued demand and additional business wins driven by sustainability trends, and our non- BPA Valpure V70 coatings. In coil coatings, we're seeing a temporary pause and slower pace from commercial construction projects. Jobs in progress will eventually resume and coupled with the continued capture of new business, we expect this business to remain one of our best performers. In general industrial, we're seeing substantial demand weakness in various end markets, including heavy equipment, agriculture, transportation, and general finishing. We expect this recovery will be slow and we'll see continued pressure throughout the rest of 2020. In industrial wood, softness across various end markets including furniture, kitchen cabinetry and flooring has continued. It is difficult to forecast the timing of improvement though many of the same drivers influencing you new housing could benefit business. In automotive refinish, the business has been impacted by the various state home mandates that have been instituted across the country. The decrease in miles driven has led to a decrease in collisions. The pace of recovery in this business will depend on how quickly stay-at-home orders are lifted, and people begin to return to their normal routine. Let me reiterate that while we are seeing near-term pressure across most markets we serve, we're confident in a long term trajectory. Now, I'll turn the call over to Allen Mistysyn, our Chief Financial Officer to talk more specifically about our revised 2020 guidance, our cash and liquidity position, and our approach to capital allocation. Al? Thanks Chris. First, I would say regarding the DIY business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the nesting phenomenon, if you will, as our customers, it's largely the result of their spending more time at home. And we believe that that will continue largely through the stay-at-home orders. Historically, if you look at the underlying principles that have us believing that this gradually shifts back to the, do it for me as opposed to DIY primarily. We think those are still intact. Those are the aging demographics, the home appreciation, the aging housing stock. And that, as well, I would say that if you look at the last recession in DIY, it grew, not in huge amounts, but it was not protracted either. Here, we have a much more significant jump in DIY business and we're experiencing it DIY business in our stores, for those customers that are still preferring a more specialty store experience and through many of our customers and our consumer brands business and we're working hard to serve them as well. As it relates to your next question regarding the, what was it, interior versus exterior? Both were up double-digits in the first quarter, and we expect that as the season starts to turn a little bit here that we'll start to see more lift in the exterior business as a result of more contractors, getting the go ahead from homeowners. In some cases right now are preferring not to have -- many cases right now are preferring not to have painting contractors enter their home. And regionally, you asked a question, what we see regionally. I'd say that we are starting to see more estimating, and I would say the close rates in those estimates are growing. Largely in Southeast and Southwest right now, they're lagging in the Northeast and in the Midwest, which you would expect heavily influenced by what's happening in New York, what's happening in Illinois and Michigan. So, I'd say, going back to the point that we referenced a few times in the prepared remarks. We'll go structurally there's not been much shift. So, we expect this, do-it-yourself to continue short-term, gradually shift back to do-it-for me, and we love our position with those customers to be able to capitalize on that. Yes. So, I'd say in P&M, we mentioned that that represents about 40% -- I'm sorry, oil and gas represents about 40% of our P&M business to our stores. And we have a very strong position there. I'd say that the oil prices have had an impact primarily in the upstream business, where your offshore shale et cetera, midstream, wood storage. Downstream, I'd say in refining and cracking is still quite a bit of investment going on. What I'm really pleased with is the shift that our teams are putting into place that pivot to where the business is not as certainly where we are. We have a strong very strong position in those areas that are under pressure. We got wonderful talent, wonderful products, and we're doing a very good job I believe in moving into some of those areas that are underserved by Sherwin right now in the oil and gas as well as other areas that we mentioned. Those are the water, wastewater, food and beverage even pharmaceutical flooring. So this is a pretty experienced team we have here. And we're taking advantage of those experiences, the scar tissue, if you will, from some of the past experiences. We're not waiting for things to happen. We're trying to capitalize and drive things to make them happen. So, I think in each markets, when we look at the drivers of those segments, we look through and understand we think was a pretty good line of site on what's going to happen. I think if you look at for example in new residential, we feel there is a pause that there is a fundamental need for housing in the country, and that while the short term traffic in models and the feedback that we're getting from our large new residential customers clearly indicate some concern with the shorter term. We're not running the quarter, I mean, running the Company to have a great second quarter here. And that's it. We're doing the best we can with the cards that we were dealt with the in the second quarter. But we're looking at the fundamentals and we believe that if you go by segment, do our business that there are some various sound fundamentals in areas where there is some softness. We're not waiting. We're moving into those areas that offer opportunity. And so segment by segment we're dissecting our business understand we have the right people doing the right things to capitalize on those opportunities. Thank you for that question because it gives you a terrific opportunity to recognize a wonderful team. We've got a terrific leadership team and Peter Ippolito and [indiscernible] and all our division presidents there. But more importantly, as strong as those leaders are, we've got just a wonderful team in our stores and are close to customers and sales reps that are doing a terrific job. And your question gives me just that the opportunity to thank this wonderful team for everything they're doing. You're right, it's changed things. We are a curbside only. So, it's given us an opportunity to leverage some of the investments that we've made in our digital platform. We have orders coming in via the digital platform that we've been invested in with a much greater utilization so we're excited about that. And I would tell you, we've been inundated with emails and notes and even phone calls from customers that have gone out of their way to, to comment and recognize our employees and their willingness to work with people. We've gotten utilizing a color fulfillment so customers can go online order colors and have them into their homes in relatively short period of time. And our people in the stores are eager to help these people, over the phone to make sure that they're taken care of. And then the transaction takes place, it's a contact a transaction when these employee or these customers pull up into our stores and their product is ordered to the back of the car. I don't know I couldn't tell him how many points of contact I've had with people recognizing that's a wonderful service and approach that we're taking. And that's in on our stores, I would say that we were blessed with a number of really, really strong and good customers on our consumer brands team, and [Eddie Peps] and [Keith Velora] [indiscernible] the two leaders running that businesses really helped us to try to be as responsive as we can to that important segment and channel to our customers. And we're trying to in-still as much as we can in our learning's from our store site into those customers and vice versa and just really providing solutions to our customers. So, we're really excited about this and say that the trend that we're seeing in our DIY business is exciting on the consumer side as well as our stores. Yes, I'd say that on pricing we continue to see a positive mix in our business. I say that my side contractors, who recognize that 90% of their projects are labor costs many homeowners, particularly those that are shopping at a Sherwin-Williams store, are typically willing to pay a little more to get the finished that they're looking for, and to have it be as productive as possible. So, we are seeing a positive mix shift in both the a pro or contractor business that we see as well as the do-it-yourself. Sure and good morning, John. What I would say is given the significant decline in crude as you point out, we do expect to realize lower year-over-year raw material costs throughout the remainder of 2020. The full year will be down by low-single-digit percentage as we talked about compared to our prior estimate of being flat for the year. I think the rate in the second half of the year will depend largely on how the downstream derivatives like propylene and ethylene react to the declines in crude. And I would say also if demand is not improved through the second half of the year, then we could potentially see a more meaningful benefit. The majority of the benefit year-over-year is going to be on that resins solvent side. If you take a look at the TiO2 side, I think we've seen strong demand there in the first quarter and the second quarter, but it's probably too soon to fully understand the supply demand impact and the effect on pricing there. I would say at this point we do anticipate stable to potentially lower prices for TiO2 in the back half. Historically weaker global demand has resulted in lower pricing. But again, I think the decline that we're expecting to see in the basket is tied more on the petrochemical side and it's really going to depend on how propylene and ethylene response. Yes. It's hard to say exactly how much of a decline we're seeing, but we saw, but in our second quarter guidance, we're talking about the America's group download double-digit to mid-teen. I think, just commentary as we've seen April progressed, the weekly sales on architectural have improved week to week from a dollar volume standpoint. As a reminder, April, was there a toughest comp a year ago? If you think about how North American same-store progressed to the second quarter last year's April was a strongest quarter and then it took down and then it took down in June. So we were fully expecting April toughest comparison. So that's what makes it a little bit harder to gauge how much is related to the shelter in place and the changes to our sales floor. It varies by division. We are looking at in some areas what we call still in markets where we have underserved markets in areas that we might have more penetration, but we're missing some gas in this. A lot of areas, quite frankly, that we're just not happy with our performance yet. And in the area of market share and our position and we've got a long way to go. And so I'd say, it's kind of a balance between the two. We'd like to take advantage of our position in the market, while providing more accessibility to our customers. And at the same time we have to get after some of these markets that are underserved. Sure. You're right, we've seen a mile driven down considerably, and we expected that impact could be for another 30 to 45 days following the end of the stay-at-home order. So a little bumpy right now if you will and that business no pun intended. But our teams are really doing a nice job there. I think, I've mentioned last quarter, it was a bold statement and I stand by it. I think our position in this auto refinish businesses as strong as it's been since I've been on this floor of the building here and a lot of confidence in our leadership in automotive, a lot of confidence in our performance coatings team and what we're doing. I think we've got a lot of determination in this business to outperform. We're going to have to get some cars on the road be able to see some of that though. I say here though, as well if I could. The effort that we have and the connectivity and virtual learning and the virtual demos that our teams are initiating here in other area out of adversity sometimes comes the best. We've had a lot of things that we've been working on that we've been able to accelerate. And we believe it's helping to convert some of these customers. Some of them were on the fence before assemble it just come online before the pandemic. And, again, we expect to be able to capitalize on this as we come out. Sure. The virus impact on Australia has been severe as well. We're 100% contact with there. But, I'd say we've started to address to your question our SG&A in our position long before the pandemic. And I'd say that our judgments not only in Australia, but I'd say in Europe, even in Asia. If you look at Europe, we have a 70% flow through on our business there. Australia we've taken -- we think the appropriate SG&A steps there as well as in Asia. Prior to the pandemic, we believe right size some of the business there and it made some very difficult decisions in some areas. And we've invested in some other areas to be able to capitalize on our growth. So I wouldn't limit it to just Australia. I think we're taking what we believe to be the appropriate aggressive steps for these businesses to drive the operating margins. We've said time and time again, we're constantly looking at programs, we're looking at brands. We're looking businesses even stores every element of our business. If it's helping us reach our goals, we want to put our foot on the gas. If not, we're making difficult decisions. I would say unprecedented growth in April. Steve, maybe just to make sure, I'm not sure what you may have picked up or the way we may have said it, but we're always looking at our investments and there are times in our normal business that we might be skinning down in an area and invest in other areas, but I think the idea that is important to hear is our stores businesses, very sound fundamental business that, that we expect to put more gas in that tank every chance we can. I don't know that the labor issues coming up right now. I think the, let me go back to the very first part of your question. We don't think that the fundamentals have changed and neither has our position in that market and we feel the gap in The Sherwin-Williams value proposition is wide and I'd say it's growing wider. If you look at rate and this may go back to the question Ghansham asked, so why we have confidence? If you look at, rates are, low housing supply is limited, and while there's some short-term impact to the business, we feel as though the fundamentals are still there. I remind you that we have an exclusive relationship with 18 of the top 20 nationals and front of regionals where we have the opportunity there. We have exclusive with 73 of the top 100. So, there's more opportunity there for us to leverage. And I would tell you that, the value that we bring in distribution our reps, the products even the design tools and local training are really areas that we're focusing on. And so, I'd say our customers right now for the most part are dealing with the short term. But I would tell you the discussions that we're having with them. In fact, last week alone we had discussions with, top all top 10 builders that reached out to us wanting to ensure of our supply chain and our capability to serve them. And I can assure you we're ready more than ready to serve that's part of what gives us confidence. There's going to be some bumps in the road in this quarter no question and maybe rolling a little bit into the two three, who knows that terrific relationships we're going to be right there with them. No one has the responsiveness to serve our customers. I show them lamps. Yes, Bob. Within our global supply chain, we are paring back some of the capacity projects that we had scheduled at the start of this year, going into next year. I would tell you that, that decrease of 140 million -- what we'll do throughout the year is monitor again how the demand trends are developing. And as we see -- for instance, our stores architectural start building back up, we'll turn some of those back on, the timing that causes the delay. But I think the 140 million would be kind of your max case. And then, as we see things turn around, we'll start investing back in our plans, in our distribution centers, in the automation to help with our continuous improvement projects and operating efficiencies and things like that. Actually, our receipts have held up pretty well. I think maybe as we get into early May, we're going to see a gap but then start improving as we get towards the second half of May and into June as -- because as I mentioned, as we look at the progress in our weekly sales, that keeps improving. As we are staying close to our customers, we're not getting a lot of concern about bad debt or solvency of our customers. So right now, as we look at it, I do expect a little bit of slowdown here in early May and maybe mid-May, but then pick up -- start picking up again. So, you're probably not going to like these answers, other than online is significant. Curbside versus delivery, I'd say the largest part of our -- I'd say it's probably on the contractor side pretty evenly split. Obviously the Do It Yourself curbside delivered right outside of our stores. And I would say regarding the future, yes, we want our customers using this system. We believe it helps in our customers' efficiency. We think it helps our efficiency. It allows us to be a better partner to them and allows our customers to move seamlessly through our business and really begin utilizing the tools and resources that we have much better. But I might add though, P.J. that, the curbside aspect of it, we think that has legs and that, that will continue, as one of the outtakes that customers enjoy, in some cases, the ability to get in and get out. The majority of the customers that come into the morning, start their business, have their crews at our stores, can still do that and those that want to come in and zip out, we'll offer the best of both. Yes, I'd say it's a huge advantage to us. It's really no different when you think about it. The customer picking up the phone and requesting an order and having us deliver that product to them, it's really no different from that aspect. But I would say that we really enjoy this store platform that we have and the ability to do both, the multipoint distribution capability. We're 30 minutes from you anywhere. And our ability to deliver in quick turnaround or with quick responsiveness, we think is important. But it's also a foundation we believe, because those customers that are in every morning, they're building a partnership with our employees. There's a loyalty that grows. And I'd say that loyalty grows both ways. It grows with the customer to Sherwin and Sherwin to the customer. And we think that distribution is one and albeit one very important aspect of the stores. But we really value our role in our customer success. And I'd say we may have value more than others, because we have a terrific relationship with these customers. But I'd say these are valuable important in building the partnership and that partnership includes problem solving for the customers, training, job management, helping them really run their business and it evolves. It evolves from just a transaction to a strong relationship. And I would tell you 35 years ago when I was in a store, I built some of those strong relationships. And unfortunately about a year and a half ago, I lost mom. And I would tell you, I was shocked. When I went back home and found a few contractors that I served, when I was a store manager that came back and spent time with me there. I think I share that story, because I think it captures the essence of what we do in our stores. We build strong relationships and they last and delivery is important, but we do a lot more than just deliver. We're going to gain share. We've been very clear on that. We're going to gain share and we're just getting started. I look at what's happening and what we're doing during this time and the work that, that leadership team and what they're delivering and I'd say we've got the best people in the field, the best store managers, best reps, they've got great resources. And we're making investments, Vincent, during these times that we expect to come out as pretty strong. We might, I think it's a little bit early for that, but we might. And again, that's where I want to feel like I'm preaching on this store platform. But I mean if our customers are hiring people that might be less skilled or less experienced, that's where we can shine for them. We work with those customers. It's just the products that we provide and the rheology that we use in our products to make sure that they flow in level better than others, the touch up, the fact that we own our colorants and how the touch up is easier and better. All of that allows maybe a less experienced or less skilled or growing in skill maybe painter to be a producer for our painting contractors. So we like this type of environment where we can shine. And that's what we'll continue to really try to leverage as we move through this process. Yes, Mike, let me have David Sewell answer that one. I think there is structures coming out of the ground right now, while there was some delay in getting on those; one, because of the stay in place or stay home; and the other, in some of those areas where they're allowing workers to come in with restrictions. So, there'll be likely some delay in those. But our customers are still feeling good about those. The other thing I would mention is, we track very closely requests for specs, for colors, for data sheets, all things that we look at as data points in helping us to understand kind of the trend and they're very strong. And so we think short-term there's going to be some bumpiness in this quarter. We get that again, second quarter is going to be a challenge. We're going to get through that. And as our contractors and our specifiers and our architects are working on projects, we're going to be the ones right there with them helping them. We do but it's not a virus -- it's not a coating that kills virus. That is a microbicrobial, very easy to say. So, it'll kill some bacteria, but it will not kill a virus. Now that said, we've had an interest as overall health and well-being, the concern of ensuring that you have as safe an environment as possible has helped us in this area. And we do have more interest on that product. Yes, I think if you look at that business, particularly the Performance Coatings Group, strong leader Aaron Erter and Todd is in there that are -- for the last over a year period have been really driving -- have a wonderful leadership team beneath them that are really driving expense reductions down to be in a position to leverage everything that we can here. So, I think there's been a lot of good work and it'll only continue. It is early to tell. I think, right now we're working very hard to be the best supplier we can and as data comes out, we'll know better. But right now we're trying to build the brand, products and make sure that we're servicing our customers better than anyone else could. Yes, I think it's a number of drivers. I think certainly seasonal. When you look at sequential improvement, there's a piece of that. I'd say that our teams are doing a very nice job of really focusing on this business through contractor relationships and as well through product technology. You may recall last quarter I talked about a product that's FlexTemp. We're having really good feedback and interest from residential customers as well as new residential. This is a product that can be applied down to 35 degrees or up to 120 degrees without sacrificing performance or application. And so, it's that type of innovation along with the service and the relationships that we're building in our stores that has us believing that we're going to grow here and outpace the market. I will take a first run at this and let Al jump in. When you asked about our run early, I would say life was really, really good. We were having -- we thought this was the year and we still again feel the fundamentals are there, but we were smoking. On DIY I'd say -- and Al I can come back, if you want to add anything on that? I think that it will slow as people get back to work and if unemployment ticks up, we don't expect to see a continued surge in DIY. And we're also monitoring on the res repaint side. We believe and again we'll see how this plays out. But by and large that the people that want to do a DIY project aren't going to hire a contract, but people that tend to hire contract, painting contractors to do the work, are going to continue to hire painting contractors. We're not expecting a big hit in our res repaint due to the surge in DIY, and certainly on exteriors, as we talked before. Typically those are going to be done by painting contractors. It's not impacted as we can see right now the choice of products. In fact as I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing a positive mix shift in quality. And just like we have in the past, we get together monthly as a management team, review our total cost basket and we make decisions on a monthly basis. And when we do that we talk to our employees, our customers and then we share with the financial community. Sure. Rosemarie, let's Chile is likely maybe best described as the closest to having normal operations. I'd say Argentina and Ecuador for the most part are closed for most of the time. In Mexico, about 60% of our stores are operating normally and roughly balanced, are running on curbside or -- we got a small, a very small percentage close but for the most part it's split between the normal and curbside. And then Brazil, I'd say roughly about 34 of our stores are closed. And the remaining open about which is about 53%. Those 53% represents over 70% of our gallon. And so that's through our own stores there. If you look at our business to our dealers, about half of our dealers are closed and about 60% of the home centers are closed but offerings delivery only. So a little bit of a mix in Brazil. Last quarter, we did close eight in Latin America. And I think this goes back Rosemarie to the point that I made earlier about our ongoing, I'd call it a pretty rigorous review of businesses, brands, customer programs, other investments and we've closed eight. And those were in areas that were persistently soft markets. We've got a terrific leadership team down here as well. And David and that team are working closely together to evaluate every one of these operations.  They're going to stand on their own or they make tough decisions. And we've made some tough decisions. And we'll continue to look at that business. We want to continue to grow that business. There are some dynamics in that market that makes it little more challenging. But we've got a lot of upside potential we should be in as well. Are you talking just whole in general or? Yes, it'd be hard to do that for every part of the company and every region. Maybe I could make this statement that we have a lot of respect for our competitors. A very good global competitors and there are a lot of really good regional competitors. Everyone's business is different. These are really challenging times. We're going to do what's right strategically for us and our customers through our strategic vision and model that works for us. And other companies may be taking a different path. But we have a lot of respect for them and it keeps us motivated and driven. It's a healthy paranoia, if you will, because good competition makes you better, we've got a lot of really good competitors. Greg, as you know, we've kind of been chasing the price and raw material through '18 and '19. So, we did go out with selective price increases in the first -- early in 2020. We talked about the small number of contracts we have on indexing. But I think the dynamics within our Performance Coatings Group are similar to the dynamics that we talk about in our architectural, and that is, we continue to invest in innovation that helps our customers be more effective, more efficient, drive faster line of speeds on their manufacturing lines to drive their total cost of application down. And it's really what we're looking at to move off of just price kind of cost metrics. And I think that's important to continue to focus on and we will continue to do that. And continue to expand our services to our customers to drive growth for both of us. Regarding the online. I would say this way, Greg. It's a growing, it's a high percentage growth, but it's relatively low overall. So while we're excited with the percentage, it's off of a relatively low phase as we're really now getting behind this. We expect that to continue. And we're going to come out of this better as a result of it.  As far as products that our customers are asking for it, yes, there's some and we're looking into them. We're likely to find them on our shelves before we talk about that. Jeff, I think, an important element to keep in mind is the cost structure of a contractor. When you mentioned the Sherwin stores 90% of the cost of goods for a painting contractor is labor. And so our focus is on driving the efficiency and productivity and profitability of that customer through innovative products and services and we'll continue to invest in areas that will help them to do that. And we believe in turn our position with that customer improves and it improves from a loyalty, usage and acceptance standpoint. And so not our intent -- we know we have to be competitive in the marketplace at the price of entry, if you will, into the market. We'll continue to ensure that we're competitive, but we'll also be making those investments we think that will help justify the price that we're charging our customers. Yes, you can't offer commodity products and services and ask for specialty store margins or pricing. Yes, so Chris, we I think did a very good job of managing our inventory. And I would just say that the raw material inventory is much smaller part of our overall inventory, but we did a much better job, a very good job of managing inventory down where we saw weakness in demand and that helped contribute to the 151 million improvement we saw in working capital in our first quarter. I think you're going to -- and we do and did build architectural inventory to what we had planned coming into the season as we're seeing a little bit softer or we're seeing softer sales in our TAG group. We're still seeing, like we've talked about that unprecedented increase in the DIY through the home center channel. So, you've seen a switch and I talked about it earlier about our global supply chain. I mean we're building and producing every gallon we can and we're continuing to look and work with our customers on getting the right products made, getting the right product and inventory into the store shelves, both in our stores and with our retail partners.  So, it's definitely varies. Packaging, we're building inventory as much as we can across all the regions because we continue to see strong demand. But I can assure you we'll continue to manage our inventories lower. And we've done a lot of different things. We've cut -- we have more communication between the selling organization and our supply chain. We've cut batch sizes, we cut safety stock. We've gone to more of a make and ship model in some cases versus make -- versus make to stock. So there's a lot of leverage that we've pulled and will continue to pull as the demand environment unfolds. It's all volume out of the factory. So again I think in those markets in particular, the team has done a nice job of driving inventory down, so just more out of the factories."

After the Company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. \nJim Jaye: Thank you and good morning, everyone. While our fourth quarter sales were within our guidance, earnings results fell short of our expectations, ending our year on a disappointing note. As we described on our January 14 call, raw material availability did not improve as meaningfully as anticipated in the quarter and the Omicron variant put additional pressure on our company, particularly in the Americas Group and our global supply chain organization, as well as on our suppliers and our customers. We also faced the highest inflation of the year in the fourth quarter, which we are combating with continued pricing actions. These are near-term headwinds. The good news is that demand remains strong across our end markets. We are seeing raw material supply issues improve sequentially. We also continue to strengthen our customer relationships and take actions during the quarter that strongly position us for the long term. And we remain very confident in our strategy and, above all, our people. Let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers before turning to John Morikis, who will provide commentary on the full year and our outlook for 2022. Starting with the top line, fourth quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 6.1% to $4.76 billion. Raw material availability negatively impacted sales by an estimated high single-digit percentage, with about 65% of the impact in the Americas Group. The remaining impact was largely in the Consumer Brands Group, with an immaterial impact to Performance Coatings Group. Pricing in the quarter was in the high single-digit percentage range. Consolidated gross margin decreased to 39.5%, driven by lower sales volume, raw material cost inflation outpacing our price increases near term and supply chain inefficiencies. SG&A expense decreased to 30.2% of sales. Consolidated profit before tax decreased to $308.9 million. The quarter included $70.1 million of acquisition-related amortization expense. Diluted net income per share in the quarter decreased to $1.15 per share. The quarter included acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.19 per share. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.34 per share. Moving on to our operating segments. Sales in the Americas Group increased 3%, as high single-digit pricing offset lower volume related to raw material availability. Segment margin decreased to 15.1%, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases. Segment SG&A was up slightly as a percent of sales, as we continued investing in strategic growth initiatives. Sales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 7.8% against a double-digit comparison a year ago. Sales were flat excluding the impact of the Wattyl divestiture. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 6.3% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs and supply chain inefficiencies, which were partially offset by selling price increases and good cost control. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 18.7%, driven by price and volume increases. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 8.9% of sales, as operating leverage from the higher volume, selling price increases and good cost control were more than offset by higher raw material costs, where inflation was the highest among the company's three operating segments. Let me turn the call over to John now for additional commentary on 2021 along with our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2022.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you Jim, and good morning everyone. I'll provide some additional color on the fourth quarter in a moment, but first I'd like to summarize our full year. For the second year in a row, we faced a series of challenges that no one could have predicted. The natural disasters of winter storm Uri and hurricane Ida crippled the industry's raw material supply chain for most of the year. The lack of raw material availability coupled with strong demand led to a rapid and unprecedented raw material cost inflation. Labor and transportation costs also escalated throughout the year. And through it all, we continue to battle various complications brought on by the continuation of the pandemic, especially in the fourth quarter. The 610,00 dedicated employees of Sherwin-Williams our greatest asset responded with determination. We did not use any of these challenges as an excuse, but as an opportunity to get even closer to our customers. We focused on supporting our customers' businesses through innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution. This solutions-based approach resulted in our customer loyalty metrics and new account activity growing significantly during the year. These trends bode well for years to come. While we focused on meeting customers' needs, we also attacked rising costs with aggressive pricing actions in all businesses. Near-term pressure on our margins was significant, but we remain highly confident, they will recover just as they have in past cycles, as we grow the business and see commodity costs moderate over time. We also continue to invest in multiple long-term growth initiatives during the year. I'll mention just a few full year metrics. Consolidated sales increased 8.6%, including a mid single-digit headwind related to raw material availability to a record $19.9 billion. It was the 11th consecutive year we have grown the business. Pricing for the year was in the mid single-digit range. On a segment basis, the Americas Group delivered 8% sales growth and 20% PBT margin for the full year, solid performance given the challenging operating environment. Pricing was in the mid single-digit range. Our largest customer segment residential repaint grew by a double-digit percentage for the sixth year in a row. Sales in all other customer segments, with the exception of DIY grew mid-to-high single-digits in the year. We also opened 85 net new stores during the year. Consumer Brands sales were down 10.9% for the year, including a four percentage point impact from the divested Wattyl business. This was against a mid-teens comparison that was driven by DIY projects related to consumers nesting during the pandemic. Pricing was a little less than what we saw in TAG. Performance Coatings sales were up 22% for the year. Every region and every business unit increased by a double-digit percentage. Price realization was in the mid single-digit range. Amidst the highest cost inflation in the company, this segment preserved the vast majority of adjusted profit before tax dollars, which decreased $18.1 million, or 2.5% from the prior year. Even with the increase in consolidated sales, we were not able to fully overcome the impacts of raw material and other cost inflation, raw material availability and the Omicron variant in the year. As a result, net income and diluted net income per share were below last year's levels. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $3.27 billion, or 16.4% of sales. Net operating cash for the year was $2.2 billion, or 11.3% of sales. We put our cash to work, returning a little over $3.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $2.8 billion to purchase 10.1 million shares at an average price of $273.18. We distributed $587 million in dividends, an increase of 20.3%. We also invested $372 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $56 million for our Building our Future project. We ended the year with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times. Additionally, we announced three acquisitions that will add to our capabilities: the coatings business of the Tennant Company, the European industrial coatings business of Sika AG and Specialty Polymers Inc. Total return to shareholders in 2021 was 44.9%, which outpaced the S&P 500 and our peer group. Finally, I'd also like to mention our ESG efforts. We announced and made good progress on our next-generation targets this year. We were recognized for various aspects of our program this year by Newsweek, Forbes and Investor's Business Daily. Given the volatility of the macroeconomic environment over the past two years, our combined results over the period are perhaps a better illustration of the underlying strength of our business. Since the end of 2019, consolidated net sales grew $2 billion, or 11.4%. Gross profit increased $507 million, or 6.3%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $211 million, or 6.9%. GAAP diluted net income per share increased 26.9% to $6.98 per share. And adjusted diluted net income per share increased 15.8% to $8.15 per share. Over the two-year period we've returned approximately $6.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. As far as our fourth quarter, I'll keep my comments brief in order to get to our 2022 outlook. The key themes remain the same as in our third quarter. Demand was strong in nearly all of our end markets. Raw material availability remained a challenge. There was some improvement, but recovery was not as quick as we would have liked. Commodity and other costs remained elevated and we continue to implement price increases. The new wrinkle was the impact of the Omicron variant, which was meaningful as we discussed on our call earlier this month. In the Americas Group sales growth in the fourth quarter was led by Protective and Marine which was up by a double-digit percentage. New residential and property management were up in the mid-single-digit range. Res repaint and commercial were up in the low single-digit range. DIY was down double digits against an extremely strong double-digit comparison. From a product perspective, exterior paint sales performed better than interior sales, with interior being the larger part of the mix. We realized a high single-digit increase in price in the fourth quarter resulting from our February 1 and August 1, 2021 price increases in our mid-September 2021 surcharge. As we mentioned a new 12% price increase is effective February 1 of this year. We opened 35 net new stores in the fourth quarter. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Fourth quarter sales were basically flat to last year, excluding the impact of the Wattyl divestiture. Sales were up low single digits in North America. That was offset by a softer sales in Europe and Asia, where COVID restrictions were more pronounced. Pricing was positive in the quarter and in the high single-digit range. Last, let me comment on the fourth quarter trends in our Performance Coatings Group. We continue to see momentum, as this is the sixth straight quarter of growth for this business. Group sales increased by a high-teens percentage in the quarter. Price realization was in the low double-digit range and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in North America, followed by Europe, Latin America and Asia. Every division in the group grew with nearly all by double digits driven by robust underlying demand, new customer wins, share of wallet gains, and pricing. Packaging was strongest followed by Coil, General Industrial, Industrial Wood and Auto Refinish respectively. Turning to our 2022 outlook. We see an operating environment with strong demand across architectural and industrial end markets. Customer labor will likely continue to be a governor on growth in some areas. We expect raw material availability to continue improving sequentially so the trajectory remains uneven. As supply improves, we stand ready with ample capacity to quickly convert those raw materials to paint. We believe the impact of the Omicron variant on the supply chain should moderate through the first quarter. Any additional impacts from COVID over the remainder of 2022 are hard to predict. What's not hard to predict is our determination. Our role is to influence results not to simply report them. Looking ahead, we expect to bend the curve in our favor through the very deliberate steps we've been taking. These include arrangements and agreements with existing and new suppliers, prioritizing our product offering to our customer's, investments in additional capacity, the acquisition of a resin supplier, and actions to retain employees to produce and distribute products. As the year goes on, we expect to be talking less and less about raw material availability and supply chain issues and more and more about volume growth, sequential gross margin improvement, and sequential margin improvement in each of our operating segments. Our outlook also assumes that, the market rate of inflation for our raw material basket will be up by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage in 2022 compared to 2021. We expect to see year-over-year inflation in all four quarters, with the largest impact likely occurring in the first quarter, and gradual reductions each quarter as the year progresses. We expect all commodity categories to be meaningfully elevated. We expect other costs, including wages and transportation to be up in the mid-to-high single-digit range. We are currently implementing additional price increases in all businesses, and will continue to do so as necessary. For the first quarter of 2022, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2021, inclusive of a low double-digit price increase, partially offset by ongoing raw material availability issues. We expect the Americas Group to be up low to mid-single digits with North America paint stores at or above the high end of that range. We expect Consumer Brands to be down by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage and we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a mid- to high-teens percentage. Our full year guidance is heavily second half-weighted due to a stronger volume, the impact of pricing action and weaker second half 2021 comparison. As you'll recall, we began 2021 with great momentum, including first half sales growth of 14.7% and adjusted EPS growth of 26.4%, before the natural disasters supply chain and COVID issues derailed the second half of the year. For the full year 2022, we expect net sales to increase by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect the Americas Group to be up a mid-to high single-digit percentage, again, with North American paint stores at or above the high end of the range. We expect Consumer Brands to be up a low to mid-single-digit percentage, and Performance Coatings Group to be up a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2022 to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.80 per share compared to $6.98 per share earned in 2021. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance, includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share of $9.25 to $9.65, an increase of 16% at the midpoint over the $8.15 we delivered in 2021. Let me close with some additional data points and an update on our capital allocation priorities. Given volume growth, pricing actions and our ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, we would expect full year gross margin expansion. We expect to see SG&A leverage in 2022 by controlling costs tightly in noncustomer-facing functions. We will continue to make investments across the enterprise. It will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to open between 80 and 100 new stores in the US and in Canada in 2022. We'll be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems as well as product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel. These investments are embedded in our full year guidance. We expect currency exchange will be a headwind of about 1.5% on consolidated sales. We expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. Our core CapEx guidance for the year is approximately $415 million. In addition to this core CapEx, we expect to make investments of approximately $450 million in '22 related to our new headquarters and our R&D facility project. Both depreciation and amortization should be about $300 million each. Interest expense should be about $330 million. We have $260 million of long-term debt due in 2022. Historically, we've targeted dividends at about 30% of prior year GAAP earnings. Next month at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 9.1% to $2.40 per share, up from $2.20 last year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. As we begin 2022, we remain confident in our strategy, our capabilities and the differentiated product and service solutions we bring to customers. Above all, my confidence in our people has never been higher. Our business remains extremely well positioned and we're emerging as an even stronger Sherwin-Williams following the challenges that we have faced in the last two years. We remain steadfast in our focus on creating shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Parkinson perhaps your line is mute. You are live for question.\nChris Parkinson: Sorry about that. So it seems there can be multiple steps to rebuild your margin structure and strive towards -- back towards your long-term goals, especially in consumer performance. Just given near-term raw material shortages, hopefully getting better on a sequential basis, raw material inflation, logistics costs etcetera, et cetera all hopefully to be offset by pricing. How should we think about what's actually embedded in your '22 guidance on margins based on those factors? And then perhaps more importantly, how should investors recalibrate expectations for the cadence of improvement in '23 and back towards your long-term goals? Any color would be appreciated. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Sure Chris. This is Al Mistysyn. And as the 2021 unfolded with a strong -- very strong first half and a softer second half, I would say, our 2022 budget is exactly the opposite. We expect continued headwinds as John mentioned in raw materials heavily weighted to the first half. But incremental pricing. We talked about TAG going out with a February 1 12% increase. And we're going out across all divisions and groups with pricing. So when you look -- let me start with when you look at our gross margin, our first half you'd expect to see a slight contraction with sequential improvement as the quarter goes on. And then you start seeing gross margin recovery in our second half and that expectation is across each of the segments. And it's really volume-driven on the architectural side continued pricing catch-up on the Performance Coatings side along with the continued strong demand in volume. And what I would expect to see is some contraction in the first half on operating margins among the segments. But I would expect to see recovery starting in our second half on the operating margins and all segments growing operating margins year-over-year in our second half. And even including -- if our -- even including TAG even has the potential to get on top of previous years. And as you know in an inflationary environment that is our -- and you look back at our history, as we see raw material increases, we implement price to offset those raw material increases. And as the price effectiveness continues to improve, we start to see recovery. And then as raw materials moderate and roll over, we see gross margin expansion and I can point back as I have in the past 2010 2011 2012, we saw that big run-up in titanium dioxide. We saw our margins get -- contract. And then we saw growth from 2013 to 2016 of almost 600 basis points. We expect to see a similar environment today.\nChris Parkinson: That's very helpful. And just as a quick follow-up just in terms of 2022 demand there's -- let's say more recently there's been a little bit of skepticism just given rates, housing affordability just essentially the broader inflationary environment. Just from the Sherwin-specific angle and what you're hearing specifically from your stores, what really truly underscores your volume confidence on the macro for TAG and as well as your ability to further win share on both Pro and big boxes, just any additional insights will be very helpful? Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Chris, I think you hit on two very important points there. One is the market and our position in that market, it would be the second point. So we believe and the first indicator would be the close relationship that we have with our customers. I'll ask Jim to talk to the macro indicators that give us confidence in a moment. But I'd say what gives me the most confidence is the nearly 3500 sales reps and over 4000 store managers that we have out there every day feeding our CRM system with data that plays back to incredible confidence that our customers have in this market. We've had we believe a pretty strong run here in a challenging market. But our customers are telling us that as they look forward, demand continues to grow. And if you look across the segments in every one of those architectural segments, the feedback that we're getting is exactly that. This is going to be a terrific year. Many of our customers would say their pipeline is pretty much full right now and they're looking out into the second, third quarter taking bids right now. So it's very solid. But let me ask Jim to give you a little bit on the macro numbers that reinforce what we're hearing from our customers.\nJim Jaye: Yeah. Thank you, John. And good morning, Chris. As you look across the various indicators that we've always talked about for years now, they're all pointing in a very positive direction Chris. And I won't go through all of them, but on the residential repaint side, we look at LIRA the leading indicator of remodeling activity that was up high single-digits in the fourth quarter and they see strong double-digit growth throughout 2022. The remodeling market index also is at near record levels going forward. Think on the new rev side when you look there in addition to John's comments about what our customers are saying permits and trends -- or permits and starts have been trending very well, since the summer. There's still a big backlog of homes that need to be built, both at the entry level and at the luxury level as well. Mortgage rates while maybe ticking up a little bit still are largely supportive, I think. On the commercial construction side, you've got other indicators the Dodge Momentum Index, the Architectural Billing Index, all of those pointing in really strong directions. In property maintenance we're seeing good activity there. So no matter where you look on our TAG business it feels very strong.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah, our TAG and we believe also our Consumer Brands business as well there's lot of opportunity there for pricing in the market as well. But one point that I'd make in addition to the pricing availability on the Consumer Brands is what we're seeing from our contractors. We talk about gross margins and our ability to push that pricing through. This is a market where our customers have confidence in their ability to put pricing in because of the supply/demand dynamics. So we're up putting price in to customers who have confidence in their ability to put price into the market. I've often said we typically don't receive thank you notes for putting price increases through. And I don't expect to receive any on this round. But I will tell you our teams are very confident that our customers are almost in the mindset of okay I need to know what the price increase is going to be so I could push it through. And at the same time they're deciding, which projects they're going to take, and which ones they're not. So the dynamics are very powerful.\nChris Parkinson: It\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Chris.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning everybody. I guess somewhat of a follow-up. I know it's very early in the year and there's a lot going on seemingly every week. But can you break out for us what you're assuming in terms of raw material availability for 2022 as it relates to your specific earnings guidance? And I guess I'm referring to volume catch-up and then your own inventory levels as the year unfolds?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. So Ghansham, the availability expectation is that -- we may see some in our first quarter. We talked about our first quarter being a little bit of choppiness -- seeing a little bit of choppiness in our availability, it could be low single to mid-single digits. But the commitment that we've gotten across our existing supplier base and our new supplier base really gives us great confidence that we'll have the raw material available to us to meet the stronger demand we expect in our first quarter and I should say stronger production in our first quarter. So with the prioritized product line that John mentioned, we are going to build in a significantly more inventory to the end of our first quarter compared to year-end 2021 and versus last year but not to what I would say more historic levels. So the additional inventory for TAG that we put in at the end of the year because of the sales shortfall will help us early on but you're talking 10 to 15 days of inventory. The real growth is because of the excess capacity that we have put in and that being filled up with raw material supply and really getting ourselves in a better inventory position.\nJohn Morikis: Ghansham, if I could add I think that's a terrific response by Al. I think looking long-term there's some choppiness here short-term. We understand that. But when we look long-term and why we feel our company is going to really outperform and we often talk about this coiled spring. I look at the points that Al just mentioned and I'd like to just add a couple if I could. There certainly are opportunities to his point about the additional capacity that we've just brought on. We've got more that's coming on that is important. The other thing that I think is important to understand that we're not complacent. You look at how we get more efficiency and more productivity out of our plants. There's work to be done here, but we're well underway in a simplification process of our products to ensure that our responsiveness and I think this would be a question some shareholders might have. As we've come through this, how do we ensure that if anything like this were to happen again that we're the horse to bet on? And we're not sitting here waiting just trying to get out of the current situation. And we are looking at how do we build in the response as a result of this experience to ensure that we avoid these types of issues going forward. So it does include the resin company that we bought. It does include the capacity that we just bought. But an equally important one is the simplification of many of our product lines to allow us to be more responsive, more adaptive to the situation if it be from raw material suppliers or raw material products or to be able to move different resins around to be able to supply our customers. So, there's a lot of really good work heavy lifting that's taking place that we're not going to see today, but it's going to help us. It's going to help us not only in situations like this in the future, but to be more responsive to our customers' needs and more reactive to opportunities going forward.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. That's very helpful. And then realizing this is a difficult question to answer, but all the various nodes in the supply chain, there's so many different issues that your customers cite in their earnings calls and so on and so forth. I'm just trying to gauge, if you were able to produce more paint, and you just wave your magic wand, and you're able to get what you need from a raw material standpoint, is there still going to be a fair amount of choppiness you think in terms of volumes on a quarterly basis, because of the other constraints that customers are citing, including appliances, labor, et cetera?\nJohn Morikis: Well, I think, we're going to have raw material -- our raw material position is going to improve. It's improving now. And as Al mentioned, between our current and new suppliers, we've got confidence that this is going to improve. That's why I made the comments earlier. I'd say it this way. We've always hated talking about weather. I would associate our feelings with what we're talking about regarding raw materials to feel like weather. We want to get this behind us, and start talking about growing our business and talking about the incredible results we're going to post, and we're going to have the raws to be able to do that. Now are there other issues that we're going to face like transportation and the fact that we're going to be in a race to build product through the first quarter, but we're not going to be able to build the inventory that we typically build in the first quarter to be as responsive as we like. So there is going to be some hand-to-hand combat if you will, as we get through the year. It's going to get better, but we're going to be racing to fill the pipeline here. And we would have liked if possible to have built more inventory in the fourth and first quarter, but we're going to be in a position to have more raw materials and more capacity to be able to respond. We'll build some inventory coming out of the first quarter, but it won't be to the traditional level that we would like going into a paint season.\nAl Mistysyn : Yes. Ghansham, the other thing I'd add there. I think when you look at the past two years have been really challenging, and because we've got a long tenured and experienced management team, we've been able to meet those challenges and produced solid results. We believe we are paid to influence results and not simply report them. And I believe our management team is doing that. If you look at the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS that yields a 10% three-year compounded average growth rate. And while doing that we continue to invest in the future growth of the company, and returning a significant portion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. So I think what you're going to see is our volume. And I'll look at it maybe architectural volume in our first half, my expectation is because we had such a strong first half of 2021 that our architectural volume will be flat to down low single-digits. It's really our second half. And the expectation is all the things that our global supply chain team is doing to get past -- and procurement teams get past raw material supply, get more consistent transportation and logistics set up. Our second half we're expecting to be up mid-to-high single digits in volume. And that's really what's going to drive the operating margin improvement across our architectural businesses TAG and consumer.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. Thanks so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Ghansham.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nBob Koort: Thank you very much. Maybe following on that last response, I just want to make sure I understood it properly. I think you said maybe your architectural business will be down in the first half, I think, you're implying revenues. And I'm wondering given the pricing cadence through 2021 and then again the February price hike coming, why it would be so weak? And then even more broadly for all of 2022, I think the guidance you gave on TAG revenues seems to match almost what you would expect in pricing. So it seems like there's maybe not a whole lot of net volume. Maybe you can give us a little more color on why that would be. Thinking of giving few range for production this year.\nAl Mistysyn : Yes, Bob to clarify, I was highlighting architectural volume in our first half to be flat to down. And it's because we had such a strong start to our first half last year. If you look at our first quarter, Consumer was up 25, the North America paint stores were up high single-digits and TAG was up high single-digits in our first quarter. So I was referring to volume. And our full year TAG being up mid- to high single-digits, with the comment being that, our North America paint stores would be at or above the high end of that range. If you annualize the price increases, you're going to get to a mid-to-high single-digits. So volume I would expect to be up and our North America paint stores to be low to mid. Does that make sense?\nBob Koort: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then I'm just curious, if you guys have any insight on, trying to figure out, if there was double ordering, if there were maybe some false bookings throughout 2021 as your customers were scrambling in a scarcity mode is there any risk, or how do you \u2013 do you have confidence that there wasn't some of that and maybe the underlying demand is slightly weaker than you'd expect? And how do you get that comfort?\nJohn Morikis: Bob, that's not a concern for me at all. And we've got tremendous comfort and confidence that the demand is real. And as we look at the bidding activity that's taking place, the job requests that are taking place, we can verify that. So the demand is real. We've got great confidence in that.\nBob Koort: That\u2019s clear. Thank you, John.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First, look I understand raw material inflation is kind of a moving target. But if we took a snapshot as we sit today in January, I'm hoping you can discuss by fourth quarter 2022, whether raw material inflation embedded in guidance is still up year-over-year or down? And then for your full year 2022, low double-digit to mid-teens inflation could you just break out expectations by your segments?\nJim Jaye: Yes, Truman. What I would say is for the full year, we're expecting as we said that low double-digit to mid-teens inflation. It should be the highest in the first quarter and I would expect it to sequentially improve as the year goes on and the comparisons get a little bit easier. But I think even in our fourth quarter, you're likely to see us up low and mid-singles in the fourth quarter. I think the strong demand that's out there is helping to support the inflation that's out there. I would again expect by segment probably to still see pretty highest inflation in our Performance Coatings Group.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Truman. The only other comment I would make on that just to reiterate, still we talked about last year the increase in raw materials was heavily weighted to our Performance Coatings. When I say that about 60%. We expect to see a little bit less than that this year. But also just you said, it our line of sight on raw material inflation is probably at best two quarters out. So looking at third or second half of this year, we'll continue to monitor the basket as we have throughout 2021. And if we see any change or increase in inflation will react with pricing quickly like we did last year.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And then in the fourth quarter TAG, margins fell 660 bps year-over-year. And I know that leverage is a \u2013 volume leverage is a key component to your operating model. I'm hoping you can help us parse out how much of this was due to volumes declining, we'll call it high single digits versus this price/cost dynamic that's going on?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Truman, as I've said in the past, volume is the single biggest driver of operating margin improvement and that is especially the case in our TAG organization. And I would say that is almost 100% driven by the volume decline. And if I may, I'd just like to recap the fourth quarter across each of the segments just to kind of talk about this year level set and move on to 2022. But if you look at TAG, as I mentioned, it's all volume-driven that margin. If we look at consumer, it was better than our sales guidance but primarily due to non-paint sales increasing. And if you look at the paint gallons being less than what we expected, that again, that volume really impacts our operating margin. But we also had because global supply chain is embedded in our Consumer Brands Group because of availability we didn't meet the production plans that we had planned. So, the supply chain inefficiency and higher raw material costs probably equally impacted the Consumer segment. So, volume is the number one driver of that impact but then the other two are probably equally weighted. And then you get into our Performance Coatings Group, nice sales gain. But again the raw material increase quarter-to-quarter that we saw and for the full year was really about 60%-plus of the sequential increase. So, we took the front of the incremental increase in raw materials and that really drove what the impact on margins. And as we've said this is the one segment that has more work to do on pricing to chase the increase in raw materials. They're out as I mentioned earlier with additional pricing in our first quarter and our expectation is that we will get on top of raw materials this year and see segment -- operating segment margin improvement in our second half.\nTruman Patterson: Hey Al for clarity. I lost you a little bit on the TAG segment commentary for clarity. The overwhelming majority almost all of it was entirely due to the margin decline not dollar decline was due to that lost volume leverage?\nAl Mistysyn: That's right. That's right Truman.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Truman.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Still want to pursue the TAG guidance for 2022 of up mid to high single-digit percentage. I think you said earlier that your volume might be up low to mid-single-digits. I mean if your prices are going to be up some high single-digit number, I realize there's a slight bit of negative currency. I don't see how your TAG range should be mid to high single-digits unless you expect flat or negative volume growth?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. What we talked about is our North America stores being up at the high end or above the high end of that range. And if you look at so you're thinking 8% to 13% -- 12% -- or 8% to 12%. If you look at the paint stores price increase the cadence of the increases if you think about how we annualize the price increases in paint stores we're going to be up low double-digit in our first quarter high single-digit in our first half. And that will moderate as we go through the second half to get to a mid to high single-digits. So, that's how I get to kind of the low to mid volume.\nJeff Zekauskas: Yes, I don't see why it would moderate really in the third quarter maybe -- I mean to that level. But to put that aside your SG&A costs I think were up 2% for the year. So, was it that there was a lagging effect to whatever inflation you're experiencing in SG&A and you expect it to be up much more, or can you talk about your SG&A inflationary expectations in a little bit more detail?\nAl Mistysyn: Sure. We look at -- although we don't really provide the full guidance by line, but to give you some direction we do expect to get leverage on our SG&A as the year progresses. We'll continue to invest as John mentioned in 80 to 100 new stores in TAG plus in our digital platform. We'll continue to look for opportunities to invest in the Pro paints within our consumer segment and other key initiatives there. And then servicing programs through our Performance Coatings Group, but we're still going to be very focused on controlling our non-customer-facing SG&A. And I would say if you look at how our volume unfolds throughout the year, the first half will be slower than our second half like I mentioned. So we expect to see more leverage in our second half on SG&A than we see in our first half. \nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you so much.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Sison: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just curious in TAG, given you don't have as much volume or gallons as you want. How are you sort of allocating those amongst customers? And are there particularly areas in the country are more profitable? Can you maximize mix and profitability as you think about where to put your limited volume at this point?\nJohn Morikis: I think there's a lot of really good work that's taking place, Mike, and it's a pretty good observation of you -- on your part, because we've had to make some decisions. And some of those decisions include paring down the product line to ensure that we have the products that were needed. We've really, I think, done a terrific job in utilizing the resources or the raw materials that have become available and we treat those precious raw materials just as that. So we're manufacturing products that could best fit the needs of our customers. And there are times when we're giving customers a product that will fit their needs, but it may not have been the product that they came in to get. And so we're working with them. And I would say this, that as we exit this, the line of sight that we've established and the relationships that we've built with our customers is one of the reasons that we're so excited about how do you turn something bad into something good. The relationships are stronger, because our teams are working with our customers in a very unique way. They may come in talking about wanting a product and our teams work with them to understand what is the project? What are you doing? Let me get this product for you and we're keeping our customers in paint. And that's been a big mantra within the TAG organization, is keeping our customers. And that responsiveness, particularly at the store and rep level is a point of differentiation. We've got a number of stores out there and we're leveraging the inventory and availability in those stores in a way that, quite frankly, most companies couldn't do. And I'm really proud. We talk a lot about One Sherwin, a mentality of doing what's best for the company. And so, there's a sharing of inventory as close to the customer as possible to be as responsive as possible. So we're not -- we're trying not to get to the decision point that you make about which customer to serve. What we're trying to do is, get to the point where we're answering the question of what product can we get this customer to keep them moving, keep them making paint and keep them providing for their families. And as a result of that, our view of their projects has improved. They are sharing more information with us. And that's why when we asked -- we were asked earlier about the confidence that we have in the demand, why we think it's as solid as we believe is our customers, as we've worked through this are sharing more with us than they ever have before. They trust us. We're working with them and we're partners. And so, we're giving them products to get them off their projects on to the next ones, the next project and they're making money doing it.\nMike Sison: Got it. And as a quick follow-up, given that our cash have surprised to the upside, one game out of first place, but if you were to see upside or where you think you guys could surprise to the upside in 2022, where do you think you can do that? And particularly what's in your control to do that? \nJohn Morikis: Well, we're going to surprise. I would tell you this. If you look back over the last two years, while we've generated over $5.6 billion in net operating cash and we've returned $6.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, we've also been investing in this business, Mike. So in our North America paint stores we've opened 133 new stores, net new stores, 180 new reps. We've added probably over 2,800 management trainees to make sure that we have a really strong future pipeline. We've invested in our pros who paints with our Consumer Brands partners on the Performance Coating side, we're adding services and solutions that we really believe our customers are willing to pay for, because it's helping them make more money and that's what we're focused on. We've not talked about this yet, but we've been investing in innovation. And some might say, well, how can you invest in innovation. To your first question, when we're sitting here with raw materials, having to make tough decisions about which products we're going to make, would you be investing in innovation? And the answer is yes. We are investing in innovation. In fact, if you look over the last 10 years, we've averaged probably over 20 new products per year and that's really important. It's an important part of our strategy. And I know that firsthand, because I can remember when I was a store manager, and just learning to sell a product. And those new products made a pretty average salesperson a much better salesperson. I would tell you, it helped me a lot. And I think it gave me confidence, and it gives our people confidence. And most importantly, I think it gives our customers confidence. And so we're investing in these products. And these products are solutions that our customers use to help their business. And we think we're uniquely positioned to be responsive to those customers' needs in both \u2013 the needs they have that they can articulate and sometimes the unarticulated the things that they may not know. And so it should be no surprise that, one of the surprises that we have coming down the pipe, include breakthrough technologies in areas of durability, scuff resistance, mar resistance. And it's clear with the surge in COVID variants, a key emphasis in the market right now is keeping surfaces clean. And so you'll be hearing about some of these surprises as you say of our self-cleaning technology platforms as we move forward. But right now, naturally we're focused on the precious raw material allocation and servicing our customers. But rest assured that that's an important part of what we're doing. I think the other areas that you should expect that might surprise is the output of the capital expenditures that we're making. We talked about capacity utilization and the incremental capacity that we've added. We've added $670 million over the last two years. We're going to get every ounce of money out of those. We're going to put those assets to work and we're going to use them hard. I also think the \u2013 and this is a bit longer term, but as you're asking about surprises I think people will be surprised as we've invested in our new R&D facility and I just mentioned innovation. While that's not going to be in the short term, it's going to be an important part of what helps drive our company forward, because I think the collaboration that we're going to get from our wonderful technology people that's really going to be exciting. And then I guess just thinking off the top of my head, the last thing that I would add would be the utilization of this Specialty Polymers asset that we acquired. I think our ability to respond and our ability to really outperform the market and really de-risk some of what comes inherent from the Gulf Coast is we believe going to be a differentiator as well. So those are things Mike I want to talk about. There's a lot more that we have up our sleeves. We're pretty excited over here about what we're working on. We could talk about themes like what's coming down the pipe and digital and some of the other areas. But I've got a lot of confidence that, while we're excited about what we've accomplished and this quarter we would like to have a better fourth quarter but I'm really excited about where we're headed. And I really do believe that, the best is ahead. We're just getting started.\nMike Sison: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: John, you just mentioned this Pros Who Paint. What exactly is that initiative? How can you help Lowe's capture more paint contractor business? And do you see any risk from a recent initiative at Home Depot to do something similar?\nJohn Morikis: Well, we respect all our competitors Steve. So we don't just stick our head in the sand and say nothing is a risk. In fact, we often talk about a healthy paranoid life, which means we take everything as serious and nothing for granted. But what the Pros Who Paint is an initiative that really drives effort towards these contractors, who paint as a part of a project. So our stores are focused on the painting contractor those that wake up every day with a goal of applying paint. There's a whole host of contractors out there that could be remodelers or could \u2013 in fact, I would say, nearly every project out there, nearly every project, ends with paint on the project. And so there are customers that prefer a different shopping environment than a paint store. And the reason is they might want to pick up drywall, they might want to pick up cabinets. They might want to pick up plumbing, whatever it might be. And so they choose their preference to be a home center platform. We've got a terrific relationship with a number of our Consumer Brands customers to focus in on this Pros Who Paints. And we believe that there's a terrific opportunity in many cases to apply what we've learned through our TAG business both in services and actions as well as product technology to bring and to help our customers better penetrate those customers that prefer that format. And while we have had some very limited success in that through our stores, I'd say that the terrific opportunity for us is to have much greater penetration through our home center partners just as they may have had some success with painters. We think by looking at the market and finding these opportunities and really putting the effort in product services, all the different unique nuances on helping those customers make more money will ultimately benefit everyone.\nSteve Byrne: And then just one more on this year-over-year issue with respect to TAG. You noted the year-ago volumes were very strong and you have that year-over-year headwind. Is there a component of that year-over-year volume drag that is also has a mix shift impact on price? If the year-ago volumes were more DIY than TAG, did that result in a price benefit that is a year-over-year drag that is also something that's being reflected in the guide?\nJohn Morikis: No, I wouldn't say that's the case Steve. But when you bring up mix shift where I jump to is wanting to clarify that what we are experiencing is a very positive mix shift. Our highest quality products are the ones in greatest demand. And you could talk about a lot of issues. One we've not talked about yet is labor, and when you talk about painting contractors trying to get as much done as possible. They are all very well aware that getting the most out of a project, getting in and out with less callbacks being able to go back and touch up if you will, getting the lowest price gallon of paint is not the answer, in fact just the opposite. And we do believe that part of this specialty store experience and quite frankly in many cases what we are either now or will be bringing to our home center partners allows our contractors to be more productive. So again we're looking at helping our contractors make their labor some of whom may not be as experienced as they would like we're helping to make those laborers much more productive and more professional in their output or their finished products than they would in a lower quality you want to pay.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. See the only thing I would add is just as a reminder DIY related to -- relative to paint stores is probably about 10%. When I was talking about architectural volume in our first half versus a difficult comp that included both TAG and Consumer and Consumer had a\u2026\nJim Jaye: 25%.\nAl Mistysyn: 25% growth in their first quarter last year.\nSteve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Thank you Steve.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. A lot of the questions I guess have been asked. So maybe I'll just ask a couple of questions on a particular couple of verticals. So could you update us on what you're seeing in commercial construction and MRO? I know those are markets that had, kind of, lagged during the pandemic. Has there been any improvement there? I imagine not just given the lingering effects but maybe you can just address that first?\nJohn Morikis: Underlying demand I'd say in commercial is solid. Sales we've been challenged in some of these areas as we've been pumping through availability, but of product but I'd say it feels pretty good. And the reason I say that Arun is that these projects are beginning to come back online and reaching the paint stage in many cases. Our customers in this space have reported some of the labor constraints that we've talked about they're not only impacting the paint business. So these guys are waiting for drywallers who may be fighting for more labor to get the drywall done sooner and you keep moving up the food chain. So it's having an impact on the entire flow of the project. But as Jim mentioned, if you look at the Dodge Momentum Index it's strong. And we have a lot of confidence that it will continue. I'm sorry the other segment you asked about was -- MRO from a -- well, I'd say maybe on a broader sense, we could answer MRO because I think it also fits this, but maybe I could help you with Protective & Marine because it fits underneath that very well. Our business here was up and very strong. We're up double-digits. And there's a lot of really good work here. We have spoken about our strength in petrochem and the opportunities there. The work that we've been doing in the adjacent markets is beginning to pay off. We're excited about that. And as government spending on infrastructure continues to work its way through. While it may not be immediate, if you look longer term, we're really well positioned for that and working hard to capture that as well. So really, really, good. If you look at the professional side of every TAG segment that we have, we've got tremendous confidence. It's a very strong market from a demand standpoint and as I mentioned, I know that from my years of experience, you know that when pricing is flowing through from our customer -- from us to our customers as well as it is. And from them to their customers, because their customers simply want the projects done and they're willing to pay to get it. It's an indicator for us of the strength of the market.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks. And just as a follow-up, maybe I can just ask about free cash flow and uses there. So it appears that maybe working capital could be a drag as you kind of sell higher-priced inventory and raws, is that right, or is it building inventory that would actually maybe benefit working capital as you move through 2022. And so, could you just help us understand free cash flow growth in 2022 expectations, and then uses thereof, I mean have you seen valuation multiples remain elevated and thus most excess cash will be used for buybacks? Is that how we should think about free cash flow and its use here? Thanks.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah, Arun. I think what we're expecting that we'll generate a slightly higher net operating cash in 2022 with the improvement in net income to your point partially offset by the increase in working capital. We expect to end of the year with significantly more architectural inventory gallons than we ended in 2021. Plus, you're correct, there's some inflation there. As far as CapEx, as John talked about, we expect that to be about 1.9% or $415 million plus another $450 million for the Building Our Future projects. That does not include incentives. So we'll see some cash out less than that $450 million. Dividends we expect the net 9% increase to 240. That's about a $630 million number, up 8%. So your free cash flow is going to go backwards. But as far as M&A is concerned when you look at our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio it was up 2.9% at the end of this year, our forecast is really for the debt-to-EBITDA approach the high-end of our range. So at two to 2.5 times, we expect debt to be flat and really what's driving that leverage ratio down is the increase in EBITDA. So from a balance sheet standpoint, we're going to have capacity to acquire and we're going to continue to pursue acquisitions that fit our strategy and we do expect to close the previously announced Sica acquisition in our first quarter. But -- and then you're right, absent additional M&A, we're going to buy our stock back. We're going to be continue to be very consistent in our capital allocation philosophy and we're not going to hold cash.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Arun.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you can break down the raw material situation a little bit further for us. How do you see some of these specific raw material baskets behaving this year? As you look at resins, pigments solvents, additives and packaging, are you still seeing some of those go up significantly, while others are stable or maybe moderating? \nJim Jaye: Yes Mike, a couple of comments there. I would say in '22, I think the biggest increase is you'll -- we're still expecting will be monomers, resins, solvents and packaging. We look at propylene as we've often talked about, and that really is critical to about 60% or so of our raw material basket. Been a little bit of a disconnect here recently. We've seen propylene ticking down, but we haven't necessarily seen it in the things that we're buying that come from that feedstock. I think part of that is because of the strong demand environment that we're in. I think that also on the TiO2 side, we're seeing that tick up as well. Inventories remain tight, given the strong demand but we feel very good about our supply of TiO2, given the really strong relationships that we have with our suppliers. \nMike Harrison: All right. And then my other question is on the COVID situation. It seems like two weeks ago that was kind of dominating the conversation. Maybe just give us an update on, how you're seeing the Omicron impact playing out relative to where you were two weeks ago? \nJohn Morikis: Well, I'd say it's improving. We're no different than what you would see in the marketplace itself. So, we saw the same spike and kind of decline that the rest of the country saw. So we are excited to try to get this behind us. As we mentioned earlier Mike, we're tired of talking about this stuff. I don't want to talk about COVID. I don't want to talk about raw materials. I want to talk about growing sales and growing profits. So we can try to give you a forecast and what's happening, but we're just going to do what we do. We've got a lot of determination on this side and backed up with a lot of skill in scar tissue. And I'd rather really not even answer this and just tell you we're going to fight through this. That's what we do. \nMike Harrison: All right. Fair enough. Thanks very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good afternoon. John, Al just looking at Q1, how should we think about the improvement or the growth in TAG earnings versus Q4? \nAl Mistysyn: Yes. So David, if you look at our fourth quarter in TAG, I talked about the volumes and the impact there. When you look at it coming into our first quarter, we're still going to see elevated raw material costs really the highest in our -- highest cost quarter for the year is our expectation. We do expect our TAG sales to be up by a low-to-mid single digit which tells you with the higher price that our volumes are going to be backwards which again is going to put pressure on our margins. But when you look at it sequentially, we do expect to see improvement in our dollars and in our margin. It's a small quarter, so any driver of volume, specifically when we look -- talk about the first quarter and fourth quarter, we talked about exterior sales in the Southeast and Southwest, driving the performance and assuming those hit the forecast we need to hit and expect them to hit, we should be ahead of our fourth quarter TAG EBIT margin and profit dollars. \nDavid Begleiter: Great. And just briefly John, looking at price realization on announced price increases this cycle versus prior cycles seem to be doing a little bit better. Why is that? And is it sustainable going forward? \nJohn Morikis: Well, I think for all the reasons David that we just talked about. But actually, maybe a little more. I'd say, it's certainly a market where supply and demand is such that our customers have the confidence that speaks to the demand. But I would also say that, our teams, if it's in our consumer business with Todd Ray and his team working really hard to help our customers be more successful or in our TAG business with Heidi Petz and her team aligning to make sure that our customers, I talked earlier about keep our customers in paint, working hard to develop products and services that have them at the right place at the right time to be able to do that or Justin Binns on our Performance Coatings side. I mean, we're not just simply reporting. We're not just responding. Customer wants this, we don't have it. That's not who we are. What we're trying to do is influence as greatly as possible. So, we're aligning closely with our customers, where we often talk about running to the center of the fire. We're running to our customers. We're trying to understand what is it that they need, how do we respond the best as we can. Yes, there's challenges. What do we do to keep you in paint to keep you moving. And as a result of that, I think, while we're trying to help our customers to be successful and if it's a public company helping them to reach their goals, their numbers or a private company, who's just trying to feed their family, our goals are aligned with their goals. And when we do our jobs, we don't have to get fat and crazy with money. We ask for our fair share, for our shareholders, while we're helping them. And that's the focus that we have. And because I think we're working really hard to do that and focusing on their success, we're adding more success in executing the price increases.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nP.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. John last year many projects got delayed with rising lumber and steel prices. In lumber after declining in second half of last year, the prices are on the move again and have gone up this year. So do you think that's a concern for construction remodeling as project costs have gone up significantly?\nJohn Morikis: No, I don't. If you look at the LIRA as an example, and other indicators that we look at P.J., there's a very strong demand, it's a strong backlog. And I've actually heard people, including one of them on my staff named my CFO, who bought an item that was going to be a slight delay in getting it, and the price was variable. Now not everyone may have that patience or ability to just say, okay, I want it, I'll pay whatever the market is at that time. But there are a lot of people out there that have been pushing off the remodel of their home, or the addition that they need, or an area that requires remodeling, because it's either aging in place or the home itself needs to be fixed. And many of them quite frankly are looking at it with the idea that prices are going up, I want to get this done and get the best price as I can right now, because it looks like this may continue. But I would tell you that I think the question that you're asking once again going back to demand. Demand is very strong.\nP.J. Juvekar: Great. In light of time, I\u2019ll pass it along. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, P.J.\nAl Mistysyn: Thank you, P.J.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Al, I think you addressed sequential earnings in TAG already, but I'm tempted to ask about Performance Coatings in that regard, so 4Q into 1Q. If we look at history, I think, there are examples of that segment trending flat up and down in 1Q versus 4Q. Do you have a strong feeling of directional sequential trend in performance for 1Q 2022? \nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Kevin, I do believe we're going to see sequential improvement. I think that team -- for a couple of reasons. First, the team has done a terrific job of putting in price increases aggressively throughout 2021 and the need to go again in 2022. There's no backing off on that team, the discipline around knowing they need to get the price and getting it, they are. Along with the volumes that we're seeing, we talked about our first quarter being up mid to high teens, with a high or low double-digit increase in price in our first quarter that tells you volume should be low to mid. And I think that's going to help drive that improvement as well.\nKevin McCarthy: Excellent. And then I wanted to follow-up on the three acquisitions that you referenced. Can you talk through the financial impact of those deals recognizing that they're in various stages of closing? For example, what is the contribution to sales that you're thinking about that's embedded in your guidance for the first quarter?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. For the first quarter, you know what, I would look at it net. If you look at the ANZ divestiture net of acquisitions, it\u2019d be an immaterial headwind. Sika we don't have in our first quarter, we expect to have in our first quarter. So you're really talking about Tenant and SPI and net of ANZ, it's immaterial.\nJohn Morikis: Tenant was more of a technology buy. We're going to -- we acquired that to try to take that technology and grow it throughout the company. It's a pretty small acquisition, but it does give us an opportunity. And to Al's point, the Specialty Polymers is more internal manufacturing.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the impact of volume in raws on the gross margin. If we look at last year holistically, would you say that raws were half of the 450 bps pressure and volume was the other half?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. I think, it may be a little more viewed on the raw material side. And here's why I would say that, Greg, we saw raw materials really ramp up in the second half of the year and not having pricing really built in to cover that until we got into August 1. We got into a September 30 on TAG and then it was heavier on our petrochem basket and really impacted Performance Coatings. So I think raws really impacted a little bit more, because the dollar -- we couldn't offset dollar for dollar. We're close booked, couldn\u2019t offset it. And as that impacts us you really see a margin decline. In the specific though to like the fourth quarter, the TAG volume miss and TAG being down high single digits, really would have been the heavier driver in our fourth quarter.\nGreg Melich: Got it.\nAl Mistysyn: But I think if you look at it across the year it's a little heavier raws.\nGreg Melich: Raws would still be the driver. And I guess, the follow-up is sort of looking back at history and sort of how we get back to the margins we had in 2020. I think when you impact the last cycle in 2011 and 2012 it took two years to get back to where you were. Do you -- has the business or the company changed enough for the world that, you would expect that to happen faster or slower, the cadence of recovery? \nAl Mistysyn: I do think, we're different makeup of a company than we were back then, because of the Valspar acquisition. But I don't think the -- you look at the businesses within our Performance Coatings Group and the strategy around that and where we can differentiate and get paid for that. I still think that that two-year cadence is applicable. And the other thing I'd highlight is, TAG is still over 50% of our sales. And you look at the strong volume that we expect in our second half and with the pricing activities that have taken place and what we have going in, we have a real opportunity, not only to surpass. We certainly feel like the second half of this year will surpass 2020 or 2021, but really approach the 2020 operating margin. So I think at TAG, we could be there. I think the other two segments have more work to do.\nJohn Morikis: But, Greg, I would add this that we learned an awful lot. And I would say, with that learning came incredible conviction is, when there were some of those delays and it took a little bit longer, it becomes tougher to get it as time goes out. So I agree with Al and I think that's -- those are good guidelines. But I'd also say that, there's a lot of determination and conviction. We're going to push that as hard as we can.\nGreg Melich: That's great. Good luck guys.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: Just a quick one here guys. New commercial construction paint has been pretty far in advance of when the buildings are completed and painted. Have you been able to go back and re-price that, or does that just have to roll through over time?\nJohn Morikis: There's not a single answer for that, John. In some cases, there are opportunities to adjust in many of them. But in some cases there's not. And so it's a case-by-case basis.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, John.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Do you expect to bring back some of the SKUs you rationalized as the raw material supply improves in the back half? And if that's the case, do you expect that to have a negative impact on margins?\nJohn Morikis: Well, what I would say is that, it's not just going to be going back to business as usual. They'll go through a very disciplined approach. And the question is going to be, if we survive this long without it why do we need to bring it back? So we want to manage our inventory and our working capital very closely. So my answer would be that there's a disciplined approach. And if in fact you see a working capital investment it's because there's the proper return that comes along with that.\nAdam Baumgarten: Got it. And then just thinking about CapEx maybe beyond 2022, do you anticipate any additional headquarter-related CapEx in 2023?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. I think you look at what we're spending so far we are going to see another similar amount in 2023 and then have it drop off into 2024.\nAdam Baumgarten: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nGarik Shmois: Hi. Thanks. Just one question for me. Just to be clear on the full year guidance and pricing. Are you assuming any additional pricing is needed beyond what you've announced for the first quarter?\nAl Mistysyn: I'd say in TAG, the assumption is that, there's no additional, I think has been consumer that will roll in, but I don't expect there's not in our guidance additional. Performance Coatings is a little different just because of the way they rolled pricing in 2021. They may have some in the first quarter they may have some rolling into the second quarter. But we're not certainly planning today to have second half price increases go in.\nJohn Morikis: I think our approach is this that we try to keep the increase to a minimum. And when you approach it that way, there can be a little more volatility. We don't want to be out in front of our customers asking for more than what we really absolutely can see with the hopes of covering what might be a future price increase. And so that introduces a little more volatility, if in fact the numbers move or the prices move we've got to respond to that. But we think it's the best approach to our customers to try to keep the pricing to a minimum and have an open discussion with them about the volatile environment that we're in.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. Thanks so much.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Garik.\nOperator: Our final question is from the line of Jaideep Pandya with On Field Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJaideep Pandya: Thank you. It's really just around M&A actually. I mean, considering what has happened in the raw materials industry, and if you want to sort of look at it from a point of view of bulking up and increasing your size, do you think a large ticket consolidation on an interregional basis is an answer to this, or is this really how you're going about in-housing some of the resin capacity and verifying or rather putting more suppliers on your list is the way to go about sort of different way of asking but do you see large ticket consolidation in this industry? Because generally raw material crisis have brought coating consolidations. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Well, if I may just start with your first point about our desires to bulk up. I'd say that what is really the driver for our M&A strategy is our \u2013 is in fact our strategy. So it's not to be the biggest just not to do anything other than to put ourselves in a position to be able to best serve our customers. And we prefer to do that in a very unique and differentiated way, bringing them solutions that help them to be successful and profitable. And so the litmus test if you will is business by business, looking at what is it that we need to be in position to be able to serve our customers. We don't have a desire to be everything to everyone, everywhere. We're not chasing commodities. We're not it's not just about size. To us it's about driving value for our customers and shareholder value for our shareholders. And we do that by staying true to a very precise strategy. You're not going to see us jumping all over the world. Something is for sale so we're chasing it. It's \u2013 we've got a very defined strategy. And if it bounces up against our strategy and all handsets to do it we're interested. If not we're not.\nJaideep Pandya: All right. Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time I'll turn the call back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, Rob. I hope you heard today how excited we are as we enter fiscal 2022, a lot of opportunity ahead of us and we're after it. I tell you that demand is strong as you heard across all of our businesses and just a lot of confidence in our people and our capabilities. So thank you for joining us today. As always, we'll be available for your follow-up calls and follow-up e-mails. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Al Mistysyn",
            "content": "Yes. Sure Chris. This is Al Mistysyn. And as the 2021 unfolded with a strong -- very strong first half and a softer second half, I would say, our 2022 budget is exactly the opposite. We expect continued headwinds as John mentioned in raw materials heavily weighted to the first half. But incremental pricing. We talked about TAG going out with a February 1 12% increase. And we're going out across all divisions and groups with pricing. So when you look -- let me start with when you look at our gross margin, our first half you'd expect to see a slight contraction with sequential improvement as the quarter goes on. And then you start seeing gross margin recovery in our second half and that expectation is across each of the segments. And it's really volume-driven on the architectural side continued pricing catch-up on the Performance Coatings side along with the continued strong demand in volume. And what I would expect to see is some contraction in the first half on operating margins among the segments. But I would expect to see recovery starting in our second half on the operating margins and all segments growing operating margins year-over-year in our second half. And even including -- if our -- even including TAG even has the potential to get on top of previous years. And as you know in an inflationary environment that is our -- and you look back at our history, as we see raw material increases, we implement price to offset those raw material increases. And as the price effectiveness continues to improve, we start to see recovery. And then as raw materials moderate and roll over, we see gross margin expansion and I can point back as I have in the past 2010 2011 2012, we saw that big run-up in titanium dioxide. We saw our margins get -- contract. And then we saw growth from 2013 to 2016 of almost 600 basis points. We expect to see a similar environment today. Yeah. So Ghansham, the availability expectation is that -- we may see some in our first quarter. We talked about our first quarter being a little bit of choppiness -- seeing a little bit of choppiness in our availability, it could be low single to mid-single digits. But the commitment that we've gotten across our existing supplier base and our new supplier base really gives us great confidence that we'll have the raw material available to us to meet the stronger demand we expect in our first quarter and I should say stronger production in our first quarter. So with the prioritized product line that John mentioned, we are going to build in a significantly more inventory to the end of our first quarter compared to year-end 2021 and versus last year but not to what I would say more historic levels. So the additional inventory for TAG that we put in at the end of the year because of the sales shortfall will help us early on but you're talking 10 to 15 days of inventory. The real growth is because of the excess capacity that we have put in and that being filled up with raw material supply and really getting ourselves in a better inventory position. Yes. Ghansham, the other thing I'd add there. I think when you look at the past two years have been really challenging, and because we've got a long tenured and experienced management team, we've been able to meet those challenges and produced solid results. We believe we are paid to influence results and not simply report them. And I believe our management team is doing that. If you look at the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS that yields a 10% three-year compounded average growth rate. And while doing that we continue to invest in the future growth of the company, and returning a significant portion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. So I think what you're going to see is our volume. And I'll look at it maybe architectural volume in our first half, my expectation is because we had such a strong first half of 2021 that our architectural volume will be flat to down low single-digits. It's really our second half. And the expectation is all the things that our global supply chain team is doing to get past -- and procurement teams get past raw material supply, get more consistent transportation and logistics set up. Our second half we're expecting to be up mid-to-high single digits in volume. And that's really what's going to drive the operating margin improvement across our architectural businesses TAG and consumer. Yes, Bob to clarify, I was highlighting architectural volume in our first half to be flat to down. And it's because we had such a strong start to our first half last year. If you look at our first quarter, Consumer was up 25, the North America paint stores were up high single-digits and TAG was up high single-digits in our first quarter. So I was referring to volume. And our full year TAG being up mid- to high single-digits, with the comment being that, our North America paint stores would be at or above the high end of that range. If you annualize the price increases, you're going to get to a mid-to-high single-digits. So volume I would expect to be up and our North America paint stores to be low to mid. Does that make sense? Yes, Truman. The only other comment I would make on that just to reiterate, still we talked about last year the increase in raw materials was heavily weighted to our Performance Coatings. When I say that about 60%. We expect to see a little bit less than that this year. But also just you said, it our line of sight on raw material inflation is probably at best two quarters out. So looking at third or second half of this year, we'll continue to monitor the basket as we have throughout 2021. And if we see any change or increase in inflation will react with pricing quickly like we did last year. Yes. Truman, as I've said in the past, volume is the single biggest driver of operating margin improvement and that is especially the case in our TAG organization. And I would say that is almost 100% driven by the volume decline. And if I may, I'd just like to recap the fourth quarter across each of the segments just to kind of talk about this year level set and move on to 2022. But if you look at TAG, as I mentioned, it's all volume-driven that margin. If we look at consumer, it was better than our sales guidance but primarily due to non-paint sales increasing. And if you look at the paint gallons being less than what we expected, that again, that volume really impacts our operating margin. But we also had because global supply chain is embedded in our Consumer Brands Group because of availability we didn't meet the production plans that we had planned. So, the supply chain inefficiency and higher raw material costs probably equally impacted the Consumer segment. So, volume is the number one driver of that impact but then the other two are probably equally weighted. And then you get into our Performance Coatings Group, nice sales gain. But again the raw material increase quarter-to-quarter that we saw and for the full year was really about 60%-plus of the sequential increase. So, we took the front of the incremental increase in raw materials and that really drove what the impact on margins. And as we've said this is the one segment that has more work to do on pricing to chase the increase in raw materials. They're out as I mentioned earlier with additional pricing in our first quarter and our expectation is that we will get on top of raw materials this year and see segment -- operating segment margin improvement in our second half. That's right. That's right Truman. Yes. What we talked about is our North America stores being up at the high end or above the high end of that range. And if you look at so you're thinking 8% to 13% -- 12% -- or 8% to 12%. If you look at the paint stores price increase the cadence of the increases if you think about how we annualize the price increases in paint stores we're going to be up low double-digit in our first quarter high single-digit in our first half. And that will moderate as we go through the second half to get to a mid to high single-digits. So, that's how I get to kind of the low to mid volume. Sure. We look at -- although we don't really provide the full guidance by line, but to give you some direction we do expect to get leverage on our SG&A as the year progresses. We'll continue to invest as John mentioned in 80 to 100 new stores in TAG plus in our digital platform. We'll continue to look for opportunities to invest in the Pro paints within our consumer segment and other key initiatives there. And then servicing programs through our Performance Coatings Group, but we're still going to be very focused on controlling our non-customer-facing SG&A. And I would say if you look at how our volume unfolds throughout the year, the first half will be slower than our second half like I mentioned. So we expect to see more leverage in our second half on SG&A than we see in our first half. Thanks, Jeff. Yeah. See the only thing I would add is just as a reminder DIY related to -- relative to paint stores is probably about 10%. When I was talking about architectural volume in our first half versus a difficult comp that included both TAG and Consumer and Consumer had a... 25% growth in their first quarter last year. Thank you Steve. Yeah, Arun. I think what we're expecting that we'll generate a slightly higher net operating cash in 2022 with the improvement in net income to your point partially offset by the increase in working capital. We expect to end of the year with significantly more architectural inventory gallons than we ended in 2021. Plus, you're correct, there's some inflation there. As far as CapEx, as John talked about, we expect that to be about 1.9% or $415 million plus another $450 million for the Building Our Future projects. That does not include incentives. So we'll see some cash out less than that $450 million. Dividends we expect the net 9% increase to 240. That's about a $630 million number, up 8%. So your free cash flow is going to go backwards. But as far as M&A is concerned when you look at our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio it was up 2.9% at the end of this year, our forecast is really for the debt-to-EBITDA approach the high-end of our range. So at two to 2.5 times, we expect debt to be flat and really what's driving that leverage ratio down is the increase in EBITDA. So from a balance sheet standpoint, we're going to have capacity to acquire and we're going to continue to pursue acquisitions that fit our strategy and we do expect to close the previously announced Sica acquisition in our first quarter. But -- and then you're right, absent additional M&A, we're going to buy our stock back. We're going to be continue to be very consistent in our capital allocation philosophy and we're not going to hold cash. Thanks, Arun. Yes. So David, if you look at our fourth quarter in TAG, I talked about the volumes and the impact there. When you look at it coming into our first quarter, we're still going to see elevated raw material costs really the highest in our -- highest cost quarter for the year is our expectation. We do expect our TAG sales to be up by a low-to-mid single digit which tells you with the higher price that our volumes are going to be backwards which again is going to put pressure on our margins. But when you look at it sequentially, we do expect to see improvement in our dollars and in our margin. It's a small quarter, so any driver of volume, specifically when we look -- talk about the first quarter and fourth quarter, we talked about exterior sales in the Southeast and Southwest, driving the performance and assuming those hit the forecast we need to hit and expect them to hit, we should be ahead of our fourth quarter TAG EBIT margin and profit dollars. Thank you, P.J. Yes, Kevin, I do believe we're going to see sequential improvement. I think that team -- for a couple of reasons. First, the team has done a terrific job of putting in price increases aggressively throughout 2021 and the need to go again in 2022. There's no backing off on that team, the discipline around knowing they need to get the price and getting it, they are. Along with the volumes that we're seeing, we talked about our first quarter being up mid to high teens, with a high or low double-digit increase in price in our first quarter that tells you volume should be low to mid. And I think that's going to help drive that improvement as well. Yes. For the first quarter, you know what, I would look at it net. If you look at the ANZ divestiture net of acquisitions, it'd be an immaterial headwind. Sika we don't have in our first quarter, we expect to have in our first quarter. So you're really talking about Tenant and SPI and net of ANZ, it's immaterial. Yes. I think, it may be a little more viewed on the raw material side. And here's why I would say that, Greg, we saw raw materials really ramp up in the second half of the year and not having pricing really built in to cover that until we got into August 1. We got into a September 30 on TAG and then it was heavier on our petrochem basket and really impacted Performance Coatings. So I think raws really impacted a little bit more, because the dollar -- we couldn't offset dollar for dollar. We're close booked, couldn't offset it. And as that impacts us you really see a margin decline. In the specific though to like the fourth quarter, the TAG volume miss and TAG being down high single digits, really would have been the heavier driver in our fourth quarter. But I think if you look at it across the year it's a little heavier raws. I do think, we're different makeup of a company than we were back then, because of the Valspar acquisition. But I don't think the -- you look at the businesses within our Performance Coatings Group and the strategy around that and where we can differentiate and get paid for that. I still think that that two-year cadence is applicable. And the other thing I'd highlight is, TAG is still over 50% of our sales. And you look at the strong volume that we expect in our second half and with the pricing activities that have taken place and what we have going in, we have a real opportunity, not only to surpass. We certainly feel like the second half of this year will surpass 2020 or 2021, but really approach the 2020 operating margin. So I think at TAG, we could be there. I think the other two segments have more work to do. Thanks, John. Yeah. I think you look at what we're spending so far we are going to see another similar amount in 2023 and then have it drop off into 2024. I'd say in TAG, the assumption is that, there's no additional, I think has been consumer that will roll in, but I don't expect there's not in our guidance additional. Performance Coatings is a little different just because of the way they rolled pricing in 2021. They may have some in the first quarter they may have some rolling into the second quarter. But we're not certainly planning today to have second half price increases go in. Thanks, Garik."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you Jim, and good morning everyone. I'll provide some additional color on the fourth quarter in a moment, but first I'd like to summarize our full year. For the second year in a row, we faced a series of challenges that no one could have predicted. The natural disasters of winter storm Uri and hurricane Ida crippled the industry's raw material supply chain for most of the year. The lack of raw material availability coupled with strong demand led to a rapid and unprecedented raw material cost inflation. Labor and transportation costs also escalated throughout the year. And through it all, we continue to battle various complications brought on by the continuation of the pandemic, especially in the fourth quarter. The 610,00 dedicated employees of Sherwin-Williams our greatest asset responded with determination. We did not use any of these challenges as an excuse, but as an opportunity to get even closer to our customers. We focused on supporting our customers' businesses through innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution. This solutions-based approach resulted in our customer loyalty metrics and new account activity growing significantly during the year. These trends bode well for years to come. While we focused on meeting customers' needs, we also attacked rising costs with aggressive pricing actions in all businesses. Near-term pressure on our margins was significant, but we remain highly confident, they will recover just as they have in past cycles, as we grow the business and see commodity costs moderate over time. We also continue to invest in multiple long-term growth initiatives during the year. I'll mention just a few full year metrics. Consolidated sales increased 8.6%, including a mid single-digit headwind related to raw material availability to a record $19.9 billion. It was the 11th consecutive year we have grown the business. Pricing for the year was in the mid single-digit range. On a segment basis, the Americas Group delivered 8% sales growth and 20% PBT margin for the full year, solid performance given the challenging operating environment. Pricing was in the mid single-digit range. Our largest customer segment residential repaint grew by a double-digit percentage for the sixth year in a row. Sales in all other customer segments, with the exception of DIY grew mid-to-high single-digits in the year. We also opened 85 net new stores during the year. Consumer Brands sales were down 10.9% for the year, including a four percentage point impact from the divested Wattyl business. This was against a mid-teens comparison that was driven by DIY projects related to consumers nesting during the pandemic. Pricing was a little less than what we saw in TAG. Performance Coatings sales were up 22% for the year. Every region and every business unit increased by a double-digit percentage. Price realization was in the mid single-digit range. Amidst the highest cost inflation in the company, this segment preserved the vast majority of adjusted profit before tax dollars, which decreased $18.1 million, or 2.5% from the prior year. Even with the increase in consolidated sales, we were not able to fully overcome the impacts of raw material and other cost inflation, raw material availability and the Omicron variant in the year. As a result, net income and diluted net income per share were below last year's levels. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $3.27 billion, or 16.4% of sales. Net operating cash for the year was $2.2 billion, or 11.3% of sales. We put our cash to work, returning a little over $3.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $2.8 billion to purchase 10.1 million shares at an average price of $273.18. We distributed $587 million in dividends, an increase of 20.3%. We also invested $372 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $56 million for our Building our Future project. We ended the year with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times. Additionally, we announced three acquisitions that will add to our capabilities: the coatings business of the Tennant Company, the European industrial coatings business of Sika AG and Specialty Polymers Inc. Total return to shareholders in 2021 was 44.9%, which outpaced the S&P 500 and our peer group. Finally, I'd also like to mention our ESG efforts. We announced and made good progress on our next-generation targets this year. We were recognized for various aspects of our program this year by Newsweek, Forbes and Investor's Business Daily. Given the volatility of the macroeconomic environment over the past two years, our combined results over the period are perhaps a better illustration of the underlying strength of our business. Since the end of 2019, consolidated net sales grew $2 billion, or 11.4%. Gross profit increased $507 million, or 6.3%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $211 million, or 6.9%. GAAP diluted net income per share increased 26.9% to $6.98 per share. And adjusted diluted net income per share increased 15.8% to $8.15 per share. Over the two-year period we've returned approximately $6.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. As far as our fourth quarter, I'll keep my comments brief in order to get to our 2022 outlook. The key themes remain the same as in our third quarter. Demand was strong in nearly all of our end markets. Raw material availability remained a challenge. There was some improvement, but recovery was not as quick as we would have liked. Commodity and other costs remained elevated and we continue to implement price increases. The new wrinkle was the impact of the Omicron variant, which was meaningful as we discussed on our call earlier this month. In the Americas Group sales growth in the fourth quarter was led by Protective and Marine which was up by a double-digit percentage. New residential and property management were up in the mid-single-digit range. Res repaint and commercial were up in the low single-digit range. DIY was down double digits against an extremely strong double-digit comparison. From a product perspective, exterior paint sales performed better than interior sales, with interior being the larger part of the mix. We realized a high single-digit increase in price in the fourth quarter resulting from our February 1 and August 1, 2021 price increases in our mid-September 2021 surcharge. As we mentioned a new 12% price increase is effective February 1 of this year. We opened 35 net new stores in the fourth quarter. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Fourth quarter sales were basically flat to last year, excluding the impact of the Wattyl divestiture. Sales were up low single digits in North America. That was offset by a softer sales in Europe and Asia, where COVID restrictions were more pronounced. Pricing was positive in the quarter and in the high single-digit range. Last, let me comment on the fourth quarter trends in our Performance Coatings Group. We continue to see momentum, as this is the sixth straight quarter of growth for this business. Group sales increased by a high-teens percentage in the quarter. Price realization was in the low double-digit range and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in North America, followed by Europe, Latin America and Asia. Every division in the group grew with nearly all by double digits driven by robust underlying demand, new customer wins, share of wallet gains, and pricing. Packaging was strongest followed by Coil, General Industrial, Industrial Wood and Auto Refinish respectively. Turning to our 2022 outlook. We see an operating environment with strong demand across architectural and industrial end markets. Customer labor will likely continue to be a governor on growth in some areas. We expect raw material availability to continue improving sequentially so the trajectory remains uneven. As supply improves, we stand ready with ample capacity to quickly convert those raw materials to paint. We believe the impact of the Omicron variant on the supply chain should moderate through the first quarter. Any additional impacts from COVID over the remainder of 2022 are hard to predict. What's not hard to predict is our determination. Our role is to influence results not to simply report them. Looking ahead, we expect to bend the curve in our favor through the very deliberate steps we've been taking. These include arrangements and agreements with existing and new suppliers, prioritizing our product offering to our customer's, investments in additional capacity, the acquisition of a resin supplier, and actions to retain employees to produce and distribute products. As the year goes on, we expect to be talking less and less about raw material availability and supply chain issues and more and more about volume growth, sequential gross margin improvement, and sequential margin improvement in each of our operating segments. Our outlook also assumes that, the market rate of inflation for our raw material basket will be up by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage in 2022 compared to 2021. We expect to see year-over-year inflation in all four quarters, with the largest impact likely occurring in the first quarter, and gradual reductions each quarter as the year progresses. We expect all commodity categories to be meaningfully elevated. We expect other costs, including wages and transportation to be up in the mid-to-high single-digit range. We are currently implementing additional price increases in all businesses, and will continue to do so as necessary. For the first quarter of 2022, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2021, inclusive of a low double-digit price increase, partially offset by ongoing raw material availability issues. We expect the Americas Group to be up low to mid-single digits with North America paint stores at or above the high end of that range. We expect Consumer Brands to be down by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage and we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a mid- to high-teens percentage. Our full year guidance is heavily second half-weighted due to a stronger volume, the impact of pricing action and weaker second half 2021 comparison. As you'll recall, we began 2021 with great momentum, including first half sales growth of 14.7% and adjusted EPS growth of 26.4%, before the natural disasters supply chain and COVID issues derailed the second half of the year. For the full year 2022, we expect net sales to increase by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect the Americas Group to be up a mid-to high single-digit percentage, again, with North American paint stores at or above the high end of the range. We expect Consumer Brands to be up a low to mid-single-digit percentage, and Performance Coatings Group to be up a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2022 to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.80 per share compared to $6.98 per share earned in 2021. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance, includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share of $9.25 to $9.65, an increase of 16% at the midpoint over the $8.15 we delivered in 2021. Let me close with some additional data points and an update on our capital allocation priorities. Given volume growth, pricing actions and our ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, we would expect full year gross margin expansion. We expect to see SG&A leverage in 2022 by controlling costs tightly in noncustomer-facing functions. We will continue to make investments across the enterprise. It will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to open between 80 and 100 new stores in the US and in Canada in 2022. We'll be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems as well as product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel. These investments are embedded in our full year guidance. We expect currency exchange will be a headwind of about 1.5% on consolidated sales. We expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. Our core CapEx guidance for the year is approximately $415 million. In addition to this core CapEx, we expect to make investments of approximately $450 million in '22 related to our new headquarters and our R&D facility project. Both depreciation and amortization should be about $300 million each. Interest expense should be about $330 million. We have $260 million of long-term debt due in 2022. Historically, we've targeted dividends at about 30% of prior year GAAP earnings. Next month at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 9.1% to $2.40 per share, up from $2.20 last year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. As we begin 2022, we remain confident in our strategy, our capabilities and the differentiated product and service solutions we bring to customers. Above all, my confidence in our people has never been higher. Our business remains extremely well positioned and we're emerging as an even stronger Sherwin-Williams following the challenges that we have faced in the last two years. We remain steadfast in our focus on creating shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. Chris, I think you hit on two very important points there. One is the market and our position in that market, it would be the second point. So we believe and the first indicator would be the close relationship that we have with our customers. I'll ask Jim to talk to the macro indicators that give us confidence in a moment. But I'd say what gives me the most confidence is the nearly 3500 sales reps and over 4000 store managers that we have out there every day feeding our CRM system with data that plays back to incredible confidence that our customers have in this market. We've had we believe a pretty strong run here in a challenging market. But our customers are telling us that as they look forward, demand continues to grow. And if you look across the segments in every one of those architectural segments, the feedback that we're getting is exactly that. This is going to be a terrific year. Many of our customers would say their pipeline is pretty much full right now and they're looking out into the second, third quarter taking bids right now. So it's very solid. But let me ask Jim to give you a little bit on the macro numbers that reinforce what we're hearing from our customers. Yeah, our TAG and we believe also our Consumer Brands business as well there's lot of opportunity there for pricing in the market as well. But one point that I'd make in addition to the pricing availability on the Consumer Brands is what we're seeing from our contractors. We talk about gross margins and our ability to push that pricing through. This is a market where our customers have confidence in their ability to put pricing in because of the supply/demand dynamics. So we're up putting price in to customers who have confidence in their ability to put price into the market. I've often said we typically don't receive thank you notes for putting price increases through. And I don't expect to receive any on this round. But I will tell you our teams are very confident that our customers are almost in the mindset of okay I need to know what the price increase is going to be so I could push it through. And at the same time they're deciding, which projects they're going to take, and which ones they're not. So the dynamics are very powerful. Thanks Chris. Ghansham, if I could add I think that's a terrific response by Al. I think looking long-term there's some choppiness here short-term. We understand that. But when we look long-term and why we feel our company is going to really outperform and we often talk about this coiled spring. I look at the points that Al just mentioned and I'd like to just add a couple if I could. There certainly are opportunities to his point about the additional capacity that we've just brought on. We've got more that's coming on that is important. The other thing that I think is important to understand that we're not complacent. You look at how we get more efficiency and more productivity out of our plants. There's work to be done here, but we're well underway in a simplification process of our products to ensure that our responsiveness and I think this would be a question some shareholders might have. As we've come through this, how do we ensure that if anything like this were to happen again that we're the horse to bet on? And we're not sitting here waiting just trying to get out of the current situation. And we are looking at how do we build in the response as a result of this experience to ensure that we avoid these types of issues going forward. So it does include the resin company that we bought. It does include the capacity that we just bought. But an equally important one is the simplification of many of our product lines to allow us to be more responsive, more adaptive to the situation if it be from raw material suppliers or raw material products or to be able to move different resins around to be able to supply our customers. So, there's a lot of really good work heavy lifting that's taking place that we're not going to see today, but it's going to help us. It's going to help us not only in situations like this in the future, but to be more responsive to our customers' needs and more reactive to opportunities going forward. Well, I think, we're going to have raw material -- our raw material position is going to improve. It's improving now. And as Al mentioned, between our current and new suppliers, we've got confidence that this is going to improve. That's why I made the comments earlier. I'd say it this way. We've always hated talking about weather. I would associate our feelings with what we're talking about regarding raw materials to feel like weather. We want to get this behind us, and start talking about growing our business and talking about the incredible results we're going to post, and we're going to have the raws to be able to do that. Now are there other issues that we're going to face like transportation and the fact that we're going to be in a race to build product through the first quarter, but we're not going to be able to build the inventory that we typically build in the first quarter to be as responsive as we like. So there is going to be some hand-to-hand combat if you will, as we get through the year. It's going to get better, but we're going to be racing to fill the pipeline here. And we would have liked if possible to have built more inventory in the fourth and first quarter, but we're going to be in a position to have more raw materials and more capacity to be able to respond. We'll build some inventory coming out of the first quarter, but it won't be to the traditional level that we would like going into a paint season. Thanks, Ghansham. Bob, that's not a concern for me at all. And we've got tremendous comfort and confidence that the demand is real. And as we look at the bidding activity that's taking place, the job requests that are taking place, we can verify that. So the demand is real. We've got great confidence in that. Thanks Truman. I think there's a lot of really good work that's taking place, Mike, and it's a pretty good observation of you -- on your part, because we've had to make some decisions. And some of those decisions include paring down the product line to ensure that we have the products that were needed. We've really, I think, done a terrific job in utilizing the resources or the raw materials that have become available and we treat those precious raw materials just as that. So we're manufacturing products that could best fit the needs of our customers. And there are times when we're giving customers a product that will fit their needs, but it may not have been the product that they came in to get. And so we're working with them. And I would say this, that as we exit this, the line of sight that we've established and the relationships that we've built with our customers is one of the reasons that we're so excited about how do you turn something bad into something good. The relationships are stronger, because our teams are working with our customers in a very unique way. They may come in talking about wanting a product and our teams work with them to understand what is the project? What are you doing? Let me get this product for you and we're keeping our customers in paint. And that's been a big mantra within the TAG organization, is keeping our customers. And that responsiveness, particularly at the store and rep level is a point of differentiation. We've got a number of stores out there and we're leveraging the inventory and availability in those stores in a way that, quite frankly, most companies couldn't do. And I'm really proud. We talk a lot about One Sherwin, a mentality of doing what's best for the company. And so, there's a sharing of inventory as close to the customer as possible to be as responsive as possible. So we're not -- we're trying not to get to the decision point that you make about which customer to serve. What we're trying to do is, get to the point where we're answering the question of what product can we get this customer to keep them moving, keep them making paint and keep them providing for their families. And as a result of that, our view of their projects has improved. They are sharing more information with us. And that's why when we asked -- we were asked earlier about the confidence that we have in the demand, why we think it's as solid as we believe is our customers, as we've worked through this are sharing more with us than they ever have before. They trust us. We're working with them and we're partners. And so, we're giving them products to get them off their projects on to the next ones, the next project and they're making money doing it. Well, we're going to surprise. I would tell you this. If you look back over the last two years, while we've generated over $5.6 billion in net operating cash and we've returned $6.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, we've also been investing in this business, Mike. So in our North America paint stores we've opened 133 new stores, net new stores, 180 new reps. We've added probably over 2,800 management trainees to make sure that we have a really strong future pipeline. We've invested in our pros who paints with our Consumer Brands partners on the Performance Coating side, we're adding services and solutions that we really believe our customers are willing to pay for, because it's helping them make more money and that's what we're focused on. We've not talked about this yet, but we've been investing in innovation. And some might say, well, how can you invest in innovation. To your first question, when we're sitting here with raw materials, having to make tough decisions about which products we're going to make, would you be investing in innovation? And the answer is yes. We are investing in innovation. In fact, if you look over the last 10 years, we've averaged probably over 20 new products per year and that's really important. It's an important part of our strategy. And I know that firsthand, because I can remember when I was a store manager, and just learning to sell a product. And those new products made a pretty average salesperson a much better salesperson. I would tell you, it helped me a lot. And I think it gave me confidence, and it gives our people confidence. And most importantly, I think it gives our customers confidence. And so we're investing in these products. And these products are solutions that our customers use to help their business. And we think we're uniquely positioned to be responsive to those customers' needs in both \u2013 the needs they have that they can articulate and sometimes the unarticulated the things that they may not know. And so it should be no surprise that, one of the surprises that we have coming down the pipe, include breakthrough technologies in areas of durability, scuff resistance, mar resistance. And it's clear with the surge in COVID variants, a key emphasis in the market right now is keeping surfaces clean. And so you'll be hearing about some of these surprises as you say of our self-cleaning technology platforms as we move forward. But right now, naturally we're focused on the precious raw material allocation and servicing our customers. But rest assured that that's an important part of what we're doing. I think the other areas that you should expect that might surprise is the output of the capital expenditures that we're making. We talked about capacity utilization and the incremental capacity that we've added. We've added $670 million over the last two years. We're going to get every ounce of money out of those. We're going to put those assets to work and we're going to use them hard. I also think the \u2013 and this is a bit longer term, but as you're asking about surprises I think people will be surprised as we've invested in our new R&D facility and I just mentioned innovation. While that's not going to be in the short term, it's going to be an important part of what helps drive our company forward, because I think the collaboration that we're going to get from our wonderful technology people that's really going to be exciting. And then I guess just thinking off the top of my head, the last thing that I would add would be the utilization of this Specialty Polymers asset that we acquired. I think our ability to respond and our ability to really outperform the market and really de-risk some of what comes inherent from the Gulf Coast is we believe going to be a differentiator as well. So those are things Mike I want to talk about. There's a lot more that we have up our sleeves. We're pretty excited over here about what we're working on. We could talk about themes like what's coming down the pipe and digital and some of the other areas. But I've got a lot of confidence that, while we're excited about what we've accomplished and this quarter we would like to have a better fourth quarter but I'm really excited about where we're headed. And I really do believe that, the best is ahead. We're just getting started. Well, we respect all our competitors Steve. So we don't just stick our head in the sand and say nothing is a risk. In fact, we often talk about a healthy paranoid life, which means we take everything as serious and nothing for granted. But what the Pros Who Paint is an initiative that really drives effort towards these contractors, who paint as a part of a project. So our stores are focused on the painting contractor those that wake up every day with a goal of applying paint. There's a whole host of contractors out there that could be remodelers or could \u2013 in fact, I would say, nearly every project out there, nearly every project, ends with paint on the project. And so there are customers that prefer a different shopping environment than a paint store. And the reason is they might want to pick up drywall, they might want to pick up cabinets. They might want to pick up plumbing, whatever it might be. And so they choose their preference to be a home center platform. We've got a terrific relationship with a number of our Consumer Brands customers to focus in on this Pros Who Paints. And we believe that there's a terrific opportunity in many cases to apply what we've learned through our TAG business both in services and actions as well as product technology to bring and to help our customers better penetrate those customers that prefer that format. And while we have had some very limited success in that through our stores, I'd say that the terrific opportunity for us is to have much greater penetration through our home center partners just as they may have had some success with painters. We think by looking at the market and finding these opportunities and really putting the effort in product services, all the different unique nuances on helping those customers make more money will ultimately benefit everyone. No, I wouldn't say that's the case Steve. But when you bring up mix shift where I jump to is wanting to clarify that what we are experiencing is a very positive mix shift. Our highest quality products are the ones in greatest demand. And you could talk about a lot of issues. One we've not talked about yet is labor, and when you talk about painting contractors trying to get as much done as possible. They are all very well aware that getting the most out of a project, getting in and out with less callbacks being able to go back and touch up if you will, getting the lowest price gallon of paint is not the answer, in fact just the opposite. And we do believe that part of this specialty store experience and quite frankly in many cases what we are either now or will be bringing to our home center partners allows our contractors to be more productive. So again we're looking at helping our contractors make their labor some of whom may not be as experienced as they would like we're helping to make those laborers much more productive and more professional in their output or their finished products than they would in a lower quality you want to pay. Underlying demand I'd say in commercial is solid. Sales we've been challenged in some of these areas as we've been pumping through availability, but of product but I'd say it feels pretty good. And the reason I say that Arun is that these projects are beginning to come back online and reaching the paint stage in many cases. Our customers in this space have reported some of the labor constraints that we've talked about they're not only impacting the paint business. So these guys are waiting for drywallers who may be fighting for more labor to get the drywall done sooner and you keep moving up the food chain. So it's having an impact on the entire flow of the project. But as Jim mentioned, if you look at the Dodge Momentum Index it's strong. And we have a lot of confidence that it will continue. I'm sorry the other segment you asked about was -- MRO from a -- well, I'd say maybe on a broader sense, we could answer MRO because I think it also fits this, but maybe I could help you with Protective & Marine because it fits underneath that very well. Our business here was up and very strong. We're up double-digits. And there's a lot of really good work here. We have spoken about our strength in petrochem and the opportunities there. The work that we've been doing in the adjacent markets is beginning to pay off. We're excited about that. And as government spending on infrastructure continues to work its way through. While it may not be immediate, if you look longer term, we're really well positioned for that and working hard to capture that as well. So really, really, good. If you look at the professional side of every TAG segment that we have, we've got tremendous confidence. It's a very strong market from a demand standpoint and as I mentioned, I know that from my years of experience, you know that when pricing is flowing through from our customer -- from us to our customers as well as it is. And from them to their customers, because their customers simply want the projects done and they're willing to pay to get it. It's an indicator for us of the strength of the market. Well, I'd say it's improving. We're no different than what you would see in the marketplace itself. So, we saw the same spike and kind of decline that the rest of the country saw. So we are excited to try to get this behind us. As we mentioned earlier Mike, we're tired of talking about this stuff. I don't want to talk about COVID. I don't want to talk about raw materials. I want to talk about growing sales and growing profits. So we can try to give you a forecast and what's happening, but we're just going to do what we do. We've got a lot of determination on this side and backed up with a lot of skill in scar tissue. And I'd rather really not even answer this and just tell you we're going to fight through this. That's what we do. Thank you, Mike. Well, I think for all the reasons David that we just talked about. But actually, maybe a little more. I'd say, it's certainly a market where supply and demand is such that our customers have the confidence that speaks to the demand. But I would also say that, our teams, if it's in our consumer business with Todd Ray and his team working really hard to help our customers be more successful or in our TAG business with Heidi Petz and her team aligning to make sure that our customers, I talked earlier about keep our customers in paint, working hard to develop products and services that have them at the right place at the right time to be able to do that or Justin Binns on our Performance Coatings side. I mean, we're not just simply reporting. We're not just responding. Customer wants this, we don't have it. That's not who we are. What we're trying to do is influence as greatly as possible. So, we're aligning closely with our customers, where we often talk about running to the center of the fire. We're running to our customers. We're trying to understand what is it that they need, how do we respond the best as we can. Yes, there's challenges. What do we do to keep you in paint to keep you moving. And as a result of that, I think, while we're trying to help our customers to be successful and if it's a public company helping them to reach their goals, their numbers or a private company, who's just trying to feed their family, our goals are aligned with their goals. And when we do our jobs, we don't have to get fat and crazy with money. We ask for our fair share, for our shareholders, while we're helping them. And that's the focus that we have. And because I think we're working really hard to do that and focusing on their success, we're adding more success in executing the price increases. Thanks, David. No, I don't. If you look at the LIRA as an example, and other indicators that we look at P.J., there's a very strong demand, it's a strong backlog. And I've actually heard people, including one of them on my staff named my CFO, who bought an item that was going to be a slight delay in getting it, and the price was variable. Now not everyone may have that patience or ability to just say, okay, I want it, I'll pay whatever the market is at that time. But there are a lot of people out there that have been pushing off the remodel of their home, or the addition that they need, or an area that requires remodeling, because it's either aging in place or the home itself needs to be fixed. And many of them quite frankly are looking at it with the idea that prices are going up, I want to get this done and get the best price as I can right now, because it looks like this may continue. But I would tell you that I think the question that you're asking once again going back to demand. Demand is very strong. Thank you, P.J. Tenant was more of a technology buy. We're going to -- we acquired that to try to take that technology and grow it throughout the company. It's a pretty small acquisition, but it does give us an opportunity. And to Al's point, the Specialty Polymers is more internal manufacturing. Thanks, Kevin. But, Greg, I would add this that we learned an awful lot. And I would say, with that learning came incredible conviction is, when there were some of those delays and it took a little bit longer, it becomes tougher to get it as time goes out. So I agree with Al and I think that's -- those are good guidelines. But I'd also say that, there's a lot of determination and conviction. We're going to push that as hard as we can. Thanks, Greg. There's not a single answer for that, John. In some cases, there are opportunities to adjust in many of them. But in some cases there's not. And so it's a case-by-case basis. You bet. Well, what I would say is that, it's not just going to be going back to business as usual. They'll go through a very disciplined approach. And the question is going to be, if we survive this long without it why do we need to bring it back? So we want to manage our inventory and our working capital very closely. So my answer would be that there's a disciplined approach. And if in fact you see a working capital investment it's because there's the proper return that comes along with that. I think our approach is this that we try to keep the increase to a minimum. And when you approach it that way, there can be a little more volatility. We don't want to be out in front of our customers asking for more than what we really absolutely can see with the hopes of covering what might be a future price increase. And so that introduces a little more volatility, if in fact the numbers move or the prices move we've got to respond to that. But we think it's the best approach to our customers to try to keep the pricing to a minimum and have an open discussion with them about the volatile environment that we're in. Well, if I may just start with your first point about our desires to bulk up. I'd say that what is really the driver for our M&A strategy is our \u2013 is in fact our strategy. So it's not to be the biggest just not to do anything other than to put ourselves in a position to be able to best serve our customers. And we prefer to do that in a very unique and differentiated way, bringing them solutions that help them to be successful and profitable. And so the litmus test if you will is business by business, looking at what is it that we need to be in position to be able to serve our customers. We don't have a desire to be everything to everyone, everywhere. We're not chasing commodities. We're not it's not just about size. To us it's about driving value for our customers and shareholder value for our shareholders. And we do that by staying true to a very precise strategy. You're not going to see us jumping all over the world. Something is for sale so we're chasing it. It's \u2013 we've got a very defined strategy. And if it bounces up against our strategy and all handsets to do it we're interested. If not we're not. You bet."

After the Company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJim Jaye : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Sherwin-Williams remained focused in the third quarter on solving customer challenges, combating rising costs with pricing and investing for future growth in a difficult and highly fluid environment that is impacting the entire coatings industry. Demand remained generally robust, but raw material inflation remained persistently high and raw material availability failed to improve. While these conditions challenged our quarterly results, we continue to strengthen our customer relationships and take actions that strongly positioned us for the long term. We're confident in the demand outlook and even more confident in our strategy, our people, and our position in the market. Let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers. All comparisons in our prepared commentary this morning are to the third quarter of 2020, unless otherwise specified. Starting with the top line, third quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 0.5% to $5.15 billion. Raw material availability negatively impacted sales by an estimated high single-digit percentage with about 75% of the impact in The Americas Group. The remaining impact was largely in the Consumer Brands Group with an immaterial impact to Performance Coatings Group. Consolidated gross margin decreased 630 basis points to 41.6% driven by lower sales volume. Raw material caused inflation outpacing our price increases near-term, and supply chain inefficiencies. SG&A expense decreased 2.7% in dollars and decreased 90 basis points to 26.6% as a percent of sales. Consolidated profit before tax decreased $264.1 million or 30.2% to $611.5 million. The third quarters of 2021 and 2020 included $70.3 million and $76.4 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense, respectively. Excluding these items, consolidated profit before tax decreased 28.4% to $681.8 million diluted net income per share in the quarter decreased to a $1.88 per share from $2.55 per share a year ago. The third quarters of 2021 and 2020, both included acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.21 per share. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 24.3% to $2.09 per share from $2.76 per share. EBITDA was $834.2 million in the quarter or 16.2% of sales. Net operating cash grew to $2.1 billion or 13.5% of sales in the first nine months of 2021. Moving on to our operating segments, Despite strong demand, sales in The Americas Group decreased 0.4% as volume and mid-single-digit selling price increases could not fully offset the decrease related to raw material availability. Segment margin decreased 3.8% points to 21.3% resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases. Segment SG&A remained basically flat year-over-year in dollars and as a percent of sales, as we continued investing in strategic growth initiatives. Sales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 22.8% against a very strong comparison a year ago. The decrease included approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture, lower volume, and the negative impact from raw material availability, partially offset by selling price increases. Adjusted segment margin decreased 11.7% points to 14.7% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume, higher raw material, and supply chain inefficiencies, partially offset by selling price increases, and good sales and marketing cost control. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 17.4% driven by volume, price increases, and favorable currency exchange. Adjusted segment margin decreased 5.5% points to 10. 5% of sales. As operating leverage from the higher volume, selling price increases and good cost control were more than offset by higher raw material costs, where inflation was the highest among the Company's three operating segments. Let me now turn the call over to John Morikis for additional commentary on the third quarter and our year-to-date, along with our guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021. John?\nJohn Morikis : Thank you, Jim. And good morning everyone. Let me begin by reiterating the themes we provided on our September 29 update call. First, the demand environment remains robust across our pro-architectural and industrial end markets. Many external indicators and more importantly, our customers, remain highly positive. Demand is not the issue. Second, we're ready to meet this demand. We continue to invest in growth initiatives. We have significant production capacity available today, and we are bringing 50 million gallons of incremental architectural production capacity online over the next two quarters. Our capabilities are not the issue. The issue that impacted our third quarter and have persisted in October continue to be industry-wide raw material availability constraints and inflation. Let me be very clear on how we are responding. Nobody has more assets and capabilities and Sherwin-Williams. We're employing all of these to keep customers in paint and on-the-job, better than our competitors. We will continue to focus on customer solutions. We are aggressively combating raw material Inflation with significant pricing actions across each of our businesses. We implemented multiple price increases in the quarter. We will continue to do so as necessary. We continue to work closely with our suppliers on solutions to improve availability sooner rather than later. At the same time, we're exploring every avenue to better control our own destiny going forward, including our recent announcement to acquire Specialty Polymers Inc. There is no shortage of confidence on our team, which is deep and experienced. My deep thanks goes to all 61,000 members of our global family. We fully expect we will emerge from these current challenges a stronger Company with stronger customer relationships and with continued strong value creation for our shareholders. In just a moment, I'll add some color to Jim's third quarter results summary. But first, I'd like to make a comment on our results year-to-date. While events largely outside of our control have forced us to adjust our expectations, we have still delivered a solid performance. 2021 year-to-date consolidated sales were up 9.4% or $1.31 billion. Despite high-teens raw material inflation, adjusted PBT increased 1.5% or $33.1 million, and adjusted diluted net income per share increased 4.8% to $6.80 per share. Adjusted EBITDA is $2.73 billion or 18% of consolidated sales.\nOperator: Even in this unusual environment, we've continued to make investments that will drive our momentum over the long term. And we're confident we will see significant margin expansion, as availability and inflation headwinds eventually subside. Now, returning to segment performance in the third quarter. In the Americas Group, raw material availability challenges were a significant drag on sales. The good news is that underlying demand remains sound and reported backlogs are strong. We expect growth rates will improve significantly commensurate with the improvement in the industry supply chain. Sales growth in the third quarter was led by Protective and Marine, which was up by high-single-digit percentage.\nJohn Morikis : We're seeing good demand in this business from customers in oil and gas flooring and steel fabrication markets. Tag's largest business, residential repaint grew by a low single-digit percentage against a strong double-digit comparison. As industry supply chain issues are resolved, we would expect this business to return to its prior growth levels, where we've delivered double-digit growth for the last five-years. New residential sales increased by a low single-digit percentage. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer. And our customers are reporting solid order rates. We're seeing a number of projects being pushed out as a variety of building materials beyond paint are in short supply. Property management was up slightly in the quarter. Improving apartment terms along with return to travel, the workplace, and school are tailwinds that should support higher growth when raw material availability improves. Our commercial business was down slightly in the quarter. Similar to new residential projects are taking longer to reach the painting phase due to short supply of multiple building materials. And finally, as expected, our DIY business was down double-digits versus an extremely difficult comparison, which was exacerbated by the raw material availability issues. From a product perspective, interior paint sales performed better than exterior sales with interior being a larger part of the mix. We realized a mid-single-digit increase in price in the third quarter resulting from our February 1 and August 1 price increases and our mid-September surcharge. would expect the combination of these pricing actions to result in a high single-digit percentage price realization,in the fourth quarter. Putting our full-year price realization for TAG in the mid-single-digit range. We will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed. We've opened 50 net new stores year-to-date. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce, and productivity enhancing services. We are not taken our foot off the gas on these growth initiatives. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group, sale decreased by a double-digit percentage driven by difficult comparisons to the prior year, consumers returning to the workplace, raw material availability issues, and the divestiture of the wild business. Overall, the out-wide demand continued to moderate to more normal levels compared to 2020. This was partially offset by growth in the North American pros who paint category, which was up strong double-digits in the quarter and year-to-date. While sales are down in all regions, sales were less impacted in North America, our largest region, compared to Europe and Asia, where COVID restrictions were more impactful. Pricing was positive in the quarter. Though below the level of the Americas Group. As you know, our global supply chain Organization has managed within this segment, this team continues to work with suppliers to navigate the industry-wide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by winter storm Uri and Hurricane Ida. We stand ready with ample capacity and are adding more to serve customers at a higher level as raw material availability improves. Last, let me comment on the third quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. We continue to see momentum as this is the fifth straight quarter of growth for this business. Group sales increased by more than 17% in the quarter, including a currency translation tailwind of 2%. Price was in the high single-digit range and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in Europe and Latin America, followed by North America and Asia. Every division in the group grew, the majority by double-digits, driven by robust underlying demand, new customer wins and share of wallet gains. I will start with packaging, which generated strong double-digit growth against a high single-digit comparison last year. Sales were up double-digits in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust, and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction within existing and new customers. Indexes general industrial, the largest division with the group, which posted its third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. Sales were up double-digits in every region. Sales were strong across most of our customer segments, led by heavy equipment, containers and general finishing. Our coil coatings business remains a consistent performer. Sales grew by a double-digit percentage for the second consecutive quarter and were positive in all regions. This team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions. Construction and appliances led the growth. Automotive refinish sales increased by mid-single digit percentage. Miles driven are nearing pre -pandemic levels. New installations of our products and systems in North America remained strong. Industrial would division generated low single-digit growth. Growth in North America, our largest region, was up strong double-digits. That was offset by Asia-Pacific, where COVID related shutdowns had a significant negative impact on sales. New residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring, and furniture applications. Before moving to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation year-to-date. We've returned a little over $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We have invested $2.1 billion to purchase 8.075 million shares at an average price of $265.88.We distributed $442.9 million in dividends, an increase of 20.4%. We also invested $248 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $36 million for our Building Our Future projects. We ended the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. We also announced that the Sica and Specialty Polymer acquisitions, which are expected to close in early 2022, if not sooner. Turning to our outlook, we expect robust demand to continue in North American pro architectural end markets. We expect DIY demand to continue normalizing as consumers return to the workplace. We expect industrial demand to remain strong. Raw material availability challenges will remain a headwind in the fourth quarter, but the situation is improving. We believe, we have weathered the worst of Hurricane Ida and supply should continue to come back online. We expect to be in a make-in-shift mode and do not anticipate building any inventory until the first quarter of 2022. On the cost side of the equation, our raw material inflation expectations for the year moved up to the low 20% range from the high teens, given additional pressure, we've seen since our last guidance. We'll not seeing any meaningful improvement until well into 2022. All businesses remain aggressive in implementing price increases as necessary to offset these costs. We recognize that the timing of price realization will continue to put pressure on margins in the near-term. And as we've said many times, we expect margin expansion over the long term and maintain our gross margin target in the 45% to 48% range. Against this backdrop, we anticipate fourth quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will be up by a mid to high single-digit percentage compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect the Americas Group sales to be up by a mid to high single-digit percentage. With pro sales at or above the high-end of this range and DIY sales, returning to a more historic level. We expect Consumer Brands sales to be down by a mid teens percentage, including a negative impact of approximately 7% points related to the Wattyl Divestiture. And we expect Performance Coatings sales to be up by a mid teens percentage. Embedded in our guidance is a similar impact to our architectural businesses as a percent to sales from raw material availability, as we experienced in the third quarter. For the full year 2021, we expect consolidated net sales to be up by a high single-digit percentage. We expect the Americas Group to be up by a high single-digit percentage. Consumer Brands Group to be down by a mid-teens percentage, including the negative impact of approximately 4% points related to the waddle divestiture and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low twenties percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $7.16 to $7.36 per share, compared to $7.36 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.85 per share, and a loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full-year 2021 earnings per share of $8.35 to $8.55. Let me close with some additional data points that may be helpful for your modeling purposes. We expect to see a slightly improved sequential gross margin in our fourth quarter as additional price increases are implemented in the quarter. We expect to see contraction in our fourth quarter operating margin, due to the contraction in gross margin, partially offset by leverage on SG&A, due to the strong sales growth. We will continue making investments across the enterprise that, will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to have around 80 new store openings in U.S. and Canada in 2021. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, as well as systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform in the home center channel. These investments are all embedded in our full-year guidance. We expect foreign currency exchange to be a tailwind of approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be slightly below 20%. We expect full-year depreciation to be approximately $270 million and amortization to be approximately $310 million. We expect full-year capex to be approximately $370 million, including about $70 million for our Building, Our Future projects. The interest expense guidance we provided last quarter remains unchanged at approximately $340 million. We expect to increase the annual dividend per share by 23.5% per share for the full-year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. We are on track to deliver solid full-year results even with the considerable supply chain and inflationary headwinds, we are experiencing. I remain extremely proud of our team and their focus on providing solutions to our customers. Demand remains strong. Our customer relationships have strengthened. And we continue to invest in our capabilities. We expect to finish the year with significant momentum that will carry us forward in 2022. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And our first question is from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets, please proceed with your question.\nJohn Mc Nulty : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. When you look at the impact that you had in terms of raw materials holding back the ability to deliver in some cases, and in particular in the TAG business, I guess, can you speak to your confidence that that business comes back versus it moving into other channels, whether it's possibly even to your Consumer Brands Group or somewhere else?\nAl Mistysyn : Yeah, John. This is important area that we really do want to stress and feel very comfortable and confident about this. We have tremendous confidence in the line of sight quite frankly, in the view of the customer and the demand that they have, we have great confidence that as we are exiting this chapter that, the relationships that we have with our customers are growing deeper. And I would point to, how we're working through this experience with our customers as kind of the backbone of why we have such confidence. We're blessed to have a control distribution model that has our stores in the markets that our customers are living in and working in and reps that are partners in their business.  Through this experience, those relationships are growing deeper because we're working closer with our customers. The line of sight that we have on the projects that they are working, and the need that they have is only increased. And so you're right. There might be some shifting from here to there. And we've always said that. We've always expected the DIY to normalize and that the business would begin shifting into other segments of the business as people returned back to business. I'm sorry, back to work.  So we always expected that while DIY shifted down, other areas would go up and we expect that we've worked hard, very hard strategically to position the Company to be in position, to be able to capitalize, which ever segment grows and whichever segment the market might turn to. So when you look at residential repaint or DIY or new residential versus property management, we work very hard with products, services, and quite frankly the people in those markets to be able to capitalize on them. So I'd say our confidence is probably as high as it's ever been for me.  I see what's happening with our customers from a net promoter score at a record level, our new account activity at record level, our share of wallet activity record level, every metric that we look at I would describe as almost the coiled spring ready to expand. And so we're excited about this chapter as I referred to it, is ending because we believe we will be the ones that are really going to accelerate quickly to take advantage of that. Hey John. This is Al. The only other comment I would make is as John talked about is DIY normalized. If we look at our combined architectural businesses with TAG and consumer, we were up low double-digits in our first half to exclude the raw material availability issues due to the Hurricane Ida, due to the Winter Storm Uri, that we talked about being a high single-digit impact in our third and a similar impact on our fourth quarter. We'd be up high single-digits on that combined business. So to John's point, we're going to capture on either channel of where their customer falls.\nJohn Mc Nulty : That's helpful color. And then maybe just one follow-up question, in terms of inflation, I know there's been a lot of issues around labor scarcity issues and Sherwin's really never had a problem with that in the past. It's always been kind of a destination for a lot of employees, but I guess can you speak to the environment that you're seeing there. How to think about wage inflation for your professionals. And also some of the labor efficiency measures that you spoke to that maybe helping to offset some of that?\nJohn Morikis : John, I want to make sure I'm capturing your question that you're talking about wage pressure that we might be experiencing?\nJohn Mc Nulty : That's right, wage pressure and even the ability to get employees in the store.\nJohn Morikis : Terrific. And I'll start with that one. We have had to make some wage rate adjustments in some of our factories, distribution centers and fleet drivers to, I'd say, attract and retain some of our employees. I'd say, I'm really excited about this fact that point to all our employees as critically important. But I would say that those customer facing employees, the store manager, and the rep that I just spoke about, are absolutely critical. And both of those employees, the turnover rate is in the range between 6% to 8%. And I would say that most in our space or that operate in over 4700 stores would kill to have a ratio like that. So while we've experienced some pressure in other areas, those customer-facing employees we've been able to retain and we believe it speaks to the terrific culture that we have, our ability to recruit and retain employees comes down to a number of areas that we consider key to that culture. The ability to come in.  We hired 1400 college graduates a year. We bring people in, we give them a career opportunity that they can accelerate in. When you look at the opportunity to come in and run a business. Out of school within a couple of years and own a P&L, we think that's a terrific opportunity for these people that have worked hard to come in and really make a difference. When I look at the impact of that, the 14 to 1,500 college graduate that come in, and what that means to our Company over time, we have nearly 10,000 graduates of that MTP Program throughout our Company. And we think -- I want to spend a little bit of time on this, John, because I think it's such an important element. We call it our secret weapon.  And that is the fact that we've got these employees that have come into the organization, they understand our culture, our strategy, they understand our expectations. Importantly, they understood our aggressiveness. And when they stick with us, which is an important element of that strategy, Those employees move through the organization and they -- they grow in their experience, they grow in their understanding. And now when you look at, for example, our rep force, 80% of our reps in TAG, came through this program.  And so when you're looking at the opportunity to promote from within and what that means to retention is they're looking at -- they're looking up, if you will, into the organization, 70% of the TAG field leadership comes from our TAG -- I'm sorry, our MTP Program. And that drives more and more retention. We look at our employee turnover then and what it means to the broader organization 7,000 of our employees are great -- have greater than 20 years of experience with our Company. And so when we're in front of customers, we're talking about trying to bring solutions to them, to make them better.  These are experienced people that help us differentiate from our competition. And so when you look at the external recognition we've received from Forbes, the fact that we've been recognized in the area of diversity, and recruitment and internships and places to begin a career, all of those are really important to us. We don't fight for those awards. What we do is fight to make a wonderful culture that people want to be a part of. And as a result, we are better positioned to take care of our customers. So I'd say it's working really well and it's an area we'll continue to be focused on.\nJohn Mc Nulty : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciate it.\nAl Mistysyn : Thank you, John.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird, please proceed with your question.\nGhansham Punjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. John, I mean, supply-chain chaos has been persistent along the supply chain, including -- obviously your customers, including on their report this morning on the home-building side. As you think about the various sub verticals within tag, how should we think about air pockets of demand? Just because even if you have from drug solubility, maybe there's other bottlenecks that your customers are cycling through. And I guess specifically referring to new [Indiscernible] and commercial.\nJohn Morikis : I'd say those are a couple of really interesting examples that you use in new residential and commercial. Because you're right, it's not just paint that those customers are dealing with. There's a lot of raw materials or materials that go into those projects that they're impacting the pace of those. Those two markets though, I would say remain very strong. Permits up in new residential, we're expanding in multi-family as well and I would add this, it's not just the raw material or the materials, Ghansham, it's also labor that's impacting that.  So there are some challenges there. But what I would encourage our shareholders to understand is the commitment that we have not only to grow with our existing customers to begin with, but I mentioned just a moment ago about the share of wallet and the new customer activity. So we look at this in a number of different fronts. We're excited about our penetration there, but there is terrific opportunity for growth in there.  And I'd say that as this market begins to recover, the position that we have, we think not only with those existing customers but with new customers will position us favorably in the market. So I feel as though when this customer that has been pushing projects back further and further as a result of some of the supplies. First, we will out supply. We believe our competition. But we're also looking at a broader net that we're casting than just our existing customers as well.\nAl Mistysyn : Hey, Ghansham, I just add to that. If you look at our working capital and where we're at today, were significantly below our planned quarter-end inventory to a gallon. So as raw material availability improves, you can count on us to keep our pedal -- our foot on the gas on building architectural inventory. We're going to be in a make and shift mode through the fourth quarter. And we plan on building inventory in our first quarter of 2022. If those jobs get pushed back with the additional 50 million gallons of architectural capacity, we have coming on by the end of the year, we'll convert every pound of raw material we can get to be in a better position to serve those customers when those jobs are ready.\nJohn Morikis : Let me just build on, because it's a great point that Al makes. It goes back to the point that I made earlier, Ghansham. We don't discriminate which segment drives our results. So if New Residential is moving, we're going to be there. And if it shifts into another segment, we'll take those raw materials, we'll make the product in there and we'll push it out. The fact that we have a leadership position in these segments as something that will leverage aggressively to be able to convert every precious ounce of raw material into sale and profitability for our shareholders.\nGhansham Punjabi : Okay. And just for my second question. Can you give us a characterization of how raw material availability has evolved over the past few months and thus far into the fourth quarter, maybe as a measure of force majeurs, or however you want to define it supplier allocations, etc. I'm trying to get the cadence just because at the end of September versus now, which is just lying around four weeks later, you have raised your guidance. I am just curious as to how you're thinking about the velocity of rom curve.. Thanks.\nJohn Morikis : Yes. I'd say it's improving. We'd like it to come on faster and I'd say that we've had strategy for many years on not only working with our current suppliers and working to make them as productive as possible. When we bought Valspar, we said all along there were opportunities for consolidation in raw materials, working aggressively to accelerate that as that will help us become a, an efficient customer, if you will, for our suppliers.  I'd also say that the same strategy that we've had includes bringing on alternative suppliers and that's a goal of ours to ensure that we have the quality and consistency of our products for our customers through qualified suppliers. So I'd describe it as it's getting better, we expect it to continue to get better, and we're taking very proactive steps on our side to ensure that we're best in show in supplying our customers.\nAl Mistysyn : And Ghansham, I'd just add to that that we did take up our raw material cost outlook up from the high teens to low 20%. Back on September 29th, we expected certain things to happen. They didn't happen as you can imagine exactly the way we thought so pressured the raw material costs on our Performance Coatings business and our other businesses. And if you look at our second half, our second half increases in raw materials more than double our first half. I talked about on the September 29th call that, we were going to be chasing raw material cost through the end of this year and into the first half of next year.  And I want to make sure you understand our commitment to doing that. Our teams are in third waves, fourth waves, TAG has been out just as a reminder, February 1st of this year with three to four. Came back out again August 1st with seven. And put a surcharge in September 20 at the 4% that we fully expect to convert to a full price increase early in 2022. I could say that about each of our groups in regions we're committed to offsetting these inflated raw material costs. And we're disciplined about our approach, as John talked about in the past, we're not losing customers over these discussions. so we may have to delay a little bit, but we are going to get the price increase to offset the rows and as they moderate, we'll start seeing our margin improve. And as we've done in the past, we will see expansion above where we came into this cycle when we come out of it.\nGhansham Punjabi : Thanks so much.\nJohn Morikis : Thank you Ghansham.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much.\nJohn Morikis : Morning, Jeff.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi. Your DIY volume we're down sharply year-over-year, is the consumer -- is the Consumer Brands and volumes today in the third quarter of 2021 pretty similar to what it was in the third quarter of '19?\nAl Mistysyn : Yeah. Jeff, if you back out the impact of Wattyl, we'd be up low single-digits -- flattish to low single-digits. You'd expect a similar comparison in our fourth quarter.\nJeff Zekauskas: All right? So if you can offset raw material cost inflation with price increase, which I think you say that you can, like order -- order of magnitude in the third quarter of 2022. Should you be earning roughly a $140 million in adjusted operating profit, even if you don't grow very much, because that's what your returns were like in the third quarter of 19 and you now will have offset the raw material inflation. Is that right?\nJim Jaye : Yes. In the sense that consumer's in a lag. So if we're our expectation with our TAG group is to be up high single-digits in price in the fourth quarter, consumer is lagging that. And it's just timing, so they're going to come back and catch that up. The other part is, the supply chain efficiencies. We do expect to get better as we flowed through next year in raw material availability gets better. Because as you know, our global supply chain is embedded in our Consumer Brands Group results and that's having a negative pressure on our margins.\nJohn Morikis : Jeff if I'd add to the point that I made just a moment ago regarding price, it's certainly consistent across all groups and as well in Consumer Brands. We've gotten some price, we need more, it's coming, we will get it.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Mizuho, please proceed with your questions.\nChris Parkinson: Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. So it's clear your pricing efforts are rolling through as the industry continues to navigate the inflationary environment. But can you quickly comment as to the overall competitive landscape per, perhaps by U.S. region as it stands today. And your ability to continue to gain share in pro and trades into '22 and even '23, just any comments on what you're hearing from your staffing customer base will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis : Yeah. Chris, I'd say this. First, I want to reiterate the determination and confidence that we have in getting our price. We're not a commodity, we bring solutions to customers that help them make more money. We're determined to continue to do that across every business that we have. So we're not asking for something to get fatter or to take advantage of a situation. We're trying to stay consistent in our model which is solutions that help our customers to be profitable and successful. If you go back to 2016, I think from an industry perspective, when there's some different dynamics in the marketplace, and people didn't go out with price. At Sherwin, we felt the brunt of that as well and our people,\nJohn Mc Nulty : I would tell you we talk regularly about the experience and the scar tissue of this leadership team has a long lasting leadership team has been through a lot. And we learned from that. And I think -- I suspect others did as well. And what it means is that when the raw material price. bucket moves like it does, you have to get the pricing or it's brutal. And it's brutal for a long time. We've learned from that.  And so when you hear the conviction, determination, and confidence that I hope you hear from me and Al on this topic. It's exactly that we're going to get this price and we're not trying to be arrogant with it. We know we have a responsibility to our customers to help make them more money in the process. And we will do that. But our ability\nJohn Morikis : to do that, we think is very high. As far as, what our competitors are doing, yes we're hearing about pricing in the marketplace. But what we're really focused on is that value proposition to our customers. And as long as we're doing our job, we expect to continue to grow our business and to do it profitably.\nChris Parkinson: That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, it's a little bit off the radar screen as it relates to some of the headwinds on today's release. But when you have taken a step back and thinking about PC margins, the 13 to 20 -- 20% basis, so to speak. Can you just quickly break down any updated thoughts on the progression back to that goal across perhaps, price costs, general OP improvements, and market mix. Just any color on, how you think that's going to evolve across the initial recovery and how to conceptualize the long-term opportunity will be greatly appreciated. Thank you once again.\nAl Mistysyn : Yes, Chris. We still are confident, and I'll let go what Justin said on September 29th call just some [Indiscernible] are PCG Group President. We made good progress in 2020. Second half operating margin was up 100 bips. The 15.2% flow-through was strong with sales up 4% and our flow-through was up over 40. So I was seeing stronger volume, but the rate of increase of our raw materials has been dramatic and I said it's 2 times in the second half versus the first half for raw material increases.  So we're out with third and fourth ways of raw material or price increases. On top of that, this team is continuing to look for efficiencies on platform consolidations, SKU rationalizations. And they also have a lot of projects to improve our profitability outside the US. And what I would say is depending on the timing of the raw material moderates and our pricing catches up and we'll get the operating margin moving positively again. the one piece that we talked about is we still have facility rationalizations in the pipeline.  We're not going to comment on those until our employees know and we get those public, but there's opportunities there and I talked about maybe a $100 million incremental margin improvement from facility rationalizations, SKU rationalizations, platform consolidations. COVID set us back a year, no doubt, and we're fighting through it. But in the mid-term, we expect to see short-term improvement, mid-term, longer-term get to that high teens, low 20s.\nJohn Morikis : But I think Chris adversity brings out the best. I will just mention the facilities and some of the opportunities there. But the other point that you mentioned about the platforms and the point that I made earlier, about the raw material consolidation. There are opportunities there that we've identified all along. The strong proliferation of resins through our organization, the opportunity to consolidate those to be more efficient.  All of those will have a significant impact on this March to 20% range of operating margins for this industrial business. We're confident in our ability to be able to get there. We're going to do it the right way though. We're going to get there with our customers and by bringing them value.\nChris Parkinson: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis : Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets, please proceed with your question.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on demand. It's up skipping a lot of different dynamics in the market the last couple of years with COVID and DIY resurgence, and now with potentially lost sales because of lack of raw material availability. Maybe if you could help us, maybe in TAG and PCG. Is there a way to kind of quantify what your backlog has kind of grown to, or do you have visibility on that and knew when you do not make the sale because of lack of raw material availability. Does it go into that backlog or is it just we've potentially lost? Maybe you can just comment on that. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn : Arun, I'd say we're again, not to beat the drum here too hard. But the fact that we've got this control distribution model gives us insight into a CRM system that gives us confidence in insight as to what's happening with our customers. And what I would tell you is that, across nearly every one of these professional segments that you mentioned about in TAG, there is a growing backlog. The confidence that our customers are working with us and how we approach their business, the collaboration that we have gives us insight. I mentioned earlier about the fact that, our teams are working closer, far closer than we ever have, ever experienced and understanding what they have going and when it's going to be.  So yes, we have great confidence. We're not going to lay out any numbers with specifics as to what that looks like, but I would tell you that if you talk to any painter right now, they would probably tell you that the bidding that they're doing is further out now than they probably have ever had and their winning jobs, that people are understanding and comfortable with getting in line for next spring, next summer. And so there is an absolute understanding of what's going on. People are turning on the TV and listening to the news and understanding that there are some issues. Ours is unique from a supply chain perspective. When you think about our architectural products, since you asked about TAG,\nJohn Morikis: The supply chain issues that we're facing, primarily go back to the points that we made earlier about the Winter Storm Uri and the Hurricane Ida in February and September, those two issues that impacted us the most and our confidence in getting on top of that as the year progresses and as we begin next year is high. And our customers are learning that the fact that they do business with us are people can scramble and get product from different stores or different distribution center keep them in pace better than most of our competitors. So we'll come out of this stronger and with more loyalty and yes, there's quite a bit of backlog that we're going to enjoy filling for our customers.\nArun Viswanathan: Great, thanks. And then if I could just get your thoughts potentially on 22, so it looks like you will have some demand recovery here and assuming raw material availability improves especially by the second half of next year, you'll have full-year or so Specialty Polymer. But you also may see some stability in DIY. Is there any kind of initial markers you can give us for '22 on how to think about each segment's growth.\nJohn Morikis : Well, I think I'd just point back at this point, Arun, that we're very comfortable, very confident that there is a growing backlog. We're not going to give you any kind of data points right now other than when we're talking with our customers, that backlog is longer than -- longer deeper, and probably growing faster than at any rate than they've seen. But I don't think we want to share any kind of numbers yet. We will provide that information at a later date.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks.\nAl Mistysyn : Thanks, Arun.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your questions.\nSteve Byrne: Stephen Byrne for Vincent. I guess just back to your comment about having to build some inventory in the first quarter. And maybe just pairing that with the overall amount of deferred volume that you have? I mean, how do we think about this phasing of actually playing catch-up on some of that deferred volume? Can it happen in the first half or what are some of the key watch-outs there?\nAl Mistysyn : I think Steven, we have to keep an eye on the availability, not just our existing suppliers but we're looking on every rock we can find alternate suppliers to help us meet the significant demand expectations that John talked about. So our ability to build that inventory in the first half is going to be somewhat dependent on the increase in raw materials to get to the true forecasted demand, which is a lot higher than where it was entering the season this year. Like John talked about, we have the capacity to make the gallons.  We kept our factories fully staffed. That's an investment on our customers to make sure we can convert every raw material as quickly as possible to get it in the field in the fourth quarter and then build inventory both on the TAG side and the consumer side to make sure we can meet the demand head-on.\nJohn Morikis : And I think that's an important point that Al just made: the fact that we made that conscious decision on -- and did impact our gross margins, keeping the labor in our manufacturing distribution centers, so that we could respond. When we're talking about why is it that we have confidence in our price, that's a great example. Our customers, we talk openly about t that. The fact that we're making investments here so that we can supply. And as Al mentioned, as the raw material become available, we'll convert those quickly.\nVincent Andrews : Thank you -- thank you, Steven.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research, please proceed with your questions.\nTruman Patterson : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and John, I'm sure you were excited that Johnson looked like Nick Chubb out there last week. So great performance. So it sounds like the supply chain is improving modestly recently but you all mentioned that some petrochemical facilities were still shutdown from a winter storm in Texas on your prior update call. Could you just compare and contrast Hurricane Ida? Are there any major differences that would allow the Ida facilities to recover relatively quicker? Or on the flip side, maybe they take a little bit longer to come online than the Texas Storm.?\nAl Mistysyn: Well I think the Ida situation is a little bit different. Why don't I have Jim talk about that briefly and then I'll come in if there's any gaps.\nJohn Morikis : Yeah, good morning, Truman. As we've talked about throughout the year here, if you look at Texas, that was more, I would say, physical damage to facilities based on the freezing of pipes and just all the damage that we've talked about at length. I think Ida, what was more at play. There was a lack of power to facilities which has recovered significantly. You also had other utilities that were offline, for example, water supply, steam, things like that that are really important in production.  And even we saw a lack of nitrogen in some of these facilities, which nitrogen is a key element to preventing explosions. People that produce that nitrogen had diverted to producing oxygen to help out with the COVID pandemic. So a little bit different dynamics in the two. I'd say we're still not fully recovered in either of those, Texas or Louisiana, but making progress as we go forward. Yeah, I think you're exactly right, gentlemen. The key point here is that there were a couple of key facilities in the paint and coatings space, particularly resin manufacturing, and other thickeners, and realogy products that ended up impacting the ability to make paint. Again, not for just the Sherwin-Williams Company, but for the industry.\nTruman Patterson : Okay. And then in TAG, you all had sales growth, I believe in Canada, in the Southeast divisions, but you all had sales declines in the Southwest, East, and Midwest divisions. I'm just trying to unpack this a little bit. Was it due to regional supply chain differences, directing product to more profitable areas? I'm just trying to understand the dynamics there.\nAl Mistysyn : I would say Truman, that it's just the availability issues are across the chain. I think what you see going on in Canada is a determined team with the right focus on the right segments. And really doing a great job of increasing new account activity, gaining share of wallet, and having a focus on growth. And you can say, well, didn't you have a focus on growth in the past? Yes, we did. But I think this team is executing at a higher level than we have in the past.  And I -- I would argue the same thing in Southeast to Marine, different mix of customers impact availability as well. But our Southeast division has performed well through all cycles and I'll take a shot at our Southwest division. They will outpace the Southwest division and we'll see if the Southwest division can come pick it up and get back at Southeast and outgain them.\nTruman Patterson : Fair enough. Thanks, guys.\nJohn Morikis : Thanks, Truman.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nMike Sison: Hey, guys, good morning. If I did the math right, for the sales shortage from raw materials that's coming in, there maybe somewhere a little over 900 million and if you actually were able to get all the raw materials you need heading into 22, would you be able to or would your customers be able to do all that work and given how strong demand is in other areas?\nAl Mistysyn : Mike, just to be clear, you're quoting a full-year impact on the 900 --\nMike Sison: For the full year. Yeah. I agree with that.\nJohn Morikis : Well, as it relates to -- your question it's really a labor question. And I would say this, that there are some challenges there for sure. Again, I keep coming back to this control distribution model and our strategy, but Mike, I think these challenges work to our advantage. When our customers are challenged with where to be, what to do and we're the ones having the stores in the marketplace so that we can be responsive and serve them, the fact that we're developing products to help their productivity.  What we're experiencing right now is a positive mix shift where customers who may have used a middle-grade product are stepping up into higher grade available products. And what they're finding out, is that they are more productive and their learning more -- and they are earning more. I'm sorry. So I'd say that there'll be some challenge, but I also think that we're uniquely positioned to be able to capitalize on that.  And again, we mentioned new accounts and share-of-wallet. So we're not just -- going to be very clear, we're not just a retailer that opens doors and hopes people come in. I mean, we're out aggressively pursuing people every day. We're trying to help those customers that are doing business with us to be more productive, make more money and we're out attacking other people's hills. We're not just trying to protect ours.  And so the programs that we have, everything from the customer programs, incentive programs, everything we have is about growing. And that's what we're committed to. And we have great confidence as these raw materials become more available, and they will, add they're converted through capacity that we have, which is available, will grow our business. And we'll grow it faster than our competitors.\nMike Sison: Got it. And just a quick follow-up. Just curious how excited you are for a big lit on Sunday. That's not for Al. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn : Thanks. Mike.\nJohn Morikis : Steeler fan amongst us. I don't know how we let anyone from Pittsburgh in here. Thank you, Mike. Next question.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nP.J. Juvekar: On your Protective and Marine business was up high-single-digits. Oil prices are approaching what, $85 today. What do you expect from the energy business? How strongly do you think that comes back in terms of coatings demand?\nJohn Morikis : We think it will be an important part of our future, P.J. We enjoy a very strong position there. Demand is picking up there. We do believe though that it's not just oil and gas. We've been working very hard and we've been very transparent about the need for that business to further diversify beyond oil and gas. So we've been focusing on some of these other key segments. And when you look at the infrastructure opportunities that might be coming down the pipe, as well as our penetration into other areas, such as flooring, such as water waste water.  There's a lot of key areas that we have been really working hard on. So our position in oil and gas, we expect to continue to penetrate. But you can rest assure that, these adjacent markets, other markets in Protective and Marine business, we're focused very hard and we're having very good success there as well.\nP.J. Juvekar: Great, great. And then different paint companies are expecting to catch up fully with raw materials at different times based on their product mix or raw materials. If oil and raw materials were to remain here and not go up from here, when do you think you will fully catch up? Would it be like early 2022 or would it be by mid-2022?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. P.J. I talked about on our September 29th call with the increases we've seen in plus the additional increase we just updated our guidance with on raw materials that we'd be chasing it through the end of the year earlier in the year, I thought we'd offset a dollar for dollar. I think what we like or plan to do is go out early in 2022, with the idea that if nothing, if we saw no other increases, we'd get on top of it in 2022 early. That means you can offset the dollars. It's going to take some moderation in raw materials before you start seeing material change in our -- improvement in our gross margin, but our expectation is early 2022.\nP.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis : Thanks. P.J.\nP.J. Juvekar: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nBob Koort: Hi guys. Thanks for the question here. I'm going to -- I'm curious about you guys had the short some customers or didn't have product available. Similarly, your suppliers on the raw material side, I'm wondering in both cases, do you make that up at the pricing that was there at the time of the order, or do you get to sell in the future to where you might actually have a richer mix on those deferred sales or deferred purchases?\nJim Jaye : Probably some of both, Bob. I think we try to do the best we can to honor quotes that we have in the pipeline. It's such a wonky year though that it's hard to completely do that in this environment. So we're trying to be as transparent as we can with our customers, understanding that some jobs get moved. But not just because of the paint side of it, but because of the other supply chain issue that some of our customers are having. So I would say we're transparent, we work closely with our customers to figure out what that pricing looks like.\nBob Koort: You noted the backlog is quite healthy, you're going to build into that. Is there any anxiety that, the labor pool of your customer base won't be there to be able to handle that surge? Do you fear maybe you're going to have some missed sales because of that?\nJohn Morikis: Well, we're going to work with our customers and that's why I think, Bob, it's important to understand that, it's not just our existing customers when we talk about working with our customers. So it absolutely is incumbent upon us to help them be as efficient as possible. That's not just the way in which we run our business, its helping them to run a more efficient business, and the products that we sell them to make them more efficient. And at the same time, we are out there growing the number of accounts that we do business with and growing the share of wallet with new customers.  So I think we are uniquely positioned in the market, and I call it the stickiness, if you will, these customers that realize that we're working really hard for them right now. That's why this Net Promoter Score, not just on the DIY side, but we do a wholesale look at that as well to understand the view from the customer. Its actually growing in this market. And I think many people might be surprised by that. But the loyalty that we have during these challenging times is actually increasing with these customers.  So they have a lot of customers that we're doing business with Some that we're growing and those that were touching, in fact, for the first time, or maybe we've had a little bit of their business and we're the ones working with them to get through this. We expect that that's going to play favorably to our future. And we're going to take every step possible to make sure that happens.\nBob Koort: Terrific. And I'm not sure what sport people are talking about. I'm looking over to a baseball stadium where the world series is starting tonight. So we are ready for those Astro's.\nAl Mistysyn : Fair enough.\nBob Koort: Thanks.\nJohn Morikis : Thank you, Bob.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Afternoon Sorry. John Nippon just bought chronology in France. Could that be any interest for you guys?\nJohn Morikis : No.\nDavid Begleiter: Very clear. And just on Q4, would you expect tag earnings to be down again or maybe or flat or up in Q4.\nAl Mistysyn: When you look at Q4, it's really dependent on the availability issues. We are experiencing more of those issues as the quarter starts off, we certainly are going up against a tougher comp. And our fourth-quarter last year was up 9%. But based on the current outlook, fourth quarter have a similar impact availability. We'll have more price in the fourth quarter. So I think what -- it's going to be hard to get on top of last year's number from a margin standpoint. The dollars of probably been close to flat, if not up slightly, but from a margin percent, it's going to be hard to get on top of last year.\nDavid Begleiter: Understood. Thank you very much.\nAl Mistysyn : Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America, please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. I wanted to drill in a little bit on how you drive share gains within TAG. It would seem that several of those end markets, like commercial developers, new residential developers, property managers, These are not customers that are walking into your stores. You have commercial relationships that are much higher than that. And John, you talked about driving stickiness with your pro - contractor s. It seems you do a lot of things to make the lives easier for those pro contractor, so they don't have to go in your stores to get product.  So my question for you is, one on the value proposition of your stores, is it primarily for your homeowners to be able to have a store nearby to maybe select product s. And then secondly, what is the key driver for driving market share gains into these end markets that you really have higher level commercial relationships with.\nJim Jaye : Yeah, Steve, I think maybe a healthy way to look at this is an ecosystem. I might take exception to the idea that the stores are simply there for do it yourself. They play a very important role in commercial, new residential, every aspect of our business. We've leveraged that location and we do believe it's a competitive advantage in the marketplace. And so let me just give you a little bit of a highlight there and then I'll talk about the drivers of the market share gains beyond that.  I'll give you some of that, but I will tell you that there are a lot more than I'm willing to talk about here. So let's talk, first of all, about the stores. When you look at any given market, you have a store locally there. And if you remember that cost of labor represents roughly 85% of the cost of goods for painting contractor. We have a rep in a store, in a market that's responsive to that customer in that market.  And particularly right now as you look at something like COVID, where you might have used commercial as an example, you might have a commercial painting contractor on a project whose directed by the general contractor to move from one floor to another because of the number of people in a given area or because of some delays. there might not be the product that the substrate to paint. Because whatever dry wall taping wasn't done on time or whatever it might be. That that painting contractor's turning to our rep and our store manager, and he realizes right now he's got men or painters on the project that he is paying considerable amount of money to. And without that local store and the responsiveness, that day might be lost. A couple of days might be lost.  Whatever situation that they face, our store and our people are there to be able to respond. And so when a customer calls and says, I need something right now and our store's 10, 15 minutes away and we can respond, that's a significant advantage that we try to leverage with our customers and we try to help them to be more efficient. And that goes across every segment and anyone that would believe that you could accomplish what we do with the stickiness and loyalty that we worked so hard to gain, without those stores probably doesn't understand what we do yet.  And when you speak to these customers and the role that we play, it goes well beyond just a van showing up with products that are in our stores, there\u2019s relationships that are built, there's questions that are asked, theirs training that takes place, and that I think a big part of who we are. I go back to the secret sauce that I talked about. We're recruiting college graduates in many cases to be assistant managers and managers to come in to run these facilities.  So they can talk intelligently about what it is that these contractors are facing and how to help them through that That local representation is absolutely a key part in our being a part of that customer's business, not just a supplier. And when we talk about our ability to work with our customers in areas such as the compression of margin short-term. That's a demonstration of our partnership and how we work with them. And as a result of that, we do believe that we're blessed to earn more and more loyalty from our customers. As it relates to the commercial contractor, New Residential that you mentioned and how we grow that you're right, this ecosystem that I talked about is very broad, very broad. It's everything from architectural reps, color reps as specifying. It's having technical people that can be in the field to help in situations like this. One product may not be available, but another one is. Do we have the technical people close to the customer to be able to help them with the application start-ups so that the project goes smoothly. We do very few people, if anyone else does in any given market. And so when we're talking with a customer, we're not just talking about can we deliver a gallon of paint? It's is an entire ecosystem. And when I say we just don't open a door and hope people come in. We're very aggressive in getting all the way through the decision-making process from owner to architect, to specify our designer, applicator all the way through. And we're covering each one of those basis in a variety of ways to make sure that those customers know and understand the value that we bring.\nSteve Byrne: John, you mentioned this example of store being 10 to 15 minutes away. I'm sure you've analyzed in excruciating detail whether, there is a value to it being five minutes away, or versus 30. And thus, the question is, when you look at your footprint of stores, how much -- how many more do you think that you could put in North America and still drive revenue growth before that starts to plateau.\nJohn Morikis : So we've, Yeah, you're right. We've looked at that in great depth and I would tell you this, we've not reached saturation in any market yet and these large markets where we have considerable representation, if it's Cleveland or in Atlanta, or Dallas, or some of these markets where we might have a 100 stores. We're still looking at more and more facilities there. And what happens to these visit is that when we grow these stores, and the volume goes through the stores, we look at adjacent markets. We'll add a store in those markets. We'll grow that new market, but will also take some of those customers out of the existing store.  And we'll move it over into the new store. And as a result, the comp store grows faster as well as the new store. So when you look at store count we can see the next mile-marker that I talk about frequently is 5,000, but that's not to signal that we think we hit 5,000 stores. When we hit by 5,000 stores we'll -- the next mile marker for us will be 5,500 and then 6,000. And we will continue to add them as long as it makes sense. But we're decades away from a point of saturation that we're concerned about.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis : You bet.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions.\nKevin Mc Carthy: Yes. Good afternoon. Just to peel the onion, maybe one more layer on raw materials. I'd be interested to hear for seeing examples of cost relief here in October across your basket. And on the flip side, which inputs might be getting worse sequentially into year-end. And then related to that I was curious as to whether or not you're seeing tightness in specialty chemicals. It seems in the wake of Uri and Ida you had a lot of disruption upstream among commodity chemicals. But lately we've been hearing more examples of specialty categories that have been disrupted. And I was curious to know whether you're dealing with That as well.\nJohn Morikis : Yeah Kevin, I'll take a shot at that. So I'll begin maybe with the third quarter and what we talked about on the third quarter was raws were up over 20%. That was a sequential -- got worse in the third quarter versus the second quarter was really monomer, resins, solvents, packaging materials, all of those moved. If I fast forward some of the more recent data that we have in terms of prices that have settled, If you look through September, all the major categories that we look at are still highly elevated year-over-year.  If you look at whether it's propylene, ethylene, Appoxee, HDPE, all these feedstocks well, elevated year-over-year and not a lot of improvement, so to speak, sequentially. I think propylene may have ticked down a penny or two, but most of these have not moved. sequentially a whole lot. We're also seeing steel and TiO2 have increased a bit as well.  I think Al might have said earlier, in October, we've seen -- in terms of the availability we've seen some improvement there, but still probably not enough to let us build inventory in the fourth quarter. You look to the fourth quarter around inflation again, it's going to be a similar type of level of 20% plus in the fourth quarter. And I don't really see a whole lot of meaningful improvement until we're into '22 first couple of months of '22.\nKevin Mc Carthy: Okay. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciate it.\nJohn Morikis : Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Jefferies, please proceed with your question.\nEdlain Rodriguez: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I am just wondering, can you talk about the visibility you have for the fourth quarter, like you gave the guidance. So how much visibility do you have? Are you more or less set? based on your auto book or is volumes still in flux and can change depending on what happens over the next two months, especially in November.\nJohn Morikis : Edlain, I think it's dependent on how [Indiscernible] the quarter and quarter and there's no other disruptions as John -- and we've talked about, we have the capacity, we have the people in place so our capabilities are there. demand is there. So we believe every gallon we make will shift to the customer and get it so just about availability right now.\nEdlain Rodriguez: Thank you. That's all I have.\nJohn Morikis : Thanks, Edlain.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Harrison: Hi. Good afternoon. You noted some sales and marketing cost controls that you put in. place in your consumer business. Could you elaborate on that? I'm assuming that it does not make sense to spend money on advertising when you don't have enough product to sell, but maybe help us think about how much higher those sales and marketing costs could be next year if we're assuming normalized products availability.\nJohn Morikis : Yes. We consistently look to be more efficient on non-customer-facing items. We did get leverage in the quarter on -- I should say we have reduced spending in the quarter, but much of it is volume-driven in what our outlook is. And you're right, if we can't get products doing more advertising, marketing and things of that nature, you don't have -- I think just giving you a one-off on SG&A for 2022 would send a mixed message. I think we got to look at the totality of the group, how sales and margins progress. That really gives us a better idea how we're going to approach our SG&A spend for [Indiscernible].\nJim Jaye : Yeah, we'll invest as it grows and then position of the market. And we will work closely with our customers to do that.\nJohn Morikis : That being said, Mike, as even though our dollars were down, we continued to invest in the pros paint at some of our retail partners to make sure that opportunity is getting off the ground as quickly as we want and needed to.\nMike Harrison: And then my other question's on mix John, you mentioned that you are seeing some positive mix shift from some of your pro customers, shifting the higher grade products to improve productivity. But at the same time, lower DIY, probably hurts mix. So is -- as we think about the margin right now, and the effect of mix within your TAG business, is it pretty neutral is or is there a little bit of a headwind from the DIY decline?\nJohn Morikis : I'd say it's neutral, Mike. The takeaway for you on that one should be that, you've got professional contractors that are learning that they can make more money with higher-quality products and they're likely to continue to do that. And quite honestly, that helps -- we believe the relationship between Sherwin-Williams with these customers, because they're more successful, more profitable, and we're playing a part in it.\nAl Mistysyn : Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDuffy Fischer: Good afternoon. Raw materials had a bigger impact on TAG in consumer than PC. Is that because of specific raw materials that go into those types of paints? And if so, which ones? Or is it because you prioritize scarce raw materials to go into PC and made a structural decision to grow that business faster.\nJohn Morikis : Yeah. It's not because we're prioritizing TAG over other customers. It's related to the specific raw material that were impacted by Hurricane Ida that impacted TAG more than consumer and PCG. I don't think getting into the specific of what raw materials and what products is appropriate, but it did impact us more on tech.\nDuffy Fischer: Fair enough. And then on the 50 million gallons of new capacity, you've got coming up. Does that do 1 or 2 or maybe 1 or 3 things. 1, are you short capacity today, so you'll get a nice volume bump as soon as that's running or B does it displace third-party product where you'll get a better margin on that, or is that really just kind of a multi-year grow wind to project?\nJohn Morikis : We're growing into and want to fill that as quickly as possible.\nDuffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys.\nJohn Morikis : Thanks, Duffy.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI, please proceed with your questions.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. I just had a follow-up as to the progression of the guidance on the raws availability. So it sounds like the headwinds you expect in the fourth quarter will be similar to the third quarter from a volume standpoint on raws. Did I get that right? High single-digits?\nAl Mistysyn : That's correct.\nGreg Melich: And so if I back into the guidance that looks like it could be four or 500 bip acceleration in sales on the fourth quarter year-over-year. So is it fair to say that that's all more of the realized price, or a mixture of price and mixed combined?\nJohn Morikis : Yeah. Craig, I'd say it's a mix of price and volume combined. TAG will have a full quarter of the surcharge as well as the August 1st price increase, availability, impacts are flattish. But I do think it's a combination of both.\nGreg Melich: Great. And then I guess if we think about the acquisitions you've made, and I know they don't help this year, but is this a key part to really getting the capacity or some of the bottlenecks fixed early next year. How important, I guess, are they to getting back to that not having a headwind from [Indiscernible] availability?\nJohn Morikis : No, I don't think it's going to be the magic key to the door here. I mean, it's going to help us. We'll bring some best practice if you will, to the acquired companies. But we're working with our suppliers and we expect that we'll look at this as I mentioned, Greg during the call, it's a holistic view that we have on this. We're looking at this specialty polymers as well as the current supply base and it'll allow us to ensure that we can be as productive as possible while improving the productivity of some of our suppliers that will help us get more raw materials as well.  We'll add capacity to the Specialty Polymers asset base that will allow us on the one side to continue to supply the external customers that they have, while continuing to ramp up our supply as well.\nEdlain Rodriguez: Would it be fair to characterize it as it is less about getting the capacity per se and more about de -risking, maybe next spring, that you have, that you need?\nJohn Morikis : I think in the shorter term it maybe a little bit de -risking, but in the longer term, with the capacity expansion that we have, it'll be relatively inexpensive investment to give us more flexibility and capacity going forward.\nGreg Melich: Well, thanks. Good luck and have a good time, guys.\nJohn Morikis : Jeff, thank you.\nAl Mistysyn : Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. In TAG, commercial construction is a longer cycle business that usually can see out a lot further there. Do you think this is the beginning of at least four quarters of down results until we anniversary the drop in new starts in commercial that's at the depth of the pandemic?\nJohn Morikis : Well, actually if you look at the architectural billing index, John, it's been positive for 8 straight months. You're right. That project started in late 2019 or early 2020 or reaching the opinion phase now. But what we're hearing from our customers is that these projects that were pushed back are starting to see daylight and we have confidence that first we have a terrific position in the commercial front.  The relationships that we have with our customers and it was a question earlier about our stores are in the right place. So we're in the right markets where a great deal of the commercial activity is taking place. We think that this will be an area of growth for us and we're excited about capitalizing on that.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. And then in consumer was pros who pay, was that up similar to TAG s residential repaint. And should we think about those tracking together or will Pros Who Paint within consumer grow faster since it's growing from a smaller base?\nJohn Morikis : It grow faster as it's a smaller base. And we're excited about that. There are some terrific partners that we're working with on that segment that we've been able to ticket that a little bit through our stores. But there are customers that prefer that setting, a home center setting, if you will, that has a broader offering of products that actually just prefer that setting. And we want to make sure are customers are positioned very well to capitalize on those opportunities.  They have number of customers in their stores right now, maybe for the first time, as customers might be looking for product or availability, we want to make sure that that experience is a good one and the quality of the product and the services they receive.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital, proceed with your question.\nGarik Shmois: Great. Thanks for having me. My question's on Pro and new growth is expected to be at, or above the high-end of the TAG guidance as the growth more of a function of the COVID half a year ago, are you seeing accelerated return here?\nAl Mistysyn : Our comp last year in our North America Paint Stores was 9.7. Third quarter was 3.5, so I think it's more around just better availability. Even though the impacts are the same, but smaller from a dollar standpoint, just because the quarter is smaller. And I would say this, we typically see a seasonal slowdown in architectural in our fourth quarter coming out of our third quarter, I would say, based on what we're seeing, you won't see it -- we're not seeing as big of a seasonal slowdown, if you will. So that's kind of why you see a nice uptake in TAG.\nGarik Shmois: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research, please proceed with your questions.\nEric Bosshard: Two things first of all, John, you commented about loyalty increasing for your Company during this period of time. I'm curious, as you're putting through these price increases at a period of time where service levels are below your standard. How are the price increases being received? Is the uptake -- or are these taking longer to stick or is it probably in the historic normal path?\nJohn Morikis : Now I'd say either historic or maybe even a little bit faster right now. Eric, it does -- it is odd. I could understand a question about the loyalty increasing while prices are going up and availability is challenged. But I think it does speak to the point I made earlier. There was a question about our store locations and I got a marvel at that question because it does get hard of what we have, which is this unique point of differentiation, where if we didn't have the stores and you're trying to put pricing through and trying to build loyalty and you don't have product, I get it.  But the fact that you're walking into a store and in many cases, these are your friends that you've now built a terrific relationship where they are working with you. I need this product, I needed as soon as possible and the person on the other side of the counter is in it with you and we're trying to empower our people to make decisions. We're trying to give them product as quickly as possible. And as a result, the customers are understanding the efforts that our people are putting in, and the pricing is the pricing.  We're again, we're under a lot of pressure from a raw material standpoint. We're helping our customers improve their profitability and we need to stay healthy. And that's the discussion that we're having. And that healthiness includes a price increase for the products that we're getting. And as a result, in the metrics in the numbers are all right there, I mentioned a net Promoter, Promoter score, and people are familiar with that. There are a number of other metrics that we look at internally. They are all pointing in the right direction. So it gives me great confidence that what we're doing is working.\nEric Bosshard: Great. That's helpful. And then secondly, Al, you commented about catching up on raws in early '22. Based on where you are now and you've obviously, within that saving, you've got some visibility on cost and pricing into '22. Is it reasonable from where the world sits now that next year is a year where raws are up? 10 and prices up 5, is that the right initial way to think about '22, linked to that statement that you made on '22?\nAl Mistysyn : Yes. That'd be all else being equal, Eric, and we don't see additional increases that would obviously make us go out again like we did this year. But you're directionally accurate.\nEric Bosshard: That's helpful. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn : Thanks, Eric.\nJohn Morikis : Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Perrella: Good afternoon. A quick question on China with the energy issues that are going on over there are also issues on the property market have the risk on up, and have you seen any issues getting raw material supply, or even on the demand side over in China.\nJim Jaye : Well, I would say China has been a challenge. You're right. So let's talk first on the demand side, on the architectural side, a decent performance last year. And there's a lot of pressure this year. It's obviously a very, very small percentage of the overall Consumer Brands Group results. So it's under pressure but not meaningful in the sense of what it does to our results, on the industrial side we've had some challenges there, and not just China, but Malaysia And Vietnam is our customers as well as our plans have been under pressure as a result of COVID.  We believe work we're beginning to work through that locally and we're in a position we think to be able to capitalize on that. But if you look at our businesses in China specifically, we've had some really strong performances. We've said strong performance in our packaging,\nJohn Morikis : and we mentioned, that strong double-digit growth in every region. We continue to grow market share there. We're proud of that. I think if our president of our General Industrial Business was in the room, we'd want to point out the performance they had there. So it's a good strong performance. Our coil business, in fact, just about every industrial business we have is doing well in China, but there's pressure in that market. And again, our focus on solution is what we believe will be the differentiating factors.\nChristopher Perrella: And John, real quick, the wood coatings business, Southeast Asia reopens and moves through the lock down, should we expect a sharp uptick in that business in the fourth quarter or is that seasonality how would that work out?\nJohn Morikis : We would expect an uptick there. Our plants in Malaysia were shut down to only the people that were there. They had to be quarantined in a hotel and shipped into the plant in and out. There's a lot of -- many of our customers were shutdown completely. Vietnam, very similar challenges. So it is -- it has been -- there has been a lot of pressure there and we would expect that to ramp back up and we're in position to be able to do that. We've been utilizing inventory, having it shipped in from other plants -- nearby plants into Malaysia and Vietnam to try to make sure that we had the inventory as they ramp up. So we've been thinking ahead about. No, how to best position our customers as they reemerge. But it should be good for us.\nChristopher Perrella: All right. Thank you, John. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session, I will turn the floor back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks.\nJim Jaye : Yes. Thank you, everybody for joining our call today. If I had to summarize the key takeaways that I hope you walk away with today is that we remain very confident in our demand environment. Our pricing initiatives are very well in place and continuing to move forward. Our overall in strategy and our people, we feel very confident about that as well. So we appreciate your interest in Sherwin. As always, we'll be available for your follow-ups later today and throughout the week. And I hope you have a great rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Al Mistysyn",
            "content": "Yeah, John. This is important area that we really do want to stress and feel very comfortable and confident about this. We have tremendous confidence in the line of sight quite frankly, in the view of the customer and the demand that they have, we have great confidence that as we are exiting this chapter that, the relationships that we have with our customers are growing deeper. And I would point to, how we're working through this experience with our customers as kind of the backbone of why we have such confidence. We're blessed to have a control distribution model that has our stores in the markets that our customers are living in and working in and reps that are partners in their business.  Through this experience, those relationships are growing deeper because we're working closer with our customers. The line of sight that we have on the projects that they are working, and the need that they have is only increased. And so you're right. There might be some shifting from here to there. And we've always said that. We've always expected the DIY to normalize and that the business would begin shifting into other segments of the business as people returned back to business. I'm sorry, back to work.  So we always expected that while DIY shifted down, other areas would go up and we expect that we've worked hard, very hard strategically to position the Company to be in position, to be able to capitalize, which ever segment grows and whichever segment the market might turn to. So when you look at residential repaint or DIY or new residential versus property management, we work very hard with products, services, and quite frankly the people in those markets to be able to capitalize on them. So I'd say our confidence is probably as high as it's ever been for me.  I see what's happening with our customers from a net promoter score at a record level, our new account activity at record level, our share of wallet activity record level, every metric that we look at I would describe as almost the coiled spring ready to expand. And so we're excited about this chapter as I referred to it, is ending because we believe we will be the ones that are really going to accelerate quickly to take advantage of that. Hey John. This is Al. The only other comment I would make is as John talked about is DIY normalized. If we look at our combined architectural businesses with TAG and consumer, we were up low double-digits in our first half to exclude the raw material availability issues due to the Hurricane Ida, due to the Winter Storm Uri, that we talked about being a high single-digit impact in our third and a similar impact on our fourth quarter. We'd be up high single-digits on that combined business. So to John's point, we're going to capture on either channel of where their customer falls. Thank you, John. Hey, Ghansham, I just add to that. If you look at our working capital and where we're at today, were significantly below our planned quarter-end inventory to a gallon. So as raw material availability improves, you can count on us to keep our pedal -- our foot on the gas on building architectural inventory. We're going to be in a make and shift mode through the fourth quarter. And we plan on building inventory in our first quarter of 2022. If those jobs get pushed back with the additional 50 million gallons of architectural capacity, we have coming on by the end of the year, we'll convert every pound of raw material we can get to be in a better position to serve those customers when those jobs are ready. And Ghansham, I'd just add to that that we did take up our raw material cost outlook up from the high teens to low 20%. Back on September 29th, we expected certain things to happen. They didn't happen as you can imagine exactly the way we thought so pressured the raw material costs on our Performance Coatings business and our other businesses. And if you look at our second half, our second half increases in raw materials more than double our first half. I talked about on the September 29th call that, we were going to be chasing raw material cost through the end of this year and into the first half of next year.  And I want to make sure you understand our commitment to doing that. Our teams are in third waves, fourth waves, TAG has been out just as a reminder, February 1st of this year with three to four. Came back out again August 1st with seven. And put a surcharge in September 20 at the 4% that we fully expect to convert to a full price increase early in 2022. I could say that about each of our groups in regions we're committed to offsetting these inflated raw material costs. And we're disciplined about our approach, as John talked about in the past, we're not losing customers over these discussions. so we may have to delay a little bit, but we are going to get the price increase to offset the rows and as they moderate, we'll start seeing our margin improve. And as we've done in the past, we will see expansion above where we came into this cycle when we come out of it. Yeah. Jeff, if you back out the impact of Wattyl, we'd be up low single-digits -- flattish to low single-digits. You'd expect a similar comparison in our fourth quarter. Yes, Chris. We still are confident, and I'll let go what Justin said on September 29th call just some [Indiscernible] are PCG Group President. We made good progress in 2020. Second half operating margin was up 100 bips. The 15.2% flow-through was strong with sales up 4% and our flow-through was up over 40. So I was seeing stronger volume, but the rate of increase of our raw materials has been dramatic and I said it's 2 times in the second half versus the first half for raw material increases.  So we're out with third and fourth ways of raw material or price increases. On top of that, this team is continuing to look for efficiencies on platform consolidations, SKU rationalizations. And they also have a lot of projects to improve our profitability outside the US. And what I would say is depending on the timing of the raw material moderates and our pricing catches up and we'll get the operating margin moving positively again. the one piece that we talked about is we still have facility rationalizations in the pipeline.  We're not going to comment on those until our employees know and we get those public, but there's opportunities there and I talked about maybe a $100 million incremental margin improvement from facility rationalizations, SKU rationalizations, platform consolidations. COVID set us back a year, no doubt, and we're fighting through it. But in the mid-term, we expect to see short-term improvement, mid-term, longer-term get to that high teens, low 20s. Arun, I'd say we're again, not to beat the drum here too hard. But the fact that we've got this control distribution model gives us insight into a CRM system that gives us confidence in insight as to what's happening with our customers. And what I would tell you is that, across nearly every one of these professional segments that you mentioned about in TAG, there is a growing backlog. The confidence that our customers are working with us and how we approach their business, the collaboration that we have gives us insight. I mentioned earlier about the fact that, our teams are working closer, far closer than we ever have, ever experienced and understanding what they have going and when it's going to be.  So yes, we have great confidence. We're not going to lay out any numbers with specifics as to what that looks like, but I would tell you that if you talk to any painter right now, they would probably tell you that the bidding that they're doing is further out now than they probably have ever had and their winning jobs, that people are understanding and comfortable with getting in line for next spring, next summer. And so there is an absolute understanding of what's going on. People are turning on the TV and listening to the news and understanding that there are some issues. Ours is unique from a supply chain perspective. When you think about our architectural products, since you asked about TAG, Thanks, Arun. I think Steven, we have to keep an eye on the availability, not just our existing suppliers but we're looking on every rock we can find alternate suppliers to help us meet the significant demand expectations that John talked about. So our ability to build that inventory in the first half is going to be somewhat dependent on the increase in raw materials to get to the true forecasted demand, which is a lot higher than where it was entering the season this year. Like John talked about, we have the capacity to make the gallons.  We kept our factories fully staffed. That's an investment on our customers to make sure we can convert every raw material as quickly as possible to get it in the field in the fourth quarter and then build inventory both on the TAG side and the consumer side to make sure we can meet the demand head-on. Well I think the Ida situation is a little bit different. Why don't I have Jim talk about that briefly and then I'll come in if there's any gaps. I would say Truman, that it's just the availability issues are across the chain. I think what you see going on in Canada is a determined team with the right focus on the right segments. And really doing a great job of increasing new account activity, gaining share of wallet, and having a focus on growth. And you can say, well, didn't you have a focus on growth in the past? Yes, we did. But I think this team is executing at a higher level than we have in the past.  And I -- I would argue the same thing in Southeast to Marine, different mix of customers impact availability as well. But our Southeast division has performed well through all cycles and I'll take a shot at our Southwest division. They will outpace the Southwest division and we'll see if the Southwest division can come pick it up and get back at Southeast and outgain them. Mike, just to be clear, you're quoting a full-year impact on the 900 -- Thanks. Mike. Yes. P.J. I talked about on our September 29th call with the increases we've seen in plus the additional increase we just updated our guidance with on raw materials that we'd be chasing it through the end of the year earlier in the year, I thought we'd offset a dollar for dollar. I think what we like or plan to do is go out early in 2022, with the idea that if nothing, if we saw no other increases, we'd get on top of it in 2022 early. That means you can offset the dollars. It's going to take some moderation in raw materials before you start seeing material change in our -- improvement in our gross margin, but our expectation is early 2022. Fair enough. When you look at Q4, it's really dependent on the availability issues. We are experiencing more of those issues as the quarter starts off, we certainly are going up against a tougher comp. And our fourth-quarter last year was up 9%. But based on the current outlook, fourth quarter have a similar impact availability. We'll have more price in the fourth quarter. So I think what -- it's going to be hard to get on top of last year's number from a margin standpoint. The dollars of probably been close to flat, if not up slightly, but from a margin percent, it's going to be hard to get on top of last year. Thanks, David. Thanks, Mike. That's correct. Thanks, Craig. Our comp last year in our North America Paint Stores was 9.7. Third quarter was 3.5, so I think it's more around just better availability. Even though the impacts are the same, but smaller from a dollar standpoint, just because the quarter is smaller. And I would say this, we typically see a seasonal slowdown in architectural in our fourth quarter coming out of our third quarter, I would say, based on what we're seeing, you won't see it -- we're not seeing as big of a seasonal slowdown, if you will. So that's kind of why you see a nice uptake in TAG. Yes. That'd be all else being equal, Eric, and we don't see additional increases that would obviously make us go out again like we did this year. But you're directionally accurate. Thanks, Eric."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. And good morning everyone. Let me begin by reiterating the themes we provided on our September 29 update call. First, the demand environment remains robust across our pro-architectural and industrial end markets. Many external indicators and more importantly, our customers, remain highly positive. Demand is not the issue. Second, we're ready to meet this demand. We continue to invest in growth initiatives. We have significant production capacity available today, and we are bringing 50 million gallons of incremental architectural production capacity online over the next two quarters. Our capabilities are not the issue. The issue that impacted our third quarter and have persisted in October continue to be industry-wide raw material availability constraints and inflation. Let me be very clear on how we are responding. Nobody has more assets and capabilities and Sherwin-Williams. We're employing all of these to keep customers in paint and on-the-job, better than our competitors. We will continue to focus on customer solutions. We are aggressively combating raw material Inflation with significant pricing actions across each of our businesses. We implemented multiple price increases in the quarter. We will continue to do so as necessary. We continue to work closely with our suppliers on solutions to improve availability sooner rather than later. At the same time, we're exploring every avenue to better control our own destiny going forward, including our recent announcement to acquire Specialty Polymers Inc. There is no shortage of confidence on our team, which is deep and experienced. My deep thanks goes to all 61,000 members of our global family. We fully expect we will emerge from these current challenges a stronger Company with stronger customer relationships and with continued strong value creation for our shareholders. In just a moment, I'll add some color to Jim's third quarter results summary. But first, I'd like to make a comment on our results year-to-date. While events largely outside of our control have forced us to adjust our expectations, we have still delivered a solid performance. 2021 year-to-date consolidated sales were up 9.4% or $1.31 billion. Despite high-teens raw material inflation, adjusted PBT increased 1.5% or $33.1 million, and adjusted diluted net income per share increased 4.8% to $6.80 per share. Adjusted EBITDA is $2.73 billion or 18% of consolidated sales. We're seeing good demand in this business from customers in oil and gas flooring and steel fabrication markets. Tag's largest business, residential repaint grew by a low single-digit percentage against a strong double-digit comparison. As industry supply chain issues are resolved, we would expect this business to return to its prior growth levels, where we've delivered double-digit growth for the last five-years. New residential sales increased by a low single-digit percentage. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer. And our customers are reporting solid order rates. We're seeing a number of projects being pushed out as a variety of building materials beyond paint are in short supply. Property management was up slightly in the quarter. Improving apartment terms along with return to travel, the workplace, and school are tailwinds that should support higher growth when raw material availability improves. Our commercial business was down slightly in the quarter. Similar to new residential projects are taking longer to reach the painting phase due to short supply of multiple building materials. And finally, as expected, our DIY business was down double-digits versus an extremely difficult comparison, which was exacerbated by the raw material availability issues. From a product perspective, interior paint sales performed better than exterior sales with interior being a larger part of the mix. We realized a mid-single-digit increase in price in the third quarter resulting from our February 1 and August 1 price increases and our mid-September surcharge. would expect the combination of these pricing actions to result in a high single-digit percentage price realization,in the fourth quarter. Putting our full-year price realization for TAG in the mid-single-digit range. We will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed. We've opened 50 net new stores year-to-date. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce, and productivity enhancing services. We are not taken our foot off the gas on these growth initiatives. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group, sale decreased by a double-digit percentage driven by difficult comparisons to the prior year, consumers returning to the workplace, raw material availability issues, and the divestiture of the wild business. Overall, the out-wide demand continued to moderate to more normal levels compared to 2020. This was partially offset by growth in the North American pros who paint category, which was up strong double-digits in the quarter and year-to-date. While sales are down in all regions, sales were less impacted in North America, our largest region, compared to Europe and Asia, where COVID restrictions were more impactful. Pricing was positive in the quarter. Though below the level of the Americas Group. As you know, our global supply chain Organization has managed within this segment, this team continues to work with suppliers to navigate the industry-wide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by winter storm Uri and Hurricane Ida. We stand ready with ample capacity and are adding more to serve customers at a higher level as raw material availability improves. Last, let me comment on the third quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. We continue to see momentum as this is the fifth straight quarter of growth for this business. Group sales increased by more than 17% in the quarter, including a currency translation tailwind of 2%. Price was in the high single-digit range and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in Europe and Latin America, followed by North America and Asia. Every division in the group grew, the majority by double-digits, driven by robust underlying demand, new customer wins and share of wallet gains. I will start with packaging, which generated strong double-digit growth against a high single-digit comparison last year. Sales were up double-digits in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust, and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction within existing and new customers. Indexes general industrial, the largest division with the group, which posted its third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. Sales were up double-digits in every region. Sales were strong across most of our customer segments, led by heavy equipment, containers and general finishing. Our coil coatings business remains a consistent performer. Sales grew by a double-digit percentage for the second consecutive quarter and were positive in all regions. This team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions. Construction and appliances led the growth. Automotive refinish sales increased by mid-single digit percentage. Miles driven are nearing pre -pandemic levels. New installations of our products and systems in North America remained strong. Industrial would division generated low single-digit growth. Growth in North America, our largest region, was up strong double-digits. That was offset by Asia-Pacific, where COVID related shutdowns had a significant negative impact on sales. New residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring, and furniture applications. Before moving to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation year-to-date. We've returned a little over $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We have invested $2.1 billion to purchase 8.075 million shares at an average price of $265.88.We distributed $442.9 million in dividends, an increase of 20.4%. We also invested $248 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $36 million for our Building Our Future projects. We ended the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. We also announced that the Sica and Specialty Polymer acquisitions, which are expected to close in early 2022, if not sooner. Turning to our outlook, we expect robust demand to continue in North American pro architectural end markets. We expect DIY demand to continue normalizing as consumers return to the workplace. We expect industrial demand to remain strong. Raw material availability challenges will remain a headwind in the fourth quarter, but the situation is improving. We believe, we have weathered the worst of Hurricane Ida and supply should continue to come back online. We expect to be in a make-in-shift mode and do not anticipate building any inventory until the first quarter of 2022. On the cost side of the equation, our raw material inflation expectations for the year moved up to the low 20% range from the high teens, given additional pressure, we've seen since our last guidance. We'll not seeing any meaningful improvement until well into 2022. All businesses remain aggressive in implementing price increases as necessary to offset these costs. We recognize that the timing of price realization will continue to put pressure on margins in the near-term. And as we've said many times, we expect margin expansion over the long term and maintain our gross margin target in the 45% to 48% range. Against this backdrop, we anticipate fourth quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will be up by a mid to high single-digit percentage compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect the Americas Group sales to be up by a mid to high single-digit percentage. With pro sales at or above the high-end of this range and DIY sales, returning to a more historic level. We expect Consumer Brands sales to be down by a mid teens percentage, including a negative impact of approximately 7% points related to the Wattyl Divestiture. And we expect Performance Coatings sales to be up by a mid teens percentage. Embedded in our guidance is a similar impact to our architectural businesses as a percent to sales from raw material availability, as we experienced in the third quarter. For the full year 2021, we expect consolidated net sales to be up by a high single-digit percentage. We expect the Americas Group to be up by a high single-digit percentage. Consumer Brands Group to be down by a mid-teens percentage, including the negative impact of approximately 4% points related to the waddle divestiture and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low twenties percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $7.16 to $7.36 per share, compared to $7.36 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.85 per share, and a loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full-year 2021 earnings per share of $8.35 to $8.55. Let me close with some additional data points that may be helpful for your modeling purposes. We expect to see a slightly improved sequential gross margin in our fourth quarter as additional price increases are implemented in the quarter. We expect to see contraction in our fourth quarter operating margin, due to the contraction in gross margin, partially offset by leverage on SG&A, due to the strong sales growth. We will continue making investments across the enterprise that, will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to have around 80 new store openings in U.S. and Canada in 2021. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, as well as systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform in the home center channel. These investments are all embedded in our full-year guidance. We expect foreign currency exchange to be a tailwind of approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be slightly below 20%. We expect full-year depreciation to be approximately $270 million and amortization to be approximately $310 million. We expect full-year capex to be approximately $370 million, including about $70 million for our Building, Our Future projects. The interest expense guidance we provided last quarter remains unchanged at approximately $340 million. We expect to increase the annual dividend per share by 23.5% per share for the full-year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. We are on track to deliver solid full-year results even with the considerable supply chain and inflationary headwinds, we are experiencing. I remain extremely proud of our team and their focus on providing solutions to our customers. Demand remains strong. Our customer relationships have strengthened. And we continue to invest in our capabilities. We expect to finish the year with significant momentum that will carry us forward in 2022. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. John, I want to make sure I'm capturing your question that you're talking about wage pressure that we might be experiencing? Terrific. And I'll start with that one. We have had to make some wage rate adjustments in some of our factories, distribution centers and fleet drivers to, I'd say, attract and retain some of our employees. I'd say, I'm really excited about this fact that point to all our employees as critically important. But I would say that those customer facing employees, the store manager, and the rep that I just spoke about, are absolutely critical. And both of those employees, the turnover rate is in the range between 6% to 8%. And I would say that most in our space or that operate in over 4700 stores would kill to have a ratio like that. So while we've experienced some pressure in other areas, those customer-facing employees we've been able to retain and we believe it speaks to the terrific culture that we have, our ability to recruit and retain employees comes down to a number of areas that we consider key to that culture. The ability to come in.  We hired 1400 college graduates a year. We bring people in, we give them a career opportunity that they can accelerate in. When you look at the opportunity to come in and run a business. Out of school within a couple of years and own a P&L, we think that's a terrific opportunity for these people that have worked hard to come in and really make a difference. When I look at the impact of that, the 14 to 1,500 college graduate that come in, and what that means to our Company over time, we have nearly 10,000 graduates of that MTP Program throughout our Company. And we think -- I want to spend a little bit of time on this, John, because I think it's such an important element. We call it our secret weapon.  And that is the fact that we've got these employees that have come into the organization, they understand our culture, our strategy, they understand our expectations. Importantly, they understood our aggressiveness. And when they stick with us, which is an important element of that strategy, Those employees move through the organization and they -- they grow in their experience, they grow in their understanding. And now when you look at, for example, our rep force, 80% of our reps in TAG, came through this program.  And so when you're looking at the opportunity to promote from within and what that means to retention is they're looking at -- they're looking up, if you will, into the organization, 70% of the TAG field leadership comes from our TAG -- I'm sorry, our MTP Program. And that drives more and more retention. We look at our employee turnover then and what it means to the broader organization 7,000 of our employees are great -- have greater than 20 years of experience with our Company. And so when we're in front of customers, we're talking about trying to bring solutions to them, to make them better.  These are experienced people that help us differentiate from our competition. And so when you look at the external recognition we've received from Forbes, the fact that we've been recognized in the area of diversity, and recruitment and internships and places to begin a career, all of those are really important to us. We don't fight for those awards. What we do is fight to make a wonderful culture that people want to be a part of. And as a result, we are better positioned to take care of our customers. So I'd say it's working really well and it's an area we'll continue to be focused on. I'd say those are a couple of really interesting examples that you use in new residential and commercial. Because you're right, it's not just paint that those customers are dealing with. There's a lot of raw materials or materials that go into those projects that they're impacting the pace of those. Those two markets though, I would say remain very strong. Permits up in new residential, we're expanding in multi-family as well and I would add this, it's not just the raw material or the materials, Ghansham, it's also labor that's impacting that.  So there are some challenges there. But what I would encourage our shareholders to understand is the commitment that we have not only to grow with our existing customers to begin with, but I mentioned just a moment ago about the share of wallet and the new customer activity. So we look at this in a number of different fronts. We're excited about our penetration there, but there is terrific opportunity for growth in there.  And I'd say that as this market begins to recover, the position that we have, we think not only with those existing customers but with new customers will position us favorably in the market. So I feel as though when this customer that has been pushing projects back further and further as a result of some of the supplies. First, we will out supply. We believe our competition. But we're also looking at a broader net that we're casting than just our existing customers as well. Let me just build on, because it's a great point that Al makes. It goes back to the point that I made earlier, Ghansham. We don't discriminate which segment drives our results. So if New Residential is moving, we're going to be there. And if it shifts into another segment, we'll take those raw materials, we'll make the product in there and we'll push it out. The fact that we have a leadership position in these segments as something that will leverage aggressively to be able to convert every precious ounce of raw material into sale and profitability for our shareholders. Yes. I'd say it's improving. We'd like it to come on faster and I'd say that we've had strategy for many years on not only working with our current suppliers and working to make them as productive as possible. When we bought Valspar, we said all along there were opportunities for consolidation in raw materials, working aggressively to accelerate that as that will help us become a, an efficient customer, if you will, for our suppliers.  I'd also say that the same strategy that we've had includes bringing on alternative suppliers and that's a goal of ours to ensure that we have the quality and consistency of our products for our customers through qualified suppliers. So I'd describe it as it's getting better, we expect it to continue to get better, and we're taking very proactive steps on our side to ensure that we're best in show in supplying our customers. Thank you Ghansham. Morning, Jeff. Jeff if I'd add to the point that I made just a moment ago regarding price, it's certainly consistent across all groups and as well in Consumer Brands. We've gotten some price, we need more, it's coming, we will get it. Thank you, Jeff. Yeah. Chris, I'd say this. First, I want to reiterate the determination and confidence that we have in getting our price. We're not a commodity, we bring solutions to customers that help them make more money. We're determined to continue to do that across every business that we have. So we're not asking for something to get fatter or to take advantage of a situation. We're trying to stay consistent in our model which is solutions that help our customers to be profitable and successful. If you go back to 2016, I think from an industry perspective, when there's some different dynamics in the marketplace, and people didn't go out with price. At Sherwin, we felt the brunt of that as well and our people, to do that, we think is very high. As far as, what our competitors are doing, yes we're hearing about pricing in the marketplace. But what we're really focused on is that value proposition to our customers. And as long as we're doing our job, we expect to continue to grow our business and to do it profitably. But I think Chris adversity brings out the best. I will just mention the facilities and some of the opportunities there. But the other point that you mentioned about the platforms and the point that I made earlier, about the raw material consolidation. There are opportunities there that we've identified all along. The strong proliferation of resins through our organization, the opportunity to consolidate those to be more efficient.  All of those will have a significant impact on this March to 20% range of operating margins for this industrial business. We're confident in our ability to be able to get there. We're going to do it the right way though. We're going to get there with our customers and by bringing them value. Thanks, Chris. The supply chain issues that we're facing, primarily go back to the points that we made earlier about the Winter Storm Uri and the Hurricane Ida in February and September, those two issues that impacted us the most and our confidence in getting on top of that as the year progresses and as we begin next year is high. And our customers are learning that the fact that they do business with us are people can scramble and get product from different stores or different distribution center keep them in pace better than most of our competitors. So we'll come out of this stronger and with more loyalty and yes, there's quite a bit of backlog that we're going to enjoy filling for our customers. Well, I think I'd just point back at this point, Arun, that we're very comfortable, very confident that there is a growing backlog. We're not going to give you any kind of data points right now other than when we're talking with our customers, that backlog is longer than -- longer deeper, and probably growing faster than at any rate than they've seen. But I don't think we want to share any kind of numbers yet. We will provide that information at a later date. And I think that's an important point that Al just made: the fact that we made that conscious decision on -- and did impact our gross margins, keeping the labor in our manufacturing distribution centers, so that we could respond. When we're talking about why is it that we have confidence in our price, that's a great example. Our customers, we talk openly about t that. The fact that we're making investments here so that we can supply. And as Al mentioned, as the raw material become available, we'll convert those quickly. Yeah, good morning, Truman. As we've talked about throughout the year here, if you look at Texas, that was more, I would say, physical damage to facilities based on the freezing of pipes and just all the damage that we've talked about at length. I think Ida, what was more at play. There was a lack of power to facilities which has recovered significantly. You also had other utilities that were offline, for example, water supply, steam, things like that that are really important in production.  And even we saw a lack of nitrogen in some of these facilities, which nitrogen is a key element to preventing explosions. People that produce that nitrogen had diverted to producing oxygen to help out with the COVID pandemic. So a little bit different dynamics in the two. I'd say we're still not fully recovered in either of those, Texas or Louisiana, but making progress as we go forward. Yeah, I think you're exactly right, gentlemen. The key point here is that there were a couple of key facilities in the paint and coatings space, particularly resin manufacturing, and other thickeners, and realogy products that ended up impacting the ability to make paint. Again, not for just the Sherwin-Williams Company, but for the industry. Thanks, Truman. Well, as it relates to -- your question it's really a labor question. And I would say this, that there are some challenges there for sure. Again, I keep coming back to this control distribution model and our strategy, but Mike, I think these challenges work to our advantage. When our customers are challenged with where to be, what to do and we're the ones having the stores in the marketplace so that we can be responsive and serve them, the fact that we're developing products to help their productivity.  What we're experiencing right now is a positive mix shift where customers who may have used a middle-grade product are stepping up into higher grade available products. And what they're finding out, is that they are more productive and their learning more -- and they are earning more. I'm sorry. So I'd say that there'll be some challenge, but I also think that we're uniquely positioned to be able to capitalize on that.  And again, we mentioned new accounts and share-of-wallet. So we're not just -- going to be very clear, we're not just a retailer that opens doors and hopes people come in. I mean, we're out aggressively pursuing people every day. We're trying to help those customers that are doing business with us to be more productive, make more money and we're out attacking other people's hills. We're not just trying to protect ours.  And so the programs that we have, everything from the customer programs, incentive programs, everything we have is about growing. And that's what we're committed to. And we have great confidence as these raw materials become more available, and they will, add they're converted through capacity that we have, which is available, will grow our business. And we'll grow it faster than our competitors. Steeler fan amongst us. I don't know how we let anyone from Pittsburgh in here. Thank you, Mike. Next question. We think it will be an important part of our future, P.J. We enjoy a very strong position there. Demand is picking up there. We do believe though that it's not just oil and gas. We've been working very hard and we've been very transparent about the need for that business to further diversify beyond oil and gas. So we've been focusing on some of these other key segments. And when you look at the infrastructure opportunities that might be coming down the pipe, as well as our penetration into other areas, such as flooring, such as water waste water.  There's a lot of key areas that we have been really working hard on. So our position in oil and gas, we expect to continue to penetrate. But you can rest assure that, these adjacent markets, other markets in Protective and Marine business, we're focused very hard and we're having very good success there as well. Thanks. P.J. Well, we're going to work with our customers and that's why I think, Bob, it's important to understand that, it's not just our existing customers when we talk about working with our customers. So it absolutely is incumbent upon us to help them be as efficient as possible. That's not just the way in which we run our business, its helping them to run a more efficient business, and the products that we sell them to make them more efficient. And at the same time, we are out there growing the number of accounts that we do business with and growing the share of wallet with new customers.  So I think we are uniquely positioned in the market, and I call it the stickiness, if you will, these customers that realize that we're working really hard for them right now. That's why this Net Promoter Score, not just on the DIY side, but we do a wholesale look at that as well to understand the view from the customer. Its actually growing in this market. And I think many people might be surprised by that. But the loyalty that we have during these challenging times is actually increasing with these customers.  So they have a lot of customers that we're doing business with Some that we're growing and those that were touching, in fact, for the first time, or maybe we've had a little bit of their business and we're the ones working with them to get through this. We expect that that's going to play favorably to our future. And we're going to take every step possible to make sure that happens. Thank you, Bob. No. So we've, Yeah, you're right. We've looked at that in great depth and I would tell you this, we've not reached saturation in any market yet and these large markets where we have considerable representation, if it's Cleveland or in Atlanta, or Dallas, or some of these markets where we might have a 100 stores. We're still looking at more and more facilities there. And what happens to these visit is that when we grow these stores, and the volume goes through the stores, we look at adjacent markets. We'll add a store in those markets. We'll grow that new market, but will also take some of those customers out of the existing store.  And we'll move it over into the new store. And as a result, the comp store grows faster as well as the new store. So when you look at store count we can see the next mile-marker that I talk about frequently is 5,000, but that's not to signal that we think we hit 5,000 stores. When we hit by 5,000 stores we'll -- the next mile marker for us will be 5,500 and then 6,000. And we will continue to add them as long as it makes sense. But we're decades away from a point of saturation that we're concerned about. You bet. Yeah Kevin, I'll take a shot at that. So I'll begin maybe with the third quarter and what we talked about on the third quarter was raws were up over 20%. That was a sequential -- got worse in the third quarter versus the second quarter was really monomer, resins, solvents, packaging materials, all of those moved. If I fast forward some of the more recent data that we have in terms of prices that have settled, If you look through September, all the major categories that we look at are still highly elevated year-over-year.  If you look at whether it's propylene, ethylene, Appoxee, HDPE, all these feedstocks well, elevated year-over-year and not a lot of improvement, so to speak, sequentially. I think propylene may have ticked down a penny or two, but most of these have not moved. sequentially a whole lot. We're also seeing steel and TiO2 have increased a bit as well.  I think Al might have said earlier, in October, we've seen -- in terms of the availability we've seen some improvement there, but still probably not enough to let us build inventory in the fourth quarter. You look to the fourth quarter around inflation again, it's going to be a similar type of level of 20% plus in the fourth quarter. And I don't really see a whole lot of meaningful improvement until we're into '22 first couple of months of '22. Sure. Edlain, I think it's dependent on how [Indiscernible] the quarter and quarter and there's no other disruptions as John -- and we've talked about, we have the capacity, we have the people in place so our capabilities are there. demand is there. So we believe every gallon we make will shift to the customer and get it so just about availability right now. Thanks, Edlain. Yes. We consistently look to be more efficient on non-customer-facing items. We did get leverage in the quarter on -- I should say we have reduced spending in the quarter, but much of it is volume-driven in what our outlook is. And you're right, if we can't get products doing more advertising, marketing and things of that nature, you don't have -- I think just giving you a one-off on SG&A for 2022 would send a mixed message. I think we got to look at the totality of the group, how sales and margins progress. That really gives us a better idea how we're going to approach our SG&A spend for [Indiscernible]. That being said, Mike, as even though our dollars were down, we continued to invest in the pros paint at some of our retail partners to make sure that opportunity is getting off the ground as quickly as we want and needed to. I'd say it's neutral, Mike. The takeaway for you on that one should be that, you've got professional contractors that are learning that they can make more money with higher-quality products and they're likely to continue to do that. And quite honestly, that helps -- we believe the relationship between Sherwin-Williams with these customers, because they're more successful, more profitable, and we're playing a part in it. Yeah. It's not because we're prioritizing TAG over other customers. It's related to the specific raw material that were impacted by Hurricane Ida that impacted TAG more than consumer and PCG. I don't think getting into the specific of what raw materials and what products is appropriate, but it did impact us more on tech. We're growing into and want to fill that as quickly as possible. Thanks, Duffy. Yeah. Craig, I'd say it's a mix of price and volume combined. TAG will have a full quarter of the surcharge as well as the August 1st price increase, availability, impacts are flattish. But I do think it's a combination of both. No, I don't think it's going to be the magic key to the door here. I mean, it's going to help us. We'll bring some best practice if you will, to the acquired companies. But we're working with our suppliers and we expect that we'll look at this as I mentioned, Greg during the call, it's a holistic view that we have on this. We're looking at this specialty polymers as well as the current supply base and it'll allow us to ensure that we can be as productive as possible while improving the productivity of some of our suppliers that will help us get more raw materials as well.  We'll add capacity to the Specialty Polymers asset base that will allow us on the one side to continue to supply the external customers that they have, while continuing to ramp up our supply as well. I think in the shorter term it maybe a little bit de -risking, but in the longer term, with the capacity expansion that we have, it'll be relatively inexpensive investment to give us more flexibility and capacity going forward. Jeff, thank you. Well, actually if you look at the architectural billing index, John, it's been positive for 8 straight months. You're right. That project started in late 2019 or early 2020 or reaching the opinion phase now. But what we're hearing from our customers is that these projects that were pushed back are starting to see daylight and we have confidence that first we have a terrific position in the commercial front.  The relationships that we have with our customers and it was a question earlier about our stores are in the right place. So we're in the right markets where a great deal of the commercial activity is taking place. We think that this will be an area of growth for us and we're excited about capitalizing on that. It grow faster as it's a smaller base. And we're excited about that. There are some terrific partners that we're working with on that segment that we've been able to ticket that a little bit through our stores. But there are customers that prefer that setting, a home center setting, if you will, that has a broader offering of products that actually just prefer that setting. And we want to make sure are customers are positioned very well to capitalize on those opportunities.  They have number of customers in their stores right now, maybe for the first time, as customers might be looking for product or availability, we want to make sure that that experience is a good one and the quality of the product and the services they receive. Now I'd say either historic or maybe even a little bit faster right now. Eric, it does -- it is odd. I could understand a question about the loyalty increasing while prices are going up and availability is challenged. But I think it does speak to the point I made earlier. There was a question about our store locations and I got a marvel at that question because it does get hard of what we have, which is this unique point of differentiation, where if we didn't have the stores and you're trying to put pricing through and trying to build loyalty and you don't have product, I get it.  But the fact that you're walking into a store and in many cases, these are your friends that you've now built a terrific relationship where they are working with you. I need this product, I needed as soon as possible and the person on the other side of the counter is in it with you and we're trying to empower our people to make decisions. We're trying to give them product as quickly as possible. And as a result, the customers are understanding the efforts that our people are putting in, and the pricing is the pricing.  We're again, we're under a lot of pressure from a raw material standpoint. We're helping our customers improve their profitability and we need to stay healthy. And that's the discussion that we're having. And that healthiness includes a price increase for the products that we're getting. And as a result, in the metrics in the numbers are all right there, I mentioned a net Promoter, Promoter score, and people are familiar with that. There are a number of other metrics that we look at internally. They are all pointing in the right direction. So it gives me great confidence that what we're doing is working. Thank you. and we mentioned, that strong double-digit growth in every region. We continue to grow market share there. We're proud of that. I think if our president of our General Industrial Business was in the room, we'd want to point out the performance they had there. So it's a good strong performance. Our coil business, in fact, just about every industrial business we have is doing well in China, but there's pressure in that market. And again, our focus on solution is what we believe will be the differentiating factors. We would expect an uptick there. Our plants in Malaysia were shut down to only the people that were there. They had to be quarantined in a hotel and shipped into the plant in and out. There's a lot of -- many of our customers were shutdown completely. Vietnam, very similar challenges. So it is -- it has been -- there has been a lot of pressure there and we would expect that to ramp back up and we're in position to be able to do that. We've been utilizing inventory, having it shipped in from other plants -- nearby plants into Malaysia and Vietnam to try to make sure that we had the inventory as they ramp up. So we've been thinking ahead about. No, how to best position our customers as they reemerge. But it should be good for us."

After the Company's prepared remarks, we will open this session to questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJim Jaye: Thank you. And good morning everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered very solid results in the second quarter. We continue to operate in a very dynamic environment where demand was robust across the majority of our business, raw material inflation remained persistently high and the effects of winter storm Uri continued to have an impact on the entire industry\u2019s supply chain and product inventories. Amid these challenges we raised our sales expectations at our June 8 Analyst Day, and we delivered on those targets. Our gross margins were under considerable pressure in the quarter, given the sustained, higher raw material costs. However, as we have demonstrated in past inflationary cycles, we are fully committed to offsetting these costs and we announced additional pricing actions in the quarter, which will be realized as the year goes on. Despite the near-term gross margin compression, adjusted diluted net income per share in the quarter, grew by a double-digit percentage and EBITDA expanded by a high single-digit percentage. Let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers. All comparisons in our prepared commentary this morning are to the second quarter of 2020, unless otherwise specified. Starting with the topline, second quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 16.9% to $5.38 billion. This is the single, largest revenue quarter in the company's history. Supply chain constraints negatively impacted sales by approximately 3.5 percentage points split evenly between The Americas Group and the Consumer Brands Group. Consolidated gross margin decreased 320 basis points to 44.8% driven by raw material cost inflation outpacing our price increases near-term and a return to a more normal mix. Gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019. SG&A expense, as a percent of sales, decreased 130 basis points to 26.7%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $71.8 million or 9.6% to $819.2 million. The second quarters of 2021 and 2020 included $78 million and $75.1 million of acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense respectively. Excluding these items, consolidated profit before tax increased 9.1% to $897.2 million. Diluted net income per share in the quarter increased to $2.42 cents per share from $2.16 per share a year ago. The second quarters of 2021 and 2020 included acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.23 per share and $0.21 per share respectively. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11.8% to $2.65 per share from $2.37 per share. EBITDA grew to $1.05 billion in the quarter or 19.5% of sales. Net operating cash grew to $1.2 billion in the first six months of 2021, an increase of 11.8% compared to the same period in 2020. Looking at our operating segments, sales came in much as we anticipated with very strong growth in our pro architectural and industrial businesses and as expected, a historically more normal DIY. Segment margin was under pressure in all three segments, primarily due to significantly higher year-over-year raw material costs. Our additional price increases, which are still being implemented, were not enough in the near term to offset the higher material costs. Sales in The Americas Group grew 22.6%. Segment margin decreased 30 basis points to 23.5% as operating leverage from the higher volume and selling price increases were offset by the higher raw material costs. Sales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 25.4%, including four percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. Adjusted segment margin decreased 680 basis points to 19.7% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and gross margin pressure related to higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases and good cost control. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group exceeded our expectations and increased 41.3%. Adjusted segment margin decreased 60 basis points to 13% of sales as operating leverage from the higher volume and selling price increases were offset by higher raw material costs. Let me now turn the call over to John Morikis for additional commentary on the second quarter and our first half, along with our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2021. John?\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Let me begin by framing my comments with some key themes. First, demand is very strong across the majority of our business, and we are aggressively pursuing growth opportunities. Two, while industry supply chain constraints are continuing to impact production and sales nobody has more assets and capabilities than Sherwin-Williams to keep their customers in paint and on the job. Three, we are aggressively combating raw material inflation with significant price actions across each of our businesses. We will continue to do so as necessary. And last, we've seen this movie before, there is no better or more experienced team in the industry to manage through the current environment. We remain extremely confident, we will emerge from these current challenges, a stronger company with stronger customer relationships and with continued strong value creation for our shareholders. My deep thanks goes to all 61,000 members of our team who are doing an amazing job in some pretty challenging circumstances right now. Jim did a nice job of framing up the second quarter at a high level. In a moment, I'll get into some additional color for each of our segments. But first, I'd like to make a comment on our first half. Given the impact of the pandemic on our results in the second quarter, a year ago, 2021 first half consolidated sales increased 14.7% or $1.29 billion. Adjusted PBT increased 23.5% or $303.3 million. Adjusted PBT margin was up 120 basis points to 15.9% of sales. And adjusted diluted net income was $4.71 per share, an increase of 26.6%. This is a very strong performance, especially in light of the much higher than anticipated raw material inflation we've seen and the supply chain challenges we've described. Now we turn into the segment performance in the quarter. In the Americas Group, second quarter sales increased to 22.6%. The impact of unfavorable currency translation was not material. Same-store sales in the U.S. and Canada were up 19.3%. We generated strong double-digit growth across all of our pro end markets in TAG in the second quarter. Residential repaint, TAG's largest business was the fastest growing and we expect this momentum to continue. Contractors are reporting solid backlogs, and interior and exterior work were both strong. Our commercial business was the next fastest growing and as gaining momentum as we expected. Projects continue to resume at varying paces and comparisons are favorable over the remainder of the year. Property maintenance is also gaining momentum. Apartment turns or return to travel and office and a favorable comparison, all contributed to our growth. We expect to see continuing improvements as the year progresses. New residential remained another area of strength for us. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer, and customers are reporting solid order rates. We're also encouraged by growth in our protective and marine business. We saw a return to growth with oil and gas customers and continued strength in flooring, bridge and highway, and pharmaceutical applications. And finally, as expected, our DIY business was down significantly after five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Notably, all TAG architectural businesses delivered growth over the second quarter of 2019. From a product perspective, sales in both interior and exterior paint were up by double-digit percentages with interior being the larger part of the mix. Additionally, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of spray equipment sales increased by double digits. This continues to be a very healthy sign of recovery as contractors typically invest in this type of equipment in anticipation of solid demand. We realized nearly 2.5% of price in the second quarter resulting from our February 1 price increase. Given the persistent raw material inflation we are experiencing, TAG announced an additional 7% price increase last month, that will be effective August 1. We would expect the combination of these February and August price increases to result in a mid-single-digit percentage of price in the third quarter, and better than that in the fourth quarter, putting our full year price realization for TAG in the mid-single-digit range. We will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed. We opened 23 net new stores in the quarter and have opened 34 net new stores year-to-date. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity enhancing services to drive additional growth. To provide a fuller picture of how this business is performing, I'll close out my TAG discussion with a few comments on the first half. Sales are up 15.9% versus the first half of 2020 and segment margin is up 110 basis points, 21.6% of sales. A metric we pay very close attention to is the number of new accounts, which are up nearly 30% in the first half. This is a clear indicator of terrific opportunities ahead. On a two-year stack basis, sales are up 14% compared to the first half of 2019, or an average of 7% annually, well above market growth. Segment margin expanded 240 basis points over the same two-year period. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased 25% in the quarter, including a positive impact of 1.5 percentage points related to currency translation and negative impact of 4 percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. Pricing was positive. As expected, our DIY business returned to more normal levels driven by consumers returning to work and difficult comparisons to the prior year. We're encouraged by growth in our European and Asia-Pacific businesses, which were both up double digits in the quarter. And in our Pros Who Paint category, though these areas of strength were not enough to offset lower North America DIY demand. While it was a challenging quarter for sure, it's constructive to look at this business over the first half, given the unusual DIY dynamics related to the pandemic over the past year. Adjusting for the divestiture of Wattyl, the business is only down low-single digits compared to the first half of 2020. Encouragingly, the first half of 2021 is up mid-single digits compared to the first half of 2019, and adjusted segment margin is up 180 basis points over the same period. We think the comparison to the first half of 2019 better indicates the progress we're making in growing this business and improving its performance. As you know, our global supply chain organization is managed within this segment, this team continues to do incredible work in navigating the industry-wide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri. We are working collaboratively across our business to support our customers and keep them painting. Last, let me comment on second quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. The industrial recovery appears to be in full swing. The momentum we've seen since the third quarter of 2020 continued and accelerated in the year\u2019s second quarter. Group sales increased by more than 40%, including a currency translation tailwind of 6% in the quarter. Price was positive, and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in Europe, followed by Latin America, Asia-Pacific and North America. Every division in the group grew by a strong double-digit percentage driven by robust underlined demand, new customer wins, share wallet gains and favorable comparisons to last year\u2019s second quarter. I'll start with the industrial wood division, which again had the highest growth rate in the group. This is the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in this business and sales were positive in every region. New residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring and furniture applications. General industrial, the largest division of the group posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and sales were positive in every region. Our customers are reporting the growth they have seen as being driven by true and market demand rather than temporary inventory restocking. Sales were strong across our customer segments, including heavy equipment, building products, containers and general finishing. Automotive refinish sales increased by strong double-digit percentage. Miles driven and collision shop volume remained below pre-pandemic levels. New installations of our products and systems in North America remained very strong. This is a good indicator of further momentum in our business. Our coil coatings business remains a consistent performer. Sales grew by strong double-digit percentage and were positive in all regions. This team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions. Construction and appliances were to grow. Our packaging team generated double-digit growth against a high-single-digit comparison last year, and sales were positive in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction with existing and new customers. As I did in the other two segments, let me speak to Performance Coatings\u2019 first half performance, where sales were up 26.4% versus the first half of 2020. Adjusted segment profit increased $81.3 million or 25.7%. Adjusted segment margin was basically flat, which is encouraging given that this group has seen the highest level of raw material inflation in the company year-to-date. On a two-year stack basis, PCG first half 2021 sales were up 15% compared to the first half of 2019 or an average of 7.5% annually, again, well above market growth. Adjusted segment margin is down just 40 basis points over the same two-year period. Encouraging performance given this business has faced the most significant raw material inflation year-to-date. Before moving on to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation year-to-date. We have returned a little over $1.9 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We\u2019ve invested $1.6 billion to purchase 6.4 million shares at an average price of $257.12. We distributed $297.7 million in dividends, an increase of 21.2%. We also invested $151.4 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $17 million for our building our future project. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times. Turning to our outlook. We expect robust demand in all North American pro architectural end markets to continue through the second half, though comparisons become more challenging and continued tightness in the supply chain will remain a headwind. We expect DIY demand to continue to moderate as consumers return to work and comparisons will remain challenging into 2022. We expect industrial demand will remain strong over the rest of the year. As we described last quarter, we\u2019ve been highly proactive in managing the supply chain disruptions to provide product to our customers. We expect to be in a make and ship mode until the seasonally slower fourth quarter when we expect to begin building inventory. We see the current challenges as an opportunity to drive even greater engagement with our customers. We\u2019re leveraging all of our assets, including our store platform, our fleet, our distribution centers, and more to let us come up with unique and creative customer solutions that others simply can\u2019t. On the cost side of the equation, raw material inflation has not moderated driven by continued supply chain issues and surging demand. As a result, we are raising our raw material inflation expectations to be in the mid-teens for the year, an increase from our previous range. We anticipate year-over-year inflation in the third quarter to be higher than it was in the second quarter with only slight improvement in the fourth quarter, as demand remains high. We continue to have great confidence. We will offset these higher costs with the incremental price increases we announced in all businesses during the second quarter. We are prepared to implement additional increases should they be necessary. We recognized the timing of price realization will continue to put pressure on margins in the near term. Over the longer term, we expect margin expansion. Against this backdrop, we anticipate third quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will be up by mid to high single digit percentage compared to the third quarter of 2020. We expect The Americas Group sales to be up by a mid to high single digit percentage with pro sales at or above the high end of this range and DIY sales returning to a more historic level.  We expect Consumer Brands sales to be down by a mid to high teens percentage, including a negative impact of approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. And we expect performance coatings sales to be up by a high teens to low 20s percentage. We expect raw material availability to continue to improve throughout the quarter. Embedded in our guidance is a slightly smaller impact from raw material availability than we experienced in the second quarter. For the full year 2021, we expect consolidated net sales to be up by a high single to low double-digit percentage. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a low double digit to mid-teens percentage. Consumer Brands Group to be down by a mid to high single digit percentage, including the negative impact of approximately four percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low 20s percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $8.01 to $8.31 per share, compared to $7.36 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.80 per share and the loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2021 earnings per share of $9.15 to $9.45, an increase of 13.6% at the midpoint over the $8.19 we delivered in 2020. Let me close with some additional data points that may be helpful for modeling purposes. We expect to see slightly more gross margin contraction in our second half compared to our first half due to higher raw material costs, product and customer mix returning to more normal levels and a more difficult comparison year-over-year, partially offset by additional selling price increases implemented across all of our businesses in the second half of the year. We expect to see some contraction in full year gross margin, given the lag between pricing realization and the rapid and greater than expected increase in raw material costs. As we capture price and inflation abates, [ph] we expect to see gross margin recover and then expand over time just as it has in previous cycles. We expect to see some contraction in our second half operating margin due to the contraction in gross margin partially offset by leverage on SG&A due to the strong sales growth. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately flat with 2020 with a nice improvement compared to 2019. The level of our operating margin performance compared to last year will depend on where in the range our consolidated sales perform and where raw materials trend through the second half of the year. We will continue making investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to return to our normal cadence with around 80 new stores opening in the U.S. and Canada in 2021. We\u2019ll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform in the home center channel. These investments are embedded in our full year guidance. We expect foreign currency exchange to be a tailwind of approximately 2% for the full year. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. We expect full year depreciation to be approximately $280 million and amortization to be approximately $310 million. The CapEx and interest expense guidance we provided last quarter remains unchanged. We have $24 million of long-term debt due in 2021. We expect to increase the annual dividend per share by 23.5% per share for the full year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We\u2019ll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. We delivered an excellent first half and despite considerable supply chain and inflationary headwinds, we are maintaining our previous full year guidance and expect to deliver another very strong year. We remain highly focused on providing solutions to our customers. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Punjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\nGhansham Punjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nJohn Morikis: Good morning, Ghansh.\nGhansham Punjabi: Good morning. Revision higher for 2021 sales specific to TAG versus your most recent guidance, can you just take us through which end markets are driving that incremental upside? And I know you also said that [indiscernible] prices are not moderating, but have they started to stabilize or is that not the case at this point?\nJohn Morikis: Hey Ghansham let me take a swipe at the first part of your question and I'll ask Al to talk about the second. And it's going to be an easy swipe across the first piece because across the TAG business, if I understand your question, which segments are going to be driving that business, it's every one of our professional segments. We've got great confidence in the demand that we see in that business. We spoke last quarter, last couple quarters about our expectations as it relates to DIY that they would likely revert back to the mean or the norm. And that from a market perspective, that we would be in a terrific position to be able to capitalize on the business as it started to shift into these pro segments. We didn't expect that it'd be perfectly smooth, just waving in from one to another. But in fact, these pro businesses are showing terrific demand and we're excited to be in a position to be able to capitalize on those. We think the control distribution model that we have, we think the reps that we have, and even in these challenges \u2013 challenging times with some of the supply chain issues, that we're working closer with our customers and developing a level of loyalty that we've not seen before. Before throwing it to Al, I'll add just a couple of comments as to why I made those statements regarding the relationship with our customers. We stay very close to our customers, and right now we've just gotten some terrific feedback on the research, as it relates to our loyalty with our customers. As it speaks to the pro business, we've set records during these challenging times with our contractors highlighting our ability to respond and work with them during these challenging issues. And the fact that our reps and managers are there with them close to the customer has allowed us to be responsive to them, keep them in paint predominantly better than anyone else. And that combined with the demand we feel is going to position us to really come through this and exit this stronger than are today and got you.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Ghansham this is Al. On the raw material basket side, we are now saying that our third quarter is going to be the highest year-over-year. And that coming into the second quarter, we thought the second quarter will be higher year-over-year. So, a slight moderation there. But we also think the fourth quarter, we should see some moderation in raw materials. The costs are higher and industrial, but significant across all of our businesses. And that is why we were out with price increases across all businesses. We announced August 1 price increase in TAG, but we're out across all our businesses in all our regions to recoup this significant raw material inflation. And as you recall, we're going to see some short-term contraction and gross margin, but as pricing catches up with those raw material increases, we'll start to see a recovery. And then as raw materials, moderate, we'll start getting gross margin expansion going forward.\nGhansham Punjabi: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Ghansham.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Zekauskas: Hi. Thanks very much.\nAl Mistysyn: Good morning. \nJeff Zekauskas: Hi, good morning. I presume that there were raw material shortages that you endured in the quarter. Do you have an estimate of perhaps your lost sales because you didn't have sufficient raw materials? And when you think about your lost sales, how would you allocate it among the groups?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Jeff on a consolidated basis, we think the raw material shortages were a headwind of about 3.4% on the consolidated, and that was split pretty evenly between our TAG and our Consumer Brands segments. There was an immaterial impact on our Performance Coatings segment.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thank you for that. And in Consumer Brands is that the area where it's \u2013 where your raw material, your price raw material capture is likely to be slowest?\nJohn Morikis: Jeff, I think what \u2013 each of the consumer, each of the \u2013 we have a lot of different categories and businesses. I would say that the team has implemented pricing across all those categories, their price effectiveness is similar to where we're at in TAG, and there are more pricing that comes off that the additional raw material basket increases that we're seeing.\nAl Mistysyn: I'd say Jeff, from our perspective our actions are right in line. And in fact, our customers\u2019 response is pretty much in line with what we've expected. We've always said that we don't try to run for the perfect quarter. We're working with our customers on both the TAG consumer, while in the PCG side on how these price increases roll in. We will get the price increase and our goal is to do that in a way that allows us to retain the customers. And to do that we work with them, but we have absolute confidence in our ability to do both of those two to put the price in and keep the customers.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, the only other comment I would make on that, Jeff is on the lag, I think, if you look at the operating margin comparison versus last year, it's very difficult because of just the very high-volume strength we saw in the second quarter. But if you look at the first half our first half and consumer, our operating margin was still up almost 180 basis points versus the first half of 2019. So, I think because of the way the year rolled out, I think, a better comparison would be to the first half of 2019. And we've maintained that margin. And on a 3.5% sales increase in the first task versus first half of 2019.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you so much.\nAl Mistysyn: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. When we think about the various buckets for raw materials, whether it's resin, TiO2, or packaging, or what have you, I guess, as you look forward, are there ones where you expect to see relief? And can you speak to ones that you think look they are going to be sticky here for a while? Can you, can you help us to think about that?\nJim Jaye: Yes, sure John. When we look at the basket, what we saw in the second quarter was really the inflation was being driven by higher cost per monomer, resins, solvents, and packaging materials. As John mentioned, the inflation was highest in the Performance Coatings Group, given their greater exposure to that side. We did guide here that we think the third quarter is going to be the highest year-over-year, raw material inflation and only, modest relief maybe in the fourth quarter. So, I think a lot of those, that I just mentioned, are going to remain sticky. I'd say on the TiO2 side, that's been largely stable for the most part, a little bit of inflation, but not \u2013 that's not where we are seeing the pressure. So, it's going to continue to be a challenging environment on the raws. But as John mentioned and Al mentioned in their remarks, we're very committed on this pricing initiatives that we have. We've been very aggressive, we're out across the businesses. We feel very good about our ability to offset those dollars during the year.\nAl Mistysyn: I think if you look at historically where we've seen going back in time where the industry took a little bit of a delay in 2016 and the experience that we gained there, we've got a lot of leadership in this company that's been through that experience as well as others. And the determination that we have to stay ahead of there, I think, is visible right now, but the performance in our operating margins in Performance Coatings, reflecting the already aggressive actions that have taken place to offset that we're very committed to this. We're going to stay very focused and we believe we'll stay ahead of the pricing here.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Fair enough. And then maybe just as a follow-up, on the supply chain issues where either you lost some business, or couldn't meet the needs, or some of your competitors have, I guess, how should we think about the potential for share change? Is this something where you see it as temporary loss business or gain business, or is this something where it could be a little bit stickier? I guess, how should we be thinking about that as we look forward?\nJohn Morikis: I think you should look at it as we're going to win share gain during this time that there might have been some transactions, some projects or some element of a project that we might have lost, but as I mentioned just briefly a moment ago, our research is indicating the way in which we're handling this. And maybe I'll talk just briefly about that, the transparency in which we're working with our customers, the responsiveness that we're working with, our customers there have been, as Al mentioned, a little bit of a challenge in dealing with some of these customers. But we have great confidence in how we're responding and how we're dealing with our customers that lead us to believe in the customer stats scores that we're getting from our customers really indicate the fact that the way we're handling this is allowing us to come out of this with greater stickiness. The new account growth that we're experiencing right now. So, record year-to-date performance in new account activity. And we're stepping into this with customers. While we're opening new accounts with them, we're getting them at this point to try new products, and that trial in itself, down the road will lead to more projects with those customers. So, I've got great confidence that as we come out of this, you're going to see that same coiled spring that we've exited other challenging times uncoil. And we're going to accelerate that. You can see that not only in what I've talked about in the research, but as our competitors continue to close stores and close territories, and we continue to invest in a number of areas, we're going to take advantage of this market. And we actually, as difficult as these times are, these are the best times for our company. We expect to come out of this stronger.\nJohn McNulty: Great, thanks very much for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nBob Koort: Thank you. Good morning.\nJohn Morikis: Good morning Bob.\nBob Koort: John, I was hoping you could help us figure out the math to get that mid-teens inflation cover. Could you tell us what your raw materials are as a percentage of your total cogs?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Bob raw materials are about 80% to 85% of our paint costs. I would tell you we need to get about a 50% price increase. 50% of the raw material increase to cover the dollars. And my expectation is that we will cover the raw material, increases dollar for dollar in the full year. A little bit behind in the first half, catch it up in the second half, but full year we'll offset, raw material increase dollar to dollar.\nBob Koort: And then maybe dovetailing on John's question. I would guess as the largest paint company, certainly in North America, you did \u2013 were you able to leverage preferential supply relationships, so you had better availability, do you think than your competitors?\nJohn Morikis: Well, we work closely with our suppliers. And I think the approach that we're taking here is that many of them are in unique situations as well. We clearly have worked with our suppliers to put ourselves in a position to leverage our supply chain, working with them in a way that can accelerate our ability to serve our customers. So, on the one front from incoming raw materials, we're working closely with them. We're unique in the fact that we have our own fleet of vehicles. We have 860 tractors and 2,100 trailers that we use to expedite once we receive these raw materials into our plants. And in many cases right now, right from our plants to customer projects. So, it's the entire the entire supply chain Bob that we're working on to expedite, cut out as many days as possible and to serve our customers. And that transparency as we communicate to our customers is exactly why I mentioned earlier. We know that we're going to come out of this with share gains.\nAl Mistysyn: Hey, Bob. The only other thing I would add to that is really utilizing our global scale, our footprint, our global relationships to look for additional supply opportunities because, we're investing capital to have an additional 50 million gallons of capacity coming online over the next few quarters and where the demand environment is it's well above where our initial forecast for raw material supply would be coming into the season. So, as we can get additional raw materials, we'll convert those raw materials faster. And as we come out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter, you can expect we'll be building inventory. And going into the first quarter, also building additional inventory to get ready for the next selling season in 2020.\nBob Koort: Great. Thanks for the help.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Bob.\nOperator: The next question will be coming from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First on Performance Coatings, you all suggested that raw material inflation will be heaviest in this segment. Could you just help us gauge the magnitude of inflation in PCG versus your mid-teens company inflation guidance? And specifically in Performance Coatings, I know you're taking actions pricing actions, but when do you expect to get kind of price cost neutral on a dollar basis in that segment?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Truman, we talked about mid-teens, our industrial businesses, depending on the business would be in the high teens, maybe low 20s and then seeing some moderation in the fourth quarter. To talk about the price cost dynamic, I think, it's important to look at the first half operating margin, because it's a little bit of a goofy year last year. I think the team has done a tremendous job maintaining their first half operating margin in a significantly higher raw material cost environment in the first half. And it's the highest in the company as we've talked about. And they are working well with their customers to keep up with the strong demand while having to implement the selling price increases to offset that raw material inflation. And when you look at our first half adjusted operating margin, it's down just 10 basis points to the first half last year and down just a 40 basis points to the first half of 2019. And you put this in perspective if you look, go back to 2016, through 2018 in a raw material inflationary environment, that wasn't as significant as we're experiencing today. And our industrial operating margins declined significantly from 2016 through 2018 on a pro forma basis, including a full year of Valspar and Sherwin Williams. And then as we saw selling prices increase, and they caught up raw material inflation and raw materials, moderate, we finally started seeing operating margin expansion \u2013 in 2019. I think what's important, you asked this question at our financial community presentation and Justin answered it the right way. We have been more aggressive in getting priced into the market faster and at a higher pace than, as we've seen this raw material inflation. And we are getting leverage on a stronger volume. So along with our continuous improvement mindset and other actions that we're going to be taking, it gives us confidence in getting to the high teens to low 20s as we come out of this raw material inflation environment. So, how long this inflation lasts will dictate somewhat how long it's going to take us to get back our operating margins, but we are in a much better position today than we were in a few years ago.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Okay, thanks for that. And then on the Consumer Brands Group especially, well in North America, I'm just hoping you can help us work through some of the moving parts there, the supply chain constraints which are impacting sales, you all have the divestiture, it seems like the pro side of the business is healthy in North America, consumer trying to understand how core DIY demand trended through the quarter and how it plays into your full year guide it seems like the, at least the deceleration in DIY should start to improve as we move through the quarter. Just trying to understand some of the moving parts there.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Truman, let me just comment that we expect that DIY would return to more normal levels as the year progressed. And we were very confident in the other segments, particularly in TAG within commercial and property maintenance would more than offset that slowdown. So, yes, we took our Consumer Brands full year sales guidance down just to mid-to-high teens while taking the Americas Group up from low double digits to mid-teens. And you are absolutely right when you look at the comparison year-over-year, our second and third quarters are going to be the toughest. Our fourth quarter is going to get slightly better, but I think it's important to look at it from an architectural market perspective. I think if you look at the combined architectural business, we expected the first half to be low double digits. And we were right there with our Consumer and TAG businesses. We've said we expected our second half to be up mid-to-high single digits versus last year. And with our TAG and CBG sales guidance for the full year, second half is in that range. So, from an architectural perspective, we believe we positioned the company strategically to take advantage of the different shifts in the market to position us to capitalize on those shifts. And plus, when you look at the return of growth industrial, we're just really excited about our full year sales guidance to be up high single digits, to low double digit in a really turbulent market.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thank you, guys for the time and good luck in the upcoming quarter.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, Truman.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. And yes, impressive results, I guess, in the face of the raw material inflation. So, I guess just, I wanted to ask about overall market growth. You continue to do really well in resi repaint and it's setting you up for, as you just noted, kind of high single to low double digits in TAG. So, I guess next year you will be facing a tougher comp there you will be facing potentially a slightly more achievable comp in DIY and consumer and performance as well. So how are you thinking about kind of ongoing sales growth in your business? I mean, are we still kind of thinking that Sherwin is in a position to grow one and a half to two times the market in TAG? And then maybe Performance is more in line with kind of industrial production and then consumer kind of settles back into kind of 3% to 4% DIY kind of range. How are you thinking about the different segments as far as growth kind of on a more midterm basis?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Arun let me take a quick swipe here and then I'll throw it to Jim to give you some macro numbers. I would say that we absolutely agree with the projected growth rates to continue to exceed the market. And I'll remind you, you use res repaint as the tip of the spear in your conversation. We've had now five consecutive years of double-digit growth in residential repaint, we don't see that slowing down. In fact, our expectations of Heidi and our TAG organization is to continue to accelerate that growth. We're making, we believe, some terrific investments in that business stores, reps, products our digital platform a number of areas there that we continue to invest. Yes, in the face of adversity in some cases, but as I mentioned earlier, that's what we believe helps us to accelerate during these challenging times, particularly given some of the moves of our competitors. So, we're excited about the growth opportunities there to accelerate. And maybe I'll throw it to Jim to just talk about some of the macro numbers across the business. But when I look at the professional segments inside our TAG business, we're excited about each one of those. And before Jim kicks off, you also mentioned the PCG side. We have very high expectations for Justin Binns and his team. We've got some really good momentum there. Our focus here, we believe is unique. We try to bring differentiated products and solutions to our customers. And we believe that the combination of the Valspar, Sherwin technology portfolio is really starting to allow us to harvest some of the great work both companies had done individually in a way that's very unique and that's clearly visible throughout the different segments. Particularly if you look at automotive as an example, where we know that we're beating the market with the combined technology that the two companies have brought together. So, the idea of consumer reverting back into low single digits is probably a good model number to use. But we absolutely believe that our TAG and PCG businesses will be outpacing the market.\nJim Jaye: Yes, to John's point about residential repaint, you think about that, I\u2019ll remind you again, that that's, while it's our largest segment and TAG, it's also the space where we have the most opportunity to gain share. So, we feel really good about residential repaint. I think if you look at some of the market data, that's out there, it's very supportive. For example, existing home sales continue to be very strong. We look at the leading indicator remodeling activity that's accelerating into 2022. The remodeling market index is all time highs right now. So resi repaint no reason for us to think that that's not going to continue to be strong. On the new residential side, you are hearing news about labor and materials being a little bit of a governor, but, I think, that could have the effect of extending that cycle. And if you just look at the raw numbers on starts, they are still a lot very significantly year-over-year, both on single family and multifamily. You\u2019ve got historically flattish mortgage rates and consumer confidence still strong in household formations that we always talk about. So, on the new resi side, very good. Commercial, just touching on that for a second, that was our second fastest growing market in the quarter. And as we\u2019ve come out of COVID, vaccines are in place, people returning to work. Commercial has a lot of momentum right now, and you\u2019re seeing other indicators like the architectural billing index, for example, that are very supportive. So, we feel very, very good there. Even property management, as people returning to travel, returning to offices, is up very nicely in the quarter. And then maybe to close out with the industrial business, we look at a lot of different indicators, as you know, there\u2019s a lot of different divisions in that segment, but the manufacturing, the PMI is up in every region. We feel very good about that. And we\u2019ve often said, in regions outside of the U.S. our opportunities are huge for market share gains. So, we feel very good about continuing to outgrow the market in TAG and in our PCG business. And as we\u2019ve said, consumers probably going to start to return to a more normal environment.\nJohn Morikis: But I would add, even on the consumer side, we are committed. We believe that we can help our customers outperform the market. So, while it might revert back more into a normalized run rate, we want, and we\u2019ll be working in and investing with our customers to help them outpace that market. And we believe that we\u2019ve aligned ourselves very well with our customers. They share that desire to continue to grow market share. And we\u2019re investing in that business and believe that we can help them outpace the market as well.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe I could ask on the capital deployment side. It sounds like you\u2019ve completed some buyback activity, but that\u2019s still going to be your main use of cash. Is that accurate outside of your internal investments? I.e., is the M&A environment still showing very high valuations that are not attractive, or maybe just comment on your uses of cash from here?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Arun. I think we\u2019ve been very consistent in our capital allocation policy. As John talked about, the strong cash generation in the first half and the return of $1.9 billion to our shareholders in dividends and buybacks. And I think I want to make a point that we don\u2019t need to make acquisitions. I think I talked about this on our financial community presentation. And you look at our growth from 2019 to 2020, we\u2019ve averaged, that\u2019s a 2.3% compounded average growth rate, or $800 million. And we grew adjusted PBT, $640 million, 77% flow-through. Our operating margin is up strong. And so, I would say, we don\u2019t have a gun to our head. We\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities, for M&A and that fits our strategy. But I think it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019ll continue to invest in our long-term organic growth opportunities. And I think that\u2019s a great way to deploy cash. We talked about the architectural capacity improvements. We have packaging capacity increases coming and others, but I think we get more leverage on the organic growth than this just purely M&A, but absent M&A, we will buy our stock back in the second half.\nJohn Morikis: And I think it\u2019s a great response. And I also do want to put a little color on the M&A strategy that Al referred to. While we don\u2019t feel as though we have a gun to our head, we do think that there are opportunities out there. And we think that there are several deals that we\u2019re working on that could be completed this year, but they\u2019re going to be disciplined deals that we can bring value to our shareholders. We\u2019re not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere. We\u2019re looking proactively for targets that as Al mentioned, fit our strategy, and those would be areas that would fill necessary geographic gaps. We\u2019re not just throwing a dart at a map here trying to figure out where we\u2019re not. We could bring technology that can be leveraged across the platform or could fill a void of other types to help us serve our customers. So, we absolutely believe that there are M&A targets out there that are a good fit that we can get at the proper value in fairness to the sellers and to our shareholders. And meanwhile, we don\u2019t feel as though we\u2019re out there just trying to buy a book of business so that we could demonstrate growth. We have growth opportunities and we\u2019re actively pursuing those organically.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks a lot.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nDuffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning, fellas.\nJohn Morikis: Hey, Duffy.\nDuffy Fischer: First question is just around raw materials and this spikes a little bit different than just a straight supply demand tightening with the freeze in COVID. Is this doing anything to change your strategy on how you want to source raw materials, either integrating upstream more yourself to do more of the resins, diversifying producers, diversifying geographies? Should we expect to see any meaningful change structurally on that side?\nJohn Morikis: No, Duffy. We have a terrific and experienced team in both procurement and in technical, as well as our supply chain. And as you would expect with veterans that have 25-plus years of experience, we\u2019re looking at a lot of things differently. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s anything that we want to talk about right now. I don\u2019t think structurally you have to be concerned from a capital standpoint that we\u2019re changing the model of the business, but that you should expect and our customers should expect us to be thinking about how to protect them going forward, and we\u2019ll be taking those necessary steps. But I don\u2019t think that on a public call like this, we want to define what those steps are.\nDuffy Fischer: Fair enough. And then can you talk about both your ability and your customer\u2019s ability to attract new talent to hire people as we\u2019re growing into this, and then what you\u2019re seeing on labor inflation?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. I\u2019d say we have seen a slight uptick in some wage areas, some pressure, where we feel that pressure. We\u2019re taking the steps to secure what we believe to be our most important resource, our people. I\u2019ll remind you that we have a terrific turnover rate between 7% and 8% on average. So, we recruit and hire the right talent. We train them, we give them the resources to win, and then they become the reason for our success and we\u2019re very proud of our team. As a result of that and the fact that they have success in their career path, our people tend to stay. In fact, over a third of our employees have 10 or more years with the company and we think that\u2019s very important. So, while we\u2019re making some adjustments where necessary, we believe that they\u2019re the right investments to make. And we do believe that as a result of this retention, we\u2019re able to respond with experienced employees that can serve their customers. As far as the materiality of the moves that we\u2019re making to respond to this pressure, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s material in the sense from a modeling perspective, but we are taking the steps necessary. And in some cases, making the financial moves to recruit and retain the talent that we need.\nDuffy Fischer: Great. Thanks guys.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Duffy.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nMike Sison: Hey, guys. It sounds like the price of the paint can is going to be a lot higher this year and maybe the highest it\u2019s ever been. Just curious, given how high the inflationary environment has been, if our materials do fall, why do you feel? But it sounds like you feel pretty good that that you\u2019ll keep that pricing level and margins could expand really exponentially versus what we\u2019ve seen historically. And then any worries that that the price of the paint can is \u2013 could cause some demand destruction given? I know it\u2019s not the biggest part of a paint project, but just any thoughts there.\nJohn Morikis: Mike, I think what\u2019s important to remember is that the cost or the cost of the paint in a total project is a relatively small percentage, 80% to 85% of the painters\u2019 costs is in their labor. And so, we\u2019re moving and developing innovative products to help them offset that labor costs. And while many of them are able to hire and secure the talent that they need, many are bringing on new unskilled people in training them. And so, the cost of a good gallon of paint that can help them produce a nice finished product that their customers will enjoy, overall, it\u2019s relatively small percentage of their cost of goods. So, they are responding I think favorably to higher quality products. And just a moment ago, I talked about our labor and our willingness to hire, recruit and retain that talent and in some cases paying a little bit more. And we have to consider that as well as our labor as well as our customers. We look at that cost of the retention that I just described, and that gets factored into all the pricing decisions that we make. Our painting contractors are doing the same. And so, we\u2019re trying to offset some of their costs, the painters with higher efficient projects, through quality of products. And while we\u2019re trying to do the same to our customers, as we\u2019re experiencing some labor cost increases, we\u2019re trying to offset that with efficiencies in our plant, in our stores to minimize the impact of labor in price increases that we\u2019re out there seeking.\nAl Mistysyn: And Mike, we do believe we\u2019re in a similar environment that we were facing in 2010 through 2012, where we had to implement six price increases in a 22-month period that offset the significant raw material increases. But we continued to invest in our long-term growth opportunities, adding 160-plus new stores, adding over 260 reps in our North America paint stores over that three-year period as well as other customer solutions. And we did see the benefit in top line and bottom line as raw materials moderated from 2010 through 2016. North America paint stores grew volume high-single digits, which was a multiple of the market, and segment operating margin grew over \u2013 almost 700 basis points. And on a consolidated basis, we grew by a high-single-digit percentage and EBITDA margin increased almost 500 basis points. We expect to see similar types of results as we come out of this, but I think the key there is we continue to invest. So, we\u2019re willing to accept a little less leverage on SG&A, including in our second half this year. But I think it\u2019s important that we show our customers that in good and difficult times we\u2019re investing in their business to make them successful.\nMike Sison: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Mike, I\u2019m absolutely shocked that your first question wasn\u2019t about the Guardian name. You let me down there. Thanks for calling.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. John, Al, on our last question, if you just go back to that 2010-2012 time period, did we retain the entirety of those price increases when raw started coming off?\nAl Mistysyn: Let\u2019s say we retained the majority of them, David. As our customer base, especially you look at our largest segment, I\u2019ll use an example of residential repaint. Cost of a gallon of paint is 10% of their costs. And once they get those costs into their bids, they can pass that on. And especially, as John talked about moving customers up to higher quality products. And we do see a trend when we\u2019re in an inflationary environment that customers move to a higher quality product to get the benefits of the efficiencies, which way far outweighs the cost of that gallon of paint, even when you compare it to what they were using previously to the current product. So, we do expect to retain a majority of the price, not just on architectural, but also on industrial side of our business.\nJohn Morikis: But I think the important metric that we track closely is our ability to help our customers make more money. So, in that process, our entire focus \u2013 when you look at the investments that we\u2019re making, the services that we\u2019re providing, every gauge that we have, every resource that we do, it always ends up with are we helping you make more money. And that\u2019s an important metric in our decision-making.\nDavid Begleiter: Understood. And just on the price impact on the back half of the year, I think you gave us the expectation for TAG, but what are you expecting or how should we look at Consumer Brands\u2019 and Performance Coatings\u2019 price mix expectations in the back half of the year?\nJohn Morikis: As we\u2019ve talked about, David, it\u2019s a little harder to kind of look at the different businesses because even within the different categories within consumer, but you would expect to see a similar, right, you would expect to see a similar range within Consumer and a higher range in PCG just because of the raw material basket being higher on our industrial businesses. And it\u2019s just timing on industrial, as you know TAG is more uniformed and timing-wise when they go outprice, whereas in our industrial businesses by business by region are staggered across different timelines, but you could expect to see a higher cadence for our industrial businesses in the second half.\nDavid Begleiter: Got it. Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Unlike some of your peers when this inflationary environment really started escalate, you made the decision to basically send the message to your pro contractors that you weren\u2019t going to raise price for a few months. Was that decision to drive loyalty being that many of them had already won contracts and had a price assumption in those contracts and so forth? Was that part of that decision? And if so, do you think that it was successful? Do you think that you gained market share among that pro contractor customer base because of that decision?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, with great certainty. And I would do that 100% of the time. I do it again tomorrow. And if we have to in the future, we\u2019d likely take the same approach. Our loyalty and our ability to even execute the effective price increase with our customers increases dramatically as a result of that, so, without question.\nSteve Byrne: And John, you also made a comment earlier about backlog from your contractors was robust. Can you quantify that? Do you have data that would compare that backlog today versus say where it was a couple of years ago? Is it meaningfully different?\nJohn Morikis: We do. We have a CRM system that we use, proprietor we built and we do keep an eye on that. It is a very strong period in backlog and we\u2019re not going to share any more detail on the specifics, but I speak with great confidence in the backlog.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions.\nKevin McCarthy: Thank you. John, in your prepared remarks, you made a comment that new account activity is up nearly 30% in the first half of the year. Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to long-term historical averages, for example? And is there any way to translate that level, record level of new account activity into what it might mean for future volumes or future share gains, for example?\nJohn Morikis: I\u2019ll give you a little color. We\u2019re not going to get into any specifics on the metrics or conversion, but I would tell you that it is a very high, very high number in comparison. I would say that our teams, our TAG leadership all the way through to those that are closest to our customers are doing a fantastic job. And one of the questions has to be how are you doing this given some of the shortages in raw materials. And the fact is, is that we\u2019ve been very open with our approach compared to our competitors. And we were out early with transparency. I\u2019d think many of our competitors were in denial. At first some of our competitors were asking, why no one else is telling me that. In fact, some of them said it might be a week or two. And we were out with very truthful with our customers as to what we expect. And I give our procurement team and our supply chain team great credit for the courage that it took to come in to this boardroom that we\u2019re in today and explain how this was going to fall out and how quickly our commercial teams took that to the market, face-to-face with our customers with full transparency to help them run their business. And the reason that I say that and why I think that\u2019s important is that while many of our competitors were in this denial and may have felt that they were going to be at a competitive advantage for whatever reason, ultimately from a customer\u2019s perspective they lost credibility. And our teams now are out talking to customers who may in the past have had loyalty that kept them from using other suppliers. Suddenly we\u2019re getting \u2013 the phones getting answered and we\u2019re helping our people to be in front of those customers that offer that terrific opportunity. Now, as I mentioned, right now we might be just simply in the trial mode because the supply chain issues are real and we\u2019re taking care of our existing customers with great focus. And we\u2019re able to talk to these new customers about the alternate supply and the importance of that and getting them to try product. In some cases, it\u2019s simply in the back of our own stores, and some cases, it\u2019s one room on a project, but we know with great certainty that this is the most important step in the process. And this trial is an exciting step and we look forward to a greater conversion going forward. So earlier I was asked, do we feel as though we\u2019re going to come out of this with market share gains. And I hope everyone heard the confidence in which I answered that because I\u2019ve got terrific respect for our leadership team and all the way down to the part-timers that are in our store, that are in front of these customers, introducing new products and new solutions that are going to help these customers make more money. And we\u2019re determined to do just that.\nKevin McCarthy: Thank you for that. My second question relates to Performance Coatings. If we look across the major categories there, packaging, wood, coil, refinish, general industrial, et cetera, can you give us a sense for which of those businesses have grown the most versus pre-pandemic levels and which might remain the most depressed, such that you have more potential for rebound going forward?\nJohn Morikis: That\u2019s a really interesting question. I\u2019d say that the way I might answer that is that we see terrific growth in all of them. If I may, I could just spin through those quickly. In the packaging business, we do believe that the unique technology that we\u2019ve brought to market will help us to continue to grow. Al mentioned the CapEx that we\u2019re putting into this business. We are investing along with our customers in additional capacity, and we think that our V70 is a very unique product. It\u2019s a plug and \u2013 a product with plug and play performance. It\u2019s easily adopted onto existing can-making equipment and helps our customers with speed. So, the efficiency of the application is terrific. It gives great flavor protection to products, both food and beverage, and it\u2019s really the next generation of the non-BPA technology. So, it\u2019s \u2013 and I\u2019m taking packaging first and getting into a little bit more depth because while it\u2019s easy to talk to that model, it\u2019s the same model that we\u2019re using in every segment to help differentiate our teams from our competitors. So, when you look at GI as an example or industrial wood, we\u2019re looking at not only the technology, but the supply chain, how do we take \u2013 the time that it takes to get product and whittle that down to what might have been weeks into days. And instead of thousands of gallons of required orders to 50 gallons or 100 gallons to put them in business faster with less working capital. Our coil businesses are doing a fantastic job of introducing technology and speed. Our automotive, I talked earlier about the combined technologies between the Sherwin and Valspar technology. That\u2019s helping throughput with each of their customers to be able to be more productive. In our protective and marine business to get assets more \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, to get assets back in play faster. So, when you asked that question, quite honestly, it\u2019s hard to answer which offers the greatest opportunities. If Justin Binns was in the room with me right now, I\u2019d look him in the eye and I\u2019d tell him I have expectations for every one of those businesses to grow and grow excessively and at the expense of our competitors. That\u2019s what I would tell them.\nKevin McCarthy: Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nP.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning or good afternoon, I should say.\nJohn Morikis: Hey, P.J.\nP.J. Juvekar: And I\u2019m looking at the industrial businesses so far of two of your competitors and their margins are much lower. Your margins kind of held up. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re presumably impacted by the same shortages of raw materials like epoxies and isocyanides. Is your impact likely to be delayed into 3Q or are there other factors that offset your raw material impact?\nJohn Morikis: I think I\u2019ll start and maybe turn it to Al if I miss anything. I think part of it is mix of business. We\u2019ve been very selective in our strategy on what we pursue. And we pursue businesses that are interested in coatings and solutions that will help them make more money, not necessarily just commodities. So, you\u2019re not going to see us in areas where it\u2019s just that commodities. So, we\u2019ve actually walked away from some of those businesses and we\u2019ve focused on areas that are more high value. So, we often talk about bridge and highway, you\u2019re going to see us on the high-value bridge area as an example as opposed to other areas that are just low-margin commodities. And I think that plays an important part in the alignment and our approach is just that. We want to be partners with our customers, help them to be more successful. And in return, they understand that our ability to serve them and make them successful comes at a cost to us and our shareholders and we\u2019re sharing that reward. Al, anything else you\u2019d like to add to that?\nAl Mistysyn: The only thing I would say, P.J., is we would expect to see sequential improvement in our Performance Coatings segment operating margin through the second half. Even though we\u2019re going to go up against a tougher comp second half versus the first half, it\u2019s still we\u2019re seeing strong volume as our sales return to a more \u2013 what I would say a more consistent or normal levels quarter-to-quarter. So, our full-year sales guidance of up low 20s percentage implies that back half in the high teens. We talked about the third quarter being up high teens to low 20s. So \u2013 and it\u2019s about the strong volume getting leverage on SG&A, but it\u2019s also the commitment that this team has made to getting price into the market timely and aggressively to offset those raw material \u2013 that raw material inflation. And like I said earlier, this is not \u2013 we learned a lot in 2016, 2017, 2018 that, that this team is now delivering on and executing from that learning. So, I think we\u2019re doing a great job.\nJohn Morikis: I\u2019m not going to revisit that.\nAl Mistysyn: No.\nP.J. Juvekar: Great. Great. And then my second question is, can you talk about your digital efforts that may have accelerated through the pandemic? How much of your contractor customers are ordering online and getting the paint delivered to the job site? Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re seeing strong utilization and I would say an increase in all the metrics in the categories that we track. And the platform, I\u2019d say, is providing a service option that makes our pros more efficient in utilizing all our resources. So unlike others who might be trying a digital platform as the model, ours is unique and that it brings everything to bear. So, we want our customers utilizing our stores, our reps, and the platform and we believe that the model that we have is very unique and how it encapsulates all of that into one offering. This platform that we \u2013 so we\u2019re not going to talk specifically about sales on platform \u2013 on the digital platform versus in the store or by phone or through the rep. Quite frankly, we don\u2019t discriminate against any of those orders. We\u2019ll take them all. We want them utilizing any resource every platform that they feel as comfortable. What we\u2019re trying to do is make it easier for them. So, this digital platform will allow them access to their pricing, their projects, their orders and they can conduct business with us 24/7 through the platform. And if they prefer to come into the store and have a cup coffee with their best friend behind the counter, we encourage that as well.\nP.J. Juvekar: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, P.J.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. John, on the Guardians, I don\u2019t think Cloverdale/Rodda uses the Guardian brand at all in Ohio, so maybe there is an opportunity there.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. There might be. I don\u2019t know about that. Only that where do the Guardians go, John? Now, they came from John Roberts, not John Morikis, everyone.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. Is it unusual in the June quarter for interior to be larger than exterior? And was that a mix headwind in the quarter since exterior is typically more expensive than interior?\nJohn Morikis: No, John, I would say kind of that mix return to a more normal level. I think typically we start off interior and exterior maybe 4 to 1 in the out quarters, where the exterior in the Midwest and East are less prevalent. And then as you get to the two middle quarters, it trends to closer to 3 to 1 to 2.5 to 1. And I think we ended the quarter closer to 2.5 to 1 on volume.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. And then trucking constraints were cited as a big headwind by some of your competitors. Were you able to use the trucking fleet in many different ways here to help mitigate the shortage of that? I know you pick up some of your raw materials that you distribute, but I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re able to pick up other raw materials and somehow mitigate freight as an issue?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, we were. And we plan to continue to use them as creatively as possible, just as we do every asset. And John, this has given us an opportunity and we have a terrific leader in Joe Sladek that runs our Global Supply Chain, whose team has been really creative. So, it\u2019s not just the tractors and trailers, which is a great question that you\u2019re asking, but we\u2019re using our distribution centers or that manufacturing, our stores, everything in a very unique fashion. And some of this has been on the fly and we\u2019ve continued to improve in our ability to do that. And again, we\u2019ll come out of this better as a result that we\u2019re learning a lot about our supply chain and our ability is to be able to leverage it. And we\u2019ll will be better coming out of this as a result.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. Thank you. Nice quarter.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions.\nMike Harrison: Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk about the consumer strength that you were seeing in Europe and Asia. Is that a product of DIY remaining stronger for longer in those regions or were the comps easier? I also know that you\u2019ve made some changes in your strategic approach to those international markets, but maybe comment on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of demand trends internationally in the consumer business.\nJohn Morikis: John \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Mike, I did say that it\u2019s a little bit of everything. Certainly, the region particularly in China, if you look at the double-digit decline in 2000 [ph] largely related to COVID, it had an impact on us. I will point out that we did improve profits, even in that kind of environment. So, in China, we continue to focus on the volume growth with the recovery further defining our operating model in that region. We had a strong half in 2021. We\u2019re not going to give guidance by business, but this is, as I\u2019ve said before, an area that we\u2019re looking long term. I wouldn\u2019t suspect that next quarter this business is going to move the needle one way or the other. But if you look next decade, it might. And so that\u2019s the way we\u2019re running this business and we have expectations for Brian Padden and his team to continue to really drive through the strategic decisions that we\u2019re making there. And we\u2019re looking long term there. In Europe, I\u2019d say we continue to build around our Kingfisher relationship. The team in Europe has delivered a double-digit increase in 2020, so comparisons are a little bit more challenging here in 2021. And we did have a very strong start in 2021. We have terrific leaders here in Europe, one of whom we just brought to the U.S. to take a very important role for us. He did such a wonderful job there and very strong leader. And again, speaks to the depth, we have a leader who is going to backfill him, that\u2019s very strong as well. So, I think both of these businesses are relatively small in nature, but good opportunities for us and we\u2019re managing accordingly.\nMike Harrison: All right. Thanks. And then I also wanted to ask about inventory levels at big-box retailers. If we were able to look at the point-of-sale data, is that pretty similar to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the consumer business revenue decline? Are you seeing retailers still working to restock or is there actually some destocking happening as the DIY demand is normalizing?\nJohn Morikis: Mike, I\u2019d prefer that our customers talk to their plans as it relates to inventory. I will say that we are working hard and will be working hard to the balance of the year to continue to improve our ability to serve them. So, it\u2019s a very important focus of ours. Al mentioned the incremental investments that we\u2019ve made to bring on about 50 million gallons of capacity. That certainly will help this business as well. But as it relates to their inventory decisions and what they do, I don\u2019t know that, that\u2019s appropriate for us to comment on. But I would tell you that we\u2019re working hard to be able to continue to improve our position with them should they decide to pull in more inventory going forward.\nMike Harrison: All right. Thanks very much.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nVincent Andrews: Hi, thanks. Just \u2013 point, in the past you\u2019ve talked about equipment sales in the stores business as a potential indicator of backlog. Is that trending in line with your expectations or is anything reflecting in that?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, it is double-digit growth. We speak \u2013 we think it speaks to the confidence that our painters have. So, we\u2019re excited about it. Yes.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. And actually just \u2013 any issues with any customers coming to you about labor availability, the season just given kind of hearing that across the board, or anything with the painters?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, I\u2019d say labor continues to be a discussion in nearly every market that I\u2019ve been in. As Jim mentioned in one of his responses, we feel as though that is serving as a bit of a governor. And I\u2019ll point out that while labor is an issue, I believe every professional segment in TAG had a double-digit gain. So, they\u2019re finding a way to continue to grow but it is an issue. And again, all of these challenges, all of this adversity, we don\u2019t ask for this adversity, but it does play to our advantage. It does allow us to serve our customers in a way that helps them through these challenges. If they run short on people or have to move from one project to other \u2013 another, any of that turmoil on the part of our customer, please write to the rep that\u2019s there, working with that customer or the store manager locally that has the capability to serve that customer. So labor is an issue. It\u2019s one of many and we try to work with our customers in a way that can help them make more money working through it.\nVincent Andrews: Appreciate it. Thanks very much.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. My question was on the comp sales trend. If you look at the deceleration, I think it was from 16% to your \u2013 to around 12% in the second quarter, is that really all just the supply availability of raws? Was that the main reason for the deceleration?\nAl Mistysyn: You\u2019re talking on TAG, Greg, correct?\nGreg Melich: Yes, talking on TAG, specifically, the two-year stack.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, I think part of it is we\u2019ve had a tougher comp. If you look at our \u2013 if you look at the way our 2019 unfolded, we kind of had a better second quarter. And then when you look at the way we had 2020, we had headwinds in the second quarter. Yes, we talked about a 3.4% headwind in raw material availability in our second quarter that impacted us. So, it\u2019s kind of a \u2013 I hate to use the term wonky, but the way the two-year stack came out, it was kind of a little bit wonky. And you look at two-year \u2013 first half 2021 versus first half 2019 up 14%, and some prices for that, but it\u2019d be primarily volume.\nGreg Melich: Got it. So then maybe the second, the follow-on to that is if we look at your guidance, it looks like you\u2019re expecting that two-year trend to reaccelerate maybe not all the way back to 2016, but get back a couple of 100 basis points so then stocks get better and as pricing goes through, is that fair?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, there is that and I think if you looked at it on the pro segment would even be a little bit better\nJohn Morikis: Yes, we expect to gain share.\nGreg Melich: Got it. That\u2019s great. Thanks. Good luck, guys.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your questions.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just one quick one from me. Just if you look at your commercial business in TAG, can you maybe walk through some of the kind of end market verticals and what was strongest, what was maybe still struggling, that would be helpful?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, I'd say we're seeing strength in quite a few areas. The hospitality area, schools, tilt-up, warehousing is really going well. Trying to think of areas that are really soft. Nothing comes to my mind, truly in areas that are really soft, I'd say, they're all growing in \u2013 lot of tilt-up, lot of warehousing, lot of expansion, medical, healthcare is expanding, some just more than others, Adam.\nAdam Baumgarten: Got it. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nJohn Morikis: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your questions.\nGarik Shmois: Great, thanks. Just one from me. Just, are you seeing any early signs of the impact of the Delta variant, any change in how homeowners are inviting in contractors or pro painters?\nJohn Morikis: No. Our res repaint business is \u2013 it\u2019s really hot and we\u2019ve not seen that at all.\nGarik Shmois: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nEric Bosshard: Thank you. Two things. First of all, that to your consumer growth improves in the second half somewhat notably relative to the second quarter, what\u2019s different in the second half in that business or what was more of a drag in 2Q that doesn\u2019t persist in the second half?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Eric. I think the raw material availability impacted us when I said evenly \u2013 3.4% on a consolidated, pretty evenly on a dollar that does impact consumer a little bit more. So, we\u2019d expect to see a little bit better progress or a little less headwind there. As they\u2019re chasing raw material cost pricing and higher pricing in their second half or our second quarter will be realized. And I think what we expect as we bring more capacity on and we get more raw materials, we\u2019ll be able to supply our customers in a better fashion.\nEric Bosshard: Okay, thank you. And then secondly, John, you talked about price leadership in stores and great not surprising to see that. The question is in regards to realization. Seeing it\u2019s a unique period of inflation with raws, can there be a path to upside realization on these price increases relative to the historic amount of realization or does the realizations schedule look like it has in years past, even though it\u2019s a different period of time?\nJohn Morikis: Eric, it might. I mean, I\u2019d say, our approach to the pricing has been very well received by our customers and the response that I said earlier about 100% of the times I would do this exactly as we rolled it out. So, it could, but there is also a lot of pressure in the market right now. So, what we\u2019re trying to do is put our teams in a position to be able to serve their customers, to help facilitate that price effectiveness. And we\u2019ll see. I mean, we\u2019re going to work hard at it, but I can\u2019t with 100% certainty tell you that I could project that number. I could tell you that we\u2019re working very hard to work with our customers to help them to be successful and in turn, our shareholders are rewarded. That\u2019s our model.\nEric Bosshard: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nKevin Hocevar: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. On the \u2013 Al, I wanted to revisit \u2013 I think you had mentioned that you have an expectation of price cost to be neutral for the full year with tailwinds in the back half offsetting the headwinds in the first half. Given the inflation you\u2019re expecting in 3Q and kind of the timing of pricing phasing in, is the third quarter still a drag on that or you\u2019d expect that to get to neutral and kind of basically all the benefits coming in the fourth quarter? Or how do you expect that to kind of phase in? And then I guess I just wanted to reconcile those comments with \u2013 I believe you guys also mentioned that gross margins in the back half of the year should be \u2013 you expect those to be weaker than the front half. So why would that be given if price cost should be a nice tailwind in the front half versus the headwind in the \u2013 sorry, nice tailwind in the back half versus the headwind in the front half?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, I think, Kevin, you will start getting on top of it in the third quarter, not only in the TAG price increase that was announced, but across all the businesses in segments. We\u2019ll start getting on top of it and then pick up more ground in the fourth quarter. The comparison gets much more difficult in our second half, if you look at adjusted gross margin in our first half 2020 was 46.9%, it grows to 47.8% in the second half. So, you have that headwind. And also, you have our customer mix. As I talked about before, when we look at the combined architectural businesses, DIY starts returning to more normal levels, and a question last year I answered, that was about a basis \u2013 100-basis points impact on our last year numbers that we saw. More so starting in the second quarter, but more so in the second half that as that returns to more normal, that\u2019ll be a headwind. So that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see as much traction as you would think in our second half on gross margin.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. That make sense. And then the sales that are \u2013 you mentioned that we\u2019re lost to 3% \u2013 3.5 or so percent in the quarter, do you view those as deferred that could be made up in future periods or do you view those more as being lost?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, believe they\u2019re deferred. I think the projects are there. John talked a lot about the demand and the strength we\u2019re seeing there across all the segments. So, I think the teams in the field are working very closely with our customers and moving products around, but I think that\u2019s deferred, not lost necessarily.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call over to John Morikis for closing remarks.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Thank you. And first, let me just start by reminding everyone that Jim and Eric will be available for the rest of day and tomorrow if you have some questions. I did ask for the opportunity to close out today\u2019s call just to pull out a couple of really important points, at least in my mind. First, that we\u2019re really proud of the terrific first half that we\u2019ve had, but we\u2019re not complacent. This isn\u2019t an organization that pops corks over what\u2019s happened. We\u2019re more focused on what has to happen. So, we\u2019re determined to continue to get better, but we\u2019re really pleased with the first half. So, I want to thank our teams for the wonderful work that they\u2019re doing. We are in a strong market with terrific demand and our goal is to outpace that demand in the market with growth that exceeds the market\u2019s position. We do believe we\u2019re positioned to capitalize on this demand, wherever it presents itself. I mentioned earlier about the utilization of our assets, if it\u2019s our factories, our stores, our reps, our digital platform, the fleet that we talked about, we do believe we\u2019re uniquely positioned and very determined. We are experiencing these raw material cost increases from an industry-wide availability issue and we think that this team of leaders that we have who have been experienced with similar cycles, it may have been natural disasters or financial crisis, COVID, whatever it might be, now here with raw materials that this seasoned and experienced team knows what to do and have the conviction to do it and we\u2019re proud of them. All of this has us confident in our ability to come through this with greater market share, as I mentioned earlier, stronger relationships and better positioned for future growth. And so, we\u2019re excited. This is a challenging year, but we\u2019re excited about our position and our ability to leverage this challenging year in the shareholder value and growth for our company. Lot of determination to do it. So, thank you all for your interest in our company, know that where we\u2019re out here determined to do better and convinced that we can. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Al Mistysyn",
            "content": "Thanks, Ghansham this is Al. On the raw material basket side, we are now saying that our third quarter is going to be the highest year-over-year. And that coming into the second quarter, we thought the second quarter will be higher year-over-year. So, a slight moderation there. But we also think the fourth quarter, we should see some moderation in raw materials. The costs are higher and industrial, but significant across all of our businesses. And that is why we were out with price increases across all businesses. We announced August 1 price increase in TAG, but we're out across all our businesses in all our regions to recoup this significant raw material inflation. And as you recall, we're going to see some short-term contraction and gross margin, but as pricing catches up with those raw material increases, we'll start to see a recovery. And then as raw materials, moderate, we'll start getting gross margin expansion going forward. Good morning. I'd say Jeff, from our perspective our actions are right in line. And in fact, our customers' response is pretty much in line with what we've expected. We've always said that we don't try to run for the perfect quarter. We're working with our customers on both the TAG consumer, while in the PCG side on how these price increases roll in. We will get the price increase and our goal is to do that in a way that allows us to retain the customers. And to do that we work with them, but we have absolute confidence in our ability to do both of those two to put the price in and keep the customers. Thank you, Jeff. I think if you look at historically where we've seen going back in time where the industry took a little bit of a delay in 2016 and the experience that we gained there, we've got a lot of leadership in this company that's been through that experience as well as others. And the determination that we have to stay ahead of there, I think, is visible right now, but the performance in our operating margins in Performance Coatings, reflecting the already aggressive actions that have taken place to offset that we're very committed to this. We're going to stay very focused and we believe we'll stay ahead of the pricing here. Yes, Bob raw materials are about 80% to 85% of our paint costs. I would tell you we need to get about a 50% price increase. 50% of the raw material increase to cover the dollars. And my expectation is that we will cover the raw material, increases dollar for dollar in the full year. A little bit behind in the first half, catch it up in the second half, but full year we'll offset, raw material increase dollar to dollar. Hey, Bob. The only other thing I would add to that is really utilizing our global scale, our footprint, our global relationships to look for additional supply opportunities because, we're investing capital to have an additional 50 million gallons of capacity coming online over the next few quarters and where the demand environment is it's well above where our initial forecast for raw material supply would be coming into the season. So, as we can get additional raw materials, we'll convert those raw materials faster. And as we come out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter, you can expect we'll be building inventory. And going into the first quarter, also building additional inventory to get ready for the next selling season in 2020. Yes, Truman, we talked about mid-teens, our industrial businesses, depending on the business would be in the high teens, maybe low 20s and then seeing some moderation in the fourth quarter. To talk about the price cost dynamic, I think, it's important to look at the first half operating margin, because it's a little bit of a goofy year last year. I think the team has done a tremendous job maintaining their first half operating margin in a significantly higher raw material cost environment in the first half. And it's the highest in the company as we've talked about. And they are working well with their customers to keep up with the strong demand while having to implement the selling price increases to offset that raw material inflation. And when you look at our first half adjusted operating margin, it's down just 10 basis points to the first half last year and down just a 40 basis points to the first half of 2019. And you put this in perspective if you look, go back to 2016, through 2018 in a raw material inflationary environment, that wasn't as significant as we're experiencing today. And our industrial operating margins declined significantly from 2016 through 2018 on a pro forma basis, including a full year of Valspar and Sherwin Williams. And then as we saw selling prices increase, and they caught up raw material inflation and raw materials, moderate, we finally started seeing operating margin expansion \u2013 in 2019. I think what's important, you asked this question at our financial community presentation and Justin answered it the right way. We have been more aggressive in getting priced into the market faster and at a higher pace than, as we've seen this raw material inflation. And we are getting leverage on a stronger volume. So along with our continuous improvement mindset and other actions that we're going to be taking, it gives us confidence in getting to the high teens to low 20s as we come out of this raw material inflation environment. So, how long this inflation lasts will dictate somewhat how long it's going to take us to get back our operating margins, but we are in a much better position today than we were in a few years ago. Yes, Arun. I think we've been very consistent in our capital allocation policy. As John talked about, the strong cash generation in the first half and the return of $1.9 billion to our shareholders in dividends and buybacks. And I think I want to make a point that we don't need to make acquisitions. I think I talked about this on our financial community presentation. And you look at our growth from 2019 to 2020, we've averaged, that's a 2.3% compounded average growth rate, or $800 million. And we grew adjusted PBT, $640 million, 77% flow-through. Our operating margin is up strong. And so, I would say, we don't have a gun to our head. We'll continue to look for opportunities, for M&A and that fits our strategy. But I think it's important to note that we'll continue to invest in our long-term organic growth opportunities. And I think that's a great way to deploy cash. We talked about the architectural capacity improvements. We have packaging capacity increases coming and others, but I think we get more leverage on the organic growth than this just purely M&A, but absent M&A, we will buy our stock back in the second half. And Mike, we do believe we're in a similar environment that we were facing in 2010 through 2012, where we had to implement six price increases in a 22-month period that offset the significant raw material increases. But we continued to invest in our long-term growth opportunities, adding 160-plus new stores, adding over 260 reps in our North America paint stores over that three-year period as well as other customer solutions. And we did see the benefit in top line and bottom line as raw materials moderated from 2010 through 2016. North America paint stores grew volume high-single digits, which was a multiple of the market, and segment operating margin grew over \u2013 almost 700 basis points. And on a consolidated basis, we grew by a high-single-digit percentage and EBITDA margin increased almost 500 basis points. We expect to see similar types of results as we come out of this, but I think the key there is we continue to invest. So, we're willing to accept a little less leverage on SG&A, including in our second half this year. But I think it's important that we show our customers that in good and difficult times we're investing in their business to make them successful. Thanks, Mike. Let's say we retained the majority of them, David. As our customer base, especially you look at our largest segment, I'll use an example of residential repaint. Cost of a gallon of paint is 10% of their costs. And once they get those costs into their bids, they can pass that on. And especially, as John talked about moving customers up to higher quality products. And we do see a trend when we're in an inflationary environment that customers move to a higher quality product to get the benefits of the efficiencies, which way far outweighs the cost of that gallon of paint, even when you compare it to what they were using previously to the current product. So, we do expect to retain a majority of the price, not just on architectural, but also on industrial side of our business. The only thing I would say, P.J., is we would expect to see sequential improvement in our Performance Coatings segment operating margin through the second half. Even though we're going to go up against a tougher comp second half versus the first half, it's still we're seeing strong volume as our sales return to a more \u2013 what I would say a more consistent or normal levels quarter-to-quarter. So, our full-year sales guidance of up low 20s percentage implies that back half in the high teens. We talked about the third quarter being up high teens to low 20s. So \u2013 and it's about the strong volume getting leverage on SG&A, but it's also the commitment that this team has made to getting price into the market timely and aggressively to offset those raw material \u2013 that raw material inflation. And like I said earlier, this is not \u2013 we learned a lot in 2016, 2017, 2018 that, that this team is now delivering on and executing from that learning. So, I think we're doing a great job. No. You're talking on TAG, Greg, correct? Yes, I think part of it is we've had a tougher comp. If you look at our \u2013 if you look at the way our 2019 unfolded, we kind of had a better second quarter. And then when you look at the way we had 2020, we had headwinds in the second quarter. Yes, we talked about a 3.4% headwind in raw material availability in our second quarter that impacted us. So, it's kind of a \u2013 I hate to use the term wonky, but the way the two-year stack came out, it was kind of a little bit wonky. And you look at two-year \u2013 first half 2021 versus first half 2019 up 14%, and some prices for that, but it'd be primarily volume. Yes, there is that and I think if you looked at it on the pro segment would even be a little bit better Yes, Eric. I think the raw material availability impacted us when I said evenly \u2013 3.4% on a consolidated, pretty evenly on a dollar that does impact consumer a little bit more. So, we'd expect to see a little bit better progress or a little less headwind there. As they're chasing raw material cost pricing and higher pricing in their second half or our second quarter will be realized. And I think what we expect as we bring more capacity on and we get more raw materials, we'll be able to supply our customers in a better fashion. Yes, I think, Kevin, you will start getting on top of it in the third quarter, not only in the TAG price increase that was announced, but across all the businesses in segments. We'll start getting on top of it and then pick up more ground in the fourth quarter. The comparison gets much more difficult in our second half, if you look at adjusted gross margin in our first half 2020 was 46.9%, it grows to 47.8% in the second half. So, you have that headwind. And also, you have our customer mix. As I talked about before, when we look at the combined architectural businesses, DIY starts returning to more normal levels, and a question last year I answered, that was about a basis \u2013 100-basis points impact on our last year numbers that we saw. More so starting in the second quarter, but more so in the second half that as that returns to more normal, that'll be a headwind. So that's why you don't see as much traction as you would think in our second half on gross margin. Yes, believe they're deferred. I think the projects are there. John talked a lot about the demand and the strength we're seeing there across all the segments. So, I think the teams in the field are working very closely with our customers and moving products around, but I think that's deferred, not lost necessarily. Thanks, Kevin."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Let me begin by framing my comments with some key themes. First, demand is very strong across the majority of our business, and we are aggressively pursuing growth opportunities. Two, while industry supply chain constraints are continuing to impact production and sales nobody has more assets and capabilities than Sherwin-Williams to keep their customers in paint and on the job. Three, we are aggressively combating raw material inflation with significant price actions across each of our businesses. We will continue to do so as necessary. And last, we've seen this movie before, there is no better or more experienced team in the industry to manage through the current environment. We remain extremely confident, we will emerge from these current challenges, a stronger company with stronger customer relationships and with continued strong value creation for our shareholders. My deep thanks goes to all 61,000 members of our team who are doing an amazing job in some pretty challenging circumstances right now. Jim did a nice job of framing up the second quarter at a high level. In a moment, I'll get into some additional color for each of our segments. But first, I'd like to make a comment on our first half. Given the impact of the pandemic on our results in the second quarter, a year ago, 2021 first half consolidated sales increased 14.7% or $1.29 billion. Adjusted PBT increased 23.5% or $303.3 million. Adjusted PBT margin was up 120 basis points to 15.9% of sales. And adjusted diluted net income was $4.71 per share, an increase of 26.6%. This is a very strong performance, especially in light of the much higher than anticipated raw material inflation we've seen and the supply chain challenges we've described. Now we turn into the segment performance in the quarter. In the Americas Group, second quarter sales increased to 22.6%. The impact of unfavorable currency translation was not material. Same-store sales in the U.S. and Canada were up 19.3%. We generated strong double-digit growth across all of our pro end markets in TAG in the second quarter. Residential repaint, TAG's largest business was the fastest growing and we expect this momentum to continue. Contractors are reporting solid backlogs, and interior and exterior work were both strong. Our commercial business was the next fastest growing and as gaining momentum as we expected. Projects continue to resume at varying paces and comparisons are favorable over the remainder of the year. Property maintenance is also gaining momentum. Apartment turns or return to travel and office and a favorable comparison, all contributed to our growth. We expect to see continuing improvements as the year progresses. New residential remained another area of strength for us. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer, and customers are reporting solid order rates. We're also encouraged by growth in our protective and marine business. We saw a return to growth with oil and gas customers and continued strength in flooring, bridge and highway, and pharmaceutical applications. And finally, as expected, our DIY business was down significantly after five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Notably, all TAG architectural businesses delivered growth over the second quarter of 2019. From a product perspective, sales in both interior and exterior paint were up by double-digit percentages with interior being the larger part of the mix. Additionally, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of spray equipment sales increased by double digits. This continues to be a very healthy sign of recovery as contractors typically invest in this type of equipment in anticipation of solid demand. We realized nearly 2.5% of price in the second quarter resulting from our February 1 price increase. Given the persistent raw material inflation we are experiencing, TAG announced an additional 7% price increase last month, that will be effective August 1. We would expect the combination of these February and August price increases to result in a mid-single-digit percentage of price in the third quarter, and better than that in the fourth quarter, putting our full year price realization for TAG in the mid-single-digit range. We will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed. We opened 23 net new stores in the quarter and have opened 34 net new stores year-to-date. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity enhancing services to drive additional growth. To provide a fuller picture of how this business is performing, I'll close out my TAG discussion with a few comments on the first half. Sales are up 15.9% versus the first half of 2020 and segment margin is up 110 basis points, 21.6% of sales. A metric we pay very close attention to is the number of new accounts, which are up nearly 30% in the first half. This is a clear indicator of terrific opportunities ahead. On a two-year stack basis, sales are up 14% compared to the first half of 2019, or an average of 7% annually, well above market growth. Segment margin expanded 240 basis points over the same two-year period. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased 25% in the quarter, including a positive impact of 1.5 percentage points related to currency translation and negative impact of 4 percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. Pricing was positive. As expected, our DIY business returned to more normal levels driven by consumers returning to work and difficult comparisons to the prior year. We're encouraged by growth in our European and Asia-Pacific businesses, which were both up double digits in the quarter. And in our Pros Who Paint category, though these areas of strength were not enough to offset lower North America DIY demand. While it was a challenging quarter for sure, it's constructive to look at this business over the first half, given the unusual DIY dynamics related to the pandemic over the past year. Adjusting for the divestiture of Wattyl, the business is only down low-single digits compared to the first half of 2020. Encouragingly, the first half of 2021 is up mid-single digits compared to the first half of 2019, and adjusted segment margin is up 180 basis points over the same period. We think the comparison to the first half of 2019 better indicates the progress we're making in growing this business and improving its performance. As you know, our global supply chain organization is managed within this segment, this team continues to do incredible work in navigating the industry-wide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri. We are working collaboratively across our business to support our customers and keep them painting. Last, let me comment on second quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. The industrial recovery appears to be in full swing. The momentum we've seen since the third quarter of 2020 continued and accelerated in the year's second quarter. Group sales increased by more than 40%, including a currency translation tailwind of 6% in the quarter. Price was positive, and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in Europe, followed by Latin America, Asia-Pacific and North America. Every division in the group grew by a strong double-digit percentage driven by robust underlined demand, new customer wins, share wallet gains and favorable comparisons to last year's second quarter. I'll start with the industrial wood division, which again had the highest growth rate in the group. This is the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in this business and sales were positive in every region. New residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring and furniture applications. General industrial, the largest division of the group posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and sales were positive in every region. Our customers are reporting the growth they have seen as being driven by true and market demand rather than temporary inventory restocking. Sales were strong across our customer segments, including heavy equipment, building products, containers and general finishing. Automotive refinish sales increased by strong double-digit percentage. Miles driven and collision shop volume remained below pre-pandemic levels. New installations of our products and systems in North America remained very strong. This is a good indicator of further momentum in our business. Our coil coatings business remains a consistent performer. Sales grew by strong double-digit percentage and were positive in all regions. This team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions. Construction and appliances were to grow. Our packaging team generated double-digit growth against a high-single-digit comparison last year, and sales were positive in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction with existing and new customers. As I did in the other two segments, let me speak to Performance Coatings' first half performance, where sales were up 26.4% versus the first half of 2020. Adjusted segment profit increased $81.3 million or 25.7%. Adjusted segment margin was basically flat, which is encouraging given that this group has seen the highest level of raw material inflation in the company year-to-date. On a two-year stack basis, PCG first half 2021 sales were up 15% compared to the first half of 2019 or an average of 7.5% annually, again, well above market growth. Adjusted segment margin is down just 40 basis points over the same two-year period. Encouraging performance given this business has faced the most significant raw material inflation year-to-date. Before moving on to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation year-to-date. We have returned a little over $1.9 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We've invested $1.6 billion to purchase 6.4 million shares at an average price of $257.12. We distributed $297.7 million in dividends, an increase of 21.2%. We also invested $151.4 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $17 million for our building our future project. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times. Turning to our outlook. We expect robust demand in all North American pro architectural end markets to continue through the second half, though comparisons become more challenging and continued tightness in the supply chain will remain a headwind. We expect DIY demand to continue to moderate as consumers return to work and comparisons will remain challenging into 2022. We expect industrial demand will remain strong over the rest of the year. As we described last quarter, we've been highly proactive in managing the supply chain disruptions to provide product to our customers. We expect to be in a make and ship mode until the seasonally slower fourth quarter when we expect to begin building inventory. We see the current challenges as an opportunity to drive even greater engagement with our customers. We're leveraging all of our assets, including our store platform, our fleet, our distribution centers, and more to let us come up with unique and creative customer solutions that others simply can't. On the cost side of the equation, raw material inflation has not moderated driven by continued supply chain issues and surging demand. As a result, we are raising our raw material inflation expectations to be in the mid-teens for the year, an increase from our previous range. We anticipate year-over-year inflation in the third quarter to be higher than it was in the second quarter with only slight improvement in the fourth quarter, as demand remains high. We continue to have great confidence. We will offset these higher costs with the incremental price increases we announced in all businesses during the second quarter. We are prepared to implement additional increases should they be necessary. We recognized the timing of price realization will continue to put pressure on margins in the near term. Over the longer term, we expect margin expansion. Against this backdrop, we anticipate third quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will be up by mid to high single digit percentage compared to the third quarter of 2020. We expect The Americas Group sales to be up by a mid to high single digit percentage with pro sales at or above the high end of this range and DIY sales returning to a more historic level.  We expect Consumer Brands sales to be down by a mid to high teens percentage, including a negative impact of approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. And we expect performance coatings sales to be up by a high teens to low 20s percentage. We expect raw material availability to continue to improve throughout the quarter. Embedded in our guidance is a slightly smaller impact from raw material availability than we experienced in the second quarter. For the full year 2021, we expect consolidated net sales to be up by a high single to low double-digit percentage. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a low double digit to mid-teens percentage. Consumer Brands Group to be down by a mid to high single digit percentage, including the negative impact of approximately four percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low 20s percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $8.01 to $8.31 per share, compared to $7.36 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.80 per share and the loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2021 earnings per share of $9.15 to $9.45, an increase of 13.6% at the midpoint over the $8.19 we delivered in 2020. Let me close with some additional data points that may be helpful for modeling purposes. We expect to see slightly more gross margin contraction in our second half compared to our first half due to higher raw material costs, product and customer mix returning to more normal levels and a more difficult comparison year-over-year, partially offset by additional selling price increases implemented across all of our businesses in the second half of the year. We expect to see some contraction in full year gross margin, given the lag between pricing realization and the rapid and greater than expected increase in raw material costs. As we capture price and inflation abates, [ph] we expect to see gross margin recover and then expand over time just as it has in previous cycles. We expect to see some contraction in our second half operating margin due to the contraction in gross margin partially offset by leverage on SG&A due to the strong sales growth. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately flat with 2020 with a nice improvement compared to 2019. The level of our operating margin performance compared to last year will depend on where in the range our consolidated sales perform and where raw materials trend through the second half of the year. We will continue making investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to return to our normal cadence with around 80 new stores opening in the U.S. and Canada in 2021. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform in the home center channel. These investments are embedded in our full year guidance. We expect foreign currency exchange to be a tailwind of approximately 2% for the full year. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. We expect full year depreciation to be approximately $280 million and amortization to be approximately $310 million. The CapEx and interest expense guidance we provided last quarter remains unchanged. We have $24 million of long-term debt due in 2021. We expect to increase the annual dividend per share by 23.5% per share for the full year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. We delivered an excellent first half and despite considerable supply chain and inflationary headwinds, we are maintaining our previous full year guidance and expect to deliver another very strong year. We remain highly focused on providing solutions to our customers. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Good morning, Ghansh. Hey Ghansham let me take a swipe at the first part of your question and I'll ask Al to talk about the second. And it's going to be an easy swipe across the first piece because across the TAG business, if I understand your question, which segments are going to be driving that business, it's every one of our professional segments. We've got great confidence in the demand that we see in that business. We spoke last quarter, last couple quarters about our expectations as it relates to DIY that they would likely revert back to the mean or the norm. And that from a market perspective, that we would be in a terrific position to be able to capitalize on the business as it started to shift into these pro segments. We didn't expect that it'd be perfectly smooth, just waving in from one to another. But in fact, these pro businesses are showing terrific demand and we're excited to be in a position to be able to capitalize on those. We think the control distribution model that we have, we think the reps that we have, and even in these challenges \u2013 challenging times with some of the supply chain issues, that we're working closer with our customers and developing a level of loyalty that we've not seen before. Before throwing it to Al, I'll add just a couple of comments as to why I made those statements regarding the relationship with our customers. We stay very close to our customers, and right now we've just gotten some terrific feedback on the research, as it relates to our loyalty with our customers. As it speaks to the pro business, we've set records during these challenging times with our contractors highlighting our ability to respond and work with them during these challenging issues. And the fact that our reps and managers are there with them close to the customer has allowed us to be responsive to them, keep them in paint predominantly better than anyone else. And that combined with the demand we feel is going to position us to really come through this and exit this stronger than are today and got you. Thanks, Ghansham. Yes, Jeff on a consolidated basis, we think the raw material shortages were a headwind of about 3.4% on the consolidated, and that was split pretty evenly between our TAG and our Consumer Brands segments. There was an immaterial impact on our Performance Coatings segment. Jeff, I think what \u2013 each of the consumer, each of the \u2013 we have a lot of different categories and businesses. I would say that the team has implemented pricing across all those categories, their price effectiveness is similar to where we're at in TAG, and there are more pricing that comes off that the additional raw material basket increases that we're seeing. Yes, the only other comment I would make on that, Jeff is on the lag, I think, if you look at the operating margin comparison versus last year, it's very difficult because of just the very high-volume strength we saw in the second quarter. But if you look at the first half our first half and consumer, our operating margin was still up almost 180 basis points versus the first half of 2019. So, I think because of the way the year rolled out, I think, a better comparison would be to the first half of 2019. And we've maintained that margin. And on a 3.5% sales increase in the first task versus first half of 2019. I think you should look at it as we're going to win share gain during this time that there might have been some transactions, some projects or some element of a project that we might have lost, but as I mentioned just briefly a moment ago, our research is indicating the way in which we're handling this. And maybe I'll talk just briefly about that, the transparency in which we're working with our customers, the responsiveness that we're working with, our customers there have been, as Al mentioned, a little bit of a challenge in dealing with some of these customers. But we have great confidence in how we're responding and how we're dealing with our customers that lead us to believe in the customer stats scores that we're getting from our customers really indicate the fact that the way we're handling this is allowing us to come out of this with greater stickiness. The new account growth that we're experiencing right now. So, record year-to-date performance in new account activity. And we're stepping into this with customers. While we're opening new accounts with them, we're getting them at this point to try new products, and that trial in itself, down the road will lead to more projects with those customers. So, I've got great confidence that as we come out of this, you're going to see that same coiled spring that we've exited other challenging times uncoil. And we're going to accelerate that. You can see that not only in what I've talked about in the research, but as our competitors continue to close stores and close territories, and we continue to invest in a number of areas, we're going to take advantage of this market. And we actually, as difficult as these times are, these are the best times for our company. We expect to come out of this stronger. Good morning Bob. Well, we work closely with our suppliers. And I think the approach that we're taking here is that many of them are in unique situations as well. We clearly have worked with our suppliers to put ourselves in a position to leverage our supply chain, working with them in a way that can accelerate our ability to serve our customers. So, on the one front from incoming raw materials, we're working closely with them. We're unique in the fact that we have our own fleet of vehicles. We have 860 tractors and 2,100 trailers that we use to expedite once we receive these raw materials into our plants. And in many cases right now, right from our plants to customer projects. So, it's the entire the entire supply chain Bob that we're working on to expedite, cut out as many days as possible and to serve our customers. And that transparency as we communicate to our customers is exactly why I mentioned earlier. We know that we're going to come out of this with share gains. Thanks Bob. Yes, Truman, let me just comment that we expect that DIY would return to more normal levels as the year progressed. And we were very confident in the other segments, particularly in TAG within commercial and property maintenance would more than offset that slowdown. So, yes, we took our Consumer Brands full year sales guidance down just to mid-to-high teens while taking the Americas Group up from low double digits to mid-teens. And you are absolutely right when you look at the comparison year-over-year, our second and third quarters are going to be the toughest. Our fourth quarter is going to get slightly better, but I think it's important to look at it from an architectural market perspective. I think if you look at the combined architectural business, we expected the first half to be low double digits. And we were right there with our Consumer and TAG businesses. We've said we expected our second half to be up mid-to-high single digits versus last year. And with our TAG and CBG sales guidance for the full year, second half is in that range. So, from an architectural perspective, we believe we positioned the company strategically to take advantage of the different shifts in the market to position us to capitalize on those shifts. And plus, when you look at the return of growth industrial, we're just really excited about our full year sales guidance to be up high single digits, to low double digit in a really turbulent market. Yes, Arun let me take a quick swipe here and then I'll throw it to Jim to give you some macro numbers. I would say that we absolutely agree with the projected growth rates to continue to exceed the market. And I'll remind you, you use res repaint as the tip of the spear in your conversation. We've had now five consecutive years of double-digit growth in residential repaint, we don't see that slowing down. In fact, our expectations of Heidi and our TAG organization is to continue to accelerate that growth. We're making, we believe, some terrific investments in that business stores, reps, products our digital platform a number of areas there that we continue to invest. Yes, in the face of adversity in some cases, but as I mentioned earlier, that's what we believe helps us to accelerate during these challenging times, particularly given some of the moves of our competitors. So, we're excited about the growth opportunities there to accelerate. And maybe I'll throw it to Jim to just talk about some of the macro numbers across the business. But when I look at the professional segments inside our TAG business, we're excited about each one of those. And before Jim kicks off, you also mentioned the PCG side. We have very high expectations for Justin Binns and his team. We've got some really good momentum there. Our focus here, we believe is unique. We try to bring differentiated products and solutions to our customers. And we believe that the combination of the Valspar, Sherwin technology portfolio is really starting to allow us to harvest some of the great work both companies had done individually in a way that's very unique and that's clearly visible throughout the different segments. Particularly if you look at automotive as an example, where we know that we're beating the market with the combined technology that the two companies have brought together. So, the idea of consumer reverting back into low single digits is probably a good model number to use. But we absolutely believe that our TAG and PCG businesses will be outpacing the market. But I would add, even on the consumer side, we are committed. We believe that we can help our customers outperform the market. So, while it might revert back more into a normalized run rate, we want, and we'll be working in and investing with our customers to help them outpace that market. And we believe that we've aligned ourselves very well with our customers. They share that desire to continue to grow market share. And we're investing in that business and believe that we can help them outpace the market as well. And I think it's a great response. And I also do want to put a little color on the M&A strategy that Al referred to. While we don't feel as though we have a gun to our head, we do think that there are opportunities out there. And we think that there are several deals that we're working on that could be completed this year, but they're going to be disciplined deals that we can bring value to our shareholders. We're not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere. We're looking proactively for targets that as Al mentioned, fit our strategy, and those would be areas that would fill necessary geographic gaps. We're not just throwing a dart at a map here trying to figure out where we're not. We could bring technology that can be leveraged across the platform or could fill a void of other types to help us serve our customers. So, we absolutely believe that there are M&A targets out there that are a good fit that we can get at the proper value in fairness to the sellers and to our shareholders. And meanwhile, we don't feel as though we're out there just trying to buy a book of business so that we could demonstrate growth. We have growth opportunities and we're actively pursuing those organically. Thanks. Hey, Duffy. No, Duffy. We have a terrific and experienced team in both procurement and in technical, as well as our supply chain. And as you would expect with veterans that have 25-plus years of experience, we're looking at a lot of things differently. I don't know if that's anything that we want to talk about right now. I don't think structurally you have to be concerned from a capital standpoint that we're changing the model of the business, but that you should expect and our customers should expect us to be thinking about how to protect them going forward, and we'll be taking those necessary steps. But I don't think that on a public call like this, we want to define what those steps are. Yes. I'd say we have seen a slight uptick in some wage areas, some pressure, where we feel that pressure. We're taking the steps to secure what we believe to be our most important resource, our people. I'll remind you that we have a terrific turnover rate between 7% and 8% on average. So, we recruit and hire the right talent. We train them, we give them the resources to win, and then they become the reason for our success and we're very proud of our team. As a result of that and the fact that they have success in their career path, our people tend to stay. In fact, over a third of our employees have 10 or more years with the company and we think that's very important. So, while we're making some adjustments where necessary, we believe that they're the right investments to make. And we do believe that as a result of this retention, we're able to respond with experienced employees that can serve their customers. As far as the materiality of the moves that we're making to respond to this pressure, I don't think it's material in the sense from a modeling perspective, but we are taking the steps necessary. And in some cases, making the financial moves to recruit and retain the talent that we need. Thank you, Duffy. Mike, I think what's important to remember is that the cost or the cost of the paint in a total project is a relatively small percentage, 80% to 85% of the painters' costs is in their labor. And so, we're moving and developing innovative products to help them offset that labor costs. And while many of them are able to hire and secure the talent that they need, many are bringing on new unskilled people in training them. And so, the cost of a good gallon of paint that can help them produce a nice finished product that their customers will enjoy, overall, it's relatively small percentage of their cost of goods. So, they are responding I think favorably to higher quality products. And just a moment ago, I talked about our labor and our willingness to hire, recruit and retain that talent and in some cases paying a little bit more. And we have to consider that as well as our labor as well as our customers. We look at that cost of the retention that I just described, and that gets factored into all the pricing decisions that we make. Our painting contractors are doing the same. And so, we're trying to offset some of their costs, the painters with higher efficient projects, through quality of products. And while we're trying to do the same to our customers, as we're experiencing some labor cost increases, we're trying to offset that with efficiencies in our plant, in our stores to minimize the impact of labor in price increases that we're out there seeking. Mike, I'm absolutely shocked that your first question wasn't about the Guardian name. You let me down there. Thanks for calling. But I think the important metric that we track closely is our ability to help our customers make more money. So, in that process, our entire focus \u2013 when you look at the investments that we're making, the services that we're providing, every gauge that we have, every resource that we do, it always ends up with are we helping you make more money. And that's an important metric in our decision-making. As we've talked about, David, it's a little harder to kind of look at the different businesses because even within the different categories within consumer, but you would expect to see a similar, right, you would expect to see a similar range within Consumer and a higher range in PCG just because of the raw material basket being higher on our industrial businesses. And it's just timing on industrial, as you know TAG is more uniformed and timing-wise when they go outprice, whereas in our industrial businesses by business by region are staggered across different timelines, but you could expect to see a higher cadence for our industrial businesses in the second half. Thank you, David. Yes, with great certainty. And I would do that 100% of the time. I do it again tomorrow. And if we have to in the future, we'd likely take the same approach. Our loyalty and our ability to even execute the effective price increase with our customers increases dramatically as a result of that, so, without question. We do. We have a CRM system that we use, proprietor we built and we do keep an eye on that. It is a very strong period in backlog and we're not going to share any more detail on the specifics, but I speak with great confidence in the backlog. You bet. I'll give you a little color. We're not going to get into any specifics on the metrics or conversion, but I would tell you that it is a very high, very high number in comparison. I would say that our teams, our TAG leadership all the way through to those that are closest to our customers are doing a fantastic job. And one of the questions has to be how are you doing this given some of the shortages in raw materials. And the fact is, is that we've been very open with our approach compared to our competitors. And we were out early with transparency. I'd think many of our competitors were in denial. At first some of our competitors were asking, why no one else is telling me that. In fact, some of them said it might be a week or two. And we were out with very truthful with our customers as to what we expect. And I give our procurement team and our supply chain team great credit for the courage that it took to come in to this boardroom that we're in today and explain how this was going to fall out and how quickly our commercial teams took that to the market, face-to-face with our customers with full transparency to help them run their business. And the reason that I say that and why I think that's important is that while many of our competitors were in this denial and may have felt that they were going to be at a competitive advantage for whatever reason, ultimately from a customer's perspective they lost credibility. And our teams now are out talking to customers who may in the past have had loyalty that kept them from using other suppliers. Suddenly we're getting \u2013 the phones getting answered and we're helping our people to be in front of those customers that offer that terrific opportunity. Now, as I mentioned, right now we might be just simply in the trial mode because the supply chain issues are real and we're taking care of our existing customers with great focus. And we're able to talk to these new customers about the alternate supply and the importance of that and getting them to try product. In some cases, it's simply in the back of our own stores, and some cases, it's one room on a project, but we know with great certainty that this is the most important step in the process. And this trial is an exciting step and we look forward to a greater conversion going forward. So earlier I was asked, do we feel as though we're going to come out of this with market share gains. And I hope everyone heard the confidence in which I answered that because I've got terrific respect for our leadership team and all the way down to the part-timers that are in our store, that are in front of these customers, introducing new products and new solutions that are going to help these customers make more money. And we're determined to do just that. That's a really interesting question. I'd say that the way I might answer that is that we see terrific growth in all of them. If I may, I could just spin through those quickly. In the packaging business, we do believe that the unique technology that we've brought to market will help us to continue to grow. Al mentioned the CapEx that we're putting into this business. We are investing along with our customers in additional capacity, and we think that our V70 is a very unique product. It's a plug and \u2013 a product with plug and play performance. It's easily adopted onto existing can-making equipment and helps our customers with speed. So, the efficiency of the application is terrific. It gives great flavor protection to products, both food and beverage, and it's really the next generation of the non-BPA technology. So, it's \u2013 and I'm taking packaging first and getting into a little bit more depth because while it's easy to talk to that model, it's the same model that we're using in every segment to help differentiate our teams from our competitors. So, when you look at GI as an example or industrial wood, we're looking at not only the technology, but the supply chain, how do we take \u2013 the time that it takes to get product and whittle that down to what might have been weeks into days. And instead of thousands of gallons of required orders to 50 gallons or 100 gallons to put them in business faster with less working capital. Our coil businesses are doing a fantastic job of introducing technology and speed. Our automotive, I talked earlier about the combined technologies between the Sherwin and Valspar technology. That's helping throughput with each of their customers to be able to be more productive. In our protective and marine business to get assets more \u2013 I'm sorry, to get assets back in play faster. So, when you asked that question, quite honestly, it's hard to answer which offers the greatest opportunities. If Justin Binns was in the room with me right now, I'd look him in the eye and I'd tell him I have expectations for every one of those businesses to grow and grow excessively and at the expense of our competitors. That's what I would tell them. Thanks, Kevin. Hey, P.J. I think I'll start and maybe turn it to Al if I miss anything. I think part of it is mix of business. We've been very selective in our strategy on what we pursue. And we pursue businesses that are interested in coatings and solutions that will help them make more money, not necessarily just commodities. So, you're not going to see us in areas where it's just that commodities. So, we've actually walked away from some of those businesses and we've focused on areas that are more high value. So, we often talk about bridge and highway, you're going to see us on the high-value bridge area as an example as opposed to other areas that are just low-margin commodities. And I think that plays an important part in the alignment and our approach is just that. We want to be partners with our customers, help them to be more successful. And in return, they understand that our ability to serve them and make them successful comes at a cost to us and our shareholders and we're sharing that reward. Al, anything else you'd like to add to that? I'm not going to revisit that. Yes, I'd say that we're seeing strong utilization and I would say an increase in all the metrics in the categories that we track. And the platform, I'd say, is providing a service option that makes our pros more efficient in utilizing all our resources. So unlike others who might be trying a digital platform as the model, ours is unique and that it brings everything to bear. So, we want our customers utilizing our stores, our reps, and the platform and we believe that the model that we have is very unique and how it encapsulates all of that into one offering. This platform that we \u2013 so we're not going to talk specifically about sales on platform \u2013 on the digital platform versus in the store or by phone or through the rep. Quite frankly, we don't discriminate against any of those orders. We'll take them all. We want them utilizing any resource every platform that they feel as comfortable. What we're trying to do is make it easier for them. So, this digital platform will allow them access to their pricing, their projects, their orders and they can conduct business with us 24/7 through the platform. And if they prefer to come into the store and have a cup coffee with their best friend behind the counter, we encourage that as well. Thanks, P.J. Yes. There might be. I don't know about that. Only that where do the Guardians go, John? Now, they came from John Roberts, not John Morikis, everyone. No, John, I would say kind of that mix return to a more normal level. I think typically we start off interior and exterior maybe 4 to 1 in the out quarters, where the exterior in the Midwest and East are less prevalent. And then as you get to the two middle quarters, it trends to closer to 3 to 1 to 2.5 to 1. And I think we ended the quarter closer to 2.5 to 1 on volume. Yes, we were. And we plan to continue to use them as creatively as possible, just as we do every asset. And John, this has given us an opportunity and we have a terrific leader in Joe Sladek that runs our Global Supply Chain, whose team has been really creative. So, it's not just the tractors and trailers, which is a great question that you're asking, but we're using our distribution centers or that manufacturing, our stores, everything in a very unique fashion. And some of this has been on the fly and we've continued to improve in our ability to do that. And again, we'll come out of this better as a result that we're learning a lot about our supply chain and our ability is to be able to leverage it. And we'll will be better coming out of this as a result. Thanks, John. John \u2013 I'm sorry, Mike, I did say that it's a little bit of everything. Certainly, the region particularly in China, if you look at the double-digit decline in 2000 [ph] largely related to COVID, it had an impact on us. I will point out that we did improve profits, even in that kind of environment. So, in China, we continue to focus on the volume growth with the recovery further defining our operating model in that region. We had a strong half in 2021. We're not going to give guidance by business, but this is, as I've said before, an area that we're looking long term. I wouldn't suspect that next quarter this business is going to move the needle one way or the other. But if you look next decade, it might. And so that's the way we're running this business and we have expectations for Brian Padden and his team to continue to really drive through the strategic decisions that we're making there. And we're looking long term there. In Europe, I'd say we continue to build around our Kingfisher relationship. The team in Europe has delivered a double-digit increase in 2020, so comparisons are a little bit more challenging here in 2021. And we did have a very strong start in 2021. We have terrific leaders here in Europe, one of whom we just brought to the U.S. to take a very important role for us. He did such a wonderful job there and very strong leader. And again, speaks to the depth, we have a leader who is going to backfill him, that's very strong as well. So, I think both of these businesses are relatively small in nature, but good opportunities for us and we're managing accordingly. Mike, I'd prefer that our customers talk to their plans as it relates to inventory. I will say that we are working hard and will be working hard to the balance of the year to continue to improve our ability to serve them. So, it's a very important focus of ours. Al mentioned the incremental investments that we've made to bring on about 50 million gallons of capacity. That certainly will help this business as well. But as it relates to their inventory decisions and what they do, I don't know that, that's appropriate for us to comment on. But I would tell you that we're working hard to be able to continue to improve our position with them should they decide to pull in more inventory going forward. You bet. Yes, it is double-digit growth. We speak \u2013 we think it speaks to the confidence that our painters have. So, we're excited about it. Yes. Yes, I'd say labor continues to be a discussion in nearly every market that I've been in. As Jim mentioned in one of his responses, we feel as though that is serving as a bit of a governor. And I'll point out that while labor is an issue, I believe every professional segment in TAG had a double-digit gain. So, they're finding a way to continue to grow but it is an issue. And again, all of these challenges, all of this adversity, we don't ask for this adversity, but it does play to our advantage. It does allow us to serve our customers in a way that helps them through these challenges. If they run short on people or have to move from one project to other \u2013 another, any of that turmoil on the part of our customer, please write to the rep that's there, working with that customer or the store manager locally that has the capability to serve that customer. So labor is an issue. It's one of many and we try to work with our customers in a way that can help them make more money working through it. You bet. Yes, we expect to gain share. Thanks, Greg. Yes, I'd say we're seeing strength in quite a few areas. The hospitality area, schools, tilt-up, warehousing is really going well. Trying to think of areas that are really soft. Nothing comes to my mind, truly in areas that are really soft, I'd say, they're all growing in \u2013 lot of tilt-up, lot of warehousing, lot of expansion, medical, healthcare is expanding, some just more than others, Adam. Yes. No. Our res repaint business is \u2013 it's really hot and we've not seen that at all. You bet. Eric, it might. I mean, I'd say, our approach to the pricing has been very well received by our customers and the response that I said earlier about 100% of the times I would do this exactly as we rolled it out. So, it could, but there is also a lot of pressure in the market right now. So, what we're trying to do is put our teams in a position to be able to serve their customers, to help facilitate that price effectiveness. And we'll see. I mean, we're going to work hard at it, but I can't with 100% certainty tell you that I could project that number. I could tell you that we're working very hard to work with our customers to help them to be successful and in turn, our shareholders are rewarded. That's our model. You bet. Yes. Thank you. And first, let me just start by reminding everyone that Jim and Eric will be available for the rest of day and tomorrow if you have some questions. I did ask for the opportunity to close out today's call just to pull out a couple of really important points, at least in my mind. First, that we're really proud of the terrific first half that we've had, but we're not complacent. This isn't an organization that pops corks over what's happened. We're more focused on what has to happen. So, we're determined to continue to get better, but we're really pleased with the first half. So, I want to thank our teams for the wonderful work that they're doing. We are in a strong market with terrific demand and our goal is to outpace that demand in the market with growth that exceeds the market's position. We do believe we're positioned to capitalize on this demand, wherever it presents itself. I mentioned earlier about the utilization of our assets, if it's our factories, our stores, our reps, our digital platform, the fleet that we talked about, we do believe we're uniquely positioned and very determined. We are experiencing these raw material cost increases from an industry-wide availability issue and we think that this team of leaders that we have who have been experienced with similar cycles, it may have been natural disasters or financial crisis, COVID, whatever it might be, now here with raw materials that this seasoned and experienced team knows what to do and have the conviction to do it and we're proud of them. All of this has us confident in our ability to come through this with greater market share, as I mentioned earlier, stronger relationships and better positioned for future growth. And so, we're excited. This is a challenging year, but we're excited about our position and our ability to leverage this challenging year in the shareholder value and growth for our company. Lot of determination to do it. So, thank you all for your interest in our company, know that where we're out here determined to do better and convinced that we can. Thank you very much."

With us on today's call are John Morikis, Chairman, President and CEO; Al Mistysyn, CFO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under the US federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJim Jaye: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered terrific results in the first quarter. The momentum with which we exited the fourth quarter continued in the first quarter. We entered the quarter with strong expectations and we finished stronger. We capitalized on extremely robust demand across both architectural and industrial markets, leading to sales in two of our segments that exceeded the guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We generated double-digit growth once again in residential repaint as well as in new residential and DIY. We also generated double-digit growth in our industrial business with improvement in every region. Before getting into some of the specific numbers, I'll remind you that in February our Board of Directors approved and declared a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend to make the stock more accessible to employees and a broader base of investors. Trading of our shares on a stock-split-adjusted basis began on April 1, 2021. All share and per-share amounts in today's press release and conference call commentary have been adjusted to reflect the 3-for-1 stock split. Additionally, all comparisons in our prepared commentary this morning are to the first quarter of 2020 unless otherwise specified. So starting with the top-line. First quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 12.3% to $4.66 billion. Consolidated gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 45.4% due to greater-than-anticipated raw material cost inflation. SG&A expense as a percent of sales decreased 300 basis points to 28.5%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $116.7 million or 29.8% to $509 million. The first quarter of 2021 included $75.6 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense and onetime costs of $111.9 million related to the divestiture of the Wattyl Australia business. The first quarter of 2020 included $75.6 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense. Excluding these items, consolidated profit before tax increased 48.8% to $696.5 million with flow-through of 44.9%. Diluted net income per share in the quarter increased to $1.51 per share from $1.15 per share a year ago. The first quarter of 2021, included acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.21 per share and onetime costs related to the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. The first quarter of 2020, included acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.21 per share. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 51.5% to $2.06 per share from $1.36 per share. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $848.7 million in the quarter or 18.2% of sales. Net operating cash grew to $195.7 million in the quarter. All three of our operating segments delivered excellent top-line growth, margin expansion and strong flow-through in the quarter. Segment margin in The Americas Group improved 240 basis points to 19.2% of sales, resulting primarily from operating leverage on a high single-digit top-line growth. Flow-through was 46.4%. Adjusted segment margin in Consumer Brands Group improved 440 basis points to 21.4% of sales resulting primarily from operating leverage on the double-digit top-line growth. Flow-through was 38.9%. And adjusted segment margin in Performance Coatings Group improved 60 basis points to 14.3% of sales driven by operating leverage on the double-digit sales growth, which was partially offset by higher raw material costs. Flow-through was 19.1%. Let me now turn the call over to John Morikis for additional commentary on the first quarter along with our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2021. John?\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. We're off to a tremendous start in 2021. Credit goes to all 61,000 members of our team who are serving our customers at a high level, aggressively pursuing and capturing new business and managing through transitory disruptions in the supply chain. There is no better team in the industry. Demand was robust across both architectural and industrial businesses in the quarter, particularly in March where sales were well above our forecast. We're seeing very positive trends as economies continue to reopen. As we've often said, volume is the strongest driver of our results and we leveraged the strong growth to deliver improved profitability in every segment in the quarter. In The Americas Group first quarter sales increased by 8.6% over the same period a year ago, including about 1.7 percentage points of price. The impact of unfavorable currency translation was not material. Same-store sales in the US and Canada were up 8.2% against a high single-digit comparison. In residential repaint, our largest segment, we delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter against a double-digit comparison. We have grown this business by double-digits for five consecutive years. We expect this momentum to continue. Contractors are reporting solid backlogs and interior and exterior were both very strong. Demand remained unprecedented in our DIY business where sales were up by double-digit percentage for the fifth consecutive quarter. New residential also remained an area of strength for us with low double-digit growth in the quarter against a high single-digit comparison. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer and customers are reporting solid order rates. Momentum is gradually building in our commercial business where sales in the quarter were up low single-digits against a solid quarter a year ago. Projects continue to resume at varying paces and comparisons are favorable over the remainder of the year. Property maintenance was down slightly in the quarter, though turnover in multifamily properties is improving. The month of March was positive and we expect to see meaningful improvement as the year progresses. Protective & Marine was down by a mid single-digit percentage in the quarter, but improved sequentially and delivered strong growth in the month of March. Growth in smaller customer segments such as flooring, bridge and highway and pharmaceutical was more than offset by softness in the oil and gas segment. We continue to aggressively pursue opportunities in all these end markets and expect continued improvement as maintenance projects cannot be delayed indefinitely. From a product perspective, sales in both interior and exterior paint were up by double-digit percentages with interior being the larger part of the mix as is normal for our first quarter. Additionally, this is the third consecutive quarter spray equivalent sales increased by double-digits in the quarter. Contractors typically invest in this type of equipment in anticipation of solid demand. Our previously announced 3% to 4% price increase to US and Canadian customers became effective February 1, prior to the supply chain disruption the industry began experiencing later in the quarter. We realized approximately 1.7% from price in the first quarter and would expect 2% or better in the following quarters. We will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed. We opened 11 new stores in the quarter in the US and Canada. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services to drive additional growth. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales increased 25% in the quarter, including 2.7 percentage points of positive impact related to currency translation, as DIY demand remained robust. Sales in all regions were above our mid-teens segment growth guidance, led by Asia and followed by Europe, North America and Australia respectively. We exited the Australia business in the segment at the close of the quarter. As you know our global supply chain organization is managed within this segment. I want to thank this team for their incredible performance in navigating the industry-wide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri during the quarter. We are working collaboratively across our businesses to keep our customers in paint and on the job. Last, let me comment on first quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. The momentum we saw in the third and fourth quarters of last year continued and accelerated in our first quarter, group sales increased by double-digit percentage. Currency translation was a tailwind of 2% in the quarter. Price was positive and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in Asia grew fastest in the quarter, followed by Europe, both of which were up by strong double-digit percentages. Latin America grew by a high single-digit percentage. North America, the largest region in the Performance Coatings Group continues to gain momentum, where sales were up by low single-digit percentage. From a divisional perspective, I'll start with the Industrial Wood division which had the highest growth in the group. Sales were up by strong double-digit percentage in the quarter and were positive in every region. Strength in new residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring and furniture applications. In General Industrial, the largest division of the group, sales were up by a high-teens percentage and were positive in every region. Sales were strong within heavy equipment, building products, containers and general finishing. While there's likely an element of inventory restocking by our customers in these numbers, we believe growing end-market demand is the larger driver given recent PMI and industrial production reports. Our Packaging team also continues to deliver great results. Sales were up high single-digits against a nearly double-digit quarter a year ago and were positive in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction. This team has been remarkably consistent and has delivered solid growth in every quarter since Sherwin-Williams acquired the business as part of the Valspar acquisition in 2017. We and our customers continue to invest in this terrific business. Our Coil Coatings business has also been a remarkably consistent performer. Sales grew by high single-digit percentage in the quarter against a double-digit comparison a year ago. This team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions. We're also seeing the gradual resumption of selected commercial construction projects. Last, Automotive Refinish sales were up by mid single-digit percentage in the quarter. This level of growth is very encouraging given that miles driven and collision shop volume remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly in North America. We're also pleased with new installations of our products and systems in North America which were very strong. This is a good indicator of future momentum in our business. Before moving on to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $930 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $775 million to purchase 3.3 million shares at an average price of $234.96. We distributed $151.8 million in dividends, an increase of 23.5%. We also invested $64.3 million in our business through capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. Turning to our outlook. We continue to see robust demand in North America residential repaint and new residential and continued recovery in commercial and property maintenance. Comparisons in DIY will be challenging over the remainder of the year, though we are excited by opportunities to work with our retail partners to grow sales in the pros who paint segment. We expect industrial demand will continue to improve as the year progresses. We'll continue to leverage our strengths in innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution, as we expect to grow at a rate that outpaces the market. On the cost side of the equation, we now expect raw material inflation for the year to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, a significant increase from the low to mid single-digit range we communicated in January. In an already challenged supply chain due to COVID-19, the February natural disaster in Texas further impacted the complex petrochemical network causing significant disruptions. These production disruptions, coupled with surging architectural and industrial demand have pressured supply and rapidly driven commodity prices upward. Recovery has been significant in recent weeks and is improving, but it's still far from complete.  At this time, we anticipate some moderation of costs in the back half of the year though they will still be elevated year-over-year. As we previously described, there is a lag of about a quarter from the time we see inflation in commodities to the time we see the impact in our results.  Given this timing, we expect to see significant raw material inflation in our second quarter, which will be the highest of the year. The pace at which capacity comes back online and supply becomes more robust remains uncertain. We have been highly proactive in managing the supply chain disruptions to minimize the impact on our customers. We expect to be in a similar mode throughout the summer months as reduced raw material availability resulted in lower-than-anticipated inventory build during our first quarter.  Our close working relationships with customers and the strength of our global supply chain give us great confidence in managing through any challenges that may occur. We've also been highly proactive in our pricing actions to offset the raw material inflation we are seeing. We've issued price increases in both the Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings Group, in addition to the previously announced price increase in The Americas Group.  We likely will need to take further pricing actions if raw material costs remain at these elevated levels. While we are fully committed to combating rising raw material costs, we also recognize that the timing of price realization will likely result in some near-term margin pressure. Against this backdrop, we anticipate second quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will increase by a mid- to high teens percentage compared to the second quarter 2020.  We expect The Americas Group to be up by a mid to high teens percentage. We expect Consumer Brands to be down by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage including a negative impact of approximately four percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. And we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a high-20s percentage.  For the full year 2021, we plan to provide you with an update to our sales and EPS guidance at our virtual financial community presentation event scheduled for Tuesday June 8th. We expect to have greater clarity of raw material availability and cost inflation trends at that time as well as further confirmation of the strong demand trends we are currently seeing.  Our current sales and adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged at this time. We expect consolidated net sales to increase by a mid to high single-digit percentage. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a mid to high single-digit percentage; Consumer Brands Group to be up or down by a low single-digit percentage including a negative impact of approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture; and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a mid-single-digit percentage.  We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $7.66 to $7.93 per share compared to $7.36 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.80 per share and a loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2021 earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.07, an increase of 9% at the midpoint over the $8.19 we delivered in 2020.  Let me close with some additional data points that may be helpful for your modeling purposes. We expect to see some contraction in full year gross margin given the lag between price realization and the rapid and greater-than-expected increase in raw material costs. As we capture price and inflation abates, we expect to see gross margin recover and then expand over time just as it has in the previous cycles.  We expect to see expansion of full year adjusted pre-tax margin as we leverage strong sales growth while controlling SG&A. We will continue making investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to return to our normal cadence with around 80 new store openings in the US and Canada in 2021.  We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel. These investments are embedded in our full year guidance. We expect foreign currency exchange will not have a material impact on sales for the full year.  We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. We expect full year depreciation to be approximately $280 million and amortization to be approximately $300 million. The CapEx and interest expense guidance we provided last quarter remains unchanged. We have $25 million of long-term debt due in 2021. We expect to increase the dividend by 23.5% for the full year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy.  We're off to a great start in 2021 with our excellent first quarter performance. Our team is operating with momentum and energized by the many opportunities in front of us as the recovery gains strength. We see demand remaining strong over the remainder of the year and nobody is better equipped to provide differentiated customer solutions than Sherwin-Williams.  We're confident in our ability to manage through transitory raw material availability and cost inflation issues and we expect to deliver another year of excellent results. That concludes our prepared remarks.  With that I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nGhansham Panjabi: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nJohn Morikis: Good Morning.\nGhansham Panjabi: I just want to think about 2021 at this point, John from a volume standpoint versus perhaps what your thoughts were coming into the year. Are there any outliers on the positive or negative side relative to your initial view as it relates to the various verticals across your three operating segments? I'm just asking because 1Q sales was above your initial guidance. 2Q is guided above us and The Street as well, but your full year guidance is -- for sales is still pretty much intact and I realize that Wattyl is part of that. But just curious on your thoughts on the various verticals? \nJohn Morikis: Yes. Let me take a run at it and I'll have Al jump in because we're getting a little bit into the forecast here, Ghansham. I'd say from a performance standpoint, we feel really good about the momentum that each of our segments are producing. I'd say the return if you will of the GI business and the Industrial Wood business at the pace that it's coming is a -- is pleasing to us. We expected that to occur, and it's coming in at a pretty robust pace. We've long spoken about how we've tried to position the business as both defensive and growth. In those markets impacted by COVID, we are we believe positioned very well to capture that. So to your point GI and Industrial Wood are growing. If you look at the segments in our TAG business, the residential, repaint, new res really doing quite well as well as DIY. I'd say, we are expecting continued traction in our commercial property management businesses. So I'd say, every element of the industrial business outside of the Protective and Marine business, which is showing sequential growth has been really improving well. And quite frankly every element of the architecture will sit on every cylinder. But let me ask Al to jump in regarding the forecast as well. \nAl Mistysyn: Hey, Ghansham, this is Al. And as I said on our January earnings call, we did have a weaker first half last year and a stronger second half. So it was important that we got off to a strong start in the first half. As you mentioned, we did start off the first quarter strong, and we're ahead of our guidance. Honestly, the second quarter sales guidance was closer to where we expected it to be based on the strong trends, we saw coming out of the fourth quarter into our first quarter those continued strong trends, especially in TAG and PCG. So those momentums carried and we're going against a weaker second quarter last year. But that being said, the first quarter is a small quarter for us. And as we typically do, we wait and get through the second quarter before we give an update on the full year. And as John mentioned in his opening remarks, which generally would be in July. So as John mentioned in his opening remarks, we're prepared to give an update on the full year sales and EPS guidance at our June 8 financial community presentation. So, not too far in the future, but gives us a good outlook and more data points to give you a better view of the year.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. It's a little earlier update than we -- as Al mentioned, we normally would do that coming out of the second quarter. So a little bit earlier in June, but it will give us an opportunity given some of the challenges that are in the market right now to give you an update at that time. \nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. And then just second question, I mean, on the pricing side for TAG. Obviously, you got a price increase through effective February 1. But your raw material guidance is basically more than 2x what it was three months ago for the year. So I guess what would you need to see to sort of adjust pricing in TAG as the year unfolds? And also remind us when was the last time TAG saw multiple price increases in one given -- in any given year? Thanks so much.\nJohn Morikis: I'd say, this Ghansham -- I'll take you back. We I believe have demonstrated that conviction and determination to put pricing in. Your point is a good one. As we entered the year, we put some pricing in and then this natural disaster came in in February. What would we see? Well, we continue to focus in on efficiencies through our own facilities, our own approach. Positive mix shift, which we're seeing right now at a pretty aggressive rate with customers moving up in quality helped to offset some of that. But I would say this that we're not taking additional pricing off the table. We'd prefer quite frankly not to go out in the midst of the painting season. We've got painting contractors that are out there quoting projects right now and we'd prefer to work through those prices -- those projects with them on those prices. But I think we've demonstrated in the past a willingness to do that if we need to. I'd say the other piece comes with the loyalty that we build and the way in which we handle these situations. We've often talked about, while we're not hoping for compression in margin as Al just mentioned, we accept a little margin compression. And it's part of the relationship that we've built we think it's unique. When our customers see us out with pricing, they know it's real. When we're out with pricing, we need it. If we find ourselves in this situation unable to offset it in pricing that -- raw material pricing that remains at an elevated level we'll be out with additional pricing.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Ghansham let me just add to that. As John talked about in his opening remarks, our focus is on operating margin expansion. And volume is the number one driver of that and you're seeing that in our first half. And our expectation is that we'll see that momentum going into our second half, but also selling price increases that have been planned. And I've brought in that to not just TAG, but across all the segments. And my expectation is that we will offset full year raw material increases dollar for dollar. We expect to get leverage on SG&A. That will more than offset that gross margin contraction. And that's typical. As you know gross margin -- short-term gross margin contraction is typical in an inflationary environment. We've shown our discipline to get pricing increases. To your question, you go back to 2010, 2011 and 2012 and we were out with six price increases in 22 months. And coming out of that you saw our gross margin not only recover, but expand from almost 600 basis points from 2013 through 2016. So the discipline is there and it's still there. And as John talked about we're providing solutions to our customers that they value. And this is why it's really important that we offset that raw material increases 85% of our cost of goods sold. And to provide those services and solutions at the high level our customers are expecting, we need to offset those raw materials. And as John said if raw materials inflation persists at these high levels, we will need to go out with another price increase later this year. And then we believe we're in that same environment. As raw materials moderate, we'll start to see our margins recover and then grow long-term, as we see our continuous improvement processes take effect and we're able to hold on to a majority of those price increases.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Ghansham, I might add one additional point to that and that is that while we're not cavalier about it, we're very sensitive to pricing and what it means to our customers. It does represent a relatively small percentage of their total cost of goods. Al mentioned that raw materials represent 85% of our COGS. If you look at a painting contractor, it represents about the same percent of their cost of paint on the project. Majority of their costs are -- I'm sorry 85% labor, the remainder cost. So it's a relatively small percentage of their total cost of goods. So we're disciplined in it. We're sensitive to it. But we also know to Al's point, if we're doing our job providing solutions to our customers, helping them make more money, disciplined in our approach to their understanding and when we're out there with the need for it.\nGhansham Panjabi: Very clear. Thanks so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nBob Koort: Thank you very much. Good morning. I wanted to ask \u2013 you gave some moderation maybe in the rate of growth in TAG in the second half, and I think you sort of explained why a second ago. But I was wondering, if you could help me think about implications on the DIY component there. I think that's maybe what 15% or 20% of your sales through the stores. What do you see on that comparison as you get into the second half? And would it be any different than what you would report in the consumer group? Thanks.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Bob. I'd say, as you mentioned DIY was very strong. And as we've previously indicated, we do expect DIY eventually to revert back to a more normal low single-digit rate as stay-at-home orders \u2013 I'm sorry, yeah, stay-at-home orders begin to ease and people begin returning back. So comparisons will be more challenging beginning in the second quarter of this year. Our belief is that as a company, we've really been working hard to position the company strategically to be able to capitalize on whichever way the market tilts. So, if in fact DIY reverts back our position as it relates to the pro segments, our industrial business, we think that we're going to be the winner if you will as it shifts one way or the other. We've worked very hard to position the company to be able to capitalize on the market, whichever way it turns. On the DIY side through our stores then while we might see some of that revert back, the pros will be higher on the CBG side or Consumer Brands Group side. It's a largely driven DIY business, but we are working hard with many of our customers on the pro who paints in there as well as an initiative for the company. You've heard us speak about the commitment that we have there, the investments that we have there, and quite frankly, the determination that we have there. And so whichever way the table tilts Bill \u2013 Bob, we believe we're going to be on top of it. And we quite frankly, don't discriminate to which segment it comes from. We're just very determined to be the one leading in each of those segments.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah, Bob. And I would expect, if you looked at those two businesses combined, so as John talked about moderating DIY and stronger in the other segments, we still expect our second half to be up mid- to high single digits in those combined architectural businesses if you will. \nJohn Morikis: And I think if you look at the comparison \u2013 maybe Al you can talk about the 2019 versus 2021. I think if you look Bob, not just at the comparison to the most recent year, if you look back to the previous year, we're still growing at a pretty impressive rate. \nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. I think you'd be looking close to a low double-digit increase over that second half period as well.\nJohn Morikis: So we're not giving it back. We're fighting along with our customers to keep it.\nBob Koort: And a quick follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared slides growth \u2013 pretty impressive growth in the interior paint segments. Can you give us some characterization of willingness to have the do-it-for-me contractors back in homes?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. Actually, it's a good observation you make because we did see strong double-digit growth, actually both in interior and exterior. But the interior is such a large percentage when that beast moves it's really terrific for us. In the res repaint, it's a second straight 20% quarter growth we've had. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, over five years of consecutive double-digit growth, this is a team that's just really focused in executing on a lot of the terrific efforts to be able to capitalize on that. We've got a new leader there in Heidi Petz, a very aggressive leader. And we're excited to see what she brings to this business as well, because I would tell you these contractors are bullish. They're returning back into this interior work with a greater pace and greater comfort by their customers. The macro data is strong, when you look at existing home sales up 12% year-over-year for March. The LIRA projecting mid-single-digit growth. Even the NAHB Remodel Index, I think it hit a record this period 86 greater than the record previously of 82. So contractors are clearly confident and bullish. We expect this is going to be another record year for us in residential repaint. There's good momentum, and you should expect us to be pushing that pedal all the way to the floor in this segment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Byrne: We're just looking at your \u2013 yes, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. If I look at your full year guide, it kind of implies second half in TAG being kind of mid-single-digit sales growth at best. Is it fair to assume that that's just stale? It would seem that you would \u2013 your pricing actions could approach that if you push more price and that wouldn't leave any room for volume growth. Is this just conservative and thus fairly stale?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah, Steve. What I said to Ghansham, we're going to look at updating our full year sales and EPS guidance at the June 8th, FCP conference. So \u2013 and it didn't make sense to me to try to take a look at one segment adjust the sales and not the whole company. So we're going to give you an update for all the segments and the full year at that meeting.\nJohn Morikis: Let me be very direct though, Steve. We're feeling very good very strong about our architectural performance and we expect a very strong performance going forward here.\nSteve Byrne: Okay. And then help me better understand your thinking on taking more price actions. It seems that you're kind of waiting to see whether these raws remain at these levels. I'm not \u2013 I'm a bit surprised you wouldn't take advantage of this, clearly, inflationary situation and push price now given the comments you just made about your pro contractors, the cost of your paint is a relatively small fraction. It is the concern about maintaining that loyalty enough to really absorb this and not push price? Help me understand that, a little better.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. Steve, I want to be clear on that as well. When you talk about absorb, I want you to really picture this, right? We've been out with pricing. We're working through that pricing. The effectiveness of that pricing is important to us right now. When you say absorb, I want to put that in context. We're talking about that we will as we have in the past temporarily accept some minor compression as we work and build through that loyalty and communicate to our customers our intentions and our plans. And so as Al mentioned, we expect to recover dollars this year. My view on this is very simple. I would give up a little press \u2013 I would say accept a little compression in the short term, when I know that in the long term, I'm going to come out of this with the customer and the price. And that's been our model in the past and it's worked very successfully. And it's a cadence that our customers have learned to expect and appreciate from us. And I challenge anyone to give any exception to the idea that not trying to run for a perfect quarter versus the years or decades that we've built this relationship with our customers shouldn't take priority over trying to go out immediately and adjust. We'll get it. We know we will. We'll work with our customers. And by the way we'll come out of it with a more loyal customer as a result of the way we handle it. \nAl Mistysyn: Yes. And Steve I'd just add to that where we could on the industrial side which really saw a rapid increase in the raw materials over the last 30, 60 days we just delayed the pricing maybe 30 days, so we can go out with a higher increase than we had planned. And so we saw some of our groups or businesses out April 1. But we are out across all businesses and all divisions. And we talked about expecting to see a kind of growth in the selling price realization from around 1.7% in our first quarter a little over 2% in our second quarter. And then we'll evaluate as we normally do month-to-month and take action where we need to. And certainly we would tell our customers first and then communicate to The Street.\nSteve Byrne: Okay, very good. Thank you for that.\nAl Mistysyn: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. When I look at your SG&A costs sequentially, maybe they're down I don't know $145 million. And that seems unusual given your historical pattern. And you had very, very nice sales growth. What's keeping the SG&A costs so low? Is there something unusual in the first quarter?\nAl Mistysyn: Jeff I would say -- and our SG&A was actually consolidated all in up about 1.4%. And the costs are related to new stores reps continued investment in Consumer Brands and the customer programs and additional services and reps in our Performance Coatings Group and then the e-commerce initiative continued investments there. We do have a decrease -- a continued decrease in travel year-over-year. That hasn't -- we haven't really fully turned that back on. But as these economies start reopening we'll see some of that. I would say in the environment we're in we're going to focus on continuing to put investments in. And where we can offset non-value activities and/or some of our back-office functions we'll do the savings there to help offset those investments. But we're going to continue to invest in this environment. And you should expect to see increase in -- modest increase in our SG&A going forward. \nJeff Zekauskas: Was there unusual management compensation last year? And if you think about management comp in 2020 related to -- relative to 2021 should it change much?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, I think Jeff we set full year targets at the beginning of the year and the comp will be dependent on our achievement of those targets. If you look sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and -- fourth quarter last year to first quarter this year, we would have more comp in our fourth quarter last year. As we typically do we true-up our accrual towards the end of the year. And with the strong fourth quarter we had we did have more comp expense in our fourth quarter including stock comp. \nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: I might just add just because I think it's an important part of your first question. I understand you were asking kind of the decline or management of the SG&A. But I think it is important going back to the question that Steve asked earlier about pricing, the investments that Al mentioned we'll continue to make because we believe that's an important element in our strategy. So, while we're managing expenses in many areas we're also investing in many critical areas. And that's what in fact allows us to execute on the strategy and which allows us to stand in front of our customers having provided a solution that allows them to make more money and ask for more money when we need to. So, I think your question is a great one. But I want to be clear that while we're managing the expense we're also investing in critical areas as well.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nP.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi. Good morning. I had just a clarification question on the Consumer Brands. Sales were up 25% in the quarter, which was a large number. And a year ago sales were down 5%. So, was there something going on with inventories maybe last year as pandemic approach into 1Q that big boxes took inventories down and they're building it now, or is there something else going on like you had exited the Ace business? So, what are the puts and takes in this 25% growth number in Consumer Brands?\nAl Mistysyn: P.J. that's -- if you go back to the first quarter of 2020 that was certainly -- the Ace impact was part of it. Really we had a difficult because of COVID Asia-Pacific was down really big and impacted our first quarter and even some of the moderation we saw in our other international businesses. We really had a strong first quarter with our international businesses up. When I say strong double digits we're talking 50%-plus. We saw a nice flow-through there. And the sell-through on the DIY side was still strong with our retail partners both here and outside the US.\nP.J. Juvekar: Thank you for that clarification. And now with your net debt-to-EBITDA close to 2.5 times should we expect Sherwin to get more aggressive in M&A? Especially as the recovery continues, what kind of acquisitions would be at the top of your shopping list?\nJohn Morikis: Well, P.J., I'd say you should expect us to see a lot of activity, mainly in the industrial piece. And our pipeline looks very robust. So, we've got a number of projects that we're working we hope to have completed this year. I'd say that it's important to again understand our strategy. As a reminder we're very focused on unique and differentiated solutions and the solutions that can help our customers achieve their success at a greater rate. And when -- thinking about that is pretty simple. We believe that the greater success our customers have the more they view us as a valued partner. So, we're not focusing on trying to be everything to everyone, everywhere. We're not focused on commodities. We're focused on those elements of unique differentiation high value infrastructure is an example, areas that we can help expedite a production line lower, energy costs, improved color loss, whatever it might be as well as technologies that we can buy and broaden through our distribution. So, we are determined to do this. But we also believe, we're unique in this sense as well that we're positioned very well given the Valspar acquisition as well as just the positions that we've had and are growing not to require acquisitions for growth. Our focus right now is on prioritizing our growth opportunities. And so, it's an exciting time here at Sherwin-Williams, where you're looking at where do we invest, where do we go, and not because we don't know where to go. It's just, there's so many opportunities for us to grow. And that's what our PCG team, our Performance Coatings Group leaders, Justin Binn, our new group -- Justin Binns, our new Group President there and our leadership teams there are really focusing in on. So, we're excited about M&A as an important lever. We expect more activity going forward here, but a very disciplined approach, not only in the financial modeling but where we're going to go. We're not, like I say, just trying to buy a book of business. We're looking at good strategic values, and not what's necessarily available driving our strategy. It's what we see going on and pursuing it and making it happen.\nP.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, P.J.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn McNulty: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. The first one would just be on the Consumer Brands Group. Can you speak to where you see the industry in terms of inventory? And is there any necessary catch-up just given the strength that you've been seeing in the markets, but also some of the supply chain disruptions? And maybe how that may flow through as we're looking through the rest of the say the next couple of quarters?\nJohn Morikis: Well, I'd say that there are some challenges, as you mentioned. I think there's a pretty good inventory level in the channel for the most part. But, I'd also say that this natural disaster is just that, it was a disaster. And I also believe that this is a way in which you respond to demonstrate your DNA to your customers. And in our 155th year of doing business, we still utilize these challenges such as this natural disaster to demonstrate why a relationship with Sherwin-Williams is valuable. And so in the face of adversity, we love that our teams are running into the center of the fire working to collaborate with our customers to position them for success, responding, and quite frankly, trying to minimize the disruptions. We think we're unique in our asset base. We think we're unique in our experience. We think we are unique in our ability to respond. And we're trying to utilize every aspect of our assets, our facilities, our people to be able to do that. And I really believe, John, that we'll exit this closer to our customers than ever. And we -- I say that because we're utilizing these assets. It could be -- we've got a very robust fleet of tractor trailers and delivery vehicles. And so, even on the home center front, when product becomes available we're not waiting for someone to come begging a transportation company to come pick up our products or to be responsive to ours. We own those. Those are ours. Those are our people our assets. We can dictate those same with our 4500 stores. I know you asked primarily about the home centers, but same stands true with our own stores, located in the communities they serve with well-trained highly qualified leaders in those stores with inventory close to the customers. We've got reps on both the store's front and the home center front. And so what we're trying to do is be as responsive as we can. And so, while there is some choppiness, if you will, from an inventory standpoint and we're working through those, it's getting better every day. We clearly see this as a transitory issue that we're dealing with. We believe we'll get on top of it. And our goal is to be on the other side, have customers point to Sherwin-Williams and say, we want the rest of you to be just like this.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. No, that makes sense. And then I guess maybe just as a follow-up on the cost side. I think there's obviously a lot of focus on the pet chem side of it. I guess can you speak to some of the other cost baskets, whether it's on the TiO2 and pigment front, or tinplate? It does seem like there's just a lot of general inflation. So, it may not just be the spike up and back down that we're seeing in pet chems, but there maybe more consistent inflation in some of the other buckets. Can you help us to quantify that or think about that as you're progressing throughout the year?\nJim Jaye: Yes. John, I'm happy to take that one. Let me just begin by reiterating a little bit what John and Al have been saying. This whole area of raw material inflation is a transitory issue for us. It's not new for us. We've demonstrated an ability to manage through this many times in the past and we'll get through this as well. You're absolutely right. In our first quarter raws were up by mid-single-digits year-over-year. The biggest driver there was on the petrochem side: monomers resins, solvents, packaging materials. And as you would imagine that hit our Performance Coatings Group a little bit harder with their greater exposure to the pet chem side. That trend is continuing here into our second quarter. If you look at propylene, ethylene, epoxy, HDPE, all of those commodities, they're the highest we've seen in many years and some are at record levels. You take a look at what's driving that across the chemical industry, we've seen a number of things. It was already a challenging environment related to COVID-19. John mentioned Winter Storm Uri. We had 168 production facilities that were offline and disrupted production for an extended period. There's still 60-plus of those facilities offline. Refineries have been operating at below-average utilization rates due to depressed demand for transportation fuels. You've got the demand, as we've talked about screaming both on the architectural and industrial side. So, I mean that's the petrochem side. I know you asked about some of the others. We're seeing similar dynamics there as well. Steel is -- we're seeing increases, supply tightness due to unplanned mill shutdowns, coronavirus outages high demand. So, that's impacting our costs on steel pails and drums. On the TiO2 side, I would say the market's getting a little bit tighter there as well, driven by high demand. You've got the stimulus packages, construction demand, recovery of industrial demand. You've got low inventories and logistical constraints. So, I think TiO2 is moving as well. For all those reasons is why we took up our guide for the year there moving up to that high-single low-double-digit percentage for the full year. 2Q should be the peak. That's how we see it right now. That capacity will come back online. Some of these costs we think will start to moderate. But, as Al mentioned, we'll give you a better view of that at our June 8, FCP event.\nJohn McNulty: Thanks very much for the color and the detail. Appreciate it.\nJohn Morikis: You bet, John.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. John, Al, in Performance Coatings, it looks like in Q2, you'll be above 2019 levels, pretty meaningfully. Why \u2013 how is that being driven by?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. David, you're absolutely right. We should be up high single-digits, low double-digits versus 2019. And I think it's all the things that John talked about in his opening remarks by division. I'll let him jump in on that.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Love to, because I think we're really optimistic about our entire industrial business. All divisions in all regions delivered year-over-year growth in the first quarter. If you look at the market manufacturing, PMI is positive in every region, customer is positive. We do believe that the vaccines should drive stability and comparisons will be favorable moving forward. But this is a terrific leadership team that's leaning forward aggressively and should bode well for us the balance of 2021. As I run through the businesses and I talked about them briefly in my prepared remarks, but if you look at some of these that have really been terrific performers and I'd start with the strong double-digit gains in our industrial wood, we've got really good momentum here. If you look at furniture, kitchen cabinets, flooring, many of these correlate to new residential. We expect that momentum to continue through the first half. And note that the second half, while it may become a bit more challenging as the year goes, this is a team that's really planting a lot of really good seeds with our customers, growing not only through existing customers, we like to say share of wallet but also in new customers. And it's a really good leadership team here. We have high expectations. Talk about our GI business and coming in second with a high teens number is a good place to be. Every region here was up double-digits as well except North America, and North America was up mid-single digits and it continues to show momentum. Again, PMI here is very positive and we expect demand to improve. Good share gains here. We're driving the business in a very positive way. Packaging is another one where demand for food and beverage and cans remains very robust. I've spoken repeatedly about our non-BPA coating. That is continuing to gain traction. Both we and our customers in packaging are investing in additional capacity. We've got terrific partners, good partnership and we anticipate strong demand going forward here for quite some time. I'm really proud of what this team has accomplished. They've delivered for us every quarter since we've acquired Valspar. And between the packaging and coil, not only have we seen terrific growth but we've long been asked about diversifying our business. This really helped us to diversify our business both the packaging and coil. And in coil we see really nice growth. Resumption in commercial projects is picking up, growth in appliances. And again, I've talked about the \u2013 new business wins in this business have really been strong in all regions. So this is another terrific leadership team. And then our automotive refinishes I think has really been something that I've been talking about very positively for a number of quarters. And again this is another terrific quarter for this team. Like others in the market, we experienced significant growth in Asia and to a lesser degree but still significant in Europe. But our strength is here in the Americas. And we believe we're continuing to gain share here through our focus on new accounts and installations, innovation. I mentioned installations in my prepared remarks. We've got more systems and products going here in North America, more installs I believe than we've ever had. I think it's the highest rate we've ever had for this business. And that clearly bodes well for us going forward. And that's in the face of miles driven and collision shop volume that's still off pre-COVID levels. So this industrial business is proving to be everything that we had hoped to do and be. We still have some work obviously in the area of operating margins. Pleased with the momentum that the team has. But there's still a lot of upside. We still think there's upside in the operating margins as well as cash and got, as I mentioned a leadership team that will deliver that. So we're looking forward to it.\nDavid Begleiter: And John that sounds \u2013 that's very impressive and one of the reasons why you'll be raising your segment sales guidance I guess in June 8. But doesn't that imply that the full year guidance could be also conservative as you really \u2013 Performance Coatings itself should be up meaningfully versus current guidance?\nJohn Morikis: Well, like I said, we would normally give you an update at the end of the second quarter. We're going to move that up into early June and we'll give you an update then. But if you're sensing a little bit of bullishness or confidence in all of our voices, I'd say that's probably appropriate.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you very much.\nAl Mistysyn: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Sison: Hey, guys. Nice quarter.\nJohn Morikis: Hey, Mike.\nMike Sison: Just one quick one on Consumer Brands Group. If you were able to hit sort of the up part of the outlook for full year, you'd need third and fourth quarter to be flattish to up on really tough comps. So if that were to occur, is that really just driven by trends in DIY sustaining, or are there things that your team is doing there to create some growth and maybe have some \u2013 gain some shelf space so on and so forth?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. I'd say \u2013 I mentioned earlier, the PROs who paint is an important initiative one that we expect. Mike I feel really good. We had a terrific year and we continue to post some terrific numbers in our CBG business. We've got terrific partners here and they're committed to growing and we're committed to growing and investing in our businesses together. I think the way it exactly plays out from a timing perspective and kind of shifts in the market, that's yet to be seen. But we're committed to this business and we're committed to our customers. And one way or the other we're going to help them be better at what it is they're doing. And we're willing to execute on that, invest in it and deliver on it. And you can count on that leadership team, wonderful leadership. Already you could see some of that work as Al mentioned in different parts of the world. But got a leadership team here in Brian Patton and Todd Rea that are doing a wonderful job, getting close to our customers and really delivering for them. And we expect that to continue. We're holding them accountable to do that.\nMike Sison: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to ask you maybe Al on the inventory level. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that it's down $100 million or so year-over-year, despite sales being up $500 million and raws are obviously up. So just curious about two things; one, is there any risk of any sort of supply constraints on your side that might curtail some volume upside? It sounds like maybe moat risk maybe in the second quarter or potentially later in the year particularly if they're -- we have another bad hurricane season or something like that? And then secondly, I'm just curious if you're seeing -- maybe this is more in The Americas Group, but I'll ask it for the rest of the segments as well whether some of your smaller competitors are at all volume-constrained as far as you can tell? And is that providing opportunities for you? \nJohn Morikis: Yes. Vincent why don't I take that? Because I think the raw material supply issue is something that I tried to touch on before. And I would say that, as Jim mentioned that 168 facilities in the petrochem industry going offline. It had an impact on not just the paint industry, but many industries. And as diversified as we are in supply base and geographically, when something like this happens it's a significant natural disaster. It's going to impact many industries. It has impacted us. And so, we're working hard with our suppliers. To be very clear we want to be the ones that stand out amongst our customers with the greatest supply, but there are challenges right now. And a natural disaster like this is going to be challenging. As I mentioned and we have mentioned repeatedly, we believe it's transitory. We think that we'll get on top of this. I think the fact that we have the tenure in our leadership team in our global supply chain, as well as procurement gives me great confidence the asset base that we have and the responsiveness and quite frankly the willingness to do whatever it is. Where we can get product in, we'll ship it from wherever we can make it the fastest to get it to our customers to serve them properly. And we're doing a lot of that right now. And so, it is a real issue. It's getting better, but it's one that we've dealt with. And as far as our competitors, yes, I'd say, as I mentioned all of our competitors are feeling the same pressures. What I'm really proud of and I've mentioned these leaders Heidi Petz, Justin Binns, Brian Patton every one of them when we talk, there's not one of them that are sitting there talking about, Boy there are challenges. The challenges that we're talking about are how quickly we can grow, how fast we can be in front of our customers, how fast we can be in front of our competitors' customers. And so while some might be in a similar situation from a raw material, very few have the ability to respond like Sherwin-Williams. And yes, we're trying to take advantage of that. We're trying to turn those into customers. So you should expect that we're aggressively in front of those customers right now talking about our products our services and how we can help our customers make money. \nVincent Andrews: Okay. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. I think in TAG you talked about property management being down. So maybe if you could just give us a little bit more color on how the trends are moving there both sequentially and year-over-year and what you expect for the rest of the year?\nJohn Morikis: Yes I'd say recovery would be choppy would be the best way that I would describe that. It's improved sequentially, but was down by mid-single digit in the quarter. As we went through the quarter, the results got better. Now some of that came from comparisons that were a little bit easier. But we believe that, there's a meaningful recovery underfoot in this business. I'd say that aligns with Dodge whose non-building starts are forecasted to rebound in the mid to high single digit range. We continue to gain good momentum here by diversifying this business. And I'd say that -- when you look at our property management I'd say, we're in a leadership position here. We've got great determination to continue to grow. But I'd say, also I think it's important is we're seeing more activity in our Southeast and Southwestern divisions where there are fewer, I'll call them governors -- or COVID governors compared to the Midwest and Eastern areas. I'd say that comps are more favorable over the rest of the year. But again, just as we've talked earlier we're not waiting for comps to get easier to be a way to demonstrate. We're on attack. We're attacking right now. And a lot of these customers, some of this might fall a little bit between property maintenance and a little bit of the commercial side. But if you look at the tourist industry, many are starting and expecting for that to pick up. And we expect some of those facilities as they start to get better utilization rates to again begin investing more in that business as well. So we're positioned really well. We're -- we've got I believe a good strong leadership position here great relationships and a lot of determination. \nVincent Andrews: Thanks so much. Look forward to the event in June.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Vincent.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes, good afternoon. Within the US would you speak to the regional trends that you saw in the quarter in your US architectural business and whether or not there was a topline impact from Uri? And then looking out maybe over the medium term, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on demographic trends? More people seem to be moving to Florida and Texas. Is that an issue that's hit your radar screen from the point of view of strategy or capital allocation as it relates to your store base for example? \nJohn Morikis: Yes. We love people moving regardless of where they move and we like them to paint and change their mind on the color a couple of times while they're doing that. So we're positioned very well. The Southeast and Southwestern divisions are terrific markets for us. The density of our stores is high there, but there's still plenty of opportunity. We talked about resuming our store count new stores up into the 80-plus range. We're excited about that. I think we have good coverage in the divisions that are the benefactors of some of that movement, but there's still opportunities and we love the shift that might be taking place if it be permanent or temporary. If you look at -- you talked about the demographic or the performance by area. The largest growth that we had was in our Canadian division. This team has been working really hard at executing up there over the last few years. We've been making a lot of investments. So quite frankly our expectations are high for this division, but they're delivering. I'd say as I mentioned the Southeastern division is another area a terrific leader in Todd Wipf down in that area that has been down there for quite some time and is doing a terrific job leading his team. Midwestern Southwestern and the Eastern divisions came in, in order and I'd say, all of them have terrific leaders and are executing. So I was trying to be cute there, Kevin about the move. But the reality is, is that as there's shift in demographics we think we're really well positioned. And we'll capitalize on it wherever it goes largely because of our relationships with the contractors that are going to be on the receiving end.\nKevin McCarthy: Understood. And then just on the housekeeping side, how would you characterize the level of earnings dilution associated with your divestiture of Wattyl?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah, Kevin, if you look at the remaining three quarters, the impact on consumer would be about close to 5%. And then the profit is immaterial. Hence the portfolio reviews that we complete on a regular basis looking at customer\u2019s brands, businesses we set midterm -- it's got to be not just sales targets but scale and growth targets. And we have to look at our operating margin, RONA, and cash flow. And we don't believe these businesses or programs can meet those targets, we decide they could be better served with somebody else.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDuffy Fischer: Yeah. Good morning fellows.\nJohn Morikis: Hey Duffy.\nAl Mistysyn: Hey Duffy.\nDuffy Fischer: Hi guys. Just one question for me. I just want to triangulate a couple of Al's comments. So you talked about volume being the biggest driver of margin expansion. But if you use your EBIT number and just look at the incremental margins, TAG came in at 46% year-over-year, consumer was 39%. But consumer grew a lot more than TAG did. So can you just talk about the puts and takes of why TAG was able to have meaningfully higher incremental margins than consumer even though it didn't have the volume growth?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. I would say Duffy the -- a couple of reasons. Strong volume in TAG, the high same-store sales increased 8.2% versus a strong 7.4% last year. And the product mix within TAG was favorable. Residential repaint was strong. DIY was strong. New res was strong. We saw double-digit growth in exterior. So -- and the price increase effectiveness was strong in our first quarter, all leading to that high flow-through of 46%. Consumer flow-through at 39%. I'll just say it happy -- really happy with that strong flow-through. And the team has been and we've talked about this investing in the Pro who paints in our home center channels, driving those investments. We also had a little bit of a mix shift as Asia Pacific and Europe grows faster than the U.S. Even though we're seeing nice improvement in the operating margins there, it does dilute our consolidated margins. So those are kind of the high-level factors that would impact that. And the last thing I would say is the consumer\u2019s price increase did come in a little bit -- on a little bit more of a lag in the first quarter -- towards the end of the first quarter to our second quarter. And then they also get the benefit of the Ace business being -- us walking away from the Ace business.\nDuffy Fischer: Perfect. Okay, thank you guys.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Duffy.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. I want to make sure we beat to death this raw material and inventory issue that's there. Did you have to shift your production mix at all due to any limited availability of raws? Did you maybe have to make more vinyl instead of acrylic or more urethane instead of epoxy?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. I'd say, we're shifting all the time though John. The timing of arrivals of raw materials or the plants that is going to be manufactured \u2013 manufacturing, we might have seen a little bit more of that than usual here given the obvious situation. But I'd say that's something that we do. And when I mentioned earlier about the strength of doing business with Sherwin-Williams that's the benefit of a company like ours, the capacity that we have, the assets that we have, quite frankly the purchasing power that we have. There's a lot of opportunities on an everyday basis. Here now with this situation as products become available, we're able to utilize our assets the best ability -- to our best ability.\nJohn Roberts: And then are you still seeing strong spray equipment sales in the stores as a leading indicator consistent with some of the growth outlooks that you've projected?\nJohn Morikis: Yes we are.\nJohn Roberts: All right. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks John.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nEdlain Rodriguez: Thank you. Good afternoon guys.\nJohn Morikis: Good afternoon.\nEdlain Rodriguez: One quick one. Like in terms of the businesses that are still under some pressure like commercial paint, Protective and Marine, and a little bit of auto refinish, like are you seeing any real fundamental improvement in those businesses? And when do you expect to start seeing maybe pre-COVID levels in some of those businesses?\nJohn Morikis: I would say that we're seeing sequential improvement in all of them and we expect that to continue. The timing on pre-COVID levels, we'd like to see that obviously sooner than later. We're working hard with our teams to be able to reach those levels. A little hard to give that projection by division in this format, but you should expect that that is absolutely our intent.\nEdlain Rodriguez: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nArun Viswanathan: All right. Thanks for taking my question here guys. I guess, I just wanted to circle back at a lot of the strength that you've seen and your expectations maybe in future periods. So, obviously, you've seen double-digit growth in resi repaint for many periods. That seems like it's actually going to continue. But you've also seen a recovery on the new side. If you were to just think about those two dynamics, do you feel that paint stores will continue to grow next year at a say 1.5 to two times the market clip?\nJohn Morikis: Yes.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. That was easy. And then I guess maybe on the industrial side similarly, we have a nice recovery going on now. But you saw some nice strength in refinish. You've discussed packaging at length. What areas of that business are potentially still below normal that you may expect to see recovery in future periods as well?\nJohn Morikis: In the industrial business you're asking?\nArun Viswanathan: Yes.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. I would absolutely say that we're pleased with the momentum in our automotive refinish. There's a lot of seeds that are being planted. Our expectations for that business are very high. I think even with the growth that we are experiencing in GI and industrial wood, we expect that momentum to continue. I'd say coil is going to continue to grow. You know what, let me just save some time here. We have expectations for every one of those divisions to continue to grow. There's a lot of upside. Our position in the market there's -- we're not sitting here with an enormous amount of market share here where we can't grow. I mean, there's opportunities in every one of those businesses. We believe we have the product technology, the assets and most importantly the people to be able to execute on that. And so our expectations are very high for each one of those businesses, both on the sales and operating margin from both perspectives.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks, John.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nJim Jaye: Thanks, Arun.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nGarik Shmois: Great. Thanks. Just one question for me. Just looking for some clarification on TAG pricing and just recognizing there could be some upside later this year. But of the -- you got 1.7% in the first quarter. You expect 2% or better the following quarters. Is that 2% total, or is that 2% on top of the 1.7% you just got? I'm assuming, it's the same as your last outlook but I just wanted to be sure.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. That's 2% in total and it's maybe even a little bit better than the prior effectiveness of price increases that we've done.\nGarik Shmois: Great. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Harrison: Hi, good afternoon.\nJohn Morikis: Hey Mike.\nMike Harrison: I wanted to dig in a little bit on this opportunity with PROs who paint at Lowe's. And it sounds like they've talked about some success in bringing these people into the stores. Do you have any metrics that you can share on what kind of benefit you've seen in the paint aisle? And maybe talk about what specific product lines at Lowe's you're gearing toward the PRO market or how you're positioning to better serve them.\nJohn Morikis: Mike, we do have metrics, none that we can share. I mean, these would be our customers' metrics that we feel, it's very important in that relationship for them to discuss and to share. And I would also say, even from a product offering targeting those customers -- and I'll talk about our stores and maybe use that to reflect on the business that you're asking about. If you look at our high-end products, many of those are sold to the DIY customer, but many are also sold to the residential repaint contractors. So, I don't know that you would find customers in our stores that are professional, that are not buying some product at nearly every price point that we offer. And so the work that we're doing on the PROs that paint, targets the same type of breadth of product. There are customers that are maybe very high-end or upscale homes that want to use the very best. And there are others quite frankly that might be in different price points, but have also recognized that the largest cost of their goods -- cost of goods is in labor and they make more money using a higher-quality paint. So, we're not only designing products for PROs or DIY customers. We're designing products for the end application with the idea of the applicator in mind. So, we do build some PRO products, largely on the commercial side that are maybe more geared towards that application. But when you go into a home center, you're going to find those PROs typically shopping throughout the entire product line.\nMike Harrison: All right. And also wanted to revisit the Wattyl divestiture. Just wondering kind of what this says about your international expansion plans or strategy on the architectural side. Maybe comment on why Wattyl wasn't a good fit. And it's been a little while since we talked about China on the architectural side. Any comments there?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. I'd say, Mike, it's a great question and one I'd like to touch on because, I think it demonstrates the discipline as well as strategy. So my message is -- to a shareholder would be, we are committed. We are committed to growth and we're making investments in those areas that we believe have the opportunity to reach the long-term targets that Al just walked through. We're not interested in just a book of business. We're not interested in practice. We know how to make paint. Our shareholders expect a return on their investment and that's what we're out to do. So we're looking at programs. We're looking at geographies. We're looking at customer programs themselves to understand, which ones are viable and meaningful to both our customers and our shareholders. And in those areas, where we can see the long-term investments paying off, we're going to invest. We're going to get in there and grind out, what needs to be done to win. But we're not going to be in some part of the world -- other part of the world, expending our time and our treasure in areas that doesn't offer the return that our shareholders deserve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nTruman Patterson: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll try and be quick because I know we're getting late. First question on TAG and Performance Coatings Group. Clearly different pricing dynamics, different raw material baskets and potential inflationary pressures. You all mentioned some gross margin compression near term. Is either segment at risk of just kind of greater compression over the next quarter? And then, either segment, will it take a little bit longer to recover all the inflationary pressures?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Truman, I would say just because of the size of the petrochem side of the basket moving higher than the others short term, we would see more of a compression on PCG. But as you know and as I talked about for the year, we're not focused on gross margin compression or expansion alone. It's a combination of things. We're focused on operating margin growth and that comes in many ways starting with volume. And we are showing strong volumes in Performance Coatings Group in TAG, the selling price increases and as I talked about PCG has incremental selling price increases coming into our second quarter and getting leverage on SG&A. And where we fall out on the operating margin improvement is really driven by that volume first. But you can have confidence in our discipline and resolve about getting price increases, if we need them later in the year to offset dollar for dollar the raw material increases across all businesses.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Okay. That's really helpful. So in PCG, primarily a bit more compression just due to raw materials rather than an inability to dip pricing at least moving forward. Okay. And then just -- this has been asked a couple of different ways, but I just want to ask a bit more directly and make sure, I'm not missing anything. DIY in the US through April, you all aren't seeing any slowing whatsoever? And the reason that I'm asking is, it looks like in consumer, the second quarter sales guide looks a little soft, but I think that might include the Wattyl divestiture. So just wanting to understand that. \nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Truman, it does include about 4% in it for Wattyl.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. But you're not seeing any deceleration in DIY in April?\nAl Mistysyn: Let me say it this way. April sales are within our guidance.\nTruman Patterson: Certainly.\nJohn Morikis: You\u2019re a good man, Truman. It's within our guidance.\nTruman Patterson: All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck on the upcoming quarter.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Truman.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your questions.\nJustin Speer: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Just a few questions here. One on, just following up that DIY paint, maybe not through your retail partners, but through your stores. How did the DIY point-of-sale trends look through the quarter to exit the quarter maybe even to April? And maybe, if you could help us maybe understand, in terms of its guidance for the second quarter, how much of that may be tied to managing your retail customers, managing inventories, or perhaps just the supply chain disruptions versus underlying demand slowing?\nJohn Morikis: No. I'd say that -- is it -- I'm not quite sure I understand your question. Is it -- \nAl Mistysyn: I would say, Justin, it's not demand slowing. I think we're showing a strong top line sales guidance. So, it's not related to anything restocking or inventory level holder pushes within the retail channel. But up mid to high teens on a consolidated basis and strong improvements across each of the segments or TAG and PCG in particular, that's driven by the underlying demand trends. That's not anything related to the inventory. CBG down low double digits to mid-teens. We have the Wattyl impact. But even with that guidance, we're still going to be up mid- to high teens relative to the second quarter of 2019. So we're not giving it all back and we're maintaining some momentum there.\nJohn Morikis: With an effort on trying to grow, as I mentioned earlier, on the -- through those retail customers with the PROs that paint as well.\nJustin Speer: For sure. Yes, I recognize there's just tremendous growth. And I know that you're looking at maybe toggling back to low single, but maybe there's some phasing and some timing where maybe we tilt negative and that's what you're guiding to. But it sounds like that's a view towards maybe end demand versus inventory situation, it's more of a view that end demand for whatever reason, the second quarter is going to be a little bit softer year-over-year for your business through retail, but not necessarily -- and then maybe, but I guess the question I have, is that a reflection of the actual end demand to the customer that you're expecting there?\nJohn Morikis: Well, what we are saying is that, as people go back to work, they're not going to be home painting. And if that occurs then there is a little less DIY business. We think Sherwin-Williams is uniquely positioned to capture it in other areas of the business. So if people are going back to work and more painters are coming to their homes while they're at work, we're going to pick that up. If the people are going back to work in their plants, the production of those plants are going to be up on -- and going online, we're going to pick it up there. So I can go through in great detail, Justin. But I know you know this business very well and we've had this discussion a number of times. Our view is that we've been working hard, quite frankly, for years for this moment. Whichever way the business tilts, we're there, and we're going to capitalize on it. And if it's in DIY, we're there. If it's in res repaint, we're there. If it's in new residential, property maintenance, commercial, property management, whatever it is, we're there and we're going to capitalize on it.\nJustin Speer: It makes sense. And, yes, you have a great portfolio to adapt to the dynamics. The last question I have is on the free cash flow margin expectation for this year. You had a very, very strong last year on that front. How are you thinking about the phasing of free cash flow margins this year?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Justin, we are expecting to be even a little bit above the 12.5%, 13% net operating cash targets we've set for ourselves. And then with our CapEx, our core CapEx below 2%, but we also have the building our future $100 million that we talked about. So if I look at net operating cash, less CapEx, we've talked about being above that 11.5%. And I think, we might be a little bit below that just because of the extra $100 million, but I do expect strong net operating cash for the year.\nJustin Speer: Excellent. Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Justin.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for taking my question. I have just one quick question on the potential infrastructure bill. How much of your Performance Coatings would benefit from it? And what technologies do you need in order to have a bigger impact?\nJohn Morikis: Rosemarie, it's a great question. It's something that has us very excited. Our Protective & Marine business is a terrific business, positioned very well. I think a big part of it -- and I think, you know as well as most that have tried to follow what this infrastructure bill might look like, I think, we all recognize that there's a lot of variability in what might be coming down the pipe here. So maybe just the pieces and parts. If it's -- we have a terrific position in water and wastewater. We have a terrific position in -- we say, bridge and highway, but it's -- ours is on the high-value end of the bridge work. If you look at airport investments, virtually any infrastructure that goes in we'd be very well positioned to be there. And I say very well positioned and I might say, because it's -- you asked about technology. We do have very unique technologies from floor to ceiling. And our goal there is to ensure that the coatings that we provide, not only offer tremendous protection, but we have very unique systems that allow our coatings to have the assets put back in place quickly, a rapid return to service we refer to them. So polyaspartic coatings that can be coated/recoated quickly and put back in place, so that bridge lane closures down considerably or floors can be recoated and put back in place quickly. All of these are part of the product offering that we bring, that our customers have learned to expect and quite frankly we work very hard to get [Indiscernible]. So depending on what comes out in that bill, we think we're going to be very well positioned to capitalize on it.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Can you quantify how much of your business could benefit? Let's pretend for a second that the whole thing goes through.\nJohn Morikis: I don't know how to quantify that until we see the reality of -- I can appreciate for your modeling, but that'd be purely speculation on our part right now. I will say this, Rosemarie we're very well positioned to capitalize on it.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Okay. And do you need additional technologies? Obviously, it sounds as though this is what you are going to be looking for in terms of M&A. Can you share with us, the gaps in your technology portfolio?\nJohn Morikis: We would not do that publicly now. We do recognize that there are opportunities. We're out looking at some of those, but we wouldn't want to flag those areas that we're pursuing M&A targets right now. \nRosemarie Morbelli: And \u2026\nJohn Morikis: [Indiscernible]\nRosemarie Morbelli: I am sorry. And still on the M&A, I presume that you are not looking at anything the size of a Valspar? We are talking more about bolt-on type of acquisitions?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. I think there -- we've spoken openly about, how long we coveted that Valspar business. I don't think there's another Valspar out there. There are opportunities for us but not something like a Valspar.\nRosemarie Morbelli: Okay. Thank you very much and good luck.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin Hocevar: Hey. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in. Al, I just wanted to follow up on -- you mentioned the expectation of pricing offsetting raw material inflation this year. And if I did some back-of-the-envelope math raw is 85% of COGS; expected inflation 10% at the midpoint. That seems to imply something like 4% to 5% pricing for the total company for the full year. And assuming the pricing will ramp throughout the year that's probably higher than that in the back half of the year. And you've already addressed, TAG kind of 2% pricing plus going forward. And we'll see if when -- if or when you, do another price increase there. But can you kind of talk about pricing in the other segments? And how -- is that the type of pricing you're expecting based on the actions that you're taking there? And then, we'll kind of see what you guys end up doing with TAG?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Kevin, I think what you can expect is, we'll continue to monitor the raw material basket as we normally do. And if it persists at these levels then, yeah, typically if -- to offset the dollars you got to get about 50% of the raw material increase just because of the way the sales COGS dynamic works. So -- and to be fair, some businesses within industrial are going higher than others, just because of the dynamics within that specific business. So I would say that, my expectation is still that we'd offset the raw dollars -- dollar per dollar wood price. And to be clear, if we don't see that happening Kevin, we'll offset it with other internal savings and SG&A, and other levers that we have to pull. So, I don't want to leave here, thinking that, boy, if I don't give -- if they don't get price they're not going to offset the raw material increase. That's absolutely not the case. We'll look at all levers that we have available, because again our focus is growing operating margin.\nKevin Hocevar: Yeah. Okay. And one other quick one on -- in the retail -- with the retail partners, I think last year there wasn't really much in the way of promotion. But now that we're entering the paint season and there tends to be, promotions around some of the holidays. Curious, if you're aware of what the promotion activity will look like this year.\nJohn Morikis: We are. But it's not something that we would discuss out of respect for our customers.\nKevin Hocevar: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Well, thanks. I'll keep it to one. Surprised, I still have it. Just want to make sure that the raw material high single-digit, low double-digits, is that an industry forecast as opposed to a Sherwin forecast? And...\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah, sir.\nGreg Melich: Yeah? And then, if that's the case, is this one of those odd years where just given the chasing of inventory to stay in stock for your customers, that your raw material bill might be up as much as the industry or even more?\nJim Jaye: It's an industry forecast, Greg is what I would say. I don't know Al if you have any other, comments on that.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. I mean, Greg to your point, if you look, at -- because we're on a last-in first-out basis in North America is the largest portion of our sales. We -- I would say it this way we would be higher because of the rapid increase this year, than we might be in other years where it's maybe more muted. That would be the way I kind of frame that.\nGreg Melich: So it would be -- I mean obviously you guys are going to buy well. But we shouldn't assume that, you would be less than the industry this year, given just the uniqueness of it?\nAl Mistysyn: Okay. I wouldn't make any assumption around that. I don't know what our peers are buying and what prices they're at. I just -- I understand, where we're at and we're trying to explain hey if a year-over-year on a rapidly increasing like it is in this year versus a more stable, our costs are going to be up higher because of that last...\nJohn Morikis: We might be in the spot a little bit -- spot market a little bit more or doing those things that we need to keep our customers in business. And so, there might be a little more volatility this year than other years.\nGreg Melich: Makes total sense, thank you. And I guess, on volume, I just want to make sure, I got it right. You don't think there was any material volume impact from being out of stock. It sounds like there may have been some but it may have been 50bps of volume demand not hundreds of bps?\nJohn Morikis: Nothing material.\nGreg Melich: Okay. Thank you. Good luck. Great job.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session for today. I'll hand the call back to Jim Jaye, for closing remarks.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Jim before you jump in here let me just -- there were some really good questions. I just want to circle back on just a couple of points. One I think that -- I think it's important to understand how confident we are. We have a proven ability to grow in the most difficult markets I think top line and bottom-line. I believe we're executing our strategy and that's uniquely positioned us to outperform the market and we believe our peers. We had a couple of points here that I think are important to reemphasize and that's the commitment we have to making strategic investments in stores and innovation in reps both, technical rep, sales and specification reps as well and all driving towards solutions and those solutions that help our customers to be more successful. And those services and products we think are an important element, not only in the ability to help our customers be more successful, but in our building that relationship with those customers. And I think managing through these periods of times highlights, the proven record I think of the company and the leadership team, I think most importantly the terrific Sherwin-Williams team members that are closest to our customers every day. We've got great confidence in our position. And more importantly, I think great confidence in our future. I've said this before, I believe, we're just getting started. And I think that best frames the mentality of this leadership team. We're proud of what we've accomplished. We're not complacent. We think we're just getting started. And we're looking forward to the future. So Jim, I'll kick it over to you to talk about the FCP.\nJim Jaye: Yeah, just a couple of housekeeping items on the virtual financial community presentation. That's going to be at 2 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, June 8. Again, that's Tuesday, June 8. Registration for that will be available on our Investor Relations website very shortly. As you heard multiple times today, we'll give you an update the full year. We'll also have some newer things this year with other members of our management team around technology and ESG. So that should be a great event. If you need more information, you can reach out to Natalie Darr and my team. And with that, I want to just thank everybody for joining our call. As always, myself, Eric Swanson, we'll be available to answer any other questions you might have. So, have a great day. And thanks for your interest in Sherwin.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Al Mistysyn",
            "content": "Hey, Ghansham, this is Al. And as I said on our January earnings call, we did have a weaker first half last year and a stronger second half. So it was important that we got off to a strong start in the first half. As you mentioned, we did start off the first quarter strong, and we're ahead of our guidance. Honestly, the second quarter sales guidance was closer to where we expected it to be based on the strong trends, we saw coming out of the fourth quarter into our first quarter those continued strong trends, especially in TAG and PCG. So those momentums carried and we're going against a weaker second quarter last year. But that being said, the first quarter is a small quarter for us. And as we typically do, we wait and get through the second quarter before we give an update on the full year. And as John mentioned in his opening remarks, which generally would be in July. So as John mentioned in his opening remarks, we're prepared to give an update on the full year sales and EPS guidance at our June 8 financial community presentation. So, not too far in the future, but gives us a good outlook and more data points to give you a better view of the year. Yes. Ghansham let me just add to that. As John talked about in his opening remarks, our focus is on operating margin expansion. And volume is the number one driver of that and you're seeing that in our first half. And our expectation is that we'll see that momentum going into our second half, but also selling price increases that have been planned. And I've brought in that to not just TAG, but across all the segments. And my expectation is that we will offset full year raw material increases dollar for dollar. We expect to get leverage on SG&A. That will more than offset that gross margin contraction. And that's typical. As you know gross margin -- short-term gross margin contraction is typical in an inflationary environment. We've shown our discipline to get pricing increases. To your question, you go back to 2010, 2011 and 2012 and we were out with six price increases in 22 months. And coming out of that you saw our gross margin not only recover, but expand from almost 600 basis points from 2013 through 2016. So the discipline is there and it's still there. And as John talked about we're providing solutions to our customers that they value. And this is why it's really important that we offset that raw material increases 85% of our cost of goods sold. And to provide those services and solutions at the high level our customers are expecting, we need to offset those raw materials. And as John said if raw materials inflation persists at these high levels, we will need to go out with another price increase later this year. And then we believe we're in that same environment. As raw materials moderate, we'll start to see our margins recover and then grow long-term, as we see our continuous improvement processes take effect and we're able to hold on to a majority of those price increases. Thank you. Yeah, Bob. And I would expect, if you looked at those two businesses combined, so as John talked about moderating DIY and stronger in the other segments, we still expect our second half to be up mid- to high single digits in those combined architectural businesses if you will. Yeah. I think you'd be looking close to a low double-digit increase over that second half period as well. Yeah, Steve. What I said to Ghansham, we're going to look at updating our full year sales and EPS guidance at the June 8th, FCP conference. So \u2013 and it didn't make sense to me to try to take a look at one segment adjust the sales and not the whole company. So we're going to give you an update for all the segments and the full year at that meeting. Yes. And Steve I'd just add to that where we could on the industrial side which really saw a rapid increase in the raw materials over the last 30, 60 days we just delayed the pricing maybe 30 days, so we can go out with a higher increase than we had planned. And so we saw some of our groups or businesses out April 1. But we are out across all businesses and all divisions. And we talked about expecting to see a kind of growth in the selling price realization from around 1.7% in our first quarter a little over 2% in our second quarter. And then we'll evaluate as we normally do month-to-month and take action where we need to. And certainly we would tell our customers first and then communicate to The Street. Thank you, Steve. Jeff I would say -- and our SG&A was actually consolidated all in up about 1.4%. And the costs are related to new stores reps continued investment in Consumer Brands and the customer programs and additional services and reps in our Performance Coatings Group and then the e-commerce initiative continued investments there. We do have a decrease -- a continued decrease in travel year-over-year. That hasn't -- we haven't really fully turned that back on. But as these economies start reopening we'll see some of that. I would say in the environment we're in we're going to focus on continuing to put investments in. And where we can offset non-value activities and/or some of our back-office functions we'll do the savings there to help offset those investments. But we're going to continue to invest in this environment. And you should expect to see increase in -- modest increase in our SG&A going forward. Yes, I think Jeff we set full year targets at the beginning of the year and the comp will be dependent on our achievement of those targets. If you look sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and -- fourth quarter last year to first quarter this year, we would have more comp in our fourth quarter last year. As we typically do we true-up our accrual towards the end of the year. And with the strong fourth quarter we had we did have more comp expense in our fourth quarter including stock comp. P.J. that's -- if you go back to the first quarter of 2020 that was certainly -- the Ace impact was part of it. Really we had a difficult because of COVID Asia-Pacific was down really big and impacted our first quarter and even some of the moderation we saw in our other international businesses. We really had a strong first quarter with our international businesses up. When I say strong double digits we're talking 50%-plus. We saw a nice flow-through there. And the sell-through on the DIY side was still strong with our retail partners both here and outside the US. Thanks, P.J. Yes. David, you're absolutely right. We should be up high single-digits, low double-digits versus 2019. And I think it's all the things that John talked about in his opening remarks by division. I'll let him jump in on that. Thank you, David. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, Kevin, if you look at the remaining three quarters, the impact on consumer would be about close to 5%. And then the profit is immaterial. Hence the portfolio reviews that we complete on a regular basis looking at customer's brands, businesses we set midterm -- it's got to be not just sales targets but scale and growth targets. And we have to look at our operating margin, RONA, and cash flow. And we don't believe these businesses or programs can meet those targets, we decide they could be better served with somebody else. Hey Duffy. Yeah. I would say Duffy the -- a couple of reasons. Strong volume in TAG, the high same-store sales increased 8.2% versus a strong 7.4% last year. And the product mix within TAG was favorable. Residential repaint was strong. DIY was strong. New res was strong. We saw double-digit growth in exterior. So -- and the price increase effectiveness was strong in our first quarter, all leading to that high flow-through of 46%. Consumer flow-through at 39%. I'll just say it happy -- really happy with that strong flow-through. And the team has been and we've talked about this investing in the Pro who paints in our home center channels, driving those investments. We also had a little bit of a mix shift as Asia Pacific and Europe grows faster than the U.S. Even though we're seeing nice improvement in the operating margins there, it does dilute our consolidated margins. So those are kind of the high-level factors that would impact that. And the last thing I would say is the consumer's price increase did come in a little bit -- on a little bit more of a lag in the first quarter -- towards the end of the first quarter to our second quarter. And then they also get the benefit of the Ace business being -- us walking away from the Ace business. Yes. That's 2% in total and it's maybe even a little bit better than the prior effectiveness of price increases that we've done. Thanks. Yes. Truman, I would say just because of the size of the petrochem side of the basket moving higher than the others short term, we would see more of a compression on PCG. But as you know and as I talked about for the year, we're not focused on gross margin compression or expansion alone. It's a combination of things. We're focused on operating margin growth and that comes in many ways starting with volume. And we are showing strong volumes in Performance Coatings Group in TAG, the selling price increases and as I talked about PCG has incremental selling price increases coming into our second quarter and getting leverage on SG&A. And where we fall out on the operating margin improvement is really driven by that volume first. But you can have confidence in our discipline and resolve about getting price increases, if we need them later in the year to offset dollar for dollar the raw material increases across all businesses. Yes. Truman, it does include about 4% in it for Wattyl. Let me say it this way. April sales are within our guidance. I would say, Justin, it's not demand slowing. I think we're showing a strong top line sales guidance. So, it's not related to anything restocking or inventory level holder pushes within the retail channel. But up mid to high teens on a consolidated basis and strong improvements across each of the segments or TAG and PCG in particular, that's driven by the underlying demand trends. That's not anything related to the inventory. CBG down low double digits to mid-teens. We have the Wattyl impact. But even with that guidance, we're still going to be up mid- to high teens relative to the second quarter of 2019. So we're not giving it all back and we're maintaining some momentum there. Yes. Justin, we are expecting to be even a little bit above the 12.5%, 13% net operating cash targets we've set for ourselves. And then with our CapEx, our core CapEx below 2%, but we also have the building our future $100 million that we talked about. So if I look at net operating cash, less CapEx, we've talked about being above that 11.5%. And I think, we might be a little bit below that just because of the extra $100 million, but I do expect strong net operating cash for the year. Yeah. Kevin, I think what you can expect is, we'll continue to monitor the raw material basket as we normally do. And if it persists at these levels then, yeah, typically if -- to offset the dollars you got to get about 50% of the raw material increase just because of the way the sales COGS dynamic works. So -- and to be fair, some businesses within industrial are going higher than others, just because of the dynamics within that specific business. So I would say that, my expectation is still that we'd offset the raw dollars -- dollar per dollar wood price. And to be clear, if we don't see that happening Kevin, we'll offset it with other internal savings and SG&A, and other levers that we have to pull. So, I don't want to leave here, thinking that, boy, if I don't give -- if they don't get price they're not going to offset the raw material increase. That's absolutely not the case. We'll look at all levers that we have available, because again our focus is growing operating margin. Thanks Kevin. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Greg to your point, if you look, at -- because we're on a last-in first-out basis in North America is the largest portion of our sales. We -- I would say it this way we would be higher because of the rapid increase this year, than we might be in other years where it's maybe more muted. That would be the way I kind of frame that. Okay. I wouldn't make any assumption around that. I don't know what our peers are buying and what prices they're at. I just -- I understand, where we're at and we're trying to explain hey if a year-over-year on a rapidly increasing like it is in this year versus a more stable, our costs are going to be up higher because of that last... Yeah. Jim before you jump in here let me just -- there were some really good questions. I just want to circle back on just a couple of points. One I think that -- I think it's important to understand how confident we are. We have a proven ability to grow in the most difficult markets I think top line and bottom-line. I believe we're executing our strategy and that's uniquely positioned us to outperform the market and we believe our peers. We had a couple of points here that I think are important to reemphasize and that's the commitment we have to making strategic investments in stores and innovation in reps both, technical rep, sales and specification reps as well and all driving towards solutions and those solutions that help our customers to be more successful. And those services and products we think are an important element, not only in the ability to help our customers be more successful, but in our building that relationship with those customers. And I think managing through these periods of times highlights, the proven record I think of the company and the leadership team, I think most importantly the terrific Sherwin-Williams team members that are closest to our customers every day. We've got great confidence in our position. And more importantly, I think great confidence in our future. I've said this before, I believe, we're just getting started. And I think that best frames the mentality of this leadership team. We're proud of what we've accomplished. We're not complacent. We think we're just getting started. And we're looking forward to the future. So Jim, I'll kick it over to you to talk about the FCP."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. We're off to a tremendous start in 2021. Credit goes to all 61,000 members of our team who are serving our customers at a high level, aggressively pursuing and capturing new business and managing through transitory disruptions in the supply chain. There is no better team in the industry. Demand was robust across both architectural and industrial businesses in the quarter, particularly in March where sales were well above our forecast. We're seeing very positive trends as economies continue to reopen. As we've often said, volume is the strongest driver of our results and we leveraged the strong growth to deliver improved profitability in every segment in the quarter. In The Americas Group first quarter sales increased by 8.6% over the same period a year ago, including about 1.7 percentage points of price. The impact of unfavorable currency translation was not material. Same-store sales in the US and Canada were up 8.2% against a high single-digit comparison. In residential repaint, our largest segment, we delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter against a double-digit comparison. We have grown this business by double-digits for five consecutive years. We expect this momentum to continue. Contractors are reporting solid backlogs and interior and exterior were both very strong. Demand remained unprecedented in our DIY business where sales were up by double-digit percentage for the fifth consecutive quarter. New residential also remained an area of strength for us with low double-digit growth in the quarter against a high single-digit comparison. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer and customers are reporting solid order rates. Momentum is gradually building in our commercial business where sales in the quarter were up low single-digits against a solid quarter a year ago. Projects continue to resume at varying paces and comparisons are favorable over the remainder of the year. Property maintenance was down slightly in the quarter, though turnover in multifamily properties is improving. The month of March was positive and we expect to see meaningful improvement as the year progresses. Protective & Marine was down by a mid single-digit percentage in the quarter, but improved sequentially and delivered strong growth in the month of March. Growth in smaller customer segments such as flooring, bridge and highway and pharmaceutical was more than offset by softness in the oil and gas segment. We continue to aggressively pursue opportunities in all these end markets and expect continued improvement as maintenance projects cannot be delayed indefinitely. From a product perspective, sales in both interior and exterior paint were up by double-digit percentages with interior being the larger part of the mix as is normal for our first quarter. Additionally, this is the third consecutive quarter spray equivalent sales increased by double-digits in the quarter. Contractors typically invest in this type of equipment in anticipation of solid demand. Our previously announced 3% to 4% price increase to US and Canadian customers became effective February 1, prior to the supply chain disruption the industry began experiencing later in the quarter. We realized approximately 1.7% from price in the first quarter and would expect 2% or better in the following quarters. We will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed. We opened 11 new stores in the quarter in the US and Canada. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services to drive additional growth. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales increased 25% in the quarter, including 2.7 percentage points of positive impact related to currency translation, as DIY demand remained robust. Sales in all regions were above our mid-teens segment growth guidance, led by Asia and followed by Europe, North America and Australia respectively. We exited the Australia business in the segment at the close of the quarter. As you know our global supply chain organization is managed within this segment. I want to thank this team for their incredible performance in navigating the industry-wide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri during the quarter. We are working collaboratively across our businesses to keep our customers in paint and on the job. Last, let me comment on first quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. The momentum we saw in the third and fourth quarters of last year continued and accelerated in our first quarter, group sales increased by double-digit percentage. Currency translation was a tailwind of 2% in the quarter. Price was positive and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in Asia grew fastest in the quarter, followed by Europe, both of which were up by strong double-digit percentages. Latin America grew by a high single-digit percentage. North America, the largest region in the Performance Coatings Group continues to gain momentum, where sales were up by low single-digit percentage. From a divisional perspective, I'll start with the Industrial Wood division which had the highest growth in the group. Sales were up by strong double-digit percentage in the quarter and were positive in every region. Strength in new residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring and furniture applications. In General Industrial, the largest division of the group, sales were up by a high-teens percentage and were positive in every region. Sales were strong within heavy equipment, building products, containers and general finishing. While there's likely an element of inventory restocking by our customers in these numbers, we believe growing end-market demand is the larger driver given recent PMI and industrial production reports. Our Packaging team also continues to deliver great results. Sales were up high single-digits against a nearly double-digit quarter a year ago and were positive in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction. This team has been remarkably consistent and has delivered solid growth in every quarter since Sherwin-Williams acquired the business as part of the Valspar acquisition in 2017. We and our customers continue to invest in this terrific business. Our Coil Coatings business has also been a remarkably consistent performer. Sales grew by high single-digit percentage in the quarter against a double-digit comparison a year ago. This team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions. We're also seeing the gradual resumption of selected commercial construction projects. Last, Automotive Refinish sales were up by mid single-digit percentage in the quarter. This level of growth is very encouraging given that miles driven and collision shop volume remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly in North America. We're also pleased with new installations of our products and systems in North America which were very strong. This is a good indicator of future momentum in our business. Before moving on to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $930 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $775 million to purchase 3.3 million shares at an average price of $234.96. We distributed $151.8 million in dividends, an increase of 23.5%. We also invested $64.3 million in our business through capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. Turning to our outlook. We continue to see robust demand in North America residential repaint and new residential and continued recovery in commercial and property maintenance. Comparisons in DIY will be challenging over the remainder of the year, though we are excited by opportunities to work with our retail partners to grow sales in the pros who paint segment. We expect industrial demand will continue to improve as the year progresses. We'll continue to leverage our strengths in innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution, as we expect to grow at a rate that outpaces the market. On the cost side of the equation, we now expect raw material inflation for the year to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, a significant increase from the low to mid single-digit range we communicated in January. In an already challenged supply chain due to COVID-19, the February natural disaster in Texas further impacted the complex petrochemical network causing significant disruptions. These production disruptions, coupled with surging architectural and industrial demand have pressured supply and rapidly driven commodity prices upward. Recovery has been significant in recent weeks and is improving, but it's still far from complete.  At this time, we anticipate some moderation of costs in the back half of the year though they will still be elevated year-over-year. As we previously described, there is a lag of about a quarter from the time we see inflation in commodities to the time we see the impact in our results.  Given this timing, we expect to see significant raw material inflation in our second quarter, which will be the highest of the year. The pace at which capacity comes back online and supply becomes more robust remains uncertain. We have been highly proactive in managing the supply chain disruptions to minimize the impact on our customers. We expect to be in a similar mode throughout the summer months as reduced raw material availability resulted in lower-than-anticipated inventory build during our first quarter.  Our close working relationships with customers and the strength of our global supply chain give us great confidence in managing through any challenges that may occur. We've also been highly proactive in our pricing actions to offset the raw material inflation we are seeing. We've issued price increases in both the Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings Group, in addition to the previously announced price increase in The Americas Group.  We likely will need to take further pricing actions if raw material costs remain at these elevated levels. While we are fully committed to combating rising raw material costs, we also recognize that the timing of price realization will likely result in some near-term margin pressure. Against this backdrop, we anticipate second quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will increase by a mid- to high teens percentage compared to the second quarter 2020.  We expect The Americas Group to be up by a mid to high teens percentage. We expect Consumer Brands to be down by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage including a negative impact of approximately four percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. And we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a high-20s percentage.  For the full year 2021, we plan to provide you with an update to our sales and EPS guidance at our virtual financial community presentation event scheduled for Tuesday June 8th. We expect to have greater clarity of raw material availability and cost inflation trends at that time as well as further confirmation of the strong demand trends we are currently seeing.  Our current sales and adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged at this time. We expect consolidated net sales to increase by a mid to high single-digit percentage. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a mid to high single-digit percentage; Consumer Brands Group to be up or down by a low single-digit percentage including a negative impact of approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture; and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a mid-single-digit percentage.  We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $7.66 to $7.93 per share compared to $7.36 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.80 per share and a loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2021 earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.07, an increase of 9% at the midpoint over the $8.19 we delivered in 2020.  Let me close with some additional data points that may be helpful for your modeling purposes. We expect to see some contraction in full year gross margin given the lag between price realization and the rapid and greater-than-expected increase in raw material costs. As we capture price and inflation abates, we expect to see gross margin recover and then expand over time just as it has in the previous cycles.  We expect to see expansion of full year adjusted pre-tax margin as we leverage strong sales growth while controlling SG&A. We will continue making investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to return to our normal cadence with around 80 new store openings in the US and Canada in 2021.  We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel. These investments are embedded in our full year guidance. We expect foreign currency exchange will not have a material impact on sales for the full year.  We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. We expect full year depreciation to be approximately $280 million and amortization to be approximately $300 million. The CapEx and interest expense guidance we provided last quarter remains unchanged. We have $25 million of long-term debt due in 2021. We expect to increase the dividend by 23.5% for the full year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy.  We're off to a great start in 2021 with our excellent first quarter performance. Our team is operating with momentum and energized by the many opportunities in front of us as the recovery gains strength. We see demand remaining strong over the remainder of the year and nobody is better equipped to provide differentiated customer solutions than Sherwin-Williams.  We're confident in our ability to manage through transitory raw material availability and cost inflation issues and we expect to deliver another year of excellent results. That concludes our prepared remarks.  With that I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. Good Morning. Yes. Let me take a run at it and I'll have Al jump in because we're getting a little bit into the forecast here, Ghansham. I'd say from a performance standpoint, we feel really good about the momentum that each of our segments are producing. I'd say the return if you will of the GI business and the Industrial Wood business at the pace that it's coming is a -- is pleasing to us. We expected that to occur, and it's coming in at a pretty robust pace. We've long spoken about how we've tried to position the business as both defensive and growth. In those markets impacted by COVID, we are we believe positioned very well to capture that. So to your point GI and Industrial Wood are growing. If you look at the segments in our TAG business, the residential, repaint, new res really doing quite well as well as DIY. I'd say, we are expecting continued traction in our commercial property management businesses. So I'd say, every element of the industrial business outside of the Protective and Marine business, which is showing sequential growth has been really improving well. And quite frankly every element of the architecture will sit on every cylinder. But let me ask Al to jump in regarding the forecast as well. Yes. It's a little earlier update than we -- as Al mentioned, we normally would do that coming out of the second quarter. So a little bit earlier in June, but it will give us an opportunity given some of the challenges that are in the market right now to give you an update at that time. I'd say, this Ghansham -- I'll take you back. We I believe have demonstrated that conviction and determination to put pricing in. Your point is a good one. As we entered the year, we put some pricing in and then this natural disaster came in in February. What would we see? Well, we continue to focus in on efficiencies through our own facilities, our own approach. Positive mix shift, which we're seeing right now at a pretty aggressive rate with customers moving up in quality helped to offset some of that. But I would say this that we're not taking additional pricing off the table. We'd prefer quite frankly not to go out in the midst of the painting season. We've got painting contractors that are out there quoting projects right now and we'd prefer to work through those prices -- those projects with them on those prices. But I think we've demonstrated in the past a willingness to do that if we need to. I'd say the other piece comes with the loyalty that we build and the way in which we handle these situations. We've often talked about, while we're not hoping for compression in margin as Al just mentioned, we accept a little margin compression. And it's part of the relationship that we've built we think it's unique. When our customers see us out with pricing, they know it's real. When we're out with pricing, we need it. If we find ourselves in this situation unable to offset it in pricing that -- raw material pricing that remains at an elevated level we'll be out with additional pricing. Yes. Ghansham, I might add one additional point to that and that is that while we're not cavalier about it, we're very sensitive to pricing and what it means to our customers. It does represent a relatively small percentage of their total cost of goods. Al mentioned that raw materials represent 85% of our COGS. If you look at a painting contractor, it represents about the same percent of their cost of paint on the project. Majority of their costs are -- I'm sorry 85% labor, the remainder cost. So it's a relatively small percentage of their total cost of goods. So we're disciplined in it. We're sensitive to it. But we also know to Al's point, if we're doing our job providing solutions to our customers, helping them make more money, disciplined in our approach to their understanding and when we're out there with the need for it. Thank you. Thanks, Bob. I'd say, as you mentioned DIY was very strong. And as we've previously indicated, we do expect DIY eventually to revert back to a more normal low single-digit rate as stay-at-home orders \u2013 I'm sorry, yeah, stay-at-home orders begin to ease and people begin returning back. So comparisons will be more challenging beginning in the second quarter of this year. Our belief is that as a company, we've really been working hard to position the company strategically to be able to capitalize on whichever way the market tilts. So, if in fact DIY reverts back our position as it relates to the pro segments, our industrial business, we think that we're going to be the winner if you will as it shifts one way or the other. We've worked very hard to position the company to be able to capitalize on the market, whichever way it turns. On the DIY side through our stores then while we might see some of that revert back, the pros will be higher on the CBG side or Consumer Brands Group side. It's a largely driven DIY business, but we are working hard with many of our customers on the pro who paints in there as well as an initiative for the company. You've heard us speak about the commitment that we have there, the investments that we have there, and quite frankly, the determination that we have there. And so whichever way the table tilts Bill \u2013 Bob, we believe we're going to be on top of it. And we quite frankly, don't discriminate to which segment it comes from. We're just very determined to be the one leading in each of those segments. And I think if you look at the comparison \u2013 maybe Al you can talk about the 2019 versus 2021. I think if you look Bob, not just at the comparison to the most recent year, if you look back to the previous year, we're still growing at a pretty impressive rate. So we're not giving it back. We're fighting along with our customers to keep it. Yeah. Actually, it's a good observation you make because we did see strong double-digit growth, actually both in interior and exterior. But the interior is such a large percentage when that beast moves it's really terrific for us. In the res repaint, it's a second straight 20% quarter growth we've had. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, over five years of consecutive double-digit growth, this is a team that's just really focused in executing on a lot of the terrific efforts to be able to capitalize on that. We've got a new leader there in Heidi Petz, a very aggressive leader. And we're excited to see what she brings to this business as well, because I would tell you these contractors are bullish. They're returning back into this interior work with a greater pace and greater comfort by their customers. The macro data is strong, when you look at existing home sales up 12% year-over-year for March. The LIRA projecting mid-single-digit growth. Even the NAHB Remodel Index, I think it hit a record this period 86 greater than the record previously of 82. So contractors are clearly confident and bullish. We expect this is going to be another record year for us in residential repaint. There's good momentum, and you should expect us to be pushing that pedal all the way to the floor in this segment. Hey, Steve. Let me be very direct though, Steve. We're feeling very good very strong about our architectural performance and we expect a very strong performance going forward here. Yeah. Steve, I want to be clear on that as well. When you talk about absorb, I want you to really picture this, right? We've been out with pricing. We're working through that pricing. The effectiveness of that pricing is important to us right now. When you say absorb, I want to put that in context. We're talking about that we will as we have in the past temporarily accept some minor compression as we work and build through that loyalty and communicate to our customers our intentions and our plans. And so as Al mentioned, we expect to recover dollars this year. My view on this is very simple. I would give up a little press \u2013 I would say accept a little compression in the short term, when I know that in the long term, I'm going to come out of this with the customer and the price. And that's been our model in the past and it's worked very successfully. And it's a cadence that our customers have learned to expect and appreciate from us. And I challenge anyone to give any exception to the idea that not trying to run for a perfect quarter versus the years or decades that we've built this relationship with our customers shouldn't take priority over trying to go out immediately and adjust. We'll get it. We know we will. We'll work with our customers. And by the way we'll come out of it with a more loyal customer as a result of the way we handle it. I might just add just because I think it's an important part of your first question. I understand you were asking kind of the decline or management of the SG&A. But I think it is important going back to the question that Steve asked earlier about pricing, the investments that Al mentioned we'll continue to make because we believe that's an important element in our strategy. So, while we're managing expenses in many areas we're also investing in many critical areas. And that's what in fact allows us to execute on the strategy and which allows us to stand in front of our customers having provided a solution that allows them to make more money and ask for more money when we need to. So, I think your question is a great one. But I want to be clear that while we're managing the expense we're also investing in critical areas as well. Thanks Jeff. Well, P.J., I'd say you should expect us to see a lot of activity, mainly in the industrial piece. And our pipeline looks very robust. So, we've got a number of projects that we're working we hope to have completed this year. I'd say that it's important to again understand our strategy. As a reminder we're very focused on unique and differentiated solutions and the solutions that can help our customers achieve their success at a greater rate. And when -- thinking about that is pretty simple. We believe that the greater success our customers have the more they view us as a valued partner. So, we're not focusing on trying to be everything to everyone, everywhere. We're not focused on commodities. We're focused on those elements of unique differentiation high value infrastructure is an example, areas that we can help expedite a production line lower, energy costs, improved color loss, whatever it might be as well as technologies that we can buy and broaden through our distribution. So, we are determined to do this. But we also believe, we're unique in this sense as well that we're positioned very well given the Valspar acquisition as well as just the positions that we've had and are growing not to require acquisitions for growth. Our focus right now is on prioritizing our growth opportunities. And so, it's an exciting time here at Sherwin-Williams, where you're looking at where do we invest, where do we go, and not because we don't know where to go. It's just, there's so many opportunities for us to grow. And that's what our PCG team, our Performance Coatings Group leaders, Justin Binn, our new group -- Justin Binns, our new Group President there and our leadership teams there are really focusing in on. So, we're excited about M&A as an important lever. We expect more activity going forward here, but a very disciplined approach, not only in the financial modeling but where we're going to go. We're not, like I say, just trying to buy a book of business. We're looking at good strategic values, and not what's necessarily available driving our strategy. It's what we see going on and pursuing it and making it happen. You bet. Well, I'd say that there are some challenges, as you mentioned. I think there's a pretty good inventory level in the channel for the most part. But, I'd also say that this natural disaster is just that, it was a disaster. And I also believe that this is a way in which you respond to demonstrate your DNA to your customers. And in our 155th year of doing business, we still utilize these challenges such as this natural disaster to demonstrate why a relationship with Sherwin-Williams is valuable. And so in the face of adversity, we love that our teams are running into the center of the fire working to collaborate with our customers to position them for success, responding, and quite frankly, trying to minimize the disruptions. We think we're unique in our asset base. We think we're unique in our experience. We think we are unique in our ability to respond. And we're trying to utilize every aspect of our assets, our facilities, our people to be able to do that. And I really believe, John, that we'll exit this closer to our customers than ever. And we -- I say that because we're utilizing these assets. It could be -- we've got a very robust fleet of tractor trailers and delivery vehicles. And so, even on the home center front, when product becomes available we're not waiting for someone to come begging a transportation company to come pick up our products or to be responsive to ours. We own those. Those are ours. Those are our people our assets. We can dictate those same with our 4500 stores. I know you asked primarily about the home centers, but same stands true with our own stores, located in the communities they serve with well-trained highly qualified leaders in those stores with inventory close to the customers. We've got reps on both the store's front and the home center front. And so what we're trying to do is be as responsive as we can. And so, while there is some choppiness, if you will, from an inventory standpoint and we're working through those, it's getting better every day. We clearly see this as a transitory issue that we're dealing with. We believe we'll get on top of it. And our goal is to be on the other side, have customers point to Sherwin-Williams and say, we want the rest of you to be just like this. You bet, John. Yes. Love to, because I think we're really optimistic about our entire industrial business. All divisions in all regions delivered year-over-year growth in the first quarter. If you look at the market manufacturing, PMI is positive in every region, customer is positive. We do believe that the vaccines should drive stability and comparisons will be favorable moving forward. But this is a terrific leadership team that's leaning forward aggressively and should bode well for us the balance of 2021. As I run through the businesses and I talked about them briefly in my prepared remarks, but if you look at some of these that have really been terrific performers and I'd start with the strong double-digit gains in our industrial wood, we've got really good momentum here. If you look at furniture, kitchen cabinets, flooring, many of these correlate to new residential. We expect that momentum to continue through the first half. And note that the second half, while it may become a bit more challenging as the year goes, this is a team that's really planting a lot of really good seeds with our customers, growing not only through existing customers, we like to say share of wallet but also in new customers. And it's a really good leadership team here. We have high expectations. Talk about our GI business and coming in second with a high teens number is a good place to be. Every region here was up double-digits as well except North America, and North America was up mid-single digits and it continues to show momentum. Again, PMI here is very positive and we expect demand to improve. Good share gains here. We're driving the business in a very positive way. Packaging is another one where demand for food and beverage and cans remains very robust. I've spoken repeatedly about our non-BPA coating. That is continuing to gain traction. Both we and our customers in packaging are investing in additional capacity. We've got terrific partners, good partnership and we anticipate strong demand going forward here for quite some time. I'm really proud of what this team has accomplished. They've delivered for us every quarter since we've acquired Valspar. And between the packaging and coil, not only have we seen terrific growth but we've long been asked about diversifying our business. This really helped us to diversify our business both the packaging and coil. And in coil we see really nice growth. Resumption in commercial projects is picking up, growth in appliances. And again, I've talked about the \u2013 new business wins in this business have really been strong in all regions. So this is another terrific leadership team. And then our automotive refinishes I think has really been something that I've been talking about very positively for a number of quarters. And again this is another terrific quarter for this team. Like others in the market, we experienced significant growth in Asia and to a lesser degree but still significant in Europe. But our strength is here in the Americas. And we believe we're continuing to gain share here through our focus on new accounts and installations, innovation. I mentioned installations in my prepared remarks. We've got more systems and products going here in North America, more installs I believe than we've ever had. I think it's the highest rate we've ever had for this business. And that clearly bodes well for us going forward. And that's in the face of miles driven and collision shop volume that's still off pre-COVID levels. So this industrial business is proving to be everything that we had hoped to do and be. We still have some work obviously in the area of operating margins. Pleased with the momentum that the team has. But there's still a lot of upside. We still think there's upside in the operating margins as well as cash and got, as I mentioned a leadership team that will deliver that. So we're looking forward to it. Well, like I said, we would normally give you an update at the end of the second quarter. We're going to move that up into early June and we'll give you an update then. But if you're sensing a little bit of bullishness or confidence in all of our voices, I'd say that's probably appropriate. Hey, Mike. Yes. I'd say \u2013 I mentioned earlier, the PROs who paint is an important initiative one that we expect. Mike I feel really good. We had a terrific year and we continue to post some terrific numbers in our CBG business. We've got terrific partners here and they're committed to growing and we're committed to growing and investing in our businesses together. I think the way it exactly plays out from a timing perspective and kind of shifts in the market, that's yet to be seen. But we're committed to this business and we're committed to our customers. And one way or the other we're going to help them be better at what it is they're doing. And we're willing to execute on that, invest in it and deliver on it. And you can count on that leadership team, wonderful leadership. Already you could see some of that work as Al mentioned in different parts of the world. But got a leadership team here in Brian Patton and Todd Rea that are doing a wonderful job, getting close to our customers and really delivering for them. And we expect that to continue. We're holding them accountable to do that. You bet. Yes. Vincent why don't I take that? Because I think the raw material supply issue is something that I tried to touch on before. And I would say that, as Jim mentioned that 168 facilities in the petrochem industry going offline. It had an impact on not just the paint industry, but many industries. And as diversified as we are in supply base and geographically, when something like this happens it's a significant natural disaster. It's going to impact many industries. It has impacted us. And so, we're working hard with our suppliers. To be very clear we want to be the ones that stand out amongst our customers with the greatest supply, but there are challenges right now. And a natural disaster like this is going to be challenging. As I mentioned and we have mentioned repeatedly, we believe it's transitory. We think that we'll get on top of this. I think the fact that we have the tenure in our leadership team in our global supply chain, as well as procurement gives me great confidence the asset base that we have and the responsiveness and quite frankly the willingness to do whatever it is. Where we can get product in, we'll ship it from wherever we can make it the fastest to get it to our customers to serve them properly. And we're doing a lot of that right now. And so, it is a real issue. It's getting better, but it's one that we've dealt with. And as far as our competitors, yes, I'd say, as I mentioned all of our competitors are feeling the same pressures. What I'm really proud of and I've mentioned these leaders Heidi Petz, Justin Binns, Brian Patton every one of them when we talk, there's not one of them that are sitting there talking about, Boy there are challenges. The challenges that we're talking about are how quickly we can grow, how fast we can be in front of our customers, how fast we can be in front of our competitors' customers. And so while some might be in a similar situation from a raw material, very few have the ability to respond like Sherwin-Williams. And yes, we're trying to take advantage of that. We're trying to turn those into customers. So you should expect that we're aggressively in front of those customers right now talking about our products our services and how we can help our customers make money. Yes I'd say recovery would be choppy would be the best way that I would describe that. It's improved sequentially, but was down by mid-single digit in the quarter. As we went through the quarter, the results got better. Now some of that came from comparisons that were a little bit easier. But we believe that, there's a meaningful recovery underfoot in this business. I'd say that aligns with Dodge whose non-building starts are forecasted to rebound in the mid to high single digit range. We continue to gain good momentum here by diversifying this business. And I'd say that -- when you look at our property management I'd say, we're in a leadership position here. We've got great determination to continue to grow. But I'd say, also I think it's important is we're seeing more activity in our Southeast and Southwestern divisions where there are fewer, I'll call them governors -- or COVID governors compared to the Midwest and Eastern areas. I'd say that comps are more favorable over the rest of the year. But again, just as we've talked earlier we're not waiting for comps to get easier to be a way to demonstrate. We're on attack. We're attacking right now. And a lot of these customers, some of this might fall a little bit between property maintenance and a little bit of the commercial side. But if you look at the tourist industry, many are starting and expecting for that to pick up. And we expect some of those facilities as they start to get better utilization rates to again begin investing more in that business as well. So we're positioned really well. We're -- we've got I believe a good strong leadership position here great relationships and a lot of determination. Thanks Vincent. Yes. We love people moving regardless of where they move and we like them to paint and change their mind on the color a couple of times while they're doing that. So we're positioned very well. The Southeast and Southwestern divisions are terrific markets for us. The density of our stores is high there, but there's still plenty of opportunity. We talked about resuming our store count new stores up into the 80-plus range. We're excited about that. I think we have good coverage in the divisions that are the benefactors of some of that movement, but there's still opportunities and we love the shift that might be taking place if it be permanent or temporary. If you look at -- you talked about the demographic or the performance by area. The largest growth that we had was in our Canadian division. This team has been working really hard at executing up there over the last few years. We've been making a lot of investments. So quite frankly our expectations are high for this division, but they're delivering. I'd say as I mentioned the Southeastern division is another area a terrific leader in Todd Wipf down in that area that has been down there for quite some time and is doing a terrific job leading his team. Midwestern Southwestern and the Eastern divisions came in, in order and I'd say, all of them have terrific leaders and are executing. So I was trying to be cute there, Kevin about the move. But the reality is, is that as there's shift in demographics we think we're really well positioned. And we'll capitalize on it wherever it goes largely because of our relationships with the contractors that are going to be on the receiving end. Hey Duffy. Thanks Duffy. Yeah. I'd say, we're shifting all the time though John. The timing of arrivals of raw materials or the plants that is going to be manufactured \u2013 manufacturing, we might have seen a little bit more of that than usual here given the obvious situation. But I'd say that's something that we do. And when I mentioned earlier about the strength of doing business with Sherwin-Williams that's the benefit of a company like ours, the capacity that we have, the assets that we have, quite frankly the purchasing power that we have. There's a lot of opportunities on an everyday basis. Here now with this situation as products become available, we're able to utilize our assets the best ability -- to our best ability. Yes we are. Thanks John. Good afternoon. I would say that we're seeing sequential improvement in all of them and we expect that to continue. The timing on pre-COVID levels, we'd like to see that obviously sooner than later. We're working hard with our teams to be able to reach those levels. A little hard to give that projection by division in this format, but you should expect that that is absolutely our intent. Thank you. Yes. In the industrial business you're asking? Yeah. I would absolutely say that we're pleased with the momentum in our automotive refinish. There's a lot of seeds that are being planted. Our expectations for that business are very high. I think even with the growth that we are experiencing in GI and industrial wood, we expect that momentum to continue. I'd say coil is going to continue to grow. You know what, let me just save some time here. We have expectations for every one of those divisions to continue to grow. There's a lot of upside. Our position in the market there's -- we're not sitting here with an enormous amount of market share here where we can't grow. I mean, there's opportunities in every one of those businesses. We believe we have the product technology, the assets and most importantly the people to be able to execute on that. And so our expectations are very high for each one of those businesses, both on the sales and operating margin from both perspectives. You bet. Hey Mike. Mike, we do have metrics, none that we can share. I mean, these would be our customers' metrics that we feel, it's very important in that relationship for them to discuss and to share. And I would also say, even from a product offering targeting those customers -- and I'll talk about our stores and maybe use that to reflect on the business that you're asking about. If you look at our high-end products, many of those are sold to the DIY customer, but many are also sold to the residential repaint contractors. So, I don't know that you would find customers in our stores that are professional, that are not buying some product at nearly every price point that we offer. And so the work that we're doing on the PROs that paint, targets the same type of breadth of product. There are customers that are maybe very high-end or upscale homes that want to use the very best. And there are others quite frankly that might be in different price points, but have also recognized that the largest cost of their goods -- cost of goods is in labor and they make more money using a higher-quality paint. So, we're not only designing products for PROs or DIY customers. We're designing products for the end application with the idea of the applicator in mind. So, we do build some PRO products, largely on the commercial side that are maybe more geared towards that application. But when you go into a home center, you're going to find those PROs typically shopping throughout the entire product line. Yes. I'd say, Mike, it's a great question and one I'd like to touch on because, I think it demonstrates the discipline as well as strategy. So my message is -- to a shareholder would be, we are committed. We are committed to growth and we're making investments in those areas that we believe have the opportunity to reach the long-term targets that Al just walked through. We're not interested in just a book of business. We're not interested in practice. We know how to make paint. Our shareholders expect a return on their investment and that's what we're out to do. So we're looking at programs. We're looking at geographies. We're looking at customer programs themselves to understand, which ones are viable and meaningful to both our customers and our shareholders. And in those areas, where we can see the long-term investments paying off, we're going to invest. We're going to get in there and grind out, what needs to be done to win. But we're not going to be in some part of the world -- other part of the world, expending our time and our treasure in areas that doesn't offer the return that our shareholders deserve. You're a good man, Truman. It's within our guidance. Thanks, Truman. No. I'd say that -- is it -- I'm not quite sure I understand your question. Is it -- With an effort on trying to grow, as I mentioned earlier, on the -- through those retail customers with the PROs that paint as well. Well, what we are saying is that, as people go back to work, they're not going to be home painting. And if that occurs then there is a little less DIY business. We think Sherwin-Williams is uniquely positioned to capture it in other areas of the business. So if people are going back to work and more painters are coming to their homes while they're at work, we're going to pick that up. If the people are going back to work in their plants, the production of those plants are going to be up on -- and going online, we're going to pick it up there. So I can go through in great detail, Justin. But I know you know this business very well and we've had this discussion a number of times. Our view is that we've been working hard, quite frankly, for years for this moment. Whichever way the business tilts, we're there, and we're going to capitalize on it. And if it's in DIY, we're there. If it's in res repaint, we're there. If it's in new residential, property maintenance, commercial, property management, whatever it is, we're there and we're going to capitalize on it. Thanks, Justin. Rosemarie, it's a great question. It's something that has us very excited. Our Protective & Marine business is a terrific business, positioned very well. I think a big part of it -- and I think, you know as well as most that have tried to follow what this infrastructure bill might look like, I think, we all recognize that there's a lot of variability in what might be coming down the pipe here. So maybe just the pieces and parts. If it's -- we have a terrific position in water and wastewater. We have a terrific position in -- we say, bridge and highway, but it's -- ours is on the high-value end of the bridge work. If you look at airport investments, virtually any infrastructure that goes in we'd be very well positioned to be there. And I say very well positioned and I might say, because it's -- you asked about technology. We do have very unique technologies from floor to ceiling. And our goal there is to ensure that the coatings that we provide, not only offer tremendous protection, but we have very unique systems that allow our coatings to have the assets put back in place quickly, a rapid return to service we refer to them. So polyaspartic coatings that can be coated/recoated quickly and put back in place, so that bridge lane closures down considerably or floors can be recoated and put back in place quickly. All of these are part of the product offering that we bring, that our customers have learned to expect and quite frankly we work very hard to get [Indiscernible]. So depending on what comes out in that bill, we think we're going to be very well positioned to capitalize on it. I don't know how to quantify that until we see the reality of -- I can appreciate for your modeling, but that'd be purely speculation on our part right now. I will say this, Rosemarie we're very well positioned to capitalize on it. We would not do that publicly now. We do recognize that there are opportunities. We're out looking at some of those, but we wouldn't want to flag those areas that we're pursuing M&A targets right now. [Indiscernible] Yeah. I think there -- we've spoken openly about, how long we coveted that Valspar business. I don't think there's another Valspar out there. There are opportunities for us but not something like a Valspar. Thank you. We are. But it's not something that we would discuss out of respect for our customers. Thank you. Yeah, sir. We might be in the spot a little bit -- spot market a little bit more or doing those things that we need to keep our customers in business. And so, there might be a little more volatility this year than other years. Nothing material. Thanks, Greg."

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.  I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered strong fourth quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, including high single-digit percentage sales growth, significant year-over-year gross margin improvement, expanded adjusted operating margins in all three segments, strong double-digit diluted net income per share growth and strong EBITDA growth. Sales in our professional architectural end markets increased by a high-teens percentage. On the industrial side of the business, sales were up by double-digit percentages in North and Latin America, partially offset by softer conditions in Europe and Asia. From a cost perspective, year-over-year inflation remained significant in the quarter, but we are encouraged by a modest sequential decrease in raw material costs for the second quarter in a row. Additionally, we made solid progress on the targeted restructuring and cost reduction actions we announced on our last call, the results of which we expect to begin benefiting us in the first half of 2023. Throughout the quarter, we remain focused on customer solutions and executing on continuous improvement in business optimization activities. We also identified opportunities and prepared for what we currently expect will be a challenging operating environment in 2023. I'd like to highlight just a few of our consolidated fourth quarter numbers. Comparisons in my comments are to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Starting with the top line. Fourth quarter 2022 consolidated net sales increased 9.8% to $5.23 billion. Consolidated gross margin increased to 42.7%, an improvement of 320 basis points. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased by 40 basis points to 29.8%. Excluding onetime costs related to our previously announced restructuring actions, gross margin improved sequentially to 42.9% in the fourth quarter of '22 from 42.8% in the third quarter of '22. And SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 110 basis points as compared to the prior year. Consolidated profit before tax increased $186 million or 60.2%. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $1.48 per share versus $1.15 per share a year ago. Excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense and costs related to previously announced restructuring actions, fourth quarter adjusted diluted net income per share increased 41% to $1.89 per share versus $1.34 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased $281 million or 52.7%. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our fourth quarter results by segment. John will follow Heidi with his comments on our full year 2022 results as well as our 2023 outlook before we move on to your questions.\nHeidi Petz: Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Americas Group, where sales increased 15.7% driven by mid-single-digit volume growth and continued effective pricing. Segment profit increased by $126.4 million and segment margin improved 210 basis points to 17.2%. Our pro architectural sales grew by a high teens percentage of the quarter, led by property management and followed by new residential, commercial and residential repaint, respectively. Sales in Protective & Marine, DIY and Latin America, all increased by double digits, but were below the TAG segment guided range. From a product perspective, interior and exterior paint sales were both strong, with interior sales growing faster and representing a larger part of the mix. We opened 40 net new stores in the fourth quarter and a total of 72 net new stores in 2022. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased by 2.4% in the quarter, which was better than our guidance. Sales decreased due to lower volume sales and low single-digit FX headwinds, partially offset by price increases. Sales were slightly positive in North America and Europe, but more than offset by significant continued weakness in China due in large part to COVID-related lockdown. Customers managed their inventories as inflation continued to pressure DIY paint demand from consumers for this segment. Tightness in alkyd resin also impacted our ability to produce stains and aerosols. Adjusted segment margin was 11.3%, up 500 basis points year-over-year. We also made good progress in the quarter on the China architectural and aerosol restructuring actions that we described last quarter. The actions in the fourth quarter resulted in $25.6 million in onetime restructuring costs and a $15.5 million impairment charge. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 4.2% and were driven by mid-teens pricing, partially offset by a low double-digit decrease in volume. Mid-single-digit sales from acquisitions were offset by a mid-single-digit unfavorable FX impact. Adjusted segment margin increased 530 basis points to 14.2% of sales. This is the third straight quarter that this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement driven by execution of our strategy, including effective pricing actions. Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased double digits against a challenging comp. Latin America sale also increased by double digits against a strong comp. Sales in Europe decreased high-single-digits against a double-digit comparison and amidst continued economic slowing. Sales decreased by a low teens percentage in Asia against a double-digit comparison and as COVID lockdowns continued to impact demand. From a division perspective, Growth was strongest in coil, which was up by a low double-digit percentage, followed by auto refinish and general industrial, which were both up mid-single digits. Packaging was down low single digits driven by negative double-digit FX impact in Europe and Asia and against an extremely strong comparison last year of over 30%. We continue to feel very good about our packaging position and expect this to be a recession-resilient performer. Industrial wood was down low teens as the housing slowdown is impacting furniture, flooring and cabinetry market. Similar to Consumer Brands Group, Performance Coatings made good progress on its portion of the targeted restructuring actions that we described on our last call, resulting in $22.2 million in onetime costs in the quarter. With that, let me turn it to John for his comments on our full year results and our 2023 outlook.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Heidi, for that color on our fourth quarter segment results. I want to thank our teams for working hard to deliver a strong finish to the year. I'm particularly pleased with the significant adjusted profit margin improvement that all three segments delivered compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Our fourth quarter completed a strong year for Sherwin-Williams and I'd like to provide just a few high-level comments on our full year performance. On a consolidated basis, we delivered record sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted net income per share in 2022. We generated these results in a difficult operating environment, including relentless inflation, less-than-optimal raw material availability, a war in Europe and COVID lockdowns in China. Our people refused to be deterred by these challenges and continue to do what they do best, serve our customers. Our success stems from executing on our strategy, which remains unchanged. We provide differentiated solutions that enable our customers to increase their productivity and their profitability. These solutions center on industry and application expertise, innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution. None of this happens without the determination and dedication of our greatest asset, the more than 61,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams. Together, this team grew full year consolidated sales by 11.1% to a record $22.1 billion. It was the 12th consecutive year we have grown the business. On a segment basis, the Americas Group delivered 12.9% sales growth and grew profit before tax $197.5 million. Our largest customer segment, residential repaint, grew by a double-digit percentage for the seventh year in a row. Sales in all other customer segments were also up by double digits for the year. Consumer Brand sales were down 1.1% for the year. Sales were up mid-single digits in North America, our largest region. This was more than offset by double-digit declines in Europe and China. Although the bottom line results weren't what we expected, 2022 was a transition year for Consumer Brands Group as they completed a number of restructuring and simplification efforts to position the business for long-term success and driving operating margins back to the high teens. Performance Coating sales were up 13.2% for the year against a 22% comparison. All divisions grew with the exception of industrial wood. It was down less than 1%. Adjusted segment margin expanded 250 basis points to 14.1% for the year as we continue to recover from the highest cost inflation in the company and pursue our high-teens margin target for this segment. Adjusted diluted net income per share increased 7.1% to a record $8.73 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $3.61 billion or 16.3% of sales. Net operating cash for the year was $1.9 billion or 18.7% of sales. We returned a total of $1.5 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share buybacks in 2022.  We invested $883 million to purchase 3.35 million shares at an average price of $263.64. We distributed $618.5 million in dividends, an increase of 5.4%. We also invested $644.5 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $188 million for our building our future projects. We ended the year with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times. Additionally, we invested $1 billion in acquisitions that accelerated our strategy. I'd also like to mention our ESG efforts where we continue to work toward meeting our longer-term targets. Newsweek, Forbes and other third parties once again recognized various aspects of our program. Throughout the year, we continue to execute on continuous improvement initiatives and targeted investments to drive growth, competitiveness, efficiency and profitability. We opened 72 new paint stores and hired 1,400 management trainees. We introduced multiple new products while reducing SKUs and formulations. We expanded production capacity and enhanced procurement and logistics processes. We also continued on our digital and sustainability journeys, and we executed on our acquisition strategy. I am confident we widened the gap between Sherwin-Williams and our competitors in 2022, and that's just what we intend to do again in 2023. So turning to our outlook. We enter 2023 with confidence, energy and a commitment to seize profitable growth opportunities wherever we find them. We have clarity of mission. We have the right strategy. We're focused on solutions for our customers. We're spending more time selling products and less time sourcing them, thanks to recovery in the supply chain. We're simplifying the business, and we're executing on targeted restructuring actions. We've made the right growth investments, and we'll continue to do so. We also have a portfolio that should be more resilient than in prior recessions. And above all, we've got the right people. We expect to outperform the market just as we have in the past. At the same time, we're not operating with our heads in the sand. We currently see a very challenging demand environment in 2023, and visibility beyond our first half is limited. The Fed has also been quite clear about its intention to slow down demand in its effort to tame inflation. These factors have not changed from what we communicated on our third quarter call and our base case in 2023 remains to prepare for the worst. Based on current indicators, we believe this is the most realistic outlook at this time. On the architectural side, it's no secret that U.S. housing will be under significant pressure this year. Single-family permits have been down year-over-year for 10 consecutive months, and single-family starts have been down year-over-year for eight consecutive months. Mortgage rates also remain elevated.  As a result, we believe our new residential volume could be down anywhere from 10% to 20% this year. We expect our other PRO end markets to be more resilient than this, but there are headwinds in these areas, too. For example, existing home sales, which drive a portion of our repaint business have declined year-over-year for 16 straight months. Now while we see a backlog of new commercial construction, the Architectural Billing Index has contracted the last three months.  On the DIY side, we expect inflation to continue putting pressure on consumer behavior in the U.S. and in Europe. On the industrial side, the PMI numbers for manufacturing in the U.S., Europe, China and Brazil have been negative for multiple months. We have already seen an industrial slowdown in Europe and the same is beginning to appear in the U.S. across several sectors. In China, COVID remains a wildcard and the trajectory of economic recovery is difficult to map. The U.S. housing slowdown will also impact some of our industrial businesses, namely industrial wood where we have already seen pressure and coil to some extent. Our team fully understands the importance of winning new accounts and growing share of wallet in this environment, and that is where we will be focused. From a cadence standpoint, we expect year-over-year sales and earnings performance will be significantly better in the first half than in our second half, driven by several factors.  Our total company comparison will be much more favorable in the first half of 2023 as we delivered a very strong second half performance in 2022, where sales were up 13.8% and adjusted earnings per share grew by over 37%. As we've often said, volume is the key driver for operating leverage in our model. In the Americas Group, which is our largest and most profitable segment, our year-over-year volume comparisons are expected to be meaningfully better in the first half versus in the second half based on the trends we are currently seeing.  We also expect more carryover price in the first half of 2023, which will have the full benefit of our September 6, 2022 price increase in TAG as well as prior price increases in the other two segments, all of which will annualize in the back half of this year. Additionally, we expect new residential sales will hold up better in our first half before very meaningful deceleration of demand in the back half of the year. Acquisitions will also be a tailwind in our first half as we expect incremental sales of approximately $140 million from transactions which closed after July 1 of last year. Given these factors and the softening demand environment, we believe our expectations for the back half of 2023 are tempered appropriately at this time. As you would expect, we will gain more clarity as the year progresses, and we will provide a more finally tuned view of our second half outlook during our second quarter conference call. As we said on our last call, we anticipated the demand environment would be challenging in 2023, leading us to get out ahead on cost management with the targeted restructuring we began in the fourth quarter. We estimate the annual savings from this effort to be in the $50 million to $70 million range, with about 75% realized by the end of 2023, and we are reaffirming those estimates today. Our outlook also assumes our raw material costs will be down by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect to see the largest benefit occurring in the second and third quarters. We expect to see decreases across many commodity categories, though the ranges likely will vary widely. From an availability standpoint, certain alkyd resins remain a pain point, impacting stains, aerosols and some industrial products. We expect supply of these resins to continue improving through the first half of the year, in part due to ramping of our own internal production.  We expect other costs, including wages, energy and transportation to be up in the mid to high single-digit range. For the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will be flat to up by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2022, inclusive of a mid-single-digit price increase. Our sales expectations for the quarter by segment are included in our slide deck. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be flat to down mid-single digits, inclusive as a mid-single-digit price of carryover from 2022. Our sales expectations for the year by segment are included in our slide deck. We expect diluted net income per share for 2023 to be in the range of $6.79 to $7.59 per share. Full year 2023 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.81 per share and includes expense related to our previously announced targeted restructuring actions of approximately $0.25 to $0.35 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $7.95 to $8.65. We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. Let me close with some additional data points and an update on our capital allocation priorities. Given carryover pricing, raw material deflation and our ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, we would expect full year gross margin expansion. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to increase in 2023. This is similar to the slowdown in 2008 and 2009, where we continue to invest in long-term solutions for our customers that allowed us to grow at a multiple of the market when demand normalized. We'll also control costs tightly in non-customer-facing functions and execute on our restructuring initiatives. We have a variety of SG&A levers we can pull depending on a material change to our outlook up or down. We expect operating margin to modestly improve year-over-year, excluding restructuring and impairment costs and acquisition-related amortization expense. While we don't typically provide this level of color, we believe it is helpful to do so this year given the higher level of non-operating expenses impacting 2023. We expect to open between 80 to 100 new stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2023. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements as well as systems and product innovation. We expect to complete the targeted restructuring actions we announced on our previous call, including the benefits and onetime costs we have outlined. We will continue to simplify and optimize the organization. The Latin American business of the Americas Group is now being managed and reported within the Consumer Brands Group. The change allows TAG leadership to focus more exclusively on its core U.S. and Canada stores business. While the Latin America architectural demand and service model are trending to be more in line with CBG's strategy. This business had sales of approximately $700 million in 2022. The change will be marginally accretive to TAG and marginally dilutive to CBG.  You will see this change when we report first quarter results in April. Prior-year segment results will be restated at that time to reflect the change. The first quarter and full year guidance for 2023 we've communicated today does not reflect this change. Next month, at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 0.8% to $2.42 per share, up from $2.40 last year. If approved, this will mark the 45th consecutive year we've increased our dividend. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We do not have any long-term debt maturities due in 2023. However, we will reduce short-term debt to trend our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio towards the high end of our long-term target of 2 to 2.5 times. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. In addition, I will refer you to the slide deck issued with our press release this morning, which provides guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. Given the many variables at play, limited visibility beyond the first half and the high level of uncertainty in the global economy, we believe our outlook is a realistic one. Our slide deck further outlines the assumptions underlying our guidance and is based on our current dialogue with customers and suppliers and our reading of numerous macro indicators. As we get through our first half and we see more information, those assumptions could change. If those assumptions change for the better, we would expect to do better than the guidance we are laying out today. While we can't defy gravity, we do expect to outperform the market and our competitors in 2023. I'm highly confident in our leadership team, which is deep and experienced and has been through many previous business cycles. We've transformed our business in many ways since the last significant downturn, and we are now a stronger and a more resilient company. We also know our guidance is clearly reflective of the market pressure we are experiencing. We anticipated 2023 would be challenging. We've planned accordingly.  We have and will continue taking appropriate actions. We expect strong momentum coming out of this period of uncertainty, similar to prior downturns. That momentum will stem from our strategy of providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and more profitable. In challenging environments, like the current one, we can be an even more valuable partner to our customers, while we're also earning new ones. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] our first question is coming from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Your line is live.\nChristopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much for taking my question. On Slide 8, you have some pretty helpful framework specifically on TAG volumes. John, obviously, you've been discussing this for a while, but can you just talk about the differences, obviously, what you're seeing in the new resi side, which is a little bit smaller but what you're hearing from your team regarding the pent-up demand on the resi repaint side. How you feel about that versus a quarter, 6 months ago and how that shapes up throughout 2023. Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: Sure, Chris. I'll start with new residential. And what I'll do is I'll talk a little bit about new res and I'll hand it over to Heidi to talk a little bit about her view. She's obviously working closely with her teams, and then I'll pick back up on res repaint we'll do the same. New res, I would start with a very important fact that over the last 10 years, we've had a 10 year compounded growth rate of about 10.5%. So this has been an area of focus for us, and it's one where we have, I think, clearly demonstrated significant success, and we are determined to continue to drive that success. Permits and starts are down as we all know. And our relationships with our national builders are strong and getting stronger. There's a lot going on, and we're working closely with them. Heidi, why don't I give that to you? And maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're working on, on the new residential side?\nHeidi Petz: Yes, sure. No, I think the last 10 years that John referred to has really put us in a strong position in new res. And we have every intention of aggressively pursuing share gains, especially during what we will consider to be pretty choppy waters ahead. We're going to continue to focus on growing our exclusive relationships. And I would expect that we're going to add to an already strong percentage of mutually beneficial exclusive relationship. For example, we look at our partnerships here pretty broadly and these builders that we're working with. It's really allowing us to collaborate in areas such as reducing complexity simplification and importantly, execution and utilizing our store platform, our technology, our supply chain and also importantly, our technical teams, we're really partnering to help these builders to respond to today's challenges and really helping them to reach their goals. So ultimately, reducing complexity may assist in their efforts to drive efficiency and productivity. And new products really play the key role in the help assist during some of these challenging times. For example, we're going to be introducing extreme build -- an extreme high build interior latex. And in a segment that's going to be under pressure, you may be asking yourself why we're bringing new products. But to be truthful, this is where we do help our customers win. This extreme high build lets the contractor build eight to 12 mils wet film thickness versus the more conventional four to six mils. So if you can imagine, just minimizing surface imperfections and excellent touch up, especially in an environment where labor is a challenge and an issue for these drywallers and painters. This product is helping to hide the spends of what I would call maybe less experienced drywallers and really improve the speed for painters. So essentially, everyone is winning here.  So you can kind of ask what to expect. John mentioned this earlier, the rate increases will pressure our builders, and we will grow share, but we were not going to be immune to the impact of these rates. We're going to respond to these changes. And I would expect that our builders will do the same. They may adjust floor plans. Many are looking at standardization, but no one will respond like Sherwin-Williams. We're going to take this expertise. We're going to aggressively go to builders that may have relationships with some of our competition. And we're going to demonstrate these capabilities in a way that will allow us to grow share. So while in the short term, we'll likely feel pressured. We like the favorable demographics. The existing housing shortage gives us a great deal of confidence that our strong and growing position in new res will benefit our shareholders.  So we look at the strong business through both a short and long-term lens. I would say in the short term, given our success and our position in the market, and we may over-index right now while we're working through some of the short-term choppiness. But in the long term, make no mistake, we do believe that this is in our best interest to continue to pursue these important gallons.\nJohn Morikis: I think maybe just one more point or two points maybe on new res, Chris, to Heidi's point, I think our relationships with the new residential contractors, they're reaching new highs. I mean we're collaborating and working together. She mentioned, one of the new products that we're introducing, I think there's a steady stream of introductions of not only products, but services and collaboration that we think really helps us help our customers. And the other point Heidi is really driving with her team, Justin Binns, our Group President of our TAG business is really taking this terrific work in products and services beyond the large national homebuilders and even driving that down further into the regional builders, where there is terrific opportunity for growth. And so while we expect there will be choppiness in the new residential, and I think it's important to say this beyond just new residential. We're not just reporting things are tough and low as us. So that's not who we are. We expect it's going to be tough, and we're going to come out fighting and swinging aggressively. And so yes, we do well with a lot of the large national homebuilders. We're going to be fighting like crazy after these regionals and other customers that we don't have.  We expect new residential if you look at some of the information that's out there to be down in the 20% to 30% range. That's not what we're expecting for our business. That's what we see in housing starts. So actually, what we're saying is that the homebuilders are posting some of them in the 20% to 30% range, we expect to outperform that and bring in a much better number than that. But we'll feel the pressure.  We get really quick to the res repaint side, and we won't go through each of the segments with such depth. But I do think that, Chris, your point is, your question is right on point, given the headlines, if you will, that these two segments will play for us this year. In residential repaint, we would say that while we continue to grow, and again, another area of focus over the 10 years, our compounded growth here has been 11% -- a little over 11.5%. We do expect to see some deceleration in the annual gains. If you look at the LIRA and the NAHB projections they are positive, but at a decelerated rate largely tied to existing home sales. But this is also an area where people continue to invest. Painting remains a relatively inexpensive investment but a very impactful project, that along with the aging housing stock and home price appreciation, we think will have a positive effect on this business. But Heidi, maybe you could talk a little bit about res repaint, and some of the work you and your team are driving there.\nHeidi Petz: Well, part of the fact that we've built really strong momentum here. I think this is certainly not by chance, but by design continuing to develop innovative products. John referenced some of the services, innovative solutions to differentiate ourselves and we couldn't do it without our incredible team. Our managers are reps, they play an extremely significant role in all segments, but I would argue in the res repaint segment, which really responds well to our high-touch personal service really can help to differentiate our model. We often talk about our secret weapon is our people. And I think clearly on display as we're helping our customers navigate through unprecedented challenges for them as well and challenges such as labor when res repaint, our full product line really allows contractors to step up in quality, helping to compensate for some less experienced applicators. And as we continue to see our customers do step up in quality, the results are clear that they are becoming more successful. And we're helping them prepare for some choppiness ahead, I would say, in addition to the whole product line, preparing for some new substrates. I'll give you an example here. In homes where our res painting, we're in the midst of rolling out a new kitchen cabinet refinish paint product.  So if you think of the homeowners that are affected by certainly higher costs and not willing to replace entire cabinet systems, but willing to refinish their existing cabinets, we're helping contractors to serve these clients with some profitable solutions. So amongst our new products, we're going to be introducing a self-cleaning Exterior Woods capes Stain as well for the exterior, which I just mentioned. So each and every rain will have a home looking freshly painted. So literally, the dirt will wash away with every rain, which is a pretty incredible technology, and we'll look like a newly painted home.  So our position in res repaint continues to improve. In fact, we continue to not only grow share but accelerate some of these share gains. So while the bid activity has adjusted, overall, it's still strong. Our average job size is increasing, and our focus continues to be and will be on new accounts and share of wallet.\nJohn Morikis: Just picking up the last point there is a good one. The quality of the leads in the bids, it seems like listening to a majority of our customers that while some of the bid activity may have tempered down a bit, the quality of the leads are actually increasing and the scope is actually increasing. So they're doing more there. And as she mentioned, we're trying to help them with projects like expanding into cabinets, introducing opportunities in garage floors and a lot of different areas. So even taking some of those new residential contractors that may have been primarily focused on new residential and helping them get into residential repaint. So we're really partnering very well with our customers to help drive their success and their profitability. So Chris, great question on those two segments. We think those are two really important segments for us going into 2023.\nChristopher Parkinson: John, given all that substance, I'll pass it on. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\nTruman Patterson: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions, as always. So you're expecting raw materials to decline in the low to mid-single-digit range in '23. Is this based off of spot pricing for petrochems as you see it today? Does this incorporate expectation for some incremental deflation in spot prices as we move through the year? I'm just asking because the petrochem futures are kind of bouncing around right now. And I'm just trying to understand how you expect the spot market to play out and what's embedded in the guidance.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Good morning, Truman, I'd begin by telling you that we called out here, we've seen a sequential decrease in our third quarter into our fourth quarter and we're expecting that trend to continue. In our first quarter, we're kind of expecting the basket to be flat to slightly up, and you'll see a bigger benefit as the year goes on.  To your point, key feedstock\u2019s like propylene, they have started to come down pretty meaningfully significantly. And eventually, it's going to find its way even more into the resins and the solvents that we buy. And that's starting to happen. We buy some of our raw materials on spot prices, so we can take advantage of that where it makes sense, and we have some on contract. I think what you also have to look at, though, is that as we look across the entire basket. Each commodity really has some dynamics associated with it. So while we're expecting down low singles to mid-singles for the basket, there's really a wide range across those different products that we buy. Some are better than that range and some are worse. And I think you're also seeing -- in addition to that, you're seeing input costs like energy and wages, which are very volatile. Those are also putting some pressure right now. So I think the takeaway would be you can expect us to continue working very closely with our suppliers to bring those costs in line with the industry demand levels, and that also reflects our position in the marketplace.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thank you. And then when you mentioned the lead demand indicators, could you just -- what are those? Could you run through some of those? And then you mentioned that you have a little bit less visibility into the back half of the year. I guess, how is today maybe a little bit different than prior periods outside of just general uncertainty in the economy?\nJim Jaye: Well, I'll talk about the indicators that you mentioned, Truman. They're the ones that we've cited for many, many years on our Analyst Days and our calls. So you heard a couple of them here on the res repaint side, the Lyra Remodeling index, existing home sales on the new res obviously, it's permits and starts. Commercial, there's a couple of different ones.  If you look on the industrial side, John, in his remarks cited the PMI numbers, which have not been trending very well at all. So it's those kind of external indicators married with obviously the real-time feedback we have from our customers and our -- it's one of the advantages of our direct distribution model.\nJohn Morikis: And on the second half, Truman, I would say that the view of the first quarter, first half versus the back half, I think it's -- you can attribute that to a very fluid and changing market. Interest rates are moving up. Housing starts are adjusting accordingly. Quite honestly, in times like this, the flux in the market, and this is my 38 years of experience talking here as well is that the contractors vary in their ability to anticipate what's happening. Some of them will look at their short-term book and believe that everything is okay. We're working with those contractors to help them understand some of the pressures that are coming down the pipe. So some of what we leverage our own controlled CRM that we have developed, the fact that we've got almost 5,000 store managers and nearly 4,000 sales reps that feed a great deal of our understanding of the market.  At this time, there's a little bit of a disconnect in that because some of our customers are feeling perhaps more bullish than we think that they should feel. Others are tied to other areas such as new residential, and they understand what the pipeline looks like. So when we talk about the visibility that we have in the first half, it's tied more towards the bids and contracts that our customers have in hand. It gives us more confidence. And that's why, as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we get through the first half, we'll reevaluate. I want to be very clear, we won't be adjusting our earnings forecast after the first quarter. We expect to have a very good first quarter, but we're going to wait and see as we get through the second quarter, what the balance of the year looks like. Once we have that better visibility, we'll speak to our investors as to what to expect going forward. But I would also add is, as we've come through COVID and some of the shortages that we've had in the market, we've become much closer with our customers. It was one of the benefits of the challenges that we've had. And so we believe we'll come out of this with a better line of sight as that relationship has improved dramatically, and it was already strong. But I think that as we get through the second quarter, we'll have a better line of sight.\nTruman Patterson: Alright. Thanks for taking my questions and good luck in the coming year. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is live. \nGhansham Panjabi: Good morning. I guess on Performance Coatings Group, can you just give us a sense as to what you're embedding for volume expectations by the sub-segments, auto refinish all the way through? That would be super helpful.\nJohn Morikis: Well, on refinish, I'd say there's a high demand here, coupled with a shortage of body texts and parts contributed to shot backlogs. We're working through a backlog of demand ourselves as we're securing more and more raw materials. As you work through some of these challenges, Ghansham, as you know, when there's a shortage of raw materials, the bottleneck moves through the process. So as we do get, which is a team effort at Sherwin, we're squeezing more and more raw materials and availability, that's improving, and we're trying to get more and more of the product out as a result of that. But as you look at automotive refinish, we're really pleased with the gains that we're gaining -- that we've gained, and we expect that to continue. I'd say packaging had a terrific year. Year-to-date, we finished the year in the mid-teens. That was on top of a year last year in the high 20s. So tough comparisons.  We're gaining a lot of share here. We're investing in capacity as fast as we've added capacity and add capacity, it's sold out. So the faster we can get that capacity up and running, the business will grow at an even faster rate.  Our coil business. This is seven consecutive quarters of double-digit growth here. Insight here that you're asking for, I'd say our North America end markets seem to be softening a bit. APAC, soft demand. And real estate market is limiting our extrusion business there and EMEA some pretty substantial declines as major coders in EMEA have shut down lines as a result of the demand. Our general industrial business, another strong year. And again, here, there are terrific opportunities within these segments. The heavy equipment market is very strong, and we expect that to continue into 2023, particularly in the ag and construction. Appliance manufacturers are appearing to slow down production as inventories get reset. Transportation and building products, I would say, are slowly down a bit. The industrial wood -- our industrial wood business is one that is tied to housing in many ways. If you look at kitchen cabinets, flooring, furniture, as I mentioned, they had a tougher quarter and were down slightly for the year. We've been investing in this business because we believe in our strategy. We've made a couple of acquisitions and have been open with the investors I've met with to tell them exactly that when we see these opportunities. We're a 156-year-old company. We're investing in this accordingly. We're not trying to win a week or a month or a quarter. We're investing long term. That confidence in our teams in each one of these segments, terrific leadership at the group level, Karl Jorgenrud, and we've got a lot of confidence that this is going to be a key driver for our business coming out of the choppiness and that we'll grow share during these choppy times. So it's really what we expect in the market. And again, we don't report we influence. We're going to outperform the market in each of these segments, we believe.\nGhansham Panjabi: Terrific. And then as it relates to TAG and kind of going back to your prepared comments and your characterization of the world we have today. I mean, obviously, interest rates having spiked over the last year having an impact on the housing ecosystem, including you. What would change the calculus of that? Is it just as simple as it reversible interest rates? And I'm just trying to reconcile the fact that interest rates have pulled back pretty substantially since October.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, it's a good question. I think you should expect us, first I want to be very clear, not waiting for the market to lift all the boats. I mean we're going to go really aggressively here, Ghansham, I would say that -- let me be careful in the words that I choose, but I would say I wouldn't want to compete with our team. These people are really well focused on the opportunities that we have. Yes, it will be impacted by housing starts, resale. We've got a terrific business in our property maintenance. We've always talked about kind of the table preparing from a strategic standpoint or which whatever way the table will tilt. And here in this environment, as the rates work their way through, if it's in residential repaint, you're going to see us outperform in residential repaint. If it's in property maintenance where people are going into multifamily homes as opposed to building homes, we're the leader there. And the same point on property maintenance as new res. We've done exceptionally well on a national standpoint. We're really cranking in after the regionals. This is the opportunity we have. We have competitors that are backing off because of some of the pressure in some of these segments. And we're going to go -- we're going to be aggressive. I'll just leave it there. We're going to be very aggressive in the regional pieces as well.\nAllen Mistysyn: Ghansham, this is Al Mistysyn. The only thing I would add to that, to your point, interest rates bounced around. And just like we talked about, as interest rates rose, it takes time to filter through the market and specifically into paint. So if you think about paint, we're always at the end of the project. So even if starts flip today, you're talking three to four months out, assuming no supply chain challenges before we get to our part of that project. And those are the things that we'll keep monitoring and pushing on with our teams to make sure we're gaining an outsized portion of the share as it returns.\nJohn Morikis: One additional point, I'll go back to Heidi's comment about our over-indexing a bit in new residential. We've done very well here. And so as those points that Al just made as housing starts begin, while there will be a lag, we'll see the benefit of that in a considerable way. And when it's down, we'll feel it perhaps a little bit more. \nGhansham Panjabi: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nDavid Begleiter: Good morning. John, in TAG, are you thinking about additional price increases this year?\nJohn Morikis: Why don't I start with that and Al, if I miss anything jump in here? I'd say that David, our view as it relates to pricing is always looking at total cost of the basket, not just raw materials, but everything from labor, transportation, containers, everything that goes into that. And right now, I would say, we've not announced any additional pricing. I think we've demonstrated the ability, desire and conviction to stay on top of that and the willingness to do that. So if, in fact, we find ourselves in that situation where we need additional pricing the first people that we'll hear about it will be our customers, and then we'll quickly advise the street of our actions.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. David, the only thing I would add just to put some color around 2023 on pricing in general. We talked about on our third quarter call that we had no additional pricing, we'd expect a mid-single-digit impact on our full year '23. Obviously, that would be a little bit higher in our first quarter. Our expectation is we're going to maintain the majority of our price like we've seen in the past. We think we've gotten past the margin contraction portion of that cycle. We're starting to see margin improvement sequentially and year-over-year, and we expect that to continue going into 2023.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good. And Al, do you still expect production this year to be below volume sell-through? And so how much -- what's the dollar impact on earnings here?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. I don't know we're going to quantify the dollar impact. But because we had to build so much inventory in 2022 to get back to more historic levels, and we are going to see a negative impact. And you could think about, and I talked about this, we'd expect a 5% to 7% decline in production gallons specifically on architectural. We are definitely expecting to see that. And that will have a drag when we look at Consumer Brands Group because that's where our global supply chain is embedded. So you're not going to see as much margin dollar improvement just for that very fact all else being equal.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman. Your line is live. \nAdam Baumgarten : Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, you mentioned in the slides some inventory destocking in the North America retail channel it seems like. Are you seeing any destocking outside of that channel, perhaps maybe some of your OEM customers?\nJohn Morikis: No. Most of our OEM customers operate on a very low min/max level. So they're leaning on us to be responsive for them. So while some would have inventory, I'd say that they lean on us and we support that as a means of helping them to be successful.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. And the only thing I would add to that, on the retail channel side, I think coming out of the third quarter, you heard some of our peers talk about destocking. We did not see that. So we were probably a quarter later anticipated some of that. And as a result, you saw consumer do a little bit better in the fourth quarter than we had planned.\nAdam Baumgarten : Got it. That's helpful. And then just in the past, you've touched on some pretty positive trends in the Pros Who paint business. Maybe an update there that also seen a slowdown as you move through the fourth quarter and into this year.\nJohn Morikis: Well, it's an important -- very important initiative for us. That's in our Consumer Brands Group. For those of you that may not be familiar with it. Todd Rea, our President there, is working closely with our teams to really capture a terrific opportunity. If you think about what we call the Pros Who Paints, it's someone that might be involved in either house flipping or remodeling and while we're very focused on the painting contractor through our store, there are customers who enjoy the wide breadth of assortment and availability of products that they get through a different format like a home center.  We're really excited about getting after this market because they prefer that type of a setting and we've got great relationships with customers that are interested in that. So I would say that in Sherwin, we're not a complacent company. There's good momentum here. But along with our customers, we want to go faster. We think some in the market have been enjoying an unencumbered run at this business, and we enjoy disrupting that and helping our customers to be more successful and we're intent on doing that. Good momentum, a lot of opportunity ahead.\nAdam Baumgarten: Great. Thanks a lot. Good luck. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is live. \nKevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. As you move the Latin American business over to consumer, can you help us understand what the associated margin uplift might be to consumer from that repositioning?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Kevin, it's really not a material change when you restate all of the factor -- all the income statement, it might give it a little bit of a lift on the TAG side because, as you well know, Latin America has been dilutive of TAG. But on the consumer side, where we're at today, versus where Latin America is. And I'll give Latin America shout-out. They've done a lot of hard lifting and rightsizing their business and are now back to focusing on growth where before it was about cost management and that type of thing. So now that team is externally focused and really going after market share growth. So I don't think you're going to see a material change on either segment because of this. But I think from a strategic standpoint, a focus standpoint and where the market trends are, it's the right decision at this time.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Kevin, I know you didn't ask specifically about -- I know you asked about the margin piece of it, but I do want to expand that to include it does have a positive impact on our TAG business. The focus on North America. We've got, as Al mentioned, a terrific leader, Alberto Benavidez down in Latin America that leads a wonderful team, and there's a shift in what's happening down there more towards what best aligns with our Consumer Brands Group. So it is a terrific opportunity from a best practice standpoint to align those two businesses. We think it's going to help our TAG business focus, and we do think that it will allow our businesses to share information. We'll take information out of Latin America that will bring up to North America and vice versa as well.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you for that. And then secondly, I wanted to ask for your updated thoughts on Al kid resins. It sounded like that was a meaningful constraint in the fourth quarter. Is there a way to size that? And is the availability beginning to improve yet as we talk today in the first quarter?\nHeidi Petz: Yes. Kevin, I would tell you that the availability, I'm not a surprise that alkyd resin does remain an industry-wide challenge. I give our technical teams and commercial teams a lot of credit for working through some very thoughtful and, in some cases, upgraded substitutions during this challenge. And we've really isolated this down a very few and are seeing sequential improvements already into our production. So I think you could expect over the next few quarters that we're going to be in a much, much better position.\nAllen Mistysyn: And the only thing I'd add to that is, we haven't called it out. It's -- so it's not material to the consolidated results. And as you know, it's split kind of between consumer products, it's split in industrial within each of those segments, it's not material. So that's why we haven't called it out.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, just sensitive to those that are affected by it, it's very material. If you think of our sales teams or our customers. Al was exactly right on a consolidated basis. But there have been many of our people that have been forced to work through some pretty challenging times and customers that have been working with us on that. So the materiality on a consolidated basis may not be as impactful as what it is to some of those that are truly impacted by it.\nKevin McCarthy: Appreciate the perspective. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is live. \nJeffZekauskas: Thanks very much. I was looking at your midrange assumptions on Slide 8. And in it, you assume that prices are, call it, up 5%, which is about $1.1 billion. And if volumes are down 5% maybe the detriment is 550. And SG&A, up mid-single digits is about 300, FX is maybe another 100, but that would be offset by a raw material decrease of 4%. So with these assumptions, why shouldn't your EBITDA be up $400 million rather than down $150 million at the midpoint. What is it in here that's really pulling the returns down if prices are really going to be up5%?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Jeff, I think what -- we went round and round in this about mid-single-digit range because you're talking at a mid-single-digit range. You've got a pretty wide margin. So I would say -- at the midpoint, we're thinking maybe a little bit lighter on the price impact and a little heavier than what you mentioned on the demand side and the volume side. So I think there's nuance in that, and this is why, to be honest with you, I struggled with laying this out that way because you can interpret it just as you have, if you go to the high end of each of those that are positive and the low end of each of those that are negative, I can get a significantly different results. So to clarify, that's why I'm saying, in the range in the midpoint, we do expect EBITDA margin expansion and EBITDA growth, it's just not going to be as significant as you're talking about.\nJeff Zekauskas: And then for a follow-up, I think you had aspired to a 45% gross margin in the fourth quarter. And maybe you came in closer to 43%. Was it that volumes weren't as strong as you expected? Or was there a different factor?\nAllen Mistysyn: No, I think you're exactly right. And you're dead on, excluding onetime and items and acquisitions, we're probably 43.1%. And it's really by the missing tag. It's our highest margin business. It came in below the bottom end of our range. And as John talked about, some of the other segments, PNM, DIY were double digit but below our range. And we also I hate to throw a weather out there, but the last -- that snowstorm around Christmas really felt like a lot of people took the whole rest of the year off. Now that being said, we are seeing those sales back in our first quarter in January and our first quarter -- start to the first quarter is where our outlook is current...\nJohn Morikis: Yes, the last couple of weeks, it really dampened down and contractors pretty much checked out throughout that. And to Al's point, as January started, you see them back in the store activities right back where we expected it to be.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks so much. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is live.\nMichael Sison: Yes. Just one quick question. When you look at the midpoint of your guidance, I think you all said that the first half will be better than second half. So any help in terms of -- is volumes kind of flattish in the first half or down a lot more in the second half? And how does that sort of split up in terms of the 8.30. How much more front-end loaded is it than the second half? Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Jeff -- Mike, I would say from a volume standpoint, we're expecting and I'll start with architectural volume. We're expecting architectural volume and TAG specifically to be up low single digits in the first half and then moderate certainly in the back half. Because when we think about the cadence of new residential and how I have it built into our plan, we'd start seeing a material slowdown as you get midway through the second quarter. That would accelerate into our third quarter. And then even if it's a shallow slowdown and it starts coming back, like I talked earlier, starts start coming back. We're not going to see the impact of that until three or four months out. So that's why it's a bigger negative impact on our fourth -- our second half than our first half. And as we've talked about, as volume goes, our operating margin and operating leverage is driven mostly by that. We expect to see more price in our first half than our second half as we annualize the price increases throughout the year, we'll see those moderate. And then we also expect to see more of the acquisitions in performance coatings in our first half and the sales and EBITDA incremental improvements there. And then as the July 1 acquisitions annualized, that will be more muted. And then a little bit offset by the way raw materials rolled out. Jim talked about the 4%, low to mid-single-digit benefit it's a little heavier on our back half than our front half just because even the first quarter, we might be flat or up or down slightly.\nMichael Sison: Okay. And any help on the EPS cadence or...\nJohn Morikis: Well, going back to the volume as the first half volume is there, it will flow through.\nMichael Sison: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. \nVincent Andrews: Thank you. If I could just ask, if you think about the 2 halves of the year, and it's well understood that you've got some visibility in 1 half and you don't in the back half. And it's also well understood now what the key macro drivers are and so forth. If you think about the back half of the year and the back half of the year winds up coming in worse than you anticipated in the different segments. What do you think the key risks are in those segments that we really need to be watchful of to sort of be on guard in case that back half wounds up actually being worse than what you anticipated to be?\nAllen Mistysyn: I think, Vincent, the thing that -- I would say it this way, the thing that we're watching specifically is within TAG and within new residential -- and the -- it's not an exact science when you look at the timing of a potential slowdown as John talked about, and the macro headlines of single-family starts slowing.  You see some of the national homebuilders talking about the lower orders, but it's really as the homes get to completion is what impacts our sales the most and there's variability in that. So as we continue to work with our national homebuilders and get a clean line of sight of that and the impact that not only has on our new residential and TAG, but also kitchen cabinets, flooring and furniture on our Performance Coatings businesses, that's going to be the main driver of whether the second half is stronger or less strong than what our current outlook is.\nVincent Andrews: And can I just ask 1 quick follow-up would be in Consumer Brands and in Performance Coatings. In Consumer Brands, are there any shelf space issues that we should know about? And likewise, are there any share gains or losses in Performance Coatings?\nAllen Mistysyn: I think there's no impact on the shelf impact shelf restriction on consumer, but I think there's a huge amount of market share gain opportunities within our industrial businesses, and that's all of them. As John talked about, we do not have 100% market share in any of our businesses, segments or regions and that's the way we're going into 2023. We're marching aggressively. So there are terrific opportunities that we're going to be pursuing. And we often talk about the coiled spring as this business comes back and we grow share, grow customers and it returns, it's going to spring. \nVincent Andrews: Okay. Best of luck.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live. \nArun Viswanathan: There's been a lot of discussion here on the new housing market. Obviously, we've seen a slowdown there. We did see that permits are also down 40% year-on-year. I guess my question is there has been a greater correlation though with architectural gallons sold in existing home sales. And there's probably a lag between starts in existing home sales as well. So could you comment on what's your outlook for existing home sales and how that ties into your guidance? Do you see any risk that maybe the low end is not low enough if the existing market gets worse from here? Thanks. \nJim Jaye: Arun, on the existing home sales, I'd remind you that drives a portion of our res repaint, but there's other factors as well that drive that repaint business. And I think, as John said, in his comments, that's an area we've been investing in more stores, more reps to go after res repaint. So I mean if you look at existing home sales, they've been down for 16 straight months but you've got other things that might offset that home price appreciation is still up year-over-year. You got the aging housing stock. You've got the baby boomers aging in place, all these things we've often spoken of. So while that will be a headwind, there's other things that will help drive that repaint. And along with the share gains that John is talking about, we think got a good outlook and high expectations for res repaint next year.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Ron, the only thing I would add to that is, as you know, res repaint is our fastest-growing segment. It's our largest segment, and it's our largest opportunity for market share growth. And I think that's what the focus of our TAG team is on with the specific investments in dedicated new res repaint stores and dedicated res repaint reps.\nJohn Morikis: As part of what gives us the confidence as we compare this to the last slowdown, we came out of the last slowdown determined to grow that residential repaint business to help offset, we call it almost a resilient segment, having the growth that we have had and we continue to invest. I think I don't know what the number is out. What the number of stores that we have now versus the last slowdown were up, how many?\nAllen Mistysyn: A little over 1,200 stores since 2010.\nJohn Morikis: 1,200 more stores now versus the last slowdown, probably a near similar number of reps focused on this area. And so it shouldn't be a surprise that we're growing the last 10 years over 11.5% and the conviction and determination that we have, I think, is an all-time high. And we expect, as we work through this challenging times to grow more share that we'll enjoy as the business -- through this as well as when the business comes back.\nHeidi Petz: So I would add to that, too, I think over the last 10 years. I think while the marketing dynamics certainly are similar to back 2008, 2009, I would say it's almost even better now. There's so much change in the market. I think as you mentioned, our incremental store count, we've been aggressively adding stores. Our competition, I would say, has been aggressively closing down stores. So with these changes, there's been some confusion in the marketplace that we believe is our opportunity. So we're adding a new store about on average every four days. And I think we'd all agree we're confident in our long-term strategy, but our near-term ability to execute.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks. And just another follow-up, I guess, was given that a lot of your growth, you're investing is mainly on the organic side. Are there inorganic opportunities as well that may present themselves in a downturn like this? What are some of the areas within the portfolio that you'd need to buttress if at all? I know you made the bolt-ons in some of the raw material and technology areas, but anything would it be more like in those areas? Or is it industrial? Or what are you looking at for potential M&A?\nJohn Morikis: Well, we've been investing in a number of transactions that we think are terrific. We've been investing primarily on our Performance Coatings side. We've invested in industrial businesses, general industrial in Germany, industrial wood business in Italy. We've got a number of flooring businesses that we've welcomed into the family. And our goal here is not -- we're not portfolio managers. We don't bring them in and run independent businesses. These are going to be contributors on a much brand or scale to the overall business.  So technology that we acquire in some part of the world we're immediately looking at how we leverage that across the entire platform. So as you're watching and absorbing the acquisitions that we're making, I hope everyone understands, we're really not interested in buying small positions in different parts of the world. We're making these acquisitions, and we'll leverage them across the entire platform around the world. So these have been good investments, we think, and there's still a considerable amount of opportunity ahead to better leverage them going forward.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO Capital. Your line is live. \nJohn McNulty: Just one kind of cleanup question on pricing. So in the deck that you showed on Slide 8 where it showed consolidated pricing carryover and there was a range, low single digits to mid-single digits. I guess what drives the range there? Because it sounds like it's just a carryover from kind of where you ended 4Q. So I guess what would make it go to the low end versus the mid-single-digit side? I guess, how should we think about that?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, John, I think it's somewhat similar, I would think, as when we talk about a range on raw material costs, there's a lot of different market dynamics from demand and other things that might cause that range to move. The point I would [Technical Difficulty] TAG 5 different price increases over two years. We fully expect to maintain the majority of that price. So even a slight decrease, increase or movement within that range doesn't impact the overall fact that we're going to maintain the majority of that price as we've done in similar environments in the past, and I think that's similar across the industrial businesses and consumer because we are looking at the total input cost basket that's affecting what price increases we've gone out with and what continued investments we've been able to make as we bring our gross margin back towards that long-term rate of 45% to 48%. So just to be clear, we kept investing when we're taking margin contraction through the cycle and now that margins start improving again. We can continue those investments to drive growth, both through our retail partners, through our own stores and help our industrial partners drive growth as well.\nHeidi Petz: Yes. I'd add to pricing isn't just a quick 30-minute discussion with our customers. It's the result of adding value everyday that's allowing us to be effective with them. So when you think of the value that we're bringing. It goes well beyond the product, but you talked earlier about services, project health, digital convenience. So we're really confident we're going to be able to hold on to this. We're not just talking about price of kind of a stand-alone discussion, so confident we're going to be able to hold on to that.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up. So your stores tend to have a higher service component to it than maybe some of the competitors out there, and that's helped you on the share front. But I guess our concern would be with labor inflation as big as it is and labor being a bigger component of your cost, I guess do you have enough levers that you can pull to offset that beyond price because your competitors may not actually have to raise price as much to deal with kind of wage inflation. So I guess, how should we think about that?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, John, it's about driving higher quality products that make our companion contractors more efficient, allows them to get more jobs done with the same number of painters and it drives their bottom line. And I think when you look at it in an inflationary environment, and we've talked about this in the past, you tend to see more -- and I'll use as res repainters move up to a higher quality product because they're going to pay more for that gallon of paint. The gallon of paint is small relative proportion to the overall cost of a project. So as we get those higher quality products in their hands and show the efficiencies they can get, it drives higher -- as you imagine, higher quality products, higher margins. And that's how our strategy is when we innovate new products, and I've said this many times before, you always innovate the high end of the good, better, best continuum and over time, that good gets replaced. So I think that's a big lever for us and a big driver of how we can continue to expand our margins.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks so much for the color. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Your line is live. \nJohn Roberts: Great. Thank you. the DIY paint historically is not price elastic, but do you think that some of the demand weakness here is that prices just got too high?\nJohn Morikis: Well, I'd say that our residential repaint business is strong, and it's as even more in times to have a contractor apply to paint, John.\nJohn Roberts: I was asking DIY consumer, sorry.\nJohn Morikis: I know I understand that, but I'm saying that in the market, we are having customers that are continuing to invest in their homes as prices have gone up and in the breadth of product that we offer, while there's a wide platform of price points, we continue, as I mentioned, to see stickiness in the higher quality products.  So I don't know that it's -- we've reached a point of demand destruction. If that's your question. I think the consumers are very well aware of inflation in the market, and I think that they're making decisions right now. No question that building up your tank has been more expensive than it has been in the past. But I'll go back to the point that we made earlier, which is that it's a -- amongst all the opportunities to influence the environment, which is most important to most of us, where you live, relative -- still a relatively inexpensive but highly impactful investment in your home.\nAllen Mistysyn: John, the only thing I would add to that is -- and we saw this in our second quarter, and I think it segment our DIY customers between what we see in the retail channels versus what we see in our stores, certainly, with the inflation of energy and food, and we saw a bigger impact on demand in our retail channel versus our stores channel. So there may be that nuance that you're seeing.\nHeidi Petz: One piece I would add to that, too, in terms of just elasticity, I think there's also the dynamic with the consumer DIY segment to Al's point, where they're purchasing less frequency, you're going to have some that are more value conscious. But we have introduced and innovated so many different products that have brought trading up to be more attractive, whether it's [indiscernible] increased durability. And so that consumer that's paying every five to seven years has demonstrated a willingness to pay for that as well. \nJohn Roberts: Okay. And then, Heidi, I think you mentioned that coil was one of the stronger end markets. Isn't that appliances and sheet metal for construction? What's going on there that, that outperformed?\nJohn Morikis: John, you might have misunderstood my voice versus Heidi so it was my voice that talked to coil. We have a nice business in our coil business that is impacted by our appliance business. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we do see some settling, if you will, in the appliance business as there's kind of a reset to inventory level. So it has impacted our coil business.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is live. \nJosh Spector: A question on the China and the aerosol restructuring. I guess it's a pretty significant amount of sales you maybe walking away from or rationalizing. I guess, are we past the point of having any ability to monetize that?\nAllen Mistysyn: I'm sorry, Josh, when you say we past the point of ability to monetize it. No. I think we have consistently taken a review of our portfolio of businesses, brands, customer programs. And I think we look at it both midterm on their ability to get significant market share growth and return on sales and cash flow. But we also take a longer-term view of it to say, if there are opportunities to monetize the business. We'll work to reorg to get it in position and pursue that option, among other options. You can run it for cash, you can run it as a growth business or you can monetize it like you're talking about. So each of those options are being evaluated and we'll update the Street as we get to that. The short-term reality though is that market, in particular, China, architectural is under heavy pressure, and we have to and we did take appropriate significant actions to adjust to that market conditions.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Appreciate that. If I could ask 1 just to follow up on Res. I mean it's obviously down low to mid-single, put a small dent in the 30% plus you guys have absorbed in terms of increases. I guess is this where raw materials stabilize in your view? And I guess if you have a weaker view on volume in the second half, do you have any visibility to either longer-term contracts or anything else becoming a relief point for raw materials into the next year?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Josh, I think you hit it, I mean, if demand continues to deteriorate, we would -- or more so than what we expect in the back half, you'd expect raw material costs to drop with that. And there's not long-term contracts or agreements that lock us into to not participate in those kinds of actions.\nJohn Morikis: These principles of supply demand we've dealt with for decades.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. \nGregMelich: Thanks. Two questions. One, thanks for the helpful CAGRs on new resi versus resi repaint. Could you remind us as to how much bigger the resi repaint businesses compared to new residential?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. It's -- Greg, it's today, 2:1 res repaint versus new residential. Back -- prior to '08 and '09, it was 1:1. So John talked about the tremendous low double-digit growth in both segments since 2010. It's just the new res repaint was starting from a higher base.\nGreg Melich: So repaint is 2x new res today? \nAllen Mistysyn: Yes.\nGreg Melich: Perfect. And then the second is more about understanding the gross margin progression. It sounds like 45% to 48% is still the right goal. I think, John, you talked about getting that in a couple of years in a normalized environment. So I guess my question is, if volume this year ended up being flat or slightly up as opposed to down, would we be back in that 45% to 48% range this year? Or is there something else going on that is impacting being on...\nJohn Morikis: No, I think that's a fair -- that's directionally fair. I think if the volume is better. And in particular, the volume is better in TAG because it's our highest gross margin segment. And yes, with the pricing that we would maintain the majority of monitoring raw materials, the continuous improvement mindset that we have across our manufacturing and distribution facilities all play into driving that margin to that 45% to 48%. But to your point, Greg, it's always about volume, and it's about volume through TAG that's going to help lift that gross margin.\nGreg Melich: Fair enough. Would it be fair to use the fourth quarter as a proxy to get an idea of that operating leverage? In other words, it looks like volume was maybe 300 or 400 bps lower than you thought it was going to be and gross margin end up being 200 basis points lower? Or am I thinking about that the wrong way?\nAllen Mistysyn: No, I think you're I would say, you're directionally accurate here.\nGreg Melich: Yes, good luck and thanks for all the info. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is live. \nSteve Byrne: Just following up on the comment, John, you made earlier about your home center partners or you're helping them as they requested for the Pros Who Paint. And I was just curious whether any of your home center partners within consumer are trying to do what you can do through your stores, like delivery of large volumes to the job sites on a digital access. Are you seeing any of them do that? And does that have any impact on your stores in the area?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Steve, I want to be really clear here that we're supporting our customers and their efforts to apply and execute on the strategies that will help them grow in this business. I think what you're trying to get after is cannibalization between the home centers and our stores. And we've looked at this in great depth. There would be very little -- there might be a few accounts here. They are a small amount. But we would gladly put those on the table to expand into a virtually untapped market for us. And the painter that's in our stores every day has expectations that are likely best filled through a specialty paint store. Some of them find their way into home centers, and we want to support those that find their way in there. But I would say that the target here and the higher level of success is going to be attracting those customers into the home centers that prefer the home center experience, largely because of the breadth of the product lines. And so we're not bashful about it. There'll be a little bit of cannibalization, very little compared to the opportunity that collectively we can pursue with our partners.\nSteve Byrne: Okay. And I wanted to ask you how much visibility do you have to the backlog that your contractors have? And do you have a view on how much do they have, whether it's residential repaint versus commercial and property management? Are those meaningfully different right now? And was there a big change recently. We had some dialogue with some contractors where there was a significant change like in the last month.\nJohn Morikis : Yes, there's been some change. I referenced that earlier that the pipeline of bidding has tempered down a bit. The quality of those bids seems to be improving and the scope of the projects continue to actually grow. I'd also say -- so the answer is yes. We do work closely with our customers. And as I mentioned previously, we I think are working much closer with them than ever in my career, partially because of the experience that we've had over the last couple of years. And so I'd say there's a wide spectrum. If you look at the one end, the commercial painting contractor and the industrial painting contractor, they generally have a longer view of what's happening because of the scope of the project. On the commercial side, something might be coming out of the ground and that project may be in a couple of years in the making. Industrial side, when they're talking about the protection of assets, there's usually a plan that they're following. That would be on the far right side. And on the other side, a shorter line of sight would be the residential repaint side. And in between would be property maintenance and new residential where there are varying lengths of view, if you will. So we work with our customers, all of them to have a good understanding. There has been some shift that's reflected in our guidance that we've given. But again, I want to reiterate, I want to -- this is really important. I apologize for repeating it so often here. We're not sitting here on our back saying well bad things are happening to us. We're aggressively pursuing any one of these segments we can talk to, what we think the market is going to perform it and how much better we expect to perform in that market. So whilst even some of the bidding that might have tempered down, again, we're not sitting here with 100% market share. We're aggressively pursuing and we expect our competitors as they pull back, we're going to take advantage of those opportunities as well as the new products. You mentioned a couple of those, the services, the new stores, we're going to be very aggressive during these times. And we expect as we go through this, to grow share. And as we come out of it, that coil spring is going to pop.\nHeidi Petz: The other thing I would add is, I think everything that John just covered across segments, I would say that in general, our customers like we have become better planners. And together, we are creating not just that stickiness we always talk about, but becoming better business partners and business planners together.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Your line is live.\nGarik Shmois: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on the SG&A guidance range? And what are some of the factors that you're going to be looking at when you decide to pull the trigger on some of the growth initiatives versus pulling back some. Is just a function of how demand is tracking this year? And maybe when do you have to make that decision, just given the range is down low single digits to anywhere to up mid-single digits through the year?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Garik, I think we look at it as we progress through the first half and get a better outlook coming into the second half. I would tell you that from a G&A standpoint, we are going to maintain our G&A tightly through the first half. I think you're going to see us -- I'll use the term pedaling clutch like one of our predecessors here have used where we'll spend merchandising, advertising, things of that nature that are not committed and their they are discretionary. We'll manage those to how demand outlook we feel like.  And it's on the long-term growth investments that you can expect us to continue to push those through stores, reps. We just talked about the Pros Who Paint because we have confidence and we have a lot of strong outlooks for the long term when it comes to architectural demand. We talked about packaging, we talked about any number of market share opportunities we have across all our businesses.  So the confidence we have in the long-term outlook makes you say that we're going to continue to invest in these long-term growth opportunities. These other noncustomer-facing type of spending, we're going to maintain very closely.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Thanks. Follow-up question is just on the pace of new store openings for '23. Just given that it picked up quite a bit in the fourth quarter, should we expect it to revert to maybe kind of a more linear pacing or any color on how that looks?\nJohn Morikis : Garik, we've been trying to spread those out more evenly for 38 years that I've been with the company. For a lot of reasons that they get back loaded as the year unfolds. We've got a good line of sight on the number and locations. But I would say they're likely going to be -- I hope not as backloaded as last year, but they're going to lean in the back half of the year again in 2023.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Thanks. And best of luck. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, and thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. As we went through our comments, I believe you heard that we're very confident in our strategy going forward. I'm very confident in our people. It's a very deep and experienced team. But at the same time, given what we see today, our outlook, I think, is a very realistic one starting off this year. Even in that outlook, we're going to continue to gain share. We're going to continue investing in the business to grow. You heard Al say we're going to control the G&A very tightly. And I think John said it multiple times that we really expect to outperform the market just as we have in the past. So thank you for joining us today. As always, I'll be available along with Eric Swanson for follow-up calls. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Americas Group, where sales increased 15.7% driven by mid-single-digit volume growth and continued effective pricing. Segment profit increased by $126.4 million and segment margin improved 210 basis points to 17.2%. Our pro architectural sales grew by a high teens percentage of the quarter, led by property management and followed by new residential, commercial and residential repaint, respectively. Sales in Protective & Marine, DIY and Latin America, all increased by double digits, but were below the TAG segment guided range. From a product perspective, interior and exterior paint sales were both strong, with interior sales growing faster and representing a larger part of the mix. We opened 40 net new stores in the fourth quarter and a total of 72 net new stores in 2022. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased by 2.4% in the quarter, which was better than our guidance. Sales decreased due to lower volume sales and low single-digit FX headwinds, partially offset by price increases. Sales were slightly positive in North America and Europe, but more than offset by significant continued weakness in China due in large part to COVID-related lockdown. Customers managed their inventories as inflation continued to pressure DIY paint demand from consumers for this segment. Tightness in alkyd resin also impacted our ability to produce stains and aerosols. Adjusted segment margin was 11.3%, up 500 basis points year-over-year. We also made good progress in the quarter on the China architectural and aerosol restructuring actions that we described last quarter. The actions in the fourth quarter resulted in $25.6 million in onetime restructuring costs and a $15.5 million impairment charge. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 4.2% and were driven by mid-teens pricing, partially offset by a low double-digit decrease in volume. Mid-single-digit sales from acquisitions were offset by a mid-single-digit unfavorable FX impact. Adjusted segment margin increased 530 basis points to 14.2% of sales. This is the third straight quarter that this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement driven by execution of our strategy, including effective pricing actions. Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased double digits against a challenging comp. Latin America sale also increased by double digits against a strong comp. Sales in Europe decreased high-single-digits against a double-digit comparison and amidst continued economic slowing. Sales decreased by a low teens percentage in Asia against a double-digit comparison and as COVID lockdowns continued to impact demand. From a division perspective, Growth was strongest in coil, which was up by a low double-digit percentage, followed by auto refinish and general industrial, which were both up mid-single digits. Packaging was down low single digits driven by negative double-digit FX impact in Europe and Asia and against an extremely strong comparison last year of over 30%. We continue to feel very good about our packaging position and expect this to be a recession-resilient performer. Industrial wood was down low teens as the housing slowdown is impacting furniture, flooring and cabinetry market. Similar to Consumer Brands Group, Performance Coatings made good progress on its portion of the targeted restructuring actions that we described on our last call, resulting in $22.2 million in onetime costs in the quarter. With that, let me turn it to John for his comments on our full year results and our 2023 outlook. Yes, sure. No, I think the last 10 years that John referred to has really put us in a strong position in new res. And we have every intention of aggressively pursuing share gains, especially during what we will consider to be pretty choppy waters ahead. We're going to continue to focus on growing our exclusive relationships. And I would expect that we're going to add to an already strong percentage of mutually beneficial exclusive relationship. For example, we look at our partnerships here pretty broadly and these builders that we're working with. It's really allowing us to collaborate in areas such as reducing complexity simplification and importantly, execution and utilizing our store platform, our technology, our supply chain and also importantly, our technical teams, we're really partnering to help these builders to respond to today's challenges and really helping them to reach their goals. So ultimately, reducing complexity may assist in their efforts to drive efficiency and productivity. And new products really play the key role in the help assist during some of these challenging times. For example, we're going to be introducing extreme build -- an extreme high build interior latex. And in a segment that's going to be under pressure, you may be asking yourself why we're bringing new products. But to be truthful, this is where we do help our customers win. This extreme high build lets the contractor build eight to 12 mils wet film thickness versus the more conventional four to six mils. So if you can imagine, just minimizing surface imperfections and excellent touch up, especially in an environment where labor is a challenge and an issue for these drywallers and painters. This product is helping to hide the spends of what I would call maybe less experienced drywallers and really improve the speed for painters. So essentially, everyone is winning here.  So you can kind of ask what to expect. John mentioned this earlier, the rate increases will pressure our builders, and we will grow share, but we were not going to be immune to the impact of these rates. We're going to respond to these changes. And I would expect that our builders will do the same. They may adjust floor plans. Many are looking at standardization, but no one will respond like Sherwin-Williams. We're going to take this expertise. We're going to aggressively go to builders that may have relationships with some of our competition. And we're going to demonstrate these capabilities in a way that will allow us to grow share. So while in the short term, we'll likely feel pressured. We like the favorable demographics. The existing housing shortage gives us a great deal of confidence that our strong and growing position in new res will benefit our shareholders.  So we look at the strong business through both a short and long-term lens. I would say in the short term, given our success and our position in the market, and we may over-index right now while we're working through some of the short-term choppiness. But in the long term, make no mistake, we do believe that this is in our best interest to continue to pursue these important gallons. Well, part of the fact that we've built really strong momentum here. I think this is certainly not by chance, but by design continuing to develop innovative products. John referenced some of the services, innovative solutions to differentiate ourselves and we couldn't do it without our incredible team. Our managers are reps, they play an extremely significant role in all segments, but I would argue in the res repaint segment, which really responds well to our high-touch personal service really can help to differentiate our model. We often talk about our secret weapon is our people. And I think clearly on display as we're helping our customers navigate through unprecedented challenges for them as well and challenges such as labor when res repaint, our full product line really allows contractors to step up in quality, helping to compensate for some less experienced applicators. And as we continue to see our customers do step up in quality, the results are clear that they are becoming more successful. And we're helping them prepare for some choppiness ahead, I would say, in addition to the whole product line, preparing for some new substrates. I'll give you an example here. In homes where our res painting, we're in the midst of rolling out a new kitchen cabinet refinish paint product.  So if you think of the homeowners that are affected by certainly higher costs and not willing to replace entire cabinet systems, but willing to refinish their existing cabinets, we're helping contractors to serve these clients with some profitable solutions. So amongst our new products, we're going to be introducing a self-cleaning Exterior Woods capes Stain as well for the exterior, which I just mentioned. So each and every rain will have a home looking freshly painted. So literally, the dirt will wash away with every rain, which is a pretty incredible technology, and we'll look like a newly painted home.  So our position in res repaint continues to improve. In fact, we continue to not only grow share but accelerate some of these share gains. So while the bid activity has adjusted, overall, it's still strong. Our average job size is increasing, and our focus continues to be and will be on new accounts and share of wallet. Yes. Kevin, I would tell you that the availability, I'm not a surprise that alkyd resin does remain an industry-wide challenge. I give our technical teams and commercial teams a lot of credit for working through some very thoughtful and, in some cases, upgraded substitutions during this challenge. And we've really isolated this down a very few and are seeing sequential improvements already into our production. So I think you could expect over the next few quarters that we're going to be in a much, much better position. So I would add to that, too, I think over the last 10 years. I think while the marketing dynamics certainly are similar to back 2008, 2009, I would say it's almost even better now. There's so much change in the market. I think as you mentioned, our incremental store count, we've been aggressively adding stores. Our competition, I would say, has been aggressively closing down stores. So with these changes, there's been some confusion in the marketplace that we believe is our opportunity. So we're adding a new store about on average every four days. And I think we'd all agree we're confident in our long-term strategy, but our near-term ability to execute. Yes. I'd add to pricing isn't just a quick 30-minute discussion with our customers. It's the result of adding value everyday that's allowing us to be effective with them. So when you think of the value that we're bringing. It goes well beyond the product, but you talked earlier about services, project health, digital convenience. So we're really confident we're going to be able to hold on to this. We're not just talking about price of kind of a stand-alone discussion, so confident we're going to be able to hold on to that. One piece I would add to that, too, in terms of just elasticity, I think there's also the dynamic with the consumer DIY segment to Al's point, where they're purchasing less frequency, you're going to have some that are more value conscious. But we have introduced and innovated so many different products that have brought trading up to be more attractive, whether it's [indiscernible] increased durability. And so that consumer that's paying every five to seven years has demonstrated a willingness to pay for that as well. The other thing I would add is, I think everything that John just covered across segments, I would say that in general, our customers like we have become better planners. And together, we are creating not just that stickiness we always talk about, but becoming better business partners and business planners together."

            "name": "Allen Mistysyn",
            "content": "Ghansham, this is Al Mistysyn. The only thing I would add to that, to your point, interest rates bounced around. And just like we talked about, as interest rates rose, it takes time to filter through the market and specifically into paint. So if you think about paint, we're always at the end of the project. So even if starts flip today, you're talking three to four months out, assuming no supply chain challenges before we get to our part of that project. And those are the things that we'll keep monitoring and pushing on with our teams to make sure we're gaining an outsized portion of the share as it returns. Yes. David, the only thing I would add just to put some color around 2023 on pricing in general. We talked about on our third quarter call that we had no additional pricing, we'd expect a mid-single-digit impact on our full year '23. Obviously, that would be a little bit higher in our first quarter. Our expectation is we're going to maintain the majority of our price like we've seen in the past. We think we've gotten past the margin contraction portion of that cycle. We're starting to see margin improvement sequentially and year-over-year, and we expect that to continue going into 2023. Yes. I don't know we're going to quantify the dollar impact. But because we had to build so much inventory in 2022 to get back to more historic levels, and we are going to see a negative impact. And you could think about, and I talked about this, we'd expect a 5% to 7% decline in production gallons specifically on architectural. We are definitely expecting to see that. And that will have a drag when we look at Consumer Brands Group because that's where our global supply chain is embedded. So you're not going to see as much margin dollar improvement just for that very fact all else being equal. Yes. And the only thing I would add to that, on the retail channel side, I think coming out of the third quarter, you heard some of our peers talk about destocking. We did not see that. So we were probably a quarter later anticipated some of that. And as a result, you saw consumer do a little bit better in the fourth quarter than we had planned. Yes, Kevin, it's really not a material change when you restate all of the factor -- all the income statement, it might give it a little bit of a lift on the TAG side because, as you well know, Latin America has been dilutive of TAG. But on the consumer side, where we're at today, versus where Latin America is. And I'll give Latin America shout-out. They've done a lot of hard lifting and rightsizing their business and are now back to focusing on growth where before it was about cost management and that type of thing. So now that team is externally focused and really going after market share growth. So I don't think you're going to see a material change on either segment because of this. But I think from a strategic standpoint, a focus standpoint and where the market trends are, it's the right decision at this time. And the only thing I'd add to that is, we haven't called it out. It's -- so it's not material to the consolidated results. And as you know, it's split kind of between consumer products, it's split in industrial within each of those segments, it's not material. So that's why we haven't called it out. Yes, Jeff, I think what -- we went round and round in this about mid-single-digit range because you're talking at a mid-single-digit range. You've got a pretty wide margin. So I would say -- at the midpoint, we're thinking maybe a little bit lighter on the price impact and a little heavier than what you mentioned on the demand side and the volume side. So I think there's nuance in that, and this is why, to be honest with you, I struggled with laying this out that way because you can interpret it just as you have, if you go to the high end of each of those that are positive and the low end of each of those that are negative, I can get a significantly different results. So to clarify, that's why I'm saying, in the range in the midpoint, we do expect EBITDA margin expansion and EBITDA growth, it's just not going to be as significant as you're talking about. No, I think you're exactly right. And you're dead on, excluding onetime and items and acquisitions, we're probably 43.1%. And it's really by the missing tag. It's our highest margin business. It came in below the bottom end of our range. And as John talked about, some of the other segments, PNM, DIY were double digit but below our range. And we also I hate to throw a weather out there, but the last -- that snowstorm around Christmas really felt like a lot of people took the whole rest of the year off. Now that being said, we are seeing those sales back in our first quarter in January and our first quarter -- start to the first quarter is where our outlook is current... I think, Vincent, the thing that -- I would say it this way, the thing that we're watching specifically is within TAG and within new residential -- and the -- it's not an exact science when you look at the timing of a potential slowdown as John talked about, and the macro headlines of single-family starts slowing.  You see some of the national homebuilders talking about the lower orders, but it's really as the homes get to completion is what impacts our sales the most and there's variability in that. So as we continue to work with our national homebuilders and get a clean line of sight of that and the impact that not only has on our new residential and TAG, but also kitchen cabinets, flooring and furniture on our Performance Coatings businesses, that's going to be the main driver of whether the second half is stronger or less strong than what our current outlook is. I think there's no impact on the shelf impact shelf restriction on consumer, but I think there's a huge amount of market share gain opportunities within our industrial businesses, and that's all of them. As John talked about, we do not have 100% market share in any of our businesses, segments or regions and that's the way we're going into 2023. We're marching aggressively. So there are terrific opportunities that we're going to be pursuing. And we often talk about the coiled spring as this business comes back and we grow share, grow customers and it returns, it's going to spring. Yes. Ron, the only thing I would add to that is, as you know, res repaint is our fastest-growing segment. It's our largest segment, and it's our largest opportunity for market share growth. And I think that's what the focus of our TAG team is on with the specific investments in dedicated new res repaint stores and dedicated res repaint reps. A little over 1,200 stores since 2010. Yes, John, I think it's somewhat similar, I would think, as when we talk about a range on raw material costs, there's a lot of different market dynamics from demand and other things that might cause that range to move. The point I would [Technical Difficulty] TAG 5 different price increases over two years. We fully expect to maintain the majority of that price. So even a slight decrease, increase or movement within that range doesn't impact the overall fact that we're going to maintain the majority of that price as we've done in similar environments in the past, and I think that's similar across the industrial businesses and consumer because we are looking at the total input cost basket that's affecting what price increases we've gone out with and what continued investments we've been able to make as we bring our gross margin back towards that long-term rate of 45% to 48%. So just to be clear, we kept investing when we're taking margin contraction through the cycle and now that margins start improving again. We can continue those investments to drive growth, both through our retail partners, through our own stores and help our industrial partners drive growth as well. Yes, John, it's about driving higher quality products that make our companion contractors more efficient, allows them to get more jobs done with the same number of painters and it drives their bottom line. And I think when you look at it in an inflationary environment, and we've talked about this in the past, you tend to see more -- and I'll use as res repainters move up to a higher quality product because they're going to pay more for that gallon of paint. The gallon of paint is small relative proportion to the overall cost of a project. So as we get those higher quality products in their hands and show the efficiencies they can get, it drives higher -- as you imagine, higher quality products, higher margins. And that's how our strategy is when we innovate new products, and I've said this many times before, you always innovate the high end of the good, better, best continuum and over time, that good gets replaced. So I think that's a big lever for us and a big driver of how we can continue to expand our margins. John, the only thing I would add to that is -- and we saw this in our second quarter, and I think it segment our DIY customers between what we see in the retail channels versus what we see in our stores, certainly, with the inflation of energy and food, and we saw a bigger impact on demand in our retail channel versus our stores channel. So there may be that nuance that you're seeing. I'm sorry, Josh, when you say we past the point of ability to monetize it. No. I think we have consistently taken a review of our portfolio of businesses, brands, customer programs. And I think we look at it both midterm on their ability to get significant market share growth and return on sales and cash flow. But we also take a longer-term view of it to say, if there are opportunities to monetize the business. We'll work to reorg to get it in position and pursue that option, among other options. You can run it for cash, you can run it as a growth business or you can monetize it like you're talking about. So each of those options are being evaluated and we'll update the Street as we get to that. The short-term reality though is that market, in particular, China, architectural is under heavy pressure, and we have to and we did take appropriate significant actions to adjust to that market conditions. Yes, Josh, I think you hit it, I mean, if demand continues to deteriorate, we would -- or more so than what we expect in the back half, you'd expect raw material costs to drop with that. And there's not long-term contracts or agreements that lock us into to not participate in those kinds of actions. Yes. It's -- Greg, it's today, 2:1 res repaint versus new residential. Back -- prior to '08 and '09, it was 1:1. So John talked about the tremendous low double-digit growth in both segments since 2010. It's just the new res repaint was starting from a higher base. Yes. No, I think you're I would say, you're directionally accurate here. Yes, Garik, I think we look at it as we progress through the first half and get a better outlook coming into the second half. I would tell you that from a G&A standpoint, we are going to maintain our G&A tightly through the first half. I think you're going to see us -- I'll use the term pedaling clutch like one of our predecessors here have used where we'll spend merchandising, advertising, things of that nature that are not committed and their they are discretionary. We'll manage those to how demand outlook we feel like.  And it's on the long-term growth investments that you can expect us to continue to push those through stores, reps. We just talked about the Pros Who Paint because we have confidence and we have a lot of strong outlooks for the long term when it comes to architectural demand. We talked about packaging, we talked about any number of market share opportunities we have across all our businesses.  So the confidence we have in the long-term outlook makes you say that we're going to continue to invest in these long-term growth opportunities. These other noncustomer-facing type of spending, we're going to maintain very closely."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Heidi, for that color on our fourth quarter segment results. I want to thank our teams for working hard to deliver a strong finish to the year. I'm particularly pleased with the significant adjusted profit margin improvement that all three segments delivered compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Our fourth quarter completed a strong year for Sherwin-Williams and I'd like to provide just a few high-level comments on our full year performance. On a consolidated basis, we delivered record sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted net income per share in 2022. We generated these results in a difficult operating environment, including relentless inflation, less-than-optimal raw material availability, a war in Europe and COVID lockdowns in China. Our people refused to be deterred by these challenges and continue to do what they do best, serve our customers. Our success stems from executing on our strategy, which remains unchanged. We provide differentiated solutions that enable our customers to increase their productivity and their profitability. These solutions center on industry and application expertise, innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution. None of this happens without the determination and dedication of our greatest asset, the more than 61,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams. Together, this team grew full year consolidated sales by 11.1% to a record $22.1 billion. It was the 12th consecutive year we have grown the business. On a segment basis, the Americas Group delivered 12.9% sales growth and grew profit before tax $197.5 million. Our largest customer segment, residential repaint, grew by a double-digit percentage for the seventh year in a row. Sales in all other customer segments were also up by double digits for the year. Consumer Brand sales were down 1.1% for the year. Sales were up mid-single digits in North America, our largest region. This was more than offset by double-digit declines in Europe and China. Although the bottom line results weren't what we expected, 2022 was a transition year for Consumer Brands Group as they completed a number of restructuring and simplification efforts to position the business for long-term success and driving operating margins back to the high teens. Performance Coating sales were up 13.2% for the year against a 22% comparison. All divisions grew with the exception of industrial wood. It was down less than 1%. Adjusted segment margin expanded 250 basis points to 14.1% for the year as we continue to recover from the highest cost inflation in the company and pursue our high-teens margin target for this segment. Adjusted diluted net income per share increased 7.1% to a record $8.73 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $3.61 billion or 16.3% of sales. Net operating cash for the year was $1.9 billion or 18.7% of sales. We returned a total of $1.5 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share buybacks in 2022.  We invested $883 million to purchase 3.35 million shares at an average price of $263.64. We distributed $618.5 million in dividends, an increase of 5.4%. We also invested $644.5 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $188 million for our building our future projects. We ended the year with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times. Additionally, we invested $1 billion in acquisitions that accelerated our strategy. I'd also like to mention our ESG efforts where we continue to work toward meeting our longer-term targets. Newsweek, Forbes and other third parties once again recognized various aspects of our program. Throughout the year, we continue to execute on continuous improvement initiatives and targeted investments to drive growth, competitiveness, efficiency and profitability. We opened 72 new paint stores and hired 1,400 management trainees. We introduced multiple new products while reducing SKUs and formulations. We expanded production capacity and enhanced procurement and logistics processes. We also continued on our digital and sustainability journeys, and we executed on our acquisition strategy. I am confident we widened the gap between Sherwin-Williams and our competitors in 2022, and that's just what we intend to do again in 2023. So turning to our outlook. We enter 2023 with confidence, energy and a commitment to seize profitable growth opportunities wherever we find them. We have clarity of mission. We have the right strategy. We're focused on solutions for our customers. We're spending more time selling products and less time sourcing them, thanks to recovery in the supply chain. We're simplifying the business, and we're executing on targeted restructuring actions. We've made the right growth investments, and we'll continue to do so. We also have a portfolio that should be more resilient than in prior recessions. And above all, we've got the right people. We expect to outperform the market just as we have in the past. At the same time, we're not operating with our heads in the sand. We currently see a very challenging demand environment in 2023, and visibility beyond our first half is limited. The Fed has also been quite clear about its intention to slow down demand in its effort to tame inflation. These factors have not changed from what we communicated on our third quarter call and our base case in 2023 remains to prepare for the worst. Based on current indicators, we believe this is the most realistic outlook at this time. On the architectural side, it's no secret that U.S. housing will be under significant pressure this year. Single-family permits have been down year-over-year for 10 consecutive months, and single-family starts have been down year-over-year for eight consecutive months. Mortgage rates also remain elevated.  As a result, we believe our new residential volume could be down anywhere from 10% to 20% this year. We expect our other PRO end markets to be more resilient than this, but there are headwinds in these areas, too. For example, existing home sales, which drive a portion of our repaint business have declined year-over-year for 16 straight months. Now while we see a backlog of new commercial construction, the Architectural Billing Index has contracted the last three months.  On the DIY side, we expect inflation to continue putting pressure on consumer behavior in the U.S. and in Europe. On the industrial side, the PMI numbers for manufacturing in the U.S., Europe, China and Brazil have been negative for multiple months. We have already seen an industrial slowdown in Europe and the same is beginning to appear in the U.S. across several sectors. In China, COVID remains a wildcard and the trajectory of economic recovery is difficult to map. The U.S. housing slowdown will also impact some of our industrial businesses, namely industrial wood where we have already seen pressure and coil to some extent. Our team fully understands the importance of winning new accounts and growing share of wallet in this environment, and that is where we will be focused. From a cadence standpoint, we expect year-over-year sales and earnings performance will be significantly better in the first half than in our second half, driven by several factors.  Our total company comparison will be much more favorable in the first half of 2023 as we delivered a very strong second half performance in 2022, where sales were up 13.8% and adjusted earnings per share grew by over 37%. As we've often said, volume is the key driver for operating leverage in our model. In the Americas Group, which is our largest and most profitable segment, our year-over-year volume comparisons are expected to be meaningfully better in the first half versus in the second half based on the trends we are currently seeing.  We also expect more carryover price in the first half of 2023, which will have the full benefit of our September 6, 2022 price increase in TAG as well as prior price increases in the other two segments, all of which will annualize in the back half of this year. Additionally, we expect new residential sales will hold up better in our first half before very meaningful deceleration of demand in the back half of the year. Acquisitions will also be a tailwind in our first half as we expect incremental sales of approximately $140 million from transactions which closed after July 1 of last year. Given these factors and the softening demand environment, we believe our expectations for the back half of 2023 are tempered appropriately at this time. As you would expect, we will gain more clarity as the year progresses, and we will provide a more finally tuned view of our second half outlook during our second quarter conference call. As we said on our last call, we anticipated the demand environment would be challenging in 2023, leading us to get out ahead on cost management with the targeted restructuring we began in the fourth quarter. We estimate the annual savings from this effort to be in the $50 million to $70 million range, with about 75% realized by the end of 2023, and we are reaffirming those estimates today. Our outlook also assumes our raw material costs will be down by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect to see the largest benefit occurring in the second and third quarters. We expect to see decreases across many commodity categories, though the ranges likely will vary widely. From an availability standpoint, certain alkyd resins remain a pain point, impacting stains, aerosols and some industrial products. We expect supply of these resins to continue improving through the first half of the year, in part due to ramping of our own internal production.  We expect other costs, including wages, energy and transportation to be up in the mid to high single-digit range. For the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will be flat to up by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2022, inclusive of a mid-single-digit price increase. Our sales expectations for the quarter by segment are included in our slide deck. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be flat to down mid-single digits, inclusive as a mid-single-digit price of carryover from 2022. Our sales expectations for the year by segment are included in our slide deck. We expect diluted net income per share for 2023 to be in the range of $6.79 to $7.59 per share. Full year 2023 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.81 per share and includes expense related to our previously announced targeted restructuring actions of approximately $0.25 to $0.35 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $7.95 to $8.65. We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. Let me close with some additional data points and an update on our capital allocation priorities. Given carryover pricing, raw material deflation and our ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, we would expect full year gross margin expansion. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to increase in 2023. This is similar to the slowdown in 2008 and 2009, where we continue to invest in long-term solutions for our customers that allowed us to grow at a multiple of the market when demand normalized. We'll also control costs tightly in non-customer-facing functions and execute on our restructuring initiatives. We have a variety of SG&A levers we can pull depending on a material change to our outlook up or down. We expect operating margin to modestly improve year-over-year, excluding restructuring and impairment costs and acquisition-related amortization expense. While we don't typically provide this level of color, we believe it is helpful to do so this year given the higher level of non-operating expenses impacting 2023. We expect to open between 80 to 100 new stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2023. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements as well as systems and product innovation. We expect to complete the targeted restructuring actions we announced on our previous call, including the benefits and onetime costs we have outlined. We will continue to simplify and optimize the organization. The Latin American business of the Americas Group is now being managed and reported within the Consumer Brands Group. The change allows TAG leadership to focus more exclusively on its core U.S. and Canada stores business. While the Latin America architectural demand and service model are trending to be more in line with CBG's strategy. This business had sales of approximately $700 million in 2022. The change will be marginally accretive to TAG and marginally dilutive to CBG.  You will see this change when we report first quarter results in April. Prior-year segment results will be restated at that time to reflect the change. The first quarter and full year guidance for 2023 we've communicated today does not reflect this change. Next month, at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 0.8% to $2.42 per share, up from $2.40 last year. If approved, this will mark the 45th consecutive year we've increased our dividend. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We do not have any long-term debt maturities due in 2023. However, we will reduce short-term debt to trend our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio towards the high end of our long-term target of 2 to 2.5 times. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. In addition, I will refer you to the slide deck issued with our press release this morning, which provides guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. Given the many variables at play, limited visibility beyond the first half and the high level of uncertainty in the global economy, we believe our outlook is a realistic one. Our slide deck further outlines the assumptions underlying our guidance and is based on our current dialogue with customers and suppliers and our reading of numerous macro indicators. As we get through our first half and we see more information, those assumptions could change. If those assumptions change for the better, we would expect to do better than the guidance we are laying out today. While we can't defy gravity, we do expect to outperform the market and our competitors in 2023. I'm highly confident in our leadership team, which is deep and experienced and has been through many previous business cycles. We've transformed our business in many ways since the last significant downturn, and we are now a stronger and a more resilient company. We also know our guidance is clearly reflective of the market pressure we are experiencing. We anticipated 2023 would be challenging. We've planned accordingly.  We have and will continue taking appropriate actions. We expect strong momentum coming out of this period of uncertainty, similar to prior downturns. That momentum will stem from our strategy of providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and more profitable. In challenging environments, like the current one, we can be an even more valuable partner to our customers, while we're also earning new ones. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Sure, Chris. I'll start with new residential. And what I'll do is I'll talk a little bit about new res and I'll hand it over to Heidi to talk a little bit about her view. She's obviously working closely with her teams, and then I'll pick back up on res repaint we'll do the same. New res, I would start with a very important fact that over the last 10 years, we've had a 10 year compounded growth rate of about 10.5%. So this has been an area of focus for us, and it's one where we have, I think, clearly demonstrated significant success, and we are determined to continue to drive that success. Permits and starts are down as we all know. And our relationships with our national builders are strong and getting stronger. There's a lot going on, and we're working closely with them. Heidi, why don't I give that to you? And maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're working on, on the new residential side? I think maybe just one more point or two points maybe on new res, Chris, to Heidi's point, I think our relationships with the new residential contractors, they're reaching new highs. I mean we're collaborating and working together. She mentioned, one of the new products that we're introducing, I think there's a steady stream of introductions of not only products, but services and collaboration that we think really helps us help our customers. And the other point Heidi is really driving with her team, Justin Binns, our Group President of our TAG business is really taking this terrific work in products and services beyond the large national homebuilders and even driving that down further into the regional builders, where there is terrific opportunity for growth. And so while we expect there will be choppiness in the new residential, and I think it's important to say this beyond just new residential. We're not just reporting things are tough and low as us. So that's not who we are. We expect it's going to be tough, and we're going to come out fighting and swinging aggressively. And so yes, we do well with a lot of the large national homebuilders. We're going to be fighting like crazy after these regionals and other customers that we don't have.  We expect new residential if you look at some of the information that's out there to be down in the 20% to 30% range. That's not what we're expecting for our business. That's what we see in housing starts. So actually, what we're saying is that the homebuilders are posting some of them in the 20% to 30% range, we expect to outperform that and bring in a much better number than that. But we'll feel the pressure.  We get really quick to the res repaint side, and we won't go through each of the segments with such depth. But I do think that, Chris, your point is, your question is right on point, given the headlines, if you will, that these two segments will play for us this year. In residential repaint, we would say that while we continue to grow, and again, another area of focus over the 10 years, our compounded growth here has been 11% -- a little over 11.5%. We do expect to see some deceleration in the annual gains. If you look at the LIRA and the NAHB projections they are positive, but at a decelerated rate largely tied to existing home sales. But this is also an area where people continue to invest. Painting remains a relatively inexpensive investment but a very impactful project, that along with the aging housing stock and home price appreciation, we think will have a positive effect on this business. But Heidi, maybe you could talk a little bit about res repaint, and some of the work you and your team are driving there. Just picking up the last point there is a good one. The quality of the leads in the bids, it seems like listening to a majority of our customers that while some of the bid activity may have tempered down a bit, the quality of the leads are actually increasing and the scope is actually increasing. So they're doing more there. And as she mentioned, we're trying to help them with projects like expanding into cabinets, introducing opportunities in garage floors and a lot of different areas. So even taking some of those new residential contractors that may have been primarily focused on new residential and helping them get into residential repaint. So we're really partnering very well with our customers to help drive their success and their profitability. So Chris, great question on those two segments. We think those are two really important segments for us going into 2023. Yes. Good morning, Truman, I'd begin by telling you that we called out here, we've seen a sequential decrease in our third quarter into our fourth quarter and we're expecting that trend to continue. In our first quarter, we're kind of expecting the basket to be flat to slightly up, and you'll see a bigger benefit as the year goes on.  To your point, key feedstock's like propylene, they have started to come down pretty meaningfully significantly. And eventually, it's going to find its way even more into the resins and the solvents that we buy. And that's starting to happen. We buy some of our raw materials on spot prices, so we can take advantage of that where it makes sense, and we have some on contract. I think what you also have to look at, though, is that as we look across the entire basket. Each commodity really has some dynamics associated with it. So while we're expecting down low singles to mid-singles for the basket, there's really a wide range across those different products that we buy. Some are better than that range and some are worse. And I think you're also seeing -- in addition to that, you're seeing input costs like energy and wages, which are very volatile. Those are also putting some pressure right now. So I think the takeaway would be you can expect us to continue working very closely with our suppliers to bring those costs in line with the industry demand levels, and that also reflects our position in the marketplace. And on the second half, Truman, I would say that the view of the first quarter, first half versus the back half, I think it's -- you can attribute that to a very fluid and changing market. Interest rates are moving up. Housing starts are adjusting accordingly. Quite honestly, in times like this, the flux in the market, and this is my 38 years of experience talking here as well is that the contractors vary in their ability to anticipate what's happening. Some of them will look at their short-term book and believe that everything is okay. We're working with those contractors to help them understand some of the pressures that are coming down the pipe. So some of what we leverage our own controlled CRM that we have developed, the fact that we've got almost 5,000 store managers and nearly 4,000 sales reps that feed a great deal of our understanding of the market.  At this time, there's a little bit of a disconnect in that because some of our customers are feeling perhaps more bullish than we think that they should feel. Others are tied to other areas such as new residential, and they understand what the pipeline looks like. So when we talk about the visibility that we have in the first half, it's tied more towards the bids and contracts that our customers have in hand. It gives us more confidence. And that's why, as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we get through the first half, we'll reevaluate. I want to be very clear, we won't be adjusting our earnings forecast after the first quarter. We expect to have a very good first quarter, but we're going to wait and see as we get through the second quarter, what the balance of the year looks like. Once we have that better visibility, we'll speak to our investors as to what to expect going forward. But I would also add is, as we've come through COVID and some of the shortages that we've had in the market, we've become much closer with our customers. It was one of the benefits of the challenges that we've had. And so we believe we'll come out of this with a better line of sight as that relationship has improved dramatically, and it was already strong. But I think that as we get through the second quarter, we'll have a better line of sight. Well, on refinish, I'd say there's a high demand here, coupled with a shortage of body texts and parts contributed to shot backlogs. We're working through a backlog of demand ourselves as we're securing more and more raw materials. As you work through some of these challenges, Ghansham, as you know, when there's a shortage of raw materials, the bottleneck moves through the process. So as we do get, which is a team effort at Sherwin, we're squeezing more and more raw materials and availability, that's improving, and we're trying to get more and more of the product out as a result of that. But as you look at automotive refinish, we're really pleased with the gains that we're gaining -- that we've gained, and we expect that to continue. I'd say packaging had a terrific year. Year-to-date, we finished the year in the mid-teens. That was on top of a year last year in the high 20s. So tough comparisons.  We're gaining a lot of share here. We're investing in capacity as fast as we've added capacity and add capacity, it's sold out. So the faster we can get that capacity up and running, the business will grow at an even faster rate.  Our coil business. This is seven consecutive quarters of double-digit growth here. Insight here that you're asking for, I'd say our North America end markets seem to be softening a bit. APAC, soft demand. And real estate market is limiting our extrusion business there and EMEA some pretty substantial declines as major coders in EMEA have shut down lines as a result of the demand. Our general industrial business, another strong year. And again, here, there are terrific opportunities within these segments. The heavy equipment market is very strong, and we expect that to continue into 2023, particularly in the ag and construction. Appliance manufacturers are appearing to slow down production as inventories get reset. Transportation and building products, I would say, are slowly down a bit. The industrial wood -- our industrial wood business is one that is tied to housing in many ways. If you look at kitchen cabinets, flooring, furniture, as I mentioned, they had a tougher quarter and were down slightly for the year. We've been investing in this business because we believe in our strategy. We've made a couple of acquisitions and have been open with the investors I've met with to tell them exactly that when we see these opportunities. We're a 156-year-old company. We're investing in this accordingly. We're not trying to win a week or a month or a quarter. We're investing long term. That confidence in our teams in each one of these segments, terrific leadership at the group level, Karl Jorgenrud, and we've got a lot of confidence that this is going to be a key driver for our business coming out of the choppiness and that we'll grow share during these choppy times. So it's really what we expect in the market. And again, we don't report we influence. We're going to outperform the market in each of these segments, we believe. Yes, it's a good question. I think you should expect us, first I want to be very clear, not waiting for the market to lift all the boats. I mean we're going to go really aggressively here, Ghansham, I would say that -- let me be careful in the words that I choose, but I would say I wouldn't want to compete with our team. These people are really well focused on the opportunities that we have. Yes, it will be impacted by housing starts, resale. We've got a terrific business in our property maintenance. We've always talked about kind of the table preparing from a strategic standpoint or which whatever way the table will tilt. And here in this environment, as the rates work their way through, if it's in residential repaint, you're going to see us outperform in residential repaint. If it's in property maintenance where people are going into multifamily homes as opposed to building homes, we're the leader there. And the same point on property maintenance as new res. We've done exceptionally well on a national standpoint. We're really cranking in after the regionals. This is the opportunity we have. We have competitors that are backing off because of some of the pressure in some of these segments. And we're going to go -- we're going to be aggressive. I'll just leave it there. We're going to be very aggressive in the regional pieces as well. One additional point, I'll go back to Heidi's comment about our over-indexing a bit in new residential. We've done very well here. And so as those points that Al just made as housing starts begin, while there will be a lag, we'll see the benefit of that in a considerable way. And when it's down, we'll feel it perhaps a little bit more. Why don't I start with that and Al, if I miss anything jump in here? I'd say that David, our view as it relates to pricing is always looking at total cost of the basket, not just raw materials, but everything from labor, transportation, containers, everything that goes into that. And right now, I would say, we've not announced any additional pricing. I think we've demonstrated the ability, desire and conviction to stay on top of that and the willingness to do that. So if, in fact, we find ourselves in that situation where we need additional pricing the first people that we'll hear about it will be our customers, and then we'll quickly advise the street of our actions. No. Most of our OEM customers operate on a very low min/max level. So they're leaning on us to be responsive for them. So while some would have inventory, I'd say that they lean on us and we support that as a means of helping them to be successful. Well, it's an important -- very important initiative for us. That's in our Consumer Brands Group. For those of you that may not be familiar with it. Todd Rea, our President there, is working closely with our teams to really capture a terrific opportunity. If you think about what we call the Pros Who Paints, it's someone that might be involved in either house flipping or remodeling and while we're very focused on the painting contractor through our store, there are customers who enjoy the wide breadth of assortment and availability of products that they get through a different format like a home center.  We're really excited about getting after this market because they prefer that type of a setting and we've got great relationships with customers that are interested in that. So I would say that in Sherwin, we're not a complacent company. There's good momentum here. But along with our customers, we want to go faster. We think some in the market have been enjoying an unencumbered run at this business, and we enjoy disrupting that and helping our customers to be more successful and we're intent on doing that. Good momentum, a lot of opportunity ahead. Yes. Kevin, I know you didn't ask specifically about -- I know you asked about the margin piece of it, but I do want to expand that to include it does have a positive impact on our TAG business. The focus on North America. We've got, as Al mentioned, a terrific leader, Alberto Benavidez down in Latin America that leads a wonderful team, and there's a shift in what's happening down there more towards what best aligns with our Consumer Brands Group. So it is a terrific opportunity from a best practice standpoint to align those two businesses. We think it's going to help our TAG business focus, and we do think that it will allow our businesses to share information. We'll take information out of Latin America that will bring up to North America and vice versa as well. Yes, just sensitive to those that are affected by it, it's very material. If you think of our sales teams or our customers. Al was exactly right on a consolidated basis. But there have been many of our people that have been forced to work through some pretty challenging times and customers that have been working with us on that. So the materiality on a consolidated basis may not be as impactful as what it is to some of those that are truly impacted by it. Yes, the last couple of weeks, it really dampened down and contractors pretty much checked out throughout that. And to Al's point, as January started, you see them back in the store activities right back where we expected it to be. Yes, Jeff -- Mike, I would say from a volume standpoint, we're expecting and I'll start with architectural volume. We're expecting architectural volume and TAG specifically to be up low single digits in the first half and then moderate certainly in the back half. Because when we think about the cadence of new residential and how I have it built into our plan, we'd start seeing a material slowdown as you get midway through the second quarter. That would accelerate into our third quarter. And then even if it's a shallow slowdown and it starts coming back, like I talked earlier, starts start coming back. We're not going to see the impact of that until three or four months out. So that's why it's a bigger negative impact on our fourth -- our second half than our first half. And as we've talked about, as volume goes, our operating margin and operating leverage is driven mostly by that. We expect to see more price in our first half than our second half as we annualize the price increases throughout the year, we'll see those moderate. And then we also expect to see more of the acquisitions in performance coatings in our first half and the sales and EBITDA incremental improvements there. And then as the July 1 acquisitions annualized, that will be more muted. And then a little bit offset by the way raw materials rolled out. Jim talked about the 4%, low to mid-single-digit benefit it's a little heavier on our back half than our front half just because even the first quarter, we might be flat or up or down slightly. Well, going back to the volume as the first half volume is there, it will flow through. As part of what gives us the confidence as we compare this to the last slowdown, we came out of the last slowdown determined to grow that residential repaint business to help offset, we call it almost a resilient segment, having the growth that we have had and we continue to invest. I think I don't know what the number is out. What the number of stores that we have now versus the last slowdown were up, how many? 1,200 more stores now versus the last slowdown, probably a near similar number of reps focused on this area. And so it shouldn't be a surprise that we're growing the last 10 years over 11.5% and the conviction and determination that we have, I think, is an all-time high. And we expect, as we work through this challenging times to grow more share that we'll enjoy as the business -- through this as well as when the business comes back. Well, we've been investing in a number of transactions that we think are terrific. We've been investing primarily on our Performance Coatings side. We've invested in industrial businesses, general industrial in Germany, industrial wood business in Italy. We've got a number of flooring businesses that we've welcomed into the family. And our goal here is not -- we're not portfolio managers. We don't bring them in and run independent businesses. These are going to be contributors on a much brand or scale to the overall business.  So technology that we acquire in some part of the world we're immediately looking at how we leverage that across the entire platform. So as you're watching and absorbing the acquisitions that we're making, I hope everyone understands, we're really not interested in buying small positions in different parts of the world. We're making these acquisitions, and we'll leverage them across the entire platform around the world. So these have been good investments, we think, and there's still a considerable amount of opportunity ahead to better leverage them going forward. Well, I'd say that our residential repaint business is strong, and it's as even more in times to have a contractor apply to paint, John. I know I understand that, but I'm saying that in the market, we are having customers that are continuing to invest in their homes as prices have gone up and in the breadth of product that we offer, while there's a wide platform of price points, we continue, as I mentioned, to see stickiness in the higher quality products.  So I don't know that it's -- we've reached a point of demand destruction. If that's your question. I think the consumers are very well aware of inflation in the market, and I think that they're making decisions right now. No question that building up your tank has been more expensive than it has been in the past. But I'll go back to the point that we made earlier, which is that it's a -- amongst all the opportunities to influence the environment, which is most important to most of us, where you live, relative -- still a relatively inexpensive but highly impactful investment in your home. John, you might have misunderstood my voice versus Heidi so it was my voice that talked to coil. We have a nice business in our coil business that is impacted by our appliance business. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we do see some settling, if you will, in the appliance business as there's kind of a reset to inventory level. So it has impacted our coil business. These principles of supply demand we've dealt with for decades. No, I think that's a fair -- that's directionally fair. I think if the volume is better. And in particular, the volume is better in TAG because it's our highest gross margin segment. And yes, with the pricing that we would maintain the majority of monitoring raw materials, the continuous improvement mindset that we have across our manufacturing and distribution facilities all play into driving that margin to that 45% to 48%. But to your point, Greg, it's always about volume, and it's about volume through TAG that's going to help lift that gross margin. Yes, Steve, I want to be really clear here that we're supporting our customers and their efforts to apply and execute on the strategies that will help them grow in this business. I think what you're trying to get after is cannibalization between the home centers and our stores. And we've looked at this in great depth. There would be very little -- there might be a few accounts here. They are a small amount. But we would gladly put those on the table to expand into a virtually untapped market for us. And the painter that's in our stores every day has expectations that are likely best filled through a specialty paint store. Some of them find their way into home centers, and we want to support those that find their way in there. But I would say that the target here and the higher level of success is going to be attracting those customers into the home centers that prefer the home center experience, largely because of the breadth of the product lines. And so we're not bashful about it. There'll be a little bit of cannibalization, very little compared to the opportunity that collectively we can pursue with our partners. Yes, there's been some change. I referenced that earlier that the pipeline of bidding has tempered down a bit. The quality of those bids seems to be improving and the scope of the projects continue to actually grow. I'd also say -- so the answer is yes. We do work closely with our customers. And as I mentioned previously, we I think are working much closer with them than ever in my career, partially because of the experience that we've had over the last couple of years. And so I'd say there's a wide spectrum. If you look at the one end, the commercial painting contractor and the industrial painting contractor, they generally have a longer view of what's happening because of the scope of the project. On the commercial side, something might be coming out of the ground and that project may be in a couple of years in the making. Industrial side, when they're talking about the protection of assets, there's usually a plan that they're following. That would be on the far right side. And on the other side, a shorter line of sight would be the residential repaint side. And in between would be property maintenance and new residential where there are varying lengths of view, if you will. So we work with our customers, all of them to have a good understanding. There has been some shift that's reflected in our guidance that we've given. But again, I want to reiterate, I want to -- this is really important. I apologize for repeating it so often here. We're not sitting here on our back saying well bad things are happening to us. We're aggressively pursuing any one of these segments we can talk to, what we think the market is going to perform it and how much better we expect to perform in that market. So whilst even some of the bidding that might have tempered down, again, we're not sitting here with 100% market share. We're aggressively pursuing and we expect our competitors as they pull back, we're going to take advantage of those opportunities as well as the new products. You mentioned a couple of those, the services, the new stores, we're going to be very aggressive during these times. And we expect as we go through this, to grow share. And as we come out of it, that coil spring is going to pop. Garik, we've been trying to spread those out more evenly for 38 years that I've been with the company. For a lot of reasons that they get back loaded as the year unfolds. We've got a good line of sight on the number and locations. But I would say they're likely going to be -- I hope not as backloaded as last year, but they're going to lean in the back half of the year again in 2023."

A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up this session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sherwin-Williams had an excellent performance in the third quarter, including high-teens sales growth resulting in the first $6 billion sales quarter in company history; significant, sequential and year-over-year gross margin improvement, record adjusted diluted earnings per share and strong cash flow. Demand remains strong in pro-architectural and North American industrial end markets in contrast to continuing softness in Europe and China. While year-over-year cost inflation remained very significant in the quarter, we were encouraged by a modest sequential decrease in raw material costs. The industry supply chain also continued to stabilize, though conditions remain tight with some previously noted specialty resins in particular remaining in limited supply. Throughout the quarter, our team continued to focus on growth initiatives, product innovation, customer solutions, pricing actions, cost control, supply chain improvements and business optimization activities while also taking actions and planning for a wide range of scenarios that could unfold next year. I'd like to go through just a few of the numbers at a high level and then turn it over to John, who will provide some additional color on the third quarter and our outlook. Comparisons in my comments are to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Starting with the top line. Third quarter 2022 consolidated sales increased 17.5% to a record $6 billion. Pricing was in the low double-digit range. Consolidated gross margin increased to 42.8%. This was an improvement of 120 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially, reflective of our pricing actions. Gross margin improved sequentially month-to-month in the quarter, with September increasing 650 basis points year-over-year. SG&A expense decreased to 25.3% of sales. Consolidated profit before tax increased $265.7 million or 43.5%. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $2.62 per share versus $1.88 per share a year ago. Excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense, third quarter adjusted diluted net income per share increased 35.4% to $2.83 per share versus $2.09 a year ago. EBITDA in the quarter was $1.12 billion or 18.6% of sales. Moving on to our operating segments. Sales in The Americas Group increased 21.4%, driven by double-digit volume growth across all architectural end markets and high single-digit price increases. Segment profit increased by $132.6 million and segment margin was 21.2%, which was about flat with last year and up 30 basis points sequentially. Sales in the Consumer Brands group increased 8.5%, driven by a low double-digit price increase, which offset lower sales volumes, primarily outside of North America. Continued tightness in alkyd resin impacted North America stain and aerosol sales. Adjusted segment margin was 16.2%, up 150 basis points year-over-year and 500 basis points sequentially. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 13.7% and were driven by mid-teen price increases, partially offset by a less than 1% decrease in volume. Mid-single-digit sales from acquisitions were offset by a mid-single-digit unfavorable FX impact. Adjusted segment margin increased 590 basis points to 16.4% of sales, due primarily to higher selling price increases. Let me now turn it over to John to provide some additional commentary, before we move on to your questions.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As we've indicated since the start of the year, we expected 2022 would be a year of two contracts to have, and that's exactly what we're seeing play out. We delivered strong results in the third quarter, and I want to thank our entire leadership team and all 61,000 employees for their focus, their determination and drive in what remains a challenging operating environment. We continue to have great confidence in our strategy. Before moving on to our outlook, let me provide some additional color on our third quarter. In The Americas Group segment, we delivered record sales and PBT. Mid-teens volume growth and high single-digit pricing drove sales, which were up by a strong double-digit percentage in every end market we serve. The sales growth was led by DIY, which was compared to an extremely soft quarter a year ago, where we prioritized our Pro customers given limited product availability. Sales growth was next strongest in our property management, followed by new residential, residential repaint and commercial, respectively. Sales were also up by a double-digit percentage in Protective & Marine, but were dampened by the ongoing limited availability of alkyd resin. We are seeing strong effectiveness from the 10% price increase we announced September 6. TAG segment profit increased due primarily to double-digit paint volume growth and selling price increases, partially offset by increased raw material costs and higher SG&A costs related to continued investments in our long-term growth initiatives and our strategy. From a product perspective, exterior and interior paint sales were both strong, with exterior sales growing slightly faster and interior being the larger part of the mix. We've opened 32 net new stores year-to-date and expect to open 40 to 50 in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in our management training program, expecting to hire more than 1,400 college graduates that will enter this program this year and who will be the future leaders of the company. We also added sales reps and territories in the quarter, along with ongoing growth investments in innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services. Our Consumer Brands Group had a much improved quarter, led by sales that exceeded our guidance. Sales in North America increased by a double-digit percentage, driven largely by price. DIY paint demand remained sluggish, as inflation continued to pressure consumers, while continued tightness in alkyd resin impacted our ability to produce stains and aerosols. On a positive note, the Pros Who Paint segment again grew by a strong double-digit percentage. Sales in China were down by a double-digit percentage, due mainly to the COVID-related lockdowns. Europe was also down double digits due to the slowing macroeconomic environment. Segment margin improved significantly, primarily due to selling price increases and good cost control, partially offset by lower sales volume, increased raw material costs and higher supply chain costs. The Performance Coatings Group followed a very good second quarter with another strong performance in the third. Sales were up mid-teens, including mid-teens pricing and a mid-single-digit benefit from acquisitions, partially offset by a very slight decrease in volume in a mid-single-digit impact from unfavorable FX. For the second straight quarter, this team delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement, driven by execution of our strategy, including effective pricing actions. The 16.4% adjusted margin in the quarter was the highest for the segment since the acquisition of Valspar. And excluding the impact of acquisitions closed over the last 12 months, adjusted segment margin was 17% in the quarter. Although, we're pleased to have reached the low end of our expressed margin target of high teens low 20s. We know there's a significant amount of opportunity ahead. I'm proud of our team's efforts to reach this goal and know they understand the high expectations we have for continued improvement. Sales varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased double digits against a challenging comp and included low single-digit volume growth. Latin America sales also increased by double digits against a strong comp. Sales were up high single digits in Asia, driven by price as COVID lockdowns continue to impact demand. Sales in Europe were backward mid-single digits against a double-digit comparison and continued economic slowing. Every division in the group grew led by coil and followed by packaging, auto refinish, general industrial and industrial wood. We're also pleased by what we're seeing so far from the recent acquisitions we've announced in this segment. Again, these businesses added mid single-digit growth in PCG sales in the quarter though this was nearly all offset by unfavorable FX. Earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire ICA, a high-quality European business focused on innovative wood coatings. Before moving to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $203 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $48 million to purchase 200,000 shares at an average price of $237.81 per share. We distributed $155.8 million in dividends. We also invested $175 million in our business through capital expenditures, including $125 million in core CapEx and $50 million for our building our future project. We closed three acquisitions in the third quarter for approximately $440 million. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.1 times as we increased short-term borrowings to fund our recent acquisitions. We'll drive the ratio to our long-term target of 2 to 2.5 times range in 2023. We will use cash in the fourth quarter of 2022 to manage debt and share buybacks will be done to offset option dilution. Turning to our outlook. We expect to deliver a very solid fourth quarter, resulting in our second half sales increasing by a low double digits to mid-teens percentage. And second half diluted earnings per share increasing by 35% at the midpoint of our guidance. Within The Americas Group, demand is strong across all of our pro-architectural markets, including new residential, despite higher interest rates, with customers reporting strong backlogs that will take them through the end of the year and likely longer. We also see a unique opportunity to continue winning new business as our competitors transition their pro contractor business models and our differentiated model has never been more on display in value than it is today. Within the Consumer Brands Group, we expect the North American DIY consumer to continue to face inflationary pressures and Europe and China remain challenging. Within the Performance Coatings Group, demand remains strongest in North America, our largest region. European demand slowed in the third quarter, and we expect continued softness in the fourth quarter. In Asia, the pace of recovery from prior COVID lockdowns in China and prospects for additional lockdowns make it difficult to assess demand trajectory. From an industry supply chain perspective, we're largely getting the raw materials we need, though the availability of alkyd and some specialty resins remain choppy and is impacting certain product lines within Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings. While we continue to push hard, we don't expect meaningful improvement in the availability of these resins until the first quarter of next year. Some near-term inefficiencies remain in our own supply chain as we continue to take steps to overcome industry issues and serve our customers. On the cost side of the equation, our full year raw material inflation guidance remains in the high teens. We expect to see further sequential decline of raw material costs in the fourth quarter, though they will remain elevated year-over-year. We expect the trajectory of raw material costs to continue trending favorably as we exit the year, although the pace and level of potential relief next year is difficult to project. Additionally, along with the highest inflation rate we've seen in 40 years, we're also experiencing significant higher costs and other elements of our cost basket, including labor, transportation and fuel and other costs. We will continue to monitor these costs, fight hard to offset them and respond with additional pricing, if necessary. So specifically for the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect our consolidated net sales will increase by a high single to low double-digit percentage, inclusive of a low double-digit price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up high teens to low 20%. We expect Consumer Brands to be down a mid to high single-digit percentage, and we expect Performance Coatings to be flat to up a low single-digit percentage. We expect North America, which is the largest region within PCG, to be up a low teens percentage. For the full year 2022, we expect consolidated sales to increase by a low double-digit percentage, inclusive of a low double-digit percentage price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up by low double digits to mid-teens percentage. We expect Consumer Brands Group to be down a low single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low double to mid-teens digit percentage. Given the many variables we've noted, we left our diluted net income per share guidance for 2022 unchanged and in the range of $7.65 to $7.95 per share. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance includes Valspar acquisition related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share of $8.50 to $8.80, which represents mid single-digit percentage growth from 2021 at the midpoint in what continues to be a challenging macro environment. This guidance implies a second half adjusted diluted net income per share of $4.63 per share at the midpoint, an increase of 35% over the same time period last year. In addition, we provided updated guidance on several of our full year data points in our slide deck, including our expectations for FX, CapEx, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. We expect our full year tax rate will remain in the low 20% range. While we're not prepared to provide any specific guidance on 2023 at this time, I would like to comment on demand trends and actions we're taking that will impact our 2023 outlook that we will provide in January. We expect slowing new residential demand with elevated interest rates and other costs that are impacting new single-family home permits and starts. However, multifamily production has maintained strong momentum. It's also clear that macro headwinds are likely to continue and potentially worsen in Europe and China. Our base case in this environment remains to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. I'm highly confident in our leadership team, which is deep in experience and has been through many previous business cycles. We've transformed our business in many ways since the last significant downturn, and we are now a stronger, more resilient company. We know what to do. To this end, we've been evaluating multiple options available to us based on a wide range of scenarios, and we are prepared to take appropriate actions beginning this quarter. These include the following we continue to review our portfolio of businesses, brands and customer programs to ensure that they are adding above-market growth and long-term shareholder value. As a result of this work, we are announcing action plans to simplify our operating model and portfolio of brands in Consumer Brands Group and to reduce costs in all regions in Performance Coatings Group, Consumer Brands and administrative segments. These actions, once finalized, could include one-time costs or charges in the range of $160 million to $180 million over the next four quarters, and could result in annual run rate savings of approximately $50 million to $70 million once fully implemented. Additional details on these planned actions are outlined in the slide deck issued with our press release this morning. We will call out significant one-time charges and update our progress on run rate synergies on future quarterly earnings calls. We remain committed to our strategy of providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and profitable. In challenging environments, we have the opportunity to become an even more valuable partner to our customers. We will continue to focus on new account growth and share of wallet initiatives. We will leverage our strength in recession resilient end markets, including residential repaint, property management, packaging and auto refinish, all of which are larger than they were in previous cycles. We will continue to invest in growth initiatives, including adding stores, sales reps and innovative products and services. We will continue to invest in our people, including our management trainee program I previously mentioned, along with ongoing training that positions our people as one of the most significant amongst our many points of differentiation. We will continue implementing appropriate pricing actions across the company to offset persistently higher input costs, with a focus on regaining our gross margins back to our long-term target range of 45% to 48%. We will continue investing in acquisitions that can accelerate our long-term strategy and top-line growth, and expand our operating margins, including our most recent announcement of European Wood Coatings leader, ICA Group. We will maintain our disciplined capital allocation philosophy. We will not hold cash, while investing appropriately in CapEx, paying a dividend, targeting acquisitions that accelerate our strategy and absent M&A buying back our stock. In sum, we expect to deliver a solid fourth quarter to complete a very strong second half of 2022, and we're also taking actions to get ahead of what could be a challenging 2023. We don't expect to be immune from any number of potentially difficult scenarios, but what we do expect is to outperform our competitors and the market. We will do this by leveraging the best team in the industry. We remain committed to creating shareholder value over the long term. And that concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Vincent Andrews.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you. Just a question on TAG and the margin, both sequentially and year-over-year. You saw a lot more improvement in margins in the other two segments. I mean you didn't TAG. So I was wondering why that was. I did notice you called out some long-term investment spending in TAG that might have affected that. So perhaps, you could talk about that a little bit as well in terms of what that is? And whether it carries over, not just in the 4Q but into next year as well?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. Yes, I mean, we saw a little over 20% increase year-over-year in our segment profit. Flow-through is a little in the low 20% range, and it typically is the case. We had higher sales volumes, which generally drives improved operating margin. I've historically talked about a low to mid-single-digit volume gain, getting in a normal state environment, mid- to high 20%. We had one really month of selling price increases, but these are still partially offset by the higher raw material costs that we had talked about being sequentially better, but still up maybe a mid-single digit in our fourth quarter. And really, the higher SG&A costs that we called out are the continued investments in long-term growth initiatives. So we've added 67 stores. We've put in over 80 reps. We've added headcount into our stores to support the growth outlook. And as John mentioned, we're going to add and really accelerate our growth in the fourth quarter by adding 40 to 50 new stores. So what I would expect in the fourth quarter is, you're going to see your normal seasonal slowdown in architectural demand, which is typical, and you also see a sequential decline in operating margin, but we expect stronger flow through in our fourth quarter, really upwards of over 30%. And you get a full quarter of the 10% price increase for -- that was implemented September 6. I would tell you, that price increase is going even a little better than what we had seen in the past, the fourth quarter sequential moderation of raw material costs and an easier comp. So you're going to see bigger year-over-year improvement in our operating margin in the fourth quarter. And you're going to see that SG&A growth into the first half of next year, and we'll give you more color on that in January.\nVincent Andrews: And just as a follow-up, we talked a lot about raw material shortages for a year now, and part of what you were doing this year was trying to get your TAG inventory back to a comfortable level to service your customers. Are you there now? And given that maybe a lot of that was done over the last quarter or two when raws were peaking, should we be thinking about you carrying sort of peak COGS inventory into next year's spring season, or how should we think about the cadence of sort of lower raw material costs flowing through in TAG specifically?\nJohn Morikis: Vincent, I'll take the inventory piece first, and I'll show it to Al to talk to the accounting. Yes, we're in a very good place right now for the majority of our products. I mentioned earlier, the issue that we continue to face with the alkyd resin and some of the specialty resins, we'll fight through that. It's getting better. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to have the majority, if not all of that behind us, at the end of the first quarter. But for the most part, the remaining portion of our product line is available for our customers. You should -- and I know you do know Sherwin-Williams, our model is not to unlock the door and hope that people are finding their way back into our stores to find them. Our sales reps and store managers are very aggressive in the hunt of pursuing customers, both existing and new to share with them the fact that we have these products available for them.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. And Vincent, we actually built a little bit of inventory from our second quarter to our third quarter, which is typically not the case. But to meet the strong demand that we're seeing, specifically within TAG with mid-teen volume growth in our third quarter and high -- low double-digit we expect in our fourth quarter, I think what you're going to see us do is try to manage our architectural inventory by year-end, maybe up another 4 million gallons. The reality of that is, we're going to monitor that very closely as the quarter progresses and look at demand trends specifically going into our first half next year, and we may adjust that number a little bit. And that's specifically to the DSCs. Our store level inventories are in great shape. We are meeting our demand -- our strong demand with high service levels, and we expect to continue to do that. But as you can imagine, we're -- as our inventories get in better shape, we'll get back to managing our working capital. Our working capital at the end of the third quarter is over 12%. We're going to target to try to drive that down between 11% and 11.5% by year-end, but still a very strong inventory position going into next year.\nJohn Morikis: And Vincent, this ties also back to your first question on the SG&A to Al's earlier point. We are continuing to invest in people to provide the service in the stores. So, as the product becomes more available, you may recall in the last couple of quarters, we talked about the new account activity at record levels and active accounts. So, now we've got a lot more people coming into our stores, new accounts coming in. We've got product available. We want to make sure that we have the service to deliver on our promise. And so they're all interrelated, and they're all working very well.\nVincent Andrews: Great to hear. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson.\nTruman Patterson: Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, clearly, there are a lot of moving parts on raw material inflation between suppliers, the petrochem oil. But John, you mentioned the trajectory of raw material cost that's trending favorably as you exit the year. Can you just help us understand at this point in time what the gross margin basket or the raw material -- sorry, raw material basket might look like exiting the year sequentially versus kind of third quarter levels?\nJim Jaye: Yes, Truman, this is Jim. I'll take that one. So, if you look at our third quarter, the raw material basket was up by mid-teens percentage year-over-year. I think as we get into the fourth quarter, we're looking at that being more like a mid-single-digit year-over-year number. I think, as John said in his prepared remarks, the trajectory is good and heading in the right direction. I think it's hard to project exactly what it's going to do next year. We're trying to still formulate that, and we'll come back to you in January with our full year guide to give you some more color on that.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Truman, I'd just add to that. As we typically do and our planning for the upcoming year, we work with our suppliers closely on looking at demand trends, looking at volume trends by region, and it gives us a better line of sight as we get through the end of the year. And that's why January, we are able to give you a much better outlook on the raw material basket and other input costs, quite honestly, as we've talked about. Labor rates have been up high single digits, and in some cases, across our supply chain, low to mid teens in an effort to reduce turnover, which is very expensive, but the expertise that goes with that turnover and then freight and other transportation costs. So, we'd like to talk about the full basket as we get into January, and we'll have a better line of sight to that.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then, you all mentioned some of the cost control initiatives in PCG and CBG in preparation of a slowdown, right? Savings of $50 million to $70 million annually. I'm hoping you can walk through those in a bit more detail. And then also, assuming volumes turn negative or remain negative through '23, how does that impact your thoughts on kind of decremental operating margins for both of those segments?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Truman, I want to be careful about getting into too much detail on this call. I mean, we're making these decisions in our fourth quarter and going forward. And it's -- as we talked about on our second quarter earnings call in July, it's part of our normal earning process that we continue -- and as John talked about, we continue to assess these portfolio of business brands and customer programs and their ability to drive above-average market share growth and the operating margin and cash flow targets we set for them. And if we don't see that happening, we take action similar to what we did with the -- exiting the East private label business, the sale of our Australia and New Zealand business architectural. I would say, on the run rate savings, more of that is due to the portfolio review than what I would call more purely cost reductions, and that's relative to the macroeconomic headwinds we're seeing. And it's probably a 60-40 split. And why I think that's important is because, we're not overreacting to the macro environment. It means that we are driving operating margin improvement across consumer brands, across the PCG. And I would even venture to say that within PCG, yes, as John talked about, we hit the low end of the high teens of 17%. We have more work to do. This -- these actions we're taking in the coming quarters is not related to our long-term high teens, low 20 operating margin. This is really in response for the slowdown we're seeing in Europe and Asia. So we have opportunities to grow with platform consolidations. As we integrate these acquisitions going into next year, they'll start to be accretive as we get to the second half. So, if we see additional slowdowns in demand, we have more levers to pull to offset any decremental operating margin. So...\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. And Truman, I\u2019d answer this point as well. When you heard Al talk about not overreacting, I think your question is a good one, but I'd also point out that there are many areas of our business that we're actually continuing to invest and in some accelerating investments. So the leadership that we have, the ability to view and see where those opportunities are, I think, comes with a great deal of experience and what we're doing. And so we just talked about adding stores as an example. We'll have 35 new stores in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, 40 to 50 this year, this fourth quarter compared to 35 last year. And if you look at the staffing that we just talked about investing in digital programs that we're investing in. So we are making, we believe, the appropriate steps in reducing where we need to, but we're also investing in those areas that are appropriate.\nAl Mistysyn: The only other comment I'd make, Truman, related to that on the one-time cost. We'll call those out as we have typically done in the past, specifically even with the Valspar integration. So we didn't put them in the guidance in the fourth quarter. There are estimates. The timing is uncertain. We're pushing the teams pretty hard to take action and get these done, but we'll call them out over the next quarterly calls, and we expect to get approximately 170 over the next four quarters.\nTruman Patterson: Perfect. Thank you all and good luck in the upcoming quarter.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Truman.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Josh Spector.\nJosh Spector: Yeah. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. A question on the Performance Coatings guidance. I guess, when I look at things sequentially, normally, it's relatively stable. You guys maybe have a 10% decline. Understanding things are getting worse in some of the regions, but I think when I look at some of the competitor guidance, things were already pretty bad in 3Q, and generally things stay bad into 4Q. Your guidance implies things are getting worse. So I'm wondering if you can maybe dig into some of the details there about getting worse or maybe your 3Q was helped by some items, which go away?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Josh, I think where we're seeing maybe a little bit more of a slowdown would be in Europe and Asia. And I think our largest region, North America, we talked about being in the low to mid-teens and price will start to annualize, so you don't get as much of a tailwind on price. Our comps are still pretty strong in our fourth quarter relative to last year. And so I don't know there's a significant step change that we're seeing other than -- I think we've got to be prepared and try to look at -- based on our history and what we've seen over the last few years is maybe a little bit wider range on sales as we go into the fourth quarter with the holidays and things of that nature. So I don't want to read too much into that other than maybe a little less price as we get into the fourth quarter and then a little bit worsening outside of North America.\nJohn Morikis: Well, I do think, to Al's point, if you look at the comps, if you take, for example, our packaging business, we had a high single-digit growth this past quarter versus strong double-digit comp. If you go into next quarter, fourth quarter comps last year were up over 30%. We've got a lot of momentum here in this business. We expect it to continue to win with our customers and grow with them. If you look at coil at a similar situation, fourth quarter last year, comps were up 20% coming off of a strong double-digit growth here as well. So there are some really strong performances here up against some really strong comps, and we think that these teams are continuing to grow in a pretty challenging environment.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Jeff Zekauskas.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In the fourth quarter, should your average prices in TAG be up about six percentage points sequentially?\nAl Mistysyn: No, Jeff. I think what what's going to happen is, we're going to get the full quarter of 10%. We're going to annualize the August 2021, 7%. We're going to annualize the September 4% of last year's surcharge. So when you net them all together, it's about flattish quarter-to-quarter or high single digit.\nJeff Zekauskas: I'm sorry, the fourth quarter of 2022 relative to the third quarter of 2022? Shouldn't \u2013 since your prices are lifting, you increased prices 10% in early September, shouldn't you capture that all sequentially? No?\nAl Mistysyn: We are, but we're also annualizing some of the price we took last year. So from quarter-to-quarter, our dollars will be higher. I agree with that, but it's still in the high single-digit range for TAG.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. And then in terms of raw materials, can you frame the alkyd resin sales and EBITDA penalty for 2022? And is TiO2 \u2013 are TiO2 prices going down sequentially in any area other than Asia?\nJim Jaye: Yeah. I'll take the TiO2 piece, Jeff. What we did see in the quarter was some inflation that's happening. I think as we go forward, it will depend on some of the softening demand that we're seeing. And I think it's part of our overall view that TiO2 should start to be part of that basket that starts to moderate. The alkyd piece, I'll let Al.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Jeff, I think the alkyd impact. I mean, it could be around 1% on top line. It's \u2013 we're having to make choices. So, as an example, why it's difficult to pinpoint it. We're \u2013 there's a broad basket of alkyd, and we're somewhere getting fully what we need. Others, we're not. And it's just trying to look at ordering and reorders and things like that. So I think it's about 1% on the top line. The bottom line, I don't think we've quantified or really going to quantify at this time.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nAl Mistysyn: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Ghansham Panjabi.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess, first off, starting off with TAG and the various sub-verticals within there, residential repaint has been a very strong grower for you for many years. I think part of that has just been due to higher home prices and consumers accordingly investing in what typically is your biggest asset. So just based on that, how do you think that category evolves as higher mortgage rates start to impact housing prices perhaps on the downside going forward?\nJohn Morikis: Ghansham, I might say it remains positive. If you talk with our contractors, they look at the backlog ahead, and they feel it's a terrific opportunity for them to continue to grow. The LIRA, if you look at the forecasting they have, is for double-digit growth for the remainder of 2022 going into 2023. I would agree that there's some projections that remodeling may slow down mid-2023, but I'll also remind you that paint represents a terrific project to have high impact of relatively low cost. And while rates are moving, house price appreciation has also moved as has the aging of housing. The stock -- aging stock home price -- values, I'm sorry, let me do this. The aging home continues to require more remodeling, more updates, people aging in place, and we see that. You see it in the NAHB, which has slowed just a bit, but still well above 50. And while existing home sales have slowed against strong comps, it's largely because of lack of inventory. And when people have a tendency to stay in home, they'll continue to invest in those homes. Res repaint, we've often talked about, is the largest segment in the professional sub-segment space. It's a great opportunity for us. These customers respond very well to our personal approach of selling with our store managers and our sales reps. Our focus here is pretty simple, and why we have confidence is that we focus on the services and the solutions that allow these customers to be more successful. And I mentioned just a moment ago about the new accounts and share-of-wallet, these are accounts that are responding well to us. And I mentioned earlier, the innovation, I thought I'd just share one really quick one with you as an example, because here in Cleveland, we've just experienced a pretty dramatic swing from cold weather to warm weather. And we've introduced a product called Latitude with Climate Flex Technology, and it's a terrific product that fits, and I think it's a great example of why we continue to grow. We're responsive to these customers' needs, and this is a product that can be applied anywhere from 35 degrees all the way up to 120 degrees with the same application, same flow, same hiding, same appearance. And so what you end up is with customers that understand we're really focused on making them successful, launching products that help them on projects longer, allowing them to work later into the season. And this product with very minimal warning, if it starts to rain usually within a few hours, not even about 30 minutes actually, the product is resistant to moisture. So these are just small examples, but it really allows us to demonstrate how we're moving the needle and why we have confidence in continuing to move the needle in this space.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay, thanks for that John. And just for my second question, just on your comments on pricing effectiveness, which sounds like it's better than your initial expectations. What do you attribute that success towards in context of just the visible sort of plateauing of some of the inflationary numbers out there with oil prices stabilizing, et cetera?\nJohn Morikis: Well, it's really simple. It's not a 30-minute discussion. We don't win or lose our price increase on how well we talk to them about the price increase in a pricing meeting. It's everything that I just talked about. Every day, we earn the value that our customers are willing to pay us for our products and services. And so the fact that we're out there helping them to be more successful, more profitable, when our costs go up, they understand that we're doing everything we can. Every customer that does business with Sherwin-Williams should know, we're doing everything we can to drive our costs down in both raw material and every other item in that basket. But when we're with them in a meeting to talk about pricing, it's because we need it. We've done everything to offset it, but what's most important is, we're helping them to be successful and we're partnering with them in their business. And so yes, we're more effective now because we're helping our customers to win.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thanks John.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes, good afternoon. John, last year, I think you spoke about adding 50 million gallons of architectural coatings capacity. Can you provide an update on that? Has any of it come online? And if so, what percent is loaded these days?\nJohn Morikis: It is online. It's allowed us, as Al mentioned earlier, to build inventory at a time where we typically would have been running flat with demand outside of Orlando, a terrific team. I got to hand it to our entire supply chain team for the great work they did in getting that capacity up and running as quickly as they did. It's pretty well utilized. We don't talk to the specifics, but we run a 10-year model out on capacity. And this capacity was needed, came in perfectly at a great time, and it's allowed us to be responsive to our customers. We've got more capacity coming in, in Statesville, which will allow us to further meet the growing demands that we're projecting. And again, I hope that you see exactly what we see, which is confidence in our ability to deliver and the investments to support the demand that we're going to create.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay, that's great. And then secondly, if I may, I wanted to talk a little bit about the acquisition activity that you've done. I think you mentioned three bolt-ons closed during the quarter. What is the aggregate sales contribution that you would expect from those in 3Q and 4Q? And based on your margin comments and performance, it sounds like maybe the acquisitions feature significantly lower margins, is that correct? And if it is, maybe you can talk about the game plan to raise those to the company average or beyond over time.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Let me start with the latter part of your question. I'll go over to Al to talk about the first piece. You're right, when we split out the acquisitions, it was to highlight to our investors our ability to reach the commitments that we've been talking about. In fact, when we first announced the Valspar acquisition, we painted a picture that we were proud of the performance of our TAG business and that we expected to drive this industrial business in that direction, citing our desire to get into the high teens, low 20 operating margins. The fact that we've reached adjusted backing out, to your point, the last 12 months of acquisitions up into the 17, there's no one popping corks here. We're not done. We know that, and it's one quarter. We understand that as well, but it clearly demonstrates what it is that we're out to do and how we're doing it. The fact that we've reached 17%, we think, is an indicator of where we are. And I will tell you where we're going is higher. The fact that we backed out these acquisitions should, in fact, indicate that we believe in these acquisitions. Some of them are as little as 30 or 60 days old, and we've not had the opportunity to drive the synergies that we know we can drive into these acquisitions. We're making these acquisitions with a long view in mind. We're not trying to add on the first 30 days of their joining our family. Do we expect them to be contributing what it is that we expect them to do? We buy them with a goal of bringing our synergies and plugging them into our platform, driving more volume out and cost reductions and synergies in. So, we're excited about these wonderful companies, the people that have joined our company as well as the technologies they bring, and we will drive those in the right direction, and they will contribute to our profit.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Kevin, the acquisitions that we've had to date have added a little over 1.5% in the third quarter, expected to be similar in the fourth quarter. When I look at PCG, that would -- they would add about a mid-single-digit percentage. And just to highlight John's point, I mean, we spent over -- or about $630 million for the year on acquisitions. Most of that are two-thirds in the third quarter.\nJohn Morikis: The offset, as we talked earlier, to those acquisitions is in FX. So, about even if you're looking there just at the scoreboard.\nKevin McCarthy: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from John McNulty.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. So, there's been a tremendous number of price hikes and announcements throughout the year at different times. So, I guess, can you help us to think about, if no further price hikes were announced, how should we be thinking about what the pricing in 2023 is year-over-year? Just to kind of help us to level set a little bit, just given how much you've been putting through.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. John, with all the annualization, you'd expect mid-single-digit price effectiveness as you roll off the February 2020 increase and annualize this last increase along with each of the price increases we went out with through the other regions and segments. Right now, that's our estimate.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then earlier, I guess, in the prepared remarks, you spoke to some of the e-commerce investment that you're making. I guess, can you give us an update as to some of the investments that you're making there? And how that market seems to be evolving at this point? We know it's still relatively early in that process, but I guess an update there would be helpful.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, John, I think what's important to understand is that our e-commerce initiative is not just a transaction. It's more than selling paint. The ability to transact over a platform like that is table stakes and ours goes well above that. It's a much broader approach towards trying to tie in the entire ecosystem that we bring. So that last mile delivery through our local store is something that we want to be able to deliver in, but we're reaching in to the contractor base that we have relationships with, and we're beginning to conduct more and more business along with the rep and the store manager in a very unique and differentiated way. We want these customers living on our platform, running their business on our platform and seamlessly doing business with us as a result of that, and it's working quite well. We've got a number of painting contractors, as well as a lot of national accounts that are that are really dialing into our platform. There'll never be a finish line to this. We're investing pretty heavily right now, but that -- as we're ramping up, it's part of our plan that will stabilize and diminish over time. But right now, we think we're in such a unique position with our store platform and the ability to conduct business in a way that no one else can that we're excited about it. We're leveraging it and more and more people are using that.\nJohn McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the color.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks John.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Christopher Parkinson.\nChristopher Parkinson: Good morning. Can you just hit on your broader expectations, whether it's 4Q or 2023, on what you're hearing in your general industrial businesses? Perhaps, just parsing out various content from geographies and then also more consumer versus core industrial businesses, it would be particularly helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Chris, our industrial business, I would say, I talked just briefly about our packaging, but our packaging non-BPA coating is continuing to gain great traction. We mentioned that we're investing in this business. We've got great relationships with our customers here, and we are investing alongside with them with great agreements that allow us to really collaborate well and to grow with them. There's strong growth, for example, in beverage in both North America and Europe as the preference more and more moves away from other containers into aluminum cans. The Euro Food Safety Association opinion in Europe is also driving an increased demand for non-BPA coatings. We think that continues through 2022 and 2023. So this is a really, really unique technology, great customers. We've got a wonderful team here that's really executing very well. We're excited about this business. The coil business has been up double digits in seven of the last eight quarters. I mentioned earlier that we're facing some tough comps here with a 20% comp in the fourth quarter, but we're not running for the quarter. We're running this for years to come. We're really excited to hear again about this leadership team as well as the technology. Our solutions here have allowed us to be much more responsive to our customers. Quicker turns, smaller batches, works well in the face of adversity for our customers, and that's where we're headed, allowing them to be more responsive to their customers. So it's working very well. Our industrial wood business is another area that we believe we're growing share. Kitchen cabinets is a big part of this business. It's still positive now, but we do expect to see a little bit of slowdown in this business as new residential slows down. Furniture same way, we are growing share. But as new residential slows down, that will have an influence on industrial wood. There are other opportunities, though. We see a terrific opportunity in industrial wood flooring to continue to grow. Building products is our share position there offers tremendous opportunity. We do have a good position here in Europe, and so as Europe impacts industrial wood, we'll feel that in our industrial wood business. Auto refinish, I would say, there's a very high demand, and we're really pleased with this team and the job we're doing here. We know we're growing share here, particularly in North America, where our shop count is growing dramatically. There's a shortage here of body techs and parts that's having a material impact on backlogs, but our results in this business are terrific. And this is another one where we have a very similar model in our automotive as we do our TAG business with our controlled distribution. So our ability to serve and be responsive to our customers along with the shift that we're seeing, very positive mix shift towards our premium products gives us great confidence in this business. The combination of the Valspar and Sherwin technology that came together is really helping us win in auto refinish. GI, general industrial, strong demand here in heavy equipment expected through 2022 and 2023, especially large in ag and construction. And certainly, as you would expect, has been positive impacted by -- positively impacted by the infrastructure opportunities that exist. And then finally, in Protective & Marine, we're really pleased with what's happening here. Demand is strong in all end markets, oil and gas, water, wastewater. Again, same issue here as far as an opportunity in multiple high-value infrastructure opportunities. Solutions here go a long way as well. Our customers are willing to pay for products that help get them off the job quicker either with less coats, quicker recoat times, whatever it might be. We've been investing in this business in the flooring business. We're putting together a nice portfolio of technologies, services and capabilities that we believe will, again, further help us to differentiate. Our model here, again, is also differentiated, particularly in North America, where we have our store platform to use a distribution where many of our competitors are trying to drop ship in large orders. Our customers can work with our teams and leverage the local Sherwin-Williams store to source product and have it there when they need them, and our teams are working really well together on that. So, a lot of momentum here. We clearly see some pressures in the market as you look at Asia and Europe, and what's happening in those. We're not going to be immune to those, but we absolutely do believe where we expect and hold our teams accountable to outperform the market, and we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to do that, and we're making investments to help support them doing that. So we're feeling pretty good about this.\nChristopher Parkinson: That's very helpful color. Just as a very brief follow-up, there's been a lot of debate regarding pent-up demand in both resi and commercial repaint. Can you just quickly assess what you're currently hearing from your customers in terms of backlog, longevity, scope? I mean there's been kind of some rumors about the scope of certain projects, especially on the resi side actually expanding for people that are waiting a lot of time. Can you just give us your latest assessment on what you're hearing from your customers? And what -- how that drives your confidence at least into year end? Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: Well, Chris, hold on one second before you just gauge. Are you talking about new residential?\nChristopher Parkinson: No. Resi repaint and commercial repaint, I apologize.\nJohn Morikis: Okay. Got it. Well, commercial and resi repaint, I'd say, the underlying demand on commercial is strong. Projects are resuming and starts are positive. If you look at the Dodge Momentum Index, it's strong positive for every month in 2022 in the ABI, the Architectural Billing Index. And I'm sure you all know that's the index that really the metric for how architects are billing has been positive for 20 straight months. So that typically means projects in the next 9 to 12 months are going to be coming out of the ground and the fact that, they remain positive, we believe, is a good sign. Customers who are positive, they're still reporting delays resulting from some labor and material shortages that we are seeing a terrific opportunity for our products. Infrastructure spending here as well is strong and schools, airports, hospitals and also areas such as data centers, our position here is strong. Again, we really leverage our platform. We leverage our specification teams. We're calling on architects and continuously drive new products for customers that allow them to be more productive on the job. The combination of those local stores, reps and really great stable of products. I've got to hit it to our innovation team. It continues to do that. I know, they've been gathered just in the last couple of days, talking about how they can continue to add more to our success, and they're doing a wonderful job doing that. So I want to call out to them as well. As it relates to the residential repaint side, as I mentioned earlier, it's still positive. We see contractors in our stores every day. They're talking about the strength through the balance of the year and turning the corner into next year, still a pretty good backlog. I'd say that, if we talk to them about bidding and what's in the pipeline and really dial into our CRM to understand that, I'd say, what we've been witnessing is more and more the project scope has increased. So the size of the projects continue to grow, I think some of that might simply be \u2013 I finally found a contractor that will come give me a quote, and I'm not going to let him out just doing my living room. I want to have them do the entire house or expanded areas that they may not have planned on in the past. The quality of the leads seem to be going on. So there's \u2013 our contractors would refer to it as less tire kicking. There's people that, they are interested in projects, interested in getting quotes, and starting these projects right away. So we're very aggressive in pursuit of these customers. We feel as though our right to win and our value proposition is strong and getting stronger, and we're looking forward to continuing to leverage this. One last point I would make is that, we \u2013 our head is not in the sand here. The call out that we're making for adjusting our expenses and everything that we're doing, I think, highlights exactly the fact that we're grounded in reality. I will say, this though that when we exited the last slowdown, in the last recession, we did a postmortem and really tried to understand what is it coming out of the next slowdown. We want to be prepared with, and how would we be better positioned to withstand the next slowdown. And so throughout the period, 2008, 2010 period all the way to now, we've been working strategically on how do we better position the company. And when you look at residential repaint, it's a much larger percentage of our business now, and that\u2019s because when we \u2013 through the last one, new residential, while we've been successful and we've been growing in our success there, we wanted to offset this and diversify our business a little bit more. So we've been hard at work, driving more and more residential repaint. And now it's a larger percentage of our business, and we think it's going to allow us to weather storms much better than we have in the past.\nChristopher Parkinson: Thank you as always.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Begleiter.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Al, should gross margins be up in Q4 sequentially?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Yes. And part of that, David, is the full impact of the 10% price increase. We do have a softer comp, but really, you also have a strong low double-digit volume in TAG, which is our highest margin segment. So we should see a nice -- better flow-through, if you will, in our fourth quarter relative to our third quarter in TAG, which will help drive that gross margin up. So yes, I'm expecting sequential and a bigger year-over-year improvement in our fourth quarter and possibly even getting to the low end of that long-term 45% to 48% range.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good. And John, just on the Home Depot PPG relationship, has there been -- have you seen any negative impacts in your business in terms of business losses or share losses?\nJohn Morikis: Well, I would say this. Our belief is that we're in a really, really good position. We've been working hard, developing our approach towards a controlled distribution model that allows us to differentiate. When we're doing our job, we would expect people to react and change their models. And when they do that, we like to take advantage of that change. We think we're executing really, really well. We think people are reacting exactly the way we'd expect them to react, and we'd say that we're capitalizing on that, and we will continue to capitalize on that.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I guess, first off, you noted that there could be some challenges in 2023. Could you just describe that a little bit more? Is that a continued slowdown in Europe and China and potentially, that spreading over into North America in the TAG business, or is it mainly still kind of more likely in PCG. I will stop there. Thanks.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Arun, I think we've talked about it. We do expect continued slowdown in Europe and Asia. I think as we get into North America architectural demand, I'd prefer as we've gone through or going through our normal preparation for the coming year in the operating plan to give you a bit more color on that in January. We'll have a few more months under our belt. There's a lot of moving macro trends and things that are happening, and they're moving daily. So rather than try to give you an outlook for 2023 on ARC in the regions, I'd prefer we'd be better prepared to do that in January. I think the fourth quarter, like we talked about, strong high teens, low 20% in TAG and low double-digit volume likely to carry over into the first quarter and then the price of high single digits that we've got certainly carries over into the first quarter. I think that's as far as I think we can go on color.\nArun Viswanathan: Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up then, have you seen your customers change their order patterns at all in maybe some different market segments as the backlog actually growing, or is it that they're getting to jobs that maybe that were deferred during 2021 because of lack of availability to raws and labor? Maybe, you can just comment on that. Thanks.\nJohn Morikis: Well, there are certainly some of that. And I would say that -- two things: one is, I think we're working much closer with our customers. Adversity brings out the best. Sometimes you have to find it. The fact that we've gotten through this challenging time with raw materials with a closer relationship with our customers, we better understand what projects they're on. In the past, they just walked into the store and they knew they could have it, whatever it was. When they needed it, it was there. As we went through that process of working through the raw material shortages, we were more responsive or better responsive when we understood what the needs of the customers were. So I'd say, the pattern, first of all, for us, it's a closer pattern. We're working better with them. We do see some, I would call it, maybe, they're more fluid. They're moving to projects when they become available and if it's weather changing or getting outside when they can, the fact that they're racing with a pretty sizable backlog. They don't want to take any time off that they don't need to. It's why I mentioned that product that I mentioned earlier, it extends the painting season for them. But I'd say, as it relates to the pattern themselves on the architectural side, we're seeing more frequency, I would say. We're seeing people in our stores more. And on the industrial side, I'd say, we're probably seeing small orders more frequently -- smaller orders more frequently as our customers are trying to prepare for cash management, while being responsive for their teams with their teams or their customers. And again, that works to our advantage, given our model of responsiveness.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Arun.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from John Roberts.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. A nice quarter. One of your longest lead time planning items is new store openings. I assume you have your sights for 2023 selected. Can you give us some insights into what new stores might look like next year?\nJohn Morikis: You're right, we do have that planned out. And I'd say that we're probably get this point going to tell you, it's going to be in the 80 to 100 range. And you'll see those in a combination of metro markets where we're continuing to feed in locations, as well as in some markets where we want to supplement some of the previous investments with added locations for our customers. But you're right, John, as we go into the year, a good portion of those are already identified and the deals are just getting finalized, and we're working through those. So, we're prepared, and again, confidence. Confident in our model, confident in the differentiation of Sherwin-Williams adding stores while others are closing stores and taking advantage of the market opportunities that exist as a result.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. And on a one-year comp, the DIY in your stores was obviously very different than the DIY in your consumer segment because a year ago, you were prioritizing the propane or over DIY in your stores. If you looked at a two-year comp, is the DIY in your stores roughly up the same amount as the DIY in the consumer segment on a two-year stack?\nAl Mistysyn: I think it'd be up higher than that, John. I think we've had really nice strength in that DIY customer within TAG. And the fact that we've been able to do turn on super sales again to bring them in has really helped drive that growth.\nJohn Roberts: Great. Thank you,\nJohn Morikis: Thanks John.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Sison\nMike Sison: Hey guys, nice quarter. Just one question for me. You sort of mentioned thinking or sort of managing the business on a worst-case scenario, what would that look like for the stores? Would demand be flat, down, down a lot? And in the event sort of that unfolds, what can you do to help mitigate some of that potential volume decline?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Mike, trying to guess how bad could be is not something that we're going to do on this call. The reality is that we prepare for a number of scenarios. Our view is that, particularly in that store's business that when things get tough, we go hunting. And the reality of a really difficult time in stores might include scaling back on some of the staffing if we didn't have the transaction count or other expenses that we might feel are appropriate. But I would say this that in the 37, soon to be 38 years I've been with the company, our approach has been to take advantage of these situations. I mentioned earlier, the work we've been doing to grow res repaint as a percent of our business coming through COVID, I think it's a great demonstration of what we do in really difficult times. We go find customers. Those customers need to paint to put food on their plate, feed their families. We grow share, we grow active accounts and we outperformed the market. And I'd say, that's what you should expect us to do in difficult times.\nAl Mistysyn: Mike, I would just add to that. If you, kind of how I frame it, so to speak, is if you go back and look at new residential in 2008 and 2009, where there's a lot of housing speculation and things of that nature, our new res was down in the low 22% range. And as John talked, as we've come out of that -- and back then, res repaint and new res ratio is 1:1. Fast forward that to today and our residential repaint versus new res is 2:1. And when I look at also property maintenance over that same time period, you look at the combination of res repaint and property maintenance that are less recession -- more recession-resistant, we're probably over 50% of our sales relative to just over 40% back then. So, when he talks about how we've map the company to help us mitigate a recession, those are the types of things. And the metrics I look at to say, okay, I don't believe it can be bad as 2008 and 2009, but if it is, we're much larger in other segments to help offset it.\nJohn Morikis: And again, not to keep everyone here all day, but the res repaint is an important part of it. The Pros Who Paint is another piece. When we think about the residential, that is a new focus for us as well, as in that industrial side where packaging, auto refinish, these are growing parts of our business that weren't as strong in the past. So, we don't wait for bad things to happen. We're trying to make good things out of it.\nMike Sison: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Sure, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison.\nMike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. You guys noted that you're working through some inefficiencies in your supply chain still. Presumably, that means that you're starting to get back to playing a little bit more offense when it comes to procurement. So I'm curious, when you're talking about raw materials coming lower sequentially, is that really just a decline in market prices, and that's mostly what you're talking about, or does it also include this greater supply chain and procurement efficiency that you should see over time?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Mike, I think what we're speaking to there has been our willingness to serve our customers even at a cost. And so, I think it will, as Ghansham might have been asked about the supply or the capacity that came on the 50 million gallons. As our raw materials have become available, we don't want to turn those down. We may need finished product in one part of the country, but the raws -- because of the supplier base might be available in another part, near another plant. We've manufactured that product and shift it to our customers to serve them. We have worked with our suppliers at times, where they've been unable to ship raw materials to us. We've used our own tank wagons or our own vehicles or 18-wheelers to secure a product and get it to our plants, when needed. So, there's an advantage of doing business with Sherwin that starts with the customer in the store or the rep plant, but it works all the way through to the raw material and manufacturing piece. And we'll do what we have to, to keep our customers in business and producing, because we know in the long run, the better job we do at keeping them in business, is the better supplier we are to them. That's in our best interest long term.\nMike Harrison: Right. And then looking at the restructuring actions, it looks like a good portion of those are targeted at the Asia Pacific region. Is that a region, where you're still investing for growth and still seeing a lot of opportunities, or is that -- is there kind of a retrenchment going on there? Maybe talk just a little bit about your strategy in the APAC region.\nJohn Morikis: Mike, I'd say, on the industrial side, we are investing and continue to grow. Nearly every one of our PCG businesses has a good and growing business there, and we expect that to continue. As you would expect, we are taking the appropriate actions based on slowdowns. And as I would say, is our custom, we continue to evaluate our businesses. And as Al mentioned, not only our businesses, our programs, our customers, relationships, everything we can to ensure that they reach the hurdle for us to continue to invest in those. I think it is safe to say that we're doing a deep dive review of our architectural business in China. And based on how that review comes out, we'll decide about what we do in the future. The industrial side, we know we can demonstrate the value for our customers that can allow us to win there.\nMike Harrison: All right. Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Greg Melich.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. Thanks for the insight on the gross margin going forward, guys. I'd like basically asked the same thing on SG&A. I think it was up almost 12% year-on-year in the third quarter. Is that a -- should we assume a double-digit growth in SG&A as well in the fourth quarter?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Greg, I think what you're going to see in our fourth quarter, with the TAG stores that we've invested in and then opening another 40 to 50, and in our fourth quarter along with the reps to support that, we'll continue to grow or control our SG&A pretty tightly. I do expect to get leverage still in our fourth quarter on SG&A. But as you typically see with the seasonal slowdown in our architectural demand, SG&A as a percent of sales will be up. I don't expect our SG&A to be up as much in our fourth quarter just because some of the actions we've taken on holding new positions, reducing travel, things of that nature will help offset some of those additional investments.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then I guess my follow-up is, given that the -- we've tend to focus on getting on top of raws, and clearly, it seems like you're there now. But given all the other costs that are going up, is it possible next year that there could be another round of price increases even if raws are flattening out?\nAl Mistysyn: Greg, I think we've got to get through our normal planning process here. We'll evaluate the merit increases and different other inputs like labor and transportation. And if we -- you know us, if we need to go out again, we will, but we're not in a position today to talk to that specifically.\nJohn Morikis: And if we need to go out, we will have wrestled everything we can to the map to try to avoid having to go out, but I think we've demonstrated an ability and a willingness if we have to. But we don't take that lightly. Our goal is not to have to, but there are some inflationary areas of wages or whatever it is. We also want to make sure that we retain the best talent, and so we know we need to be competitive as well.\nGreg Melich: That's great. And then my last is really a follow-up on gross margin. Could you help us, if gross margins end up being, I guess, they were up 110, 120 this quarter, and let's say they're up 300 or more in the fourth quarter, is that going to be more from price versus raws or more just from volume increases? I think last year, you called out that was hundreds of bps of help. Can you just help us on that?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah, I think it's going to be the strong volume through TAG of double-digit pricing and then the raw moderation in that order.\nGreg Melich: Got it. Thank you guys, and good luck.\nAl Mistysyn: Thank you Greg.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Greg.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Just maybe sticking on DIY. I know you mentioned that volumes in TAG were really strong there. Were North American DIY volumes positive in Consumer Brands in the quarter?\nJohn Morikis : North American volume was up strong single digits.\nAl Mistysyn : Yes. I'd say, on the volume side, we were up low to mid-teens in the third quarter. Volume was up low single-digit.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Got it. And then just as we're thinking about the raw materials, if we were to keep the current basket at the levels where they are today and flow that through to next year, what would that look like from a raw material inflation perspective, if everything just stays stable where it is?\nAl Mistysyn : Yes, Adam, I think you're -- if everything stayed exactly the same, which we know you're still talking probably low mid single-digit by the time you annualize everything, that's a hard answer today. Like we talked about let us get through our planning cycle, let us get through our demand outlook with our suppliers and let us give you a better view of our full basket of input costs, raw materials, labor, freight transportation on our January call. I think it's too early to be speculating too much on 2023 costs at this point.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois.\nGarik Shmois : Hi. Thanks. I'm curious if you could speak to any mix impact in TAG, or are you seeing any signs or anticipating any signs of trade down?\nJohn Morikis : No, actually, we see the opposite as customers are facing labor shortages and trying to get through projects as quickly as possible. They have a tendency to move up in quality. And we're actually even seeing that in our new residential as well as we've introduced new products, new one of Painters Edge Plus. It's an ultra flat product that hides in perfections as an example. So you get in some of these projects where the drywall contractors are struggling to hire and find experienced drywallers. They're passing drywall on that may not be as perfect as the painter might have liked. And so we're helping them with products that hide some of those imperfections. Our customers are willing to pay for those. 90% -- 85% to 90% of their cost is labor. So shifting up in quality helps them on the overall profitability of the project.\nGarik Shmois : Got it. Thank you. Follow-up question is just one more on DIY. It sounded a bit more sluggish coming out of 2Q. Just curious, are you seeing a sequential strengthening there?\nJohn Morikis : I'd say, some of what you're seeing in our DIY first in our stores -- and Al was right, we've seen more DIY in our own stores, but it's a relatively small percentage of our business. We're mainly focused on the pinning contractor through our own stores, but the comparisons there where we were shifting product away from DIY products into contractors is a portion of the benefit that we see. And then also on the consumer brand side, as we've reached a more level state, if you will, of raw materials. We've been able to benefit from some of the pipeline filling into other customers that we've not been able to in the past just because of availability. So we're seeing some benefit there as well.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. Thanks, again.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Steve Byrne.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Are the equipment sales that you're paying contractors sometimes buy from you, the spraying machines and so forth. Are they still a good leading indicator of paint demand for you, or does that depend on which of the business is? I was just curious if it's still useful, how would you characterize those sales in recent months? And on the same theme, John, you talked about having visibility for the paint for the pro backlog through the end of the year, here we are almost in November, would you normally have a view of a backlog beyond year-end at this time?\nJohn Morikis: So let me answer the first question. You're right that the spray equipment sales, any given time of year, could vary as how much of a leading indicator would be. So residential repaint, as an example, I don't think many of us would appreciate a repaint contractor coming into our homes where we're living with an airless sprayer trying to spray the inside of the home. And as exterior slows down, they're less likely to purchase spray equipment. So I'd say that for the most part right now, spray equipment is riding along, as you would expect, with the sales volume of paint that we're experiencing. And then the second part of your question, Steve, was \u2013 \nSteve Byrne: Just whether you\u2019re seeing more of a backlog beyond a couple of months at this time of year?\nJohn Morikis: I'd say, right now, as we'd be talking historically to our customers, the outlook that we have is pretty much in line with what we would normally hear from them. Commercial contractors generally have a \u2013 a longer view. These are larger projects that go out to bid as far out as a year earlier. Residential repaint would be on the other end of the spectrum and those contractors could get contracts or agreements that could start in weeks, others in months. So I'd say, it's pretty much in line with what we would normally see if you put them all together and look at the backlog. It's pretty consistent with what we've seen.\nSteve Byrne: And then with respect to the consumer business in China, is that basically wallroom brand. And I was just curious whether that brand that you acquired with Valspar just hasn't worked out as well as you had hoped?\nJohn Morikis: It is the wallroom brand. And if I'm talking on a call about a deep dive, it probably is safe to say, it's not worked out as well as I had hoped.\nSteve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Eric Bosshard.\nEric Bosshard: Good afternoon. Two things for you. First of all, Al, in terms of production and inventory from here, can you just clarify what the plan is as you head into what you characterize as a bit uncertain in volume in some areas? What is the plan through 4Q and into 2023?\nAl Mistysyn : Yes, Eric, I talked about building some inventory in our fourth quarter on architectural specifically. I think of those as maybe some of the -- if you rank products, being your fastest mover rebuilding some inventories in Bs and Cs and Ds just to make sure we got the full spectrum of products covered going into next year's selling season. That being said, as John talked about, we're going to stay very close with our customers and what their backlogs and outlooks are, and we'll adjust production accordingly. I don't want to get too far out in front of demand, knowing that we were able to keep up with demand through the summer season with the additional capacity we brought online that we talked about earlier. So I think it gives us more flexibility to manage inventory lower if need be going into the summer. But I think those are things that we're very -- going to be very cautious about. Like I said, I want to get our working capital back down towards that 10.5% of sales, where we -- I would like to run the company. We think we can get down there around 11% to 11.5% by the end of this year, knowing we're going to carry a little bit more inventory into next year or I should say it that way, I should say, we'll be back to a more historical level of inventory than we were a year ago, obviously. But I think that's something we'll manage pretty tight.\nEric Bosshard : Okay. And then secondly, John, I understand your comments on how the portfolio is different with more resi repaint versus new. In the last cycle, the industrial business is also, I'd say, notably bigger than it was before as well. I'm curious how that influences the gross margin path? How you talked about getting to the low end of the 45% to 48% in 4Q? But how does the gross margin recovery path behave? In this cycle, should it behave like in prior cycles, or is the inclusion of industrial change in the arc of that path?\nAl Mistysyn : Eric, I think what you see is that mix shift of -- on the industrial side is a little bit better for us from a gross margin standpoint. And then you got to kind of look at it even within architectural, the mix shift is a little bit better for us. So I get your question. We didn't have packaging through the last cycle. It's a larger portion -- a much larger portion of industrial even now than it was two years ago. So I think when you look at margin profiles, we might have a positive -- a little bit more positive shift when you get into these slowdowns. We're seeing some of that. I would argue with a slowdown in Asia and Europe across some of our businesses within Industrial. So as North America hangs in there and has better demand, our margins will be a little bit better around the business.\nJohn Morikis : To weigh in segments like our auto refinish and coil, I mean there's -- it's a very good question. Eric, I think if you look at the overall, we think we're not only better positioned from a demand standpoint. We talk about resi repaint, but you also would have to include property management in there, the auto refinish, the packaging, all of these are really better positioned, but we're going to be, I think, in a better position to grow volume as well, more absorption through the plant than we may have to the last cycle as well. And there's a lot that we bring in our approach even with existing segments. The strategy work that we've done to allow us to better focus on the sub-segments and those customers within there that are willing to pay for the solutions that we bring is where we're focused, and we think that's going to benefit us.\nEric Bosshard: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jim Jaye for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJim Jaye: Thank you, Holly, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. As you heard, we're looking forward to delivering a very solid fourth quarter that will result in 35% growth in our second half adjusted earnings per share. We're also very focused on preparing for any number of scenarios that might unfold next year. Our team is very deep and experienced, as John said. So very confident heading into next year, and we're looking to execute \u2013 continuing to execute at a high level. We'll be available along with Eric Swanson for your questions afterwards, and again, thank you for joining us today. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's event. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Al Mistysyn",
            "content": "Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. Yes, I mean, we saw a little over 20% increase year-over-year in our segment profit. Flow-through is a little in the low 20% range, and it typically is the case. We had higher sales volumes, which generally drives improved operating margin. I've historically talked about a low to mid-single-digit volume gain, getting in a normal state environment, mid- to high 20%. We had one really month of selling price increases, but these are still partially offset by the higher raw material costs that we had talked about being sequentially better, but still up maybe a mid-single digit in our fourth quarter. And really, the higher SG&A costs that we called out are the continued investments in long-term growth initiatives. So we've added 67 stores. We've put in over 80 reps. We've added headcount into our stores to support the growth outlook. And as John mentioned, we're going to add and really accelerate our growth in the fourth quarter by adding 40 to 50 new stores. So what I would expect in the fourth quarter is, you're going to see your normal seasonal slowdown in architectural demand, which is typical, and you also see a sequential decline in operating margin, but we expect stronger flow through in our fourth quarter, really upwards of over 30%. And you get a full quarter of the 10% price increase for -- that was implemented September 6. I would tell you, that price increase is going even a little better than what we had seen in the past, the fourth quarter sequential moderation of raw material costs and an easier comp. So you're going to see bigger year-over-year improvement in our operating margin in the fourth quarter. And you're going to see that SG&A growth into the first half of next year, and we'll give you more color on that in January. Yes. And Vincent, we actually built a little bit of inventory from our second quarter to our third quarter, which is typically not the case. But to meet the strong demand that we're seeing, specifically within TAG with mid-teen volume growth in our third quarter and high -- low double-digit we expect in our fourth quarter, I think what you're going to see us do is try to manage our architectural inventory by year-end, maybe up another 4 million gallons. The reality of that is, we're going to monitor that very closely as the quarter progresses and look at demand trends specifically going into our first half next year, and we may adjust that number a little bit. And that's specifically to the DSCs. Our store level inventories are in great shape. We are meeting our demand -- our strong demand with high service levels, and we expect to continue to do that. But as you can imagine, we're -- as our inventories get in better shape, we'll get back to managing our working capital. Our working capital at the end of the third quarter is over 12%. We're going to target to try to drive that down between 11% and 11.5% by year-end, but still a very strong inventory position going into next year. The only other comment I'd make, Truman, related to that on the one-time cost. We'll call those out as we have typically done in the past, specifically even with the Valspar integration. So we didn't put them in the guidance in the fourth quarter. There are estimates. The timing is uncertain. We're pushing the teams pretty hard to take action and get these done, but we'll call them out over the next quarterly calls, and we expect to get approximately 170 over the next four quarters. Yeah. Josh, I think where we're seeing maybe a little bit more of a slowdown would be in Europe and Asia. And I think our largest region, North America, we talked about being in the low to mid-teens and price will start to annualize, so you don't get as much of a tailwind on price. Our comps are still pretty strong in our fourth quarter relative to last year. And so I don't know there's a significant step change that we're seeing other than -- I think we've got to be prepared and try to look at -- based on our history and what we've seen over the last few years is maybe a little bit wider range on sales as we go into the fourth quarter with the holidays and things of that nature. So I don't want to read too much into that other than maybe a little less price as we get into the fourth quarter and then a little bit worsening outside of North America. No, Jeff. I think what what's going to happen is, we're going to get the full quarter of 10%. We're going to annualize the August 2021, 7%. We're going to annualize the September 4% of last year's surcharge. So when you net them all together, it's about flattish quarter-to-quarter or high single digit. We are, but we're also annualizing some of the price we took last year. So from quarter-to-quarter, our dollars will be higher. I agree with that, but it's still in the high single-digit range for TAG. Yes, Jeff, I think the alkyd impact. I mean, it could be around 1% on top line. It's \u2013 we're having to make choices. So, as an example, why it's difficult to pinpoint it. We're \u2013 there's a broad basket of alkyd, and we're somewhere getting fully what we need. Others, we're not. And it's just trying to look at ordering and reorders and things like that. So I think it's about 1% on the top line. The bottom line, I don't think we've quantified or really going to quantify at this time. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, Kevin, the acquisitions that we've had to date have added a little over 1.5% in the third quarter, expected to be similar in the fourth quarter. When I look at PCG, that would -- they would add about a mid-single-digit percentage. And just to highlight John's point, I mean, we spent over -- or about $630 million for the year on acquisitions. Most of that are two-thirds in the third quarter. Yes. John, with all the annualization, you'd expect mid-single-digit price effectiveness as you roll off the February 2020 increase and annualize this last increase along with each of the price increases we went out with through the other regions and segments. Right now, that's our estimate. Yes. Yes. And part of that, David, is the full impact of the 10% price increase. We do have a softer comp, but really, you also have a strong low double-digit volume in TAG, which is our highest margin segment. So we should see a nice -- better flow-through, if you will, in our fourth quarter relative to our third quarter in TAG, which will help drive that gross margin up. So yes, I'm expecting sequential and a bigger year-over-year improvement in our fourth quarter and possibly even getting to the low end of that long-term 45% to 48% range. Yes, Arun, I think we've talked about it. We do expect continued slowdown in Europe and Asia. I think as we get into North America architectural demand, I'd prefer as we've gone through or going through our normal preparation for the coming year in the operating plan to give you a bit more color on that in January. We'll have a few more months under our belt. There's a lot of moving macro trends and things that are happening, and they're moving daily. So rather than try to give you an outlook for 2023 on ARC in the regions, I'd prefer we'd be better prepared to do that in January. I think the fourth quarter, like we talked about, strong high teens, low 20% in TAG and low double-digit volume likely to carry over into the first quarter and then the price of high single digits that we've got certainly carries over into the first quarter. I think that's as far as I think we can go on color. I think it'd be up higher than that, John. I think we've had really nice strength in that DIY customer within TAG. And the fact that we've been able to do turn on super sales again to bring them in has really helped drive that growth. Mike, I would just add to that. If you, kind of how I frame it, so to speak, is if you go back and look at new residential in 2008 and 2009, where there's a lot of housing speculation and things of that nature, our new res was down in the low 22% range. And as John talked, as we've come out of that -- and back then, res repaint and new res ratio is 1:1. Fast forward that to today and our residential repaint versus new res is 2:1. And when I look at also property maintenance over that same time period, you look at the combination of res repaint and property maintenance that are less recession -- more recession-resistant, we're probably over 50% of our sales relative to just over 40% back then. So, when he talks about how we've map the company to help us mitigate a recession, those are the types of things. And the metrics I look at to say, okay, I don't believe it can be bad as 2008 and 2009, but if it is, we're much larger in other segments to help offset it. Yeah. Greg, I think what you're going to see in our fourth quarter, with the TAG stores that we've invested in and then opening another 40 to 50, and in our fourth quarter along with the reps to support that, we'll continue to grow or control our SG&A pretty tightly. I do expect to get leverage still in our fourth quarter on SG&A. But as you typically see with the seasonal slowdown in our architectural demand, SG&A as a percent of sales will be up. I don't expect our SG&A to be up as much in our fourth quarter just because some of the actions we've taken on holding new positions, reducing travel, things of that nature will help offset some of those additional investments. Greg, I think we've got to get through our normal planning process here. We'll evaluate the merit increases and different other inputs like labor and transportation. And if we -- you know us, if we need to go out again, we will, but we're not in a position today to talk to that specifically. Yeah, I think it's going to be the strong volume through TAG of double-digit pricing and then the raw moderation in that order. Thank you Greg. Yes. I'd say, on the volume side, we were up low to mid-teens in the third quarter. Volume was up low single-digit. Yes, Adam, I think you're -- if everything stayed exactly the same, which we know you're still talking probably low mid single-digit by the time you annualize everything, that's a hard answer today. Like we talked about let us get through our planning cycle, let us get through our demand outlook with our suppliers and let us give you a better view of our full basket of input costs, raw materials, labor, freight transportation on our January call. I think it's too early to be speculating too much on 2023 costs at this point. Yes, Eric, I talked about building some inventory in our fourth quarter on architectural specifically. I think of those as maybe some of the -- if you rank products, being your fastest mover rebuilding some inventories in Bs and Cs and Ds just to make sure we got the full spectrum of products covered going into next year's selling season. That being said, as John talked about, we're going to stay very close with our customers and what their backlogs and outlooks are, and we'll adjust production accordingly. I don't want to get too far out in front of demand, knowing that we were able to keep up with demand through the summer season with the additional capacity we brought online that we talked about earlier. So I think it gives us more flexibility to manage inventory lower if need be going into the summer. But I think those are things that we're very -- going to be very cautious about. Like I said, I want to get our working capital back down towards that 10.5% of sales, where we -- I would like to run the company. We think we can get down there around 11% to 11.5% by the end of this year, knowing we're going to carry a little bit more inventory into next year or I should say it that way, I should say, we'll be back to a more historical level of inventory than we were a year ago, obviously. But I think that's something we'll manage pretty tight. Eric, I think what you see is that mix shift of -- on the industrial side is a little bit better for us from a gross margin standpoint. And then you got to kind of look at it even within architectural, the mix shift is a little bit better for us. So I get your question. We didn't have packaging through the last cycle. It's a larger portion -- a much larger portion of industrial even now than it was two years ago. So I think when you look at margin profiles, we might have a positive -- a little bit more positive shift when you get into these slowdowns. We're seeing some of that. I would argue with a slowdown in Asia and Europe across some of our businesses within Industrial. So as North America hangs in there and has better demand, our margins will be a little bit better around the business."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As we've indicated since the start of the year, we expected 2022 would be a year of two contracts to have, and that's exactly what we're seeing play out. We delivered strong results in the third quarter, and I want to thank our entire leadership team and all 61,000 employees for their focus, their determination and drive in what remains a challenging operating environment. We continue to have great confidence in our strategy. Before moving on to our outlook, let me provide some additional color on our third quarter. In The Americas Group segment, we delivered record sales and PBT. Mid-teens volume growth and high single-digit pricing drove sales, which were up by a strong double-digit percentage in every end market we serve. The sales growth was led by DIY, which was compared to an extremely soft quarter a year ago, where we prioritized our Pro customers given limited product availability. Sales growth was next strongest in our property management, followed by new residential, residential repaint and commercial, respectively. Sales were also up by a double-digit percentage in Protective & Marine, but were dampened by the ongoing limited availability of alkyd resin. We are seeing strong effectiveness from the 10% price increase we announced September 6. TAG segment profit increased due primarily to double-digit paint volume growth and selling price increases, partially offset by increased raw material costs and higher SG&A costs related to continued investments in our long-term growth initiatives and our strategy. From a product perspective, exterior and interior paint sales were both strong, with exterior sales growing slightly faster and interior being the larger part of the mix. We've opened 32 net new stores year-to-date and expect to open 40 to 50 in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in our management training program, expecting to hire more than 1,400 college graduates that will enter this program this year and who will be the future leaders of the company. We also added sales reps and territories in the quarter, along with ongoing growth investments in innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services. Our Consumer Brands Group had a much improved quarter, led by sales that exceeded our guidance. Sales in North America increased by a double-digit percentage, driven largely by price. DIY paint demand remained sluggish, as inflation continued to pressure consumers, while continued tightness in alkyd resin impacted our ability to produce stains and aerosols. On a positive note, the Pros Who Paint segment again grew by a strong double-digit percentage. Sales in China were down by a double-digit percentage, due mainly to the COVID-related lockdowns. Europe was also down double digits due to the slowing macroeconomic environment. Segment margin improved significantly, primarily due to selling price increases and good cost control, partially offset by lower sales volume, increased raw material costs and higher supply chain costs. The Performance Coatings Group followed a very good second quarter with another strong performance in the third. Sales were up mid-teens, including mid-teens pricing and a mid-single-digit benefit from acquisitions, partially offset by a very slight decrease in volume in a mid-single-digit impact from unfavorable FX. For the second straight quarter, this team delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement, driven by execution of our strategy, including effective pricing actions. The 16.4% adjusted margin in the quarter was the highest for the segment since the acquisition of Valspar. And excluding the impact of acquisitions closed over the last 12 months, adjusted segment margin was 17% in the quarter. Although, we're pleased to have reached the low end of our expressed margin target of high teens low 20s. We know there's a significant amount of opportunity ahead. I'm proud of our team's efforts to reach this goal and know they understand the high expectations we have for continued improvement. Sales varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased double digits against a challenging comp and included low single-digit volume growth. Latin America sales also increased by double digits against a strong comp. Sales were up high single digits in Asia, driven by price as COVID lockdowns continue to impact demand. Sales in Europe were backward mid-single digits against a double-digit comparison and continued economic slowing. Every division in the group grew led by coil and followed by packaging, auto refinish, general industrial and industrial wood. We're also pleased by what we're seeing so far from the recent acquisitions we've announced in this segment. Again, these businesses added mid single-digit growth in PCG sales in the quarter though this was nearly all offset by unfavorable FX. Earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire ICA, a high-quality European business focused on innovative wood coatings. Before moving to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $203 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $48 million to purchase 200,000 shares at an average price of $237.81 per share. We distributed $155.8 million in dividends. We also invested $175 million in our business through capital expenditures, including $125 million in core CapEx and $50 million for our building our future project. We closed three acquisitions in the third quarter for approximately $440 million. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.1 times as we increased short-term borrowings to fund our recent acquisitions. We'll drive the ratio to our long-term target of 2 to 2.5 times range in 2023. We will use cash in the fourth quarter of 2022 to manage debt and share buybacks will be done to offset option dilution. Turning to our outlook. We expect to deliver a very solid fourth quarter, resulting in our second half sales increasing by a low double digits to mid-teens percentage. And second half diluted earnings per share increasing by 35% at the midpoint of our guidance. Within The Americas Group, demand is strong across all of our pro-architectural markets, including new residential, despite higher interest rates, with customers reporting strong backlogs that will take them through the end of the year and likely longer. We also see a unique opportunity to continue winning new business as our competitors transition their pro contractor business models and our differentiated model has never been more on display in value than it is today. Within the Consumer Brands Group, we expect the North American DIY consumer to continue to face inflationary pressures and Europe and China remain challenging. Within the Performance Coatings Group, demand remains strongest in North America, our largest region. European demand slowed in the third quarter, and we expect continued softness in the fourth quarter. In Asia, the pace of recovery from prior COVID lockdowns in China and prospects for additional lockdowns make it difficult to assess demand trajectory. From an industry supply chain perspective, we're largely getting the raw materials we need, though the availability of alkyd and some specialty resins remain choppy and is impacting certain product lines within Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings. While we continue to push hard, we don't expect meaningful improvement in the availability of these resins until the first quarter of next year. Some near-term inefficiencies remain in our own supply chain as we continue to take steps to overcome industry issues and serve our customers. On the cost side of the equation, our full year raw material inflation guidance remains in the high teens. We expect to see further sequential decline of raw material costs in the fourth quarter, though they will remain elevated year-over-year. We expect the trajectory of raw material costs to continue trending favorably as we exit the year, although the pace and level of potential relief next year is difficult to project. Additionally, along with the highest inflation rate we've seen in 40 years, we're also experiencing significant higher costs and other elements of our cost basket, including labor, transportation and fuel and other costs. We will continue to monitor these costs, fight hard to offset them and respond with additional pricing, if necessary. So specifically for the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect our consolidated net sales will increase by a high single to low double-digit percentage, inclusive of a low double-digit price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up high teens to low 20%. We expect Consumer Brands to be down a mid to high single-digit percentage, and we expect Performance Coatings to be flat to up a low single-digit percentage. We expect North America, which is the largest region within PCG, to be up a low teens percentage. For the full year 2022, we expect consolidated sales to increase by a low double-digit percentage, inclusive of a low double-digit percentage price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up by low double digits to mid-teens percentage. We expect Consumer Brands Group to be down a low single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low double to mid-teens digit percentage. Given the many variables we've noted, we left our diluted net income per share guidance for 2022 unchanged and in the range of $7.65 to $7.95 per share. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance includes Valspar acquisition related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share of $8.50 to $8.80, which represents mid single-digit percentage growth from 2021 at the midpoint in what continues to be a challenging macro environment. This guidance implies a second half adjusted diluted net income per share of $4.63 per share at the midpoint, an increase of 35% over the same time period last year. In addition, we provided updated guidance on several of our full year data points in our slide deck, including our expectations for FX, CapEx, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. We expect our full year tax rate will remain in the low 20% range. While we're not prepared to provide any specific guidance on 2023 at this time, I would like to comment on demand trends and actions we're taking that will impact our 2023 outlook that we will provide in January. We expect slowing new residential demand with elevated interest rates and other costs that are impacting new single-family home permits and starts. However, multifamily production has maintained strong momentum. It's also clear that macro headwinds are likely to continue and potentially worsen in Europe and China. Our base case in this environment remains to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. I'm highly confident in our leadership team, which is deep in experience and has been through many previous business cycles. We've transformed our business in many ways since the last significant downturn, and we are now a stronger, more resilient company. We know what to do. To this end, we've been evaluating multiple options available to us based on a wide range of scenarios, and we are prepared to take appropriate actions beginning this quarter. These include the following we continue to review our portfolio of businesses, brands and customer programs to ensure that they are adding above-market growth and long-term shareholder value. As a result of this work, we are announcing action plans to simplify our operating model and portfolio of brands in Consumer Brands Group and to reduce costs in all regions in Performance Coatings Group, Consumer Brands and administrative segments. These actions, once finalized, could include one-time costs or charges in the range of $160 million to $180 million over the next four quarters, and could result in annual run rate savings of approximately $50 million to $70 million once fully implemented. Additional details on these planned actions are outlined in the slide deck issued with our press release this morning. We will call out significant one-time charges and update our progress on run rate synergies on future quarterly earnings calls. We remain committed to our strategy of providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and profitable. In challenging environments, we have the opportunity to become an even more valuable partner to our customers. We will continue to focus on new account growth and share of wallet initiatives. We will leverage our strength in recession resilient end markets, including residential repaint, property management, packaging and auto refinish, all of which are larger than they were in previous cycles. We will continue to invest in growth initiatives, including adding stores, sales reps and innovative products and services. We will continue to invest in our people, including our management trainee program I previously mentioned, along with ongoing training that positions our people as one of the most significant amongst our many points of differentiation. We will continue implementing appropriate pricing actions across the company to offset persistently higher input costs, with a focus on regaining our gross margins back to our long-term target range of 45% to 48%. We will continue investing in acquisitions that can accelerate our long-term strategy and top-line growth, and expand our operating margins, including our most recent announcement of European Wood Coatings leader, ICA Group. We will maintain our disciplined capital allocation philosophy. We will not hold cash, while investing appropriately in CapEx, paying a dividend, targeting acquisitions that accelerate our strategy and absent M&A buying back our stock. In sum, we expect to deliver a solid fourth quarter to complete a very strong second half of 2022, and we're also taking actions to get ahead of what could be a challenging 2023. We don't expect to be immune from any number of potentially difficult scenarios, but what we do expect is to outperform our competitors and the market. We will do this by leveraging the best team in the industry. We remain committed to creating shareholder value over the long term. And that concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'll be happy to take your questions. Vincent, I'll take the inventory piece first, and I'll show it to Al to talk to the accounting. Yes, we're in a very good place right now for the majority of our products. I mentioned earlier, the issue that we continue to face with the alkyd resin and some of the specialty resins, we'll fight through that. It's getting better. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to have the majority, if not all of that behind us, at the end of the first quarter. But for the most part, the remaining portion of our product line is available for our customers. You should -- and I know you do know Sherwin-Williams, our model is not to unlock the door and hope that people are finding their way back into our stores to find them. Our sales reps and store managers are very aggressive in the hunt of pursuing customers, both existing and new to share with them the fact that we have these products available for them. And Vincent, this ties also back to your first question on the SG&A to Al's earlier point. We are continuing to invest in people to provide the service in the stores. So, as the product becomes more available, you may recall in the last couple of quarters, we talked about the new account activity at record levels and active accounts. So, now we've got a lot more people coming into our stores, new accounts coming in. We've got product available. We want to make sure that we have the service to deliver on our promise. And so they're all interrelated, and they're all working very well. Yes. Truman, I'd just add to that. As we typically do and our planning for the upcoming year, we work with our suppliers closely on looking at demand trends, looking at volume trends by region, and it gives us a better line of sight as we get through the end of the year. And that's why January, we are able to give you a much better outlook on the raw material basket and other input costs, quite honestly, as we've talked about. Labor rates have been up high single digits, and in some cases, across our supply chain, low to mid teens in an effort to reduce turnover, which is very expensive, but the expertise that goes with that turnover and then freight and other transportation costs. So, we'd like to talk about the full basket as we get into January, and we'll have a better line of sight to that. Yes. Truman, I want to be careful about getting into too much detail on this call. I mean, we're making these decisions in our fourth quarter and going forward. And it's -- as we talked about on our second quarter earnings call in July, it's part of our normal earning process that we continue -- and as John talked about, we continue to assess these portfolio of business brands and customer programs and their ability to drive above-average market share growth and the operating margin and cash flow targets we set for them. And if we don't see that happening, we take action similar to what we did with the -- exiting the East private label business, the sale of our Australia and New Zealand business architectural. I would say, on the run rate savings, more of that is due to the portfolio review than what I would call more purely cost reductions, and that's relative to the macroeconomic headwinds we're seeing. And it's probably a 60-40 split. And why I think that's important is because, we're not overreacting to the macro environment. It means that we are driving operating margin improvement across consumer brands, across the PCG. And I would even venture to say that within PCG, yes, as John talked about, we hit the low end of the high teens of 17%. We have more work to do. This -- these actions we're taking in the coming quarters is not related to our long-term high teens, low 20 operating margin. This is really in response for the slowdown we're seeing in Europe and Asia. So we have opportunities to grow with platform consolidations. As we integrate these acquisitions going into next year, they'll start to be accretive as we get to the second half. So, if we see additional slowdowns in demand, we have more levers to pull to offset any decremental operating margin. So... Yeah. And Truman, I'd answer this point as well. When you heard Al talk about not overreacting, I think your question is a good one, but I'd also point out that there are many areas of our business that we're actually continuing to invest and in some accelerating investments. So the leadership that we have, the ability to view and see where those opportunities are, I think, comes with a great deal of experience and what we're doing. And so we just talked about adding stores as an example. We'll have 35 new stores in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, 40 to 50 this year, this fourth quarter compared to 35 last year. And if you look at the staffing that we just talked about investing in digital programs that we're investing in. So we are making, we believe, the appropriate steps in reducing where we need to, but we're also investing in those areas that are appropriate. Thanks Truman. Well, I do think, to Al's point, if you look at the comps, if you take, for example, our packaging business, we had a high single-digit growth this past quarter versus strong double-digit comp. If you go into next quarter, fourth quarter comps last year were up over 30%. We've got a lot of momentum here in this business. We expect it to continue to win with our customers and grow with them. If you look at coil at a similar situation, fourth quarter last year, comps were up 20% coming off of a strong double-digit growth here as well. So there are some really strong performances here up against some really strong comps, and we think that these teams are continuing to grow in a pretty challenging environment. Thanks, Josh. Ghansham, I might say it remains positive. If you talk with our contractors, they look at the backlog ahead, and they feel it's a terrific opportunity for them to continue to grow. The LIRA, if you look at the forecasting they have, is for double-digit growth for the remainder of 2022 going into 2023. I would agree that there's some projections that remodeling may slow down mid-2023, but I'll also remind you that paint represents a terrific project to have high impact of relatively low cost. And while rates are moving, house price appreciation has also moved as has the aging of housing. The stock -- aging stock home price -- values, I'm sorry, let me do this. The aging home continues to require more remodeling, more updates, people aging in place, and we see that. You see it in the NAHB, which has slowed just a bit, but still well above 50. And while existing home sales have slowed against strong comps, it's largely because of lack of inventory. And when people have a tendency to stay in home, they'll continue to invest in those homes. Res repaint, we've often talked about, is the largest segment in the professional sub-segment space. It's a great opportunity for us. These customers respond very well to our personal approach of selling with our store managers and our sales reps. Our focus here is pretty simple, and why we have confidence is that we focus on the services and the solutions that allow these customers to be more successful. And I mentioned just a moment ago about the new accounts and share-of-wallet, these are accounts that are responding well to us. And I mentioned earlier, the innovation, I thought I'd just share one really quick one with you as an example, because here in Cleveland, we've just experienced a pretty dramatic swing from cold weather to warm weather. And we've introduced a product called Latitude with Climate Flex Technology, and it's a terrific product that fits, and I think it's a great example of why we continue to grow. We're responsive to these customers' needs, and this is a product that can be applied anywhere from 35 degrees all the way up to 120 degrees with the same application, same flow, same hiding, same appearance. And so what you end up is with customers that understand we're really focused on making them successful, launching products that help them on projects longer, allowing them to work later into the season. And this product with very minimal warning, if it starts to rain usually within a few hours, not even about 30 minutes actually, the product is resistant to moisture. So these are just small examples, but it really allows us to demonstrate how we're moving the needle and why we have confidence in continuing to move the needle in this space. Well, it's really simple. It's not a 30-minute discussion. We don't win or lose our price increase on how well we talk to them about the price increase in a pricing meeting. It's everything that I just talked about. Every day, we earn the value that our customers are willing to pay us for our products and services. And so the fact that we're out there helping them to be more successful, more profitable, when our costs go up, they understand that we're doing everything we can. Every customer that does business with Sherwin-Williams should know, we're doing everything we can to drive our costs down in both raw material and every other item in that basket. But when we're with them in a meeting to talk about pricing, it's because we need it. We've done everything to offset it, but what's most important is, we're helping them to be successful and we're partnering with them in their business. And so yes, we're more effective now because we're helping our customers to win. It is online. It's allowed us, as Al mentioned earlier, to build inventory at a time where we typically would have been running flat with demand outside of Orlando, a terrific team. I got to hand it to our entire supply chain team for the great work they did in getting that capacity up and running as quickly as they did. It's pretty well utilized. We don't talk to the specifics, but we run a 10-year model out on capacity. And this capacity was needed, came in perfectly at a great time, and it's allowed us to be responsive to our customers. We've got more capacity coming in, in Statesville, which will allow us to further meet the growing demands that we're projecting. And again, I hope that you see exactly what we see, which is confidence in our ability to deliver and the investments to support the demand that we're going to create. Yes. Let me start with the latter part of your question. I'll go over to Al to talk about the first piece. You're right, when we split out the acquisitions, it was to highlight to our investors our ability to reach the commitments that we've been talking about. In fact, when we first announced the Valspar acquisition, we painted a picture that we were proud of the performance of our TAG business and that we expected to drive this industrial business in that direction, citing our desire to get into the high teens, low 20 operating margins. The fact that we've reached adjusted backing out, to your point, the last 12 months of acquisitions up into the 17, there's no one popping corks here. We're not done. We know that, and it's one quarter. We understand that as well, but it clearly demonstrates what it is that we're out to do and how we're doing it. The fact that we've reached 17%, we think, is an indicator of where we are. And I will tell you where we're going is higher. The fact that we backed out these acquisitions should, in fact, indicate that we believe in these acquisitions. Some of them are as little as 30 or 60 days old, and we've not had the opportunity to drive the synergies that we know we can drive into these acquisitions. We're making these acquisitions with a long view in mind. We're not trying to add on the first 30 days of their joining our family. Do we expect them to be contributing what it is that we expect them to do? We buy them with a goal of bringing our synergies and plugging them into our platform, driving more volume out and cost reductions and synergies in. So, we're excited about these wonderful companies, the people that have joined our company as well as the technologies they bring, and we will drive those in the right direction, and they will contribute to our profit. The offset, as we talked earlier, to those acquisitions is in FX. So, about even if you're looking there just at the scoreboard. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, John, I think what's important to understand is that our e-commerce initiative is not just a transaction. It's more than selling paint. The ability to transact over a platform like that is table stakes and ours goes well above that. It's a much broader approach towards trying to tie in the entire ecosystem that we bring. So that last mile delivery through our local store is something that we want to be able to deliver in, but we're reaching in to the contractor base that we have relationships with, and we're beginning to conduct more and more business along with the rep and the store manager in a very unique and differentiated way. We want these customers living on our platform, running their business on our platform and seamlessly doing business with us as a result of that, and it's working quite well. We've got a number of painting contractors, as well as a lot of national accounts that are that are really dialing into our platform. There'll never be a finish line to this. We're investing pretty heavily right now, but that -- as we're ramping up, it's part of our plan that will stabilize and diminish over time. But right now, we think we're in such a unique position with our store platform and the ability to conduct business in a way that no one else can that we're excited about it. We're leveraging it and more and more people are using that. Thanks John. Chris, our industrial business, I would say, I talked just briefly about our packaging, but our packaging non-BPA coating is continuing to gain great traction. We mentioned that we're investing in this business. We've got great relationships with our customers here, and we are investing alongside with them with great agreements that allow us to really collaborate well and to grow with them. There's strong growth, for example, in beverage in both North America and Europe as the preference more and more moves away from other containers into aluminum cans. The Euro Food Safety Association opinion in Europe is also driving an increased demand for non-BPA coatings. We think that continues through 2022 and 2023. So this is a really, really unique technology, great customers. We've got a wonderful team here that's really executing very well. We're excited about this business. The coil business has been up double digits in seven of the last eight quarters. I mentioned earlier that we're facing some tough comps here with a 20% comp in the fourth quarter, but we're not running for the quarter. We're running this for years to come. We're really excited to hear again about this leadership team as well as the technology. Our solutions here have allowed us to be much more responsive to our customers. Quicker turns, smaller batches, works well in the face of adversity for our customers, and that's where we're headed, allowing them to be more responsive to their customers. So it's working very well. Our industrial wood business is another area that we believe we're growing share. Kitchen cabinets is a big part of this business. It's still positive now, but we do expect to see a little bit of slowdown in this business as new residential slows down. Furniture same way, we are growing share. But as new residential slows down, that will have an influence on industrial wood. There are other opportunities, though. We see a terrific opportunity in industrial wood flooring to continue to grow. Building products is our share position there offers tremendous opportunity. We do have a good position here in Europe, and so as Europe impacts industrial wood, we'll feel that in our industrial wood business. Auto refinish, I would say, there's a very high demand, and we're really pleased with this team and the job we're doing here. We know we're growing share here, particularly in North America, where our shop count is growing dramatically. There's a shortage here of body techs and parts that's having a material impact on backlogs, but our results in this business are terrific. And this is another one where we have a very similar model in our automotive as we do our TAG business with our controlled distribution. So our ability to serve and be responsive to our customers along with the shift that we're seeing, very positive mix shift towards our premium products gives us great confidence in this business. The combination of the Valspar and Sherwin technology that came together is really helping us win in auto refinish. GI, general industrial, strong demand here in heavy equipment expected through 2022 and 2023, especially large in ag and construction. And certainly, as you would expect, has been positive impacted by -- positively impacted by the infrastructure opportunities that exist. And then finally, in Protective & Marine, we're really pleased with what's happening here. Demand is strong in all end markets, oil and gas, water, wastewater. Again, same issue here as far as an opportunity in multiple high-value infrastructure opportunities. Solutions here go a long way as well. Our customers are willing to pay for products that help get them off the job quicker either with less coats, quicker recoat times, whatever it might be. We've been investing in this business in the flooring business. We're putting together a nice portfolio of technologies, services and capabilities that we believe will, again, further help us to differentiate. Our model here, again, is also differentiated, particularly in North America, where we have our store platform to use a distribution where many of our competitors are trying to drop ship in large orders. Our customers can work with our teams and leverage the local Sherwin-Williams store to source product and have it there when they need them, and our teams are working really well together on that. So, a lot of momentum here. We clearly see some pressures in the market as you look at Asia and Europe, and what's happening in those. We're not going to be immune to those, but we absolutely do believe where we expect and hold our teams accountable to outperform the market, and we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to do that, and we're making investments to help support them doing that. So we're feeling pretty good about this. Well, Chris, hold on one second before you just gauge. Are you talking about new residential? Okay. Got it. Well, commercial and resi repaint, I'd say, the underlying demand on commercial is strong. Projects are resuming and starts are positive. If you look at the Dodge Momentum Index, it's strong positive for every month in 2022 in the ABI, the Architectural Billing Index. And I'm sure you all know that's the index that really the metric for how architects are billing has been positive for 20 straight months. So that typically means projects in the next 9 to 12 months are going to be coming out of the ground and the fact that, they remain positive, we believe, is a good sign. Customers who are positive, they're still reporting delays resulting from some labor and material shortages that we are seeing a terrific opportunity for our products. Infrastructure spending here as well is strong and schools, airports, hospitals and also areas such as data centers, our position here is strong. Again, we really leverage our platform. We leverage our specification teams. We're calling on architects and continuously drive new products for customers that allow them to be more productive on the job. The combination of those local stores, reps and really great stable of products. I've got to hit it to our innovation team. It continues to do that. I know, they've been gathered just in the last couple of days, talking about how they can continue to add more to our success, and they're doing a wonderful job doing that. So I want to call out to them as well. As it relates to the residential repaint side, as I mentioned earlier, it's still positive. We see contractors in our stores every day. They're talking about the strength through the balance of the year and turning the corner into next year, still a pretty good backlog. I'd say that, if we talk to them about bidding and what's in the pipeline and really dial into our CRM to understand that, I'd say, what we've been witnessing is more and more the project scope has increased. So the size of the projects continue to grow, I think some of that might simply be \u2013 I finally found a contractor that will come give me a quote, and I'm not going to let him out just doing my living room. I want to have them do the entire house or expanded areas that they may not have planned on in the past. The quality of the leads seem to be going on. So there's \u2013 our contractors would refer to it as less tire kicking. There's people that, they are interested in projects, interested in getting quotes, and starting these projects right away. So we're very aggressive in pursuit of these customers. We feel as though our right to win and our value proposition is strong and getting stronger, and we're looking forward to continuing to leverage this. One last point I would make is that, we \u2013 our head is not in the sand here. The call out that we're making for adjusting our expenses and everything that we're doing, I think, highlights exactly the fact that we're grounded in reality. I will say, this though that when we exited the last slowdown, in the last recession, we did a postmortem and really tried to understand what is it coming out of the next slowdown. We want to be prepared with, and how would we be better positioned to withstand the next slowdown. And so throughout the period, 2008, 2010 period all the way to now, we've been working strategically on how do we better position the company. And when you look at residential repaint, it's a much larger percentage of our business now, and that's because when we \u2013 through the last one, new residential, while we've been successful and we've been growing in our success there, we wanted to offset this and diversify our business a little bit more. So we've been hard at work, driving more and more residential repaint. And now it's a larger percentage of our business, and we think it's going to allow us to weather storms much better than we have in the past. Thanks, Chris. Well, I would say this. Our belief is that we're in a really, really good position. We've been working hard, developing our approach towards a controlled distribution model that allows us to differentiate. When we're doing our job, we would expect people to react and change their models. And when they do that, we like to take advantage of that change. We think we're executing really, really well. We think people are reacting exactly the way we'd expect them to react, and we'd say that we're capitalizing on that, and we will continue to capitalize on that. Thanks, David. Well, there are certainly some of that. And I would say that -- two things: one is, I think we're working much closer with our customers. Adversity brings out the best. Sometimes you have to find it. The fact that we've gotten through this challenging time with raw materials with a closer relationship with our customers, we better understand what projects they're on. In the past, they just walked into the store and they knew they could have it, whatever it was. When they needed it, it was there. As we went through that process of working through the raw material shortages, we were more responsive or better responsive when we understood what the needs of the customers were. So I'd say, the pattern, first of all, for us, it's a closer pattern. We're working better with them. We do see some, I would call it, maybe, they're more fluid. They're moving to projects when they become available and if it's weather changing or getting outside when they can, the fact that they're racing with a pretty sizable backlog. They don't want to take any time off that they don't need to. It's why I mentioned that product that I mentioned earlier, it extends the painting season for them. But I'd say, as it relates to the pattern themselves on the architectural side, we're seeing more frequency, I would say. We're seeing people in our stores more. And on the industrial side, I'd say, we're probably seeing small orders more frequently -- smaller orders more frequently as our customers are trying to prepare for cash management, while being responsive for their teams with their teams or their customers. And again, that works to our advantage, given our model of responsiveness. Thanks, Arun. You're right, we do have that planned out. And I'd say that we're probably get this point going to tell you, it's going to be in the 80 to 100 range. And you'll see those in a combination of metro markets where we're continuing to feed in locations, as well as in some markets where we want to supplement some of the previous investments with added locations for our customers. But you're right, John, as we go into the year, a good portion of those are already identified and the deals are just getting finalized, and we're working through those. So, we're prepared, and again, confidence. Confident in our model, confident in the differentiation of Sherwin-Williams adding stores while others are closing stores and taking advantage of the market opportunities that exist as a result. Thanks John. Yes. Mike, trying to guess how bad could be is not something that we're going to do on this call. The reality is that we prepare for a number of scenarios. Our view is that, particularly in that store's business that when things get tough, we go hunting. And the reality of a really difficult time in stores might include scaling back on some of the staffing if we didn't have the transaction count or other expenses that we might feel are appropriate. But I would say this that in the 37, soon to be 38 years I've been with the company, our approach has been to take advantage of these situations. I mentioned earlier, the work we've been doing to grow res repaint as a percent of our business coming through COVID, I think it's a great demonstration of what we do in really difficult times. We go find customers. Those customers need to paint to put food on their plate, feed their families. We grow share, we grow active accounts and we outperformed the market. And I'd say, that's what you should expect us to do in difficult times. And again, not to keep everyone here all day, but the res repaint is an important part of it. The Pros Who Paint is another piece. When we think about the residential, that is a new focus for us as well, as in that industrial side where packaging, auto refinish, these are growing parts of our business that weren't as strong in the past. So, we don't wait for bad things to happen. We're trying to make good things out of it. Sure, Mike. Yes, Mike, I think what we're speaking to there has been our willingness to serve our customers even at a cost. And so, I think it will, as Ghansham might have been asked about the supply or the capacity that came on the 50 million gallons. As our raw materials have become available, we don't want to turn those down. We may need finished product in one part of the country, but the raws -- because of the supplier base might be available in another part, near another plant. We've manufactured that product and shift it to our customers to serve them. We have worked with our suppliers at times, where they've been unable to ship raw materials to us. We've used our own tank wagons or our own vehicles or 18-wheelers to secure a product and get it to our plants, when needed. So, there's an advantage of doing business with Sherwin that starts with the customer in the store or the rep plant, but it works all the way through to the raw material and manufacturing piece. And we'll do what we have to, to keep our customers in business and producing, because we know in the long run, the better job we do at keeping them in business, is the better supplier we are to them. That's in our best interest long term. Mike, I'd say, on the industrial side, we are investing and continue to grow. Nearly every one of our PCG businesses has a good and growing business there, and we expect that to continue. As you would expect, we are taking the appropriate actions based on slowdowns. And as I would say, is our custom, we continue to evaluate our businesses. And as Al mentioned, not only our businesses, our programs, our customers, relationships, everything we can to ensure that they reach the hurdle for us to continue to invest in those. I think it is safe to say that we're doing a deep dive review of our architectural business in China. And based on how that review comes out, we'll decide about what we do in the future. The industrial side, we know we can demonstrate the value for our customers that can allow us to win there. Thanks Mike. And if we need to go out, we will have wrestled everything we can to the map to try to avoid having to go out, but I think we've demonstrated an ability and a willingness if we have to. But we don't take that lightly. Our goal is not to have to, but there are some inflationary areas of wages or whatever it is. We also want to make sure that we retain the best talent, and so we know we need to be competitive as well. Thanks Greg. North American volume was up strong single digits. No, actually, we see the opposite as customers are facing labor shortages and trying to get through projects as quickly as possible. They have a tendency to move up in quality. And we're actually even seeing that in our new residential as well as we've introduced new products, new one of Painters Edge Plus. It's an ultra flat product that hides in perfections as an example. So you get in some of these projects where the drywall contractors are struggling to hire and find experienced drywallers. They're passing drywall on that may not be as perfect as the painter might have liked. And so we're helping them with products that hide some of those imperfections. Our customers are willing to pay for those. 90% -- 85% to 90% of their cost is labor. So shifting up in quality helps them on the overall profitability of the project. I'd say, some of what you're seeing in our DIY first in our stores -- and Al was right, we've seen more DIY in our own stores, but it's a relatively small percentage of our business. We're mainly focused on the pinning contractor through our own stores, but the comparisons there where we were shifting product away from DIY products into contractors is a portion of the benefit that we see. And then also on the consumer brand side, as we've reached a more level state, if you will, of raw materials. We've been able to benefit from some of the pipeline filling into other customers that we've not been able to in the past just because of availability. So we're seeing some benefit there as well. So let me answer the first question. You're right that the spray equipment sales, any given time of year, could vary as how much of a leading indicator would be. So residential repaint, as an example, I don't think many of us would appreciate a repaint contractor coming into our homes where we're living with an airless sprayer trying to spray the inside of the home. And as exterior slows down, they're less likely to purchase spray equipment. So I'd say that for the most part right now, spray equipment is riding along, as you would expect, with the sales volume of paint that we're experiencing. And then the second part of your question, Steve, was \u2013 I'd say, right now, as we'd be talking historically to our customers, the outlook that we have is pretty much in line with what we would normally hear from them. Commercial contractors generally have a \u2013 a longer view. These are larger projects that go out to bid as far out as a year earlier. Residential repaint would be on the other end of the spectrum and those contractors could get contracts or agreements that could start in weeks, others in months. So I'd say, it's pretty much in line with what we would normally see if you put them all together and look at the backlog. It's pretty consistent with what we've seen. It is the wallroom brand. And if I'm talking on a call about a deep dive, it probably is safe to say, it's not worked out as well as I had hoped. You bet. To weigh in segments like our auto refinish and coil, I mean there's -- it's a very good question. Eric, I think if you look at the overall, we think we're not only better positioned from a demand standpoint. We talk about resi repaint, but you also would have to include property management in there, the auto refinish, the packaging, all of these are really better positioned, but we're going to be, I think, in a better position to grow volume as well, more absorption through the plant than we may have to the last cycle as well. And there's a lot that we bring in our approach even with existing segments. The strategy work that we've done to allow us to better focus on the sub-segments and those customers within there that are willing to pay for the solutions that we bring is where we're focused, and we think that's going to benefit us. Thanks, Eric."

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJames Jaye: Thank you and good morning to everyone. Our second quarter results came in below our expectations and conclude what we knew would be a challenging first half to the year. On the top line, the quarter was characterized by strong demand in pro architectural and North American industrial end markets, partially offset by softness in the North American DIY channel, which we first described at our Investor Day on June 8; and tight supply of certain resins, particularly alkyd resins, which impacted our North American nonpaint sales, namely aerosols and stains. Internationally, demand deteriorated faster than anticipated in Europe, and we saw no real recovery in China following the lifting of COVID lockdowns, both of which meaningfully impacted Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings Group sales. Our earnings per share were impacted by multiple factors, including no meaningful improvement in raw material costs, supply chain inefficiencies incurred in serving our customers, the sales shortfall at North American DIY, slowing European and Asian demand, and higher other and interest expense.  I'll go through just a few of the numbers at a high level and then turn it over to John, who will talk about the demand and cost trends we are seeing, how we're responding and our revised outlook for the year, including what we expect will be significant earnings per share growth in the second half. Comparisons in my comments are to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Starting with the top line. Second quarter 2022 consolidated sales increased 9.2%, slightly below the low end of our guidance and driven by the shortfall in Consumer Brands Group. Pricing was in the low double-digit range. Consolidated gross margin decreased to 41.7% driven by cost inflation. On a sequential basis, gross margin improved by 60 basis points, reflecting our pricing actions. SG&A expense decreased to 25.9% of sales. Consolidated profit before tax decreased 9.7% to $739.9 million. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $2.21 per share versus $2.42 per share a year ago. Excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense, second quarter adjusted diluted net income per share was $2.41 per share versus $2.65 a share a year ago. EBITDA in the quarter was $976.1 million or 16.6% of sales. Moving on to our operating segments. Sales in The Americas Group increased 8.1% against a 22.6% comparison. High single-digit pricing and higher professional architectural sales volume was partially offset by lower volume in Protective & Marine and DIY. Segment margin decreased to 21%, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases and good cost control. Sales in the Consumer Brands Group increased 0.9%, inclusive of a high single-digit price increase. Demand was soft in all regions, particularly outside of North America. And tightness in alkyd resins impacted North America nonpaint sales. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 11.2% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume, higher raw material costs and supply chain inefficiencies, partially offset by selling price increases. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 15.2% against a 41.3% comparison and were driven by double-digit price increases and low single-digit sales from acquisitions, partially offset by a low single-digit FX impact. Adjusted segment margin increased 80 basis points to 13.8% of sales due primarily to higher selling price increases and good cost control. Additionally, I'll point out the admin segment this quarter, where we had a headwind of $45.1 million year-over-year or about $0.13 per share. This was driven primarily by investment losses and gains, higher interest expense, a gain on disposition of assets last year and higher SG&A expenses, partially offset by lower compensation expense. Let me now turn the call over to John for additional commentary on the second quarter, along with our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2022. John?\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me be clear that we are not satisfied with our results in the quarter. Our job is not to just report results but to influence results. We fell short of our expectations this quarter as we continue to operate in a highly inflationary cost environment coupled with ongoing regional challenges impacting demand. Saying that, we continue to see positive trends in much of the business, and we expect to deliver a strong second half of the year. We have confidence in our strategy, we have confidence in our business model, and we have incredible confidence in our people. Let me start by describing how the quarter played out following our June 8 Investor Day event. Pro architectural demand remains strong. Encouragingly, sales have been particularly strong month to date in July, and contractors are reporting strong backlogs, which bodes very well for our second half. The lower demand for DIY that we described continued, and tight alkyd resin supply negatively impacted North America nonpaint categories. Europe has significantly softened further, and there was no meaningful recovery in China post the lifting of the COVID lockdown. This impacted Consumer Brands and portions of Performance Coatings. There was no improvement in raw material costs. While some key feedstocks have come down sequentially, the issue is timing as resins, solvents and other key inputs are taking longer to reflect this trend than anticipated. Additionally, the rest of the cost basket remained highly elevated, including labor, transportation, fuel and other costs.  While the supply chain for raw materials continue to improve, it remains tight and subject to shots. Notably, certain specialty resins crucial to several of our industrial coatings products were in short supply. With the tightness in the supply chain, we continue to have inefficiencies in our operations but have chosen to continue serving our customers, albeit at higher costs.  While the cost and regional pressures we are seeing are real, there is no sense of panic amongst our team, which is deep and experienced. We continue to operate with urgency and great determination, and we're taking the following actions. We've announced and are implementing a 10% price increase in The Americas Group effective September 6. Significant pricing actions are also being taken in our other 2 groups. We remain highly focused on capturing demand and gaining share. We're managing our expenses tightly across all our businesses. These are focused on general and administrative spending rather than growth. Before moving on to our outlook, let me provide some additional color on our second quarter. In The Americas Group, sales growth was strong and volumes were positive in pro architectural market segments. Excluding DIY and Protective & Marine, sales were up 8.7% in North America paint stores. Against very difficult comparisons and as we expected, sales gains for the group were driven by price as total volume was down slightly. The sales growth was led by property management and New Residential, both of which increased by a double-digit percentage. Residential repaint was up high single digits, and commercial was up by a mid-single-digit percentage. DIY was down low single digits. Limited availability of certain resins impacted us in Protective & Marine, which was up by mid-single-digit percentage. We've also begun to see margin recovery in the business as segment margin expanded sequentially. From a products perspective, exterior paint sales grew faster than interior sales with interior being the larger part of the mix. We opened 19 net new stores over the first half of the year and still plan 80 to 100 for the year. We also added sales reps and territories in the quarter, along with ongoing growth investments in management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services. Our Consumer Brands Group had a very difficult quarter. Sales in North America were up by a high single-digit percentage but well below our expectations given a favorable comparison. The slowing demand we cited at our Investor Day did not improve over the remainder of the month, so we experienced tight supply in certain resins, particularly alkyd resins, that significantly impacted our North American nonpaint sales. On a positive note, the Pros Who Paint segment, while small, again grew by a strong double-digit percentage. Sales in China were down by a very high double-digit percentage due to COVID-related lockdowns and a challenging comparison. Europe was also down high double digits due to the slowing macroeconomic environment and a challenging comparison. Pricing was positive in the quarter and in the high single-digit range. Segment margin decreased significantly due to lower sales volume, increased raw material costs and supply chain inefficiencies. In contrast, our Performance Coatings Group had a very nice quarter. Sales were up mid-teens, including mid-teens pricing. Low single-digit sales from acquisitions were more than offset by FX headwinds. Adjusted segment margin improved 80 basis points year-over-year and 200 basis points sequentially, indicative of executed pricing actions.  Regionally, sales increased strong double digits in North America and Latin America against difficult comparisons. Sales in Europe were up low single digits. Sales were backward in Asia, largely related to COVID lockdowns. Nearly every division in the group grew, led by coil and packaging, both of which were up strong double digits against double-digit comparisons. We are clearly gaining share in these businesses. Sales in general industrial and auto refinish increased high single digits against very strong double-digit comparisons. Industrial wood sales decreased low single digits, mainly related to Asia and COVID lockdowns and a slowdown in Europe. Before moving to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $453 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $296 million to purchase 1.1 million shares at an average price of $269.46. We distributed $156.2 million in dividend. We also invested $129 million in our business through capital expenditures, including $89 million in core CapEx and $40 million for Building Our Future projects.  Additionally, the acquisition of Gross & Perthun and Dur-A-Flex closed on July 1. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.4x as we increased short-term borrowings to fund our recent acquisitions. We expect to end the year around 3x and will drive the ratio to our long-term target of 2 to 2.5x range in 2023. We will use cash in the second half of 2022 to manage debt, and share buybacks will be done to offset option dilution. Turning to our outlook. As we've communicated multiple times going back to January of this year, we expected 2022 would be a year of 2 contrasting halves with difficult first half comparisons easing in the back half. We expect to deliver a strong second half with sales up low double digits to mid-teens percentage and diluted earnings per share up by 35% at the midpoint of our guidance. Within The Americas Group, we continue to see extremely strong demand across all of our pro-architectural markets, including New Residential despite higher interest rates with customers reporting strong backlogs that will take them through the end of the year and likely longer. We also see a unique opportunity to win new business as competitors transition their pro contractor business models. Within the Consumer Brands Group, we expect more modest growth as the North American DIY consumer faces inflationary pressures and Europe and China remain challenging. Within Performance Coatings Group, demand remained strongest in North America, our largest region. European demand has slowed in the second quarter, and we do not expect meaningful improvement in the second half of the year. In Asia, the pace of recovery from prior COVID lockdowns in China and prospects for additional lockdowns make it difficult to assess demand trajectory. From an industry supply chain perspective, we're getting the raw materials we need with some exceptions such as alkyd resins, which remain choppy. At the same time, it's not optimal. In our own operations, we expect inefficiencies to continue near term as we've decided to take the necessary steps required to overcome these challenges and ensure that we are serving our customers with product where and when they need it. Exiting this era with our customers will prove beneficial to our shareholders. On the cost side of the equation, we're raising our mid-teens raw material inflation guidance to high teens as expected cost moderation did not materialize in the second quarter and appears to be pushed out a quarter or 2. To be clear, while the timing is not precise, we do expect raw material costs to moderate. We do expect to hold on to our pricing based on the value we deliver and the customer-facing investments we've continued to make, and we do expect margins to expand. There's considerable short-term volatility in the market, and our visibility beyond a quarter or 2 is limited. Our pricing actions remain on track. Additionally, the highest rate of inflation we've seen in 40 years is affecting the other elements of our cost basket, including labor, transportation, fuel and other costs. We're combating these increases with additional selling price increases in all 3 segments in our second half of the year. So specifically for the third quarter of 2022, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a low to mid-teens percentage inclusive of a low double-digit price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a high teen's percentage. We expect Consumer Brands to be up by a low single-digit percentage. And we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a high single to low double-digit percentage. For the full year 2022, we are maintaining our consolidated net sales guidance based on the momentum we're seeing in pro architectural and North American industrial. We continue to expect consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage.  We expect Consumer Brands Group to be down by a low single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low double digits to mid-teens percentage. We are decreasing our earnings guidance for the full year based primarily on the headwinds we described previously. The incremental pricing actions and general and administrative cost reductions I described earlier will not fully offset these headwinds immediately.  We now expect diluted net income per share for 2022 to be in the range of $7.65 to $7.95 per share compared to $6.98 per share earned in 2021. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance includes Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share of $8.50 to $8.80, an increase of 6.1% at the midpoint, over the $8.15 we delivered in 2021.  This implies a second half adjusted diluted net income per share of $4.63 per share at the midpoint, an increase of 35% over the same time last year. In addition, we provided updated guidance on several of our full year data points in our slide deck, including our expectations for FX, CapEx, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. We expect our full year tax rate will remain in the low-20% range. While we continue to operate in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in our strategy. We expect to deliver a strong second half of the year, and more importantly, create shareholder value over the long term through the following actions. We will continue leveraging strong pro architectural volume demand in North America paint stores while investing in future growth with incremental new stores and sales reps.  We will continue implementing appropriate pricing actions across the company to offset persistently higher input costs with a focus on regaining our gross margins back to our long-term target range of 45% to 48%. We'll continue to invest in the Pros Who Paint initiative in Consumer Brands Group and in products and services that customers value in the Performance Coatings Group. We will continue investing in acquisitions that accelerate our long-term strategic plan, add top line growth and expand our operating margins as we've demonstrated recently through the Specialty Polymers, Sika, Gross & Perthun and Dur-A-Flex acquisitions.  We will continue appropriately managing our general and administrative costs while investing in future growth initiatives. We will continue to review our portfolio of businesses, brands and customer programs to ensure they are adding above-market growth and long-term shareholder value. We will maintain our disciplined capital allocation philosophy. We will not hold cash while investing appropriately in CapEx, paying the dividend, targeting acquisitions that accelerate our strategy, and absent M&A, buying back our stock. Our leadership team is experienced. Our 61,000 employees are focused on the task at hand. And we expect to win. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question for today is coming from Ghansham Panjabi.\nGhansham Panjabi: Robert W. Baird. I guess, first off, I mean, obviously, John, a lot has changed over the past few months given the increase in interest rates and concerns over construction end markets here in North America. Can you first just update us with your view, if it has changed, as it relates to the various subsegments within TAG?\nJohn Morikis: Well, Ghansham, I'd say our confidence in TAG remains as strong as it has always been. If you look at what's happening within those segments, maybe I could just run through them briefly here. If you look at New Residential, our position there is strong and getting stronger.  As a matter of fact, we've been very transparent in sharing that we've had these exclusive relationships with 18 of the top 20 national homebuilders. In fact, we've gotten a few inquiries because of some specific wording in the financial community presentation slide and if we've been able to maintain those relationships. The fact is that we've actually grown them. Proud of our team for hanging on to the 18 of the top 20, but we've actually now grown that to exclusive relationship with the top 23 of the top 25, and we're selling the majority of the remaining 2 in the top 25. So customers in this space are telling us they are confident in the balance of the year.  Demand is strong based on just the simple supply and demand. And so as we work with our national and regional homebuilders, the creativity that they are displaying to ensure that they keep building is high. But market demand here is high. Supply is below the demand space, and we think it's pretty visible to those of us in the industry that there is a strong level of demand. If I look at residential repaint, here is an area where the job itself is growing in size and value. Part of that is a continued positive mix shift into higher-quality products. These higher-quality products help our customers with productivity, with their appearance, touchup, just the whole ease of application. Our customers here, again, are very confident through the balance of the year with demand, and our position here is growing. And I do think that it might be interesting to point out that if you go back to the 2008 period where we -- last we really faced these significant challenges in residential, that was really the catalyst for our residential repaint business that we have now.  So it is a uniquely different position and I think much more favorable position for our company right now. Because if there is a slowdown in New Residential, we have a much stronger residential repaint business now than we did during the last slowdown. So it's an area of focus that we've had strategically to offset any puts and takes in the market. And we think that the stronger position in res repaint that we have now will be a strong position going forward. The other area, if you're following New Residential with concern would be, well, what happens if people are not buying new homes.  Again, we still think there's demand -- strong demand there. But property maintenance would be the other area that we would expect to benefit. And here again, we've spoken about the relationships that we have. In the past, we've talked about the 18 of the top 20 that we have exclusive relationships. We now have exclusive relationships with 21 of the top 25.  In fact, in the top 350, we have solid agreements with 70% of them exclusive relationships with 45%. So at 45% exclusive of the top 350, while we're pleased with that, it still offers a terrific opportunity, and again, room for growth for us. In property management CapEx, our teams would describe that as an area that's off the charts right now. There's considerable amount of investment taking place as well as in the turns, which is very robust and almost acts as a bit of an annuity in the business in many ways. In commercial, I would describe it, Ghansham, as historic backlog. The pipeline here is strong. We're seeing a lot of activity here in tilta, in distribution, data centers and some might even include multifamily in the commercial space as well. We run a good part of our business -- Protective & Marine business, as you know, through our TAG business. This is a business where demand has been strong, particularly in petrochem, water and wastewater, also high -- other value area of infrastructure, as I mentioned, data centers.  Also battery plants is another area. This is an area that we were impacted negatively. We talked in our prepared remarks about the alkyd resins. We felt a lot of pressure here. We could have really sold a lot more product if we could have gotten more of the alkyd resin that was in short supply. But our position here is very good and one that we believe has a tremendous runway ahead of us.\nAllen Mistysyn: Ghansham, this is Al Mistysyn. And building on that confidence in the strong demand, this is what gives us confidence in our second half adjusted EPS guidance to be up 35% with strong volume in TAG. Plus we announced, as John mentioned in his opening remarks, a 10% price increase effective September 6, along with the pricing actions we're taking across the rest of the groups.  Our expectation is that we're going to see nice gross margin improvement year-over-year, starting in our third quarter and trending through our fourth quarter. And I'd like to highlight another -- a couple of other points just to reiterate that confidence. If you look at our operating margin in TAG at 21% in the second quarter, yes, it was down year-over-year, but I think the strong volume and the pricing actions that we're taking are going to help us get into a strong improvement in our second half.  As it is, our second quarter was sequentially better by 420 basis points and better by 500 basis -- 90 basis points versus the fourth quarter. And I got to talk about Performance Coatings Group because, as you know, that has historically been our lowest operating margin business to date. And we have a lot of confidence in attaining our target operating margin of high teens to low 20%, and I think that will move the needle on our overall results, and we're making good progress. Our second quarter operating margin improved 80 basis points year-over-year and increased 400 -- and improved 200 basis points sequentially and improved 490 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. And this came on gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. And even with the macro challenges that we're facing in Europe and Asia that we can expect to continue in our second half, the pricing actions, the market share gains that we're experiencing in packaging and coil, in particular, gives us great confidence that we'll be able to expand our margins in the second half in that business.  And that's including the acquisitions that we made that John talked about, which are going to give us modest tailwind in our second half on operating profit. But as we integrate and realize synergies next year, and we'll talk more about this on our second -- our year-end call, we expect margin accretion with those acquisitions. And then finally, I'll talk about our Consumer Brands Group, which we absolutely understand and agree, we're under pressure in our second quarter. Still sequentially down but better than 490 basis points than our fourth quarter. Even though the volumes are down, our expectation is that business returns to 20% operating margins as we improve our operating efficiencies, as we focus on our continuous improvement initiatives and we drive shareholder value and generate cash flow, and that's going to be part of this portfolio review that we do. And we look at, as you know, profitable gallon growth, operating margin expansion, RONA and cash flow. And we're committed to driving the businesses within consumer to the targets that we set. And as you know, if we haven't and don't believe we have a path to hitting those targets, we are committed to making those changes. And that includes, as you recall, the ANZ divestiture and the Ace private label business that we walked away from.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Christopher Parkinson.\nChristopher Parkinson: Mizuho. Gentlemen, just going in -- and so let's take a look at TAG. I know there's some optimism on the pent-up demand on the resi repaint side, likely commercial, even some stuff in multifamily, I imagine. Price-cost, we know where your pricing is. We're all taking a stab at where we think the raw material basket is going to go over the next couple of quarters. Al and John, when we take a step back from everything, I mean, where do you ultimately think the TAG margins can go? I mean there's been a lot of focus on the 13 by 24 CB and PC. Obviously, it's going to take a little bit to get there. But on the TAG side of it, just how should we think about your business? How should we think about in terms of like how they're falling into place in the back half of the year and into '23 and even '24? Are there any updated thoughts there?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Chris, this is going to be a little bit of a diversion from what you talked about. And let me just highlight that we're probably not going to be talking about '24 yet. So bear with us here.\nChristopher Parkinson: Fair enough.\nJohn Morikis: But I do want to mention, and I'll ask Al to get into the details. But I do think -- as maybe as a preface to your question, I think it's important to understand why we have the confidence that the margins improve the way that we're projecting. And I think highlighted is it's specifically focused on our ability to make our customers more successful is through products, is through service, is through our people.  It's the adversity that's in the market right now that we feed on. This is actually when we're at our best in servicing those customers. And I think you can see that right now. As we come through this second quarter -- and while TAG hit the number. It was on the lower end of the sales expectations, the fact is that we probably missed by less than a couple of weeks what we were projecting because we're experiencing that now.  As June went on, sales continued to grow, the momentum continued to increase. In fact, we don't normally show this level of color, but I would tell you that coming out of June with a double-digit gain in nearly every segment. Now as we enter into and finish up July, our average day in TAG right now is averaging high teens, low 20s.  So the momentum that we projected is in fact there, and we believe it's because of the value that we're helping create on the part of our customers to help them to be more successful in what it is that they're doing. They've got a lot of challenges in labor. They've got challenges in projects starting and stopping. And our people, our stores, our products are helping them to do that better than anyone else. And as I mentioned on numerous calls, what we evaluate the most is the research that we do who helps you make more money. And by a wide margin, we have a great distance between us and our competition here on the professional side. Let me let Al walk you through our projections on margins.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Chris, I mean we saw a nice sequential improvement in our margins. Our raw -- our pricing that we put in place to date did actually -- was over what the raw material cost increases were plus other input costs but just not up to the expectations we had. And with the outlook that we have on raw material costs being in the -- above the high end of our range, the cost to serve our customers, as we talked about, the supply chain is not ideal.  So we're moving product around this platform, if you will, to make sure we have the right products in the right place where our customers need them. And that's really is what's driving this additional 10% price increase September 6, which we do believe will have a similar effectiveness to previous price increases.  And as you recall and know, you go back to '10, '11 and '12, and we were out with 6 price increases in 22 months. Our margins in TAG were under pressure. And coming out of that, as raw materials moderated, our gross margins grew almost 600 basis points from '13 to '16. And we believe we're in a similar environment, and it's because we can hold on to that price, because we continue to make investments even though we're experiencing these headwinds. And if you go back full year 2022 -- or 2020, we're at 22.1, second half was 23.5. I don't believe we quite get to those levels, but we're starting on a much better base than we were in 2010. So we have a lot of confidence that as the market turns and raws start to moderate, we'll hang on to that price and we'll see a nice snapback to our gross margins and operating margins in the TAG going forward.\nJohn Morikis: And let me just top that off with the key driver behind that, we believe and we'll always believe that it's our people. The message on our differentiation here, I think, is probably as strong or stronger, particularly given the environment that we're finding ourselves in. We're going to war with store managers that average 10 years of experience, sales reps that average 12 years, our district managers averaging 22 years, our vice presidents averaging 24 years. So there's a lot of experience that we're leading with. And the fact that we've got this training and the experience that we have allows us a customer engagement. We feel that's a clear differentiation point between us and our competitors. And the fact that we are now able to get back into in-person training as opposed to virtual training and the way we're engaging with our people, we think, is just an outstanding element to our -- what we call our secret weapon, our people.  And our ability to right now attract talent is probably as strong as ever. We have been open about our management training program, which is entering its 40th year. We're recruiting anywhere from 1,400 to 1,500 college graduates. And this high-caliber, talented employee joining our family helps us to do exactly what Al laid out as far as the financials. It's the people that set us apart.\nChristopher Parkinson: Just a -- and then just a real quick follow-up as a corollary of Al's comment on the price increase. It seems as though in the past -- understanding it's a small part of TAG, we all thought of the price increases of the DIY crowd, once again small, short-term contractors, long-term contractors and kind of the progression to getting that.  And typically, the realization was 60%, 70%-plus of initial price increase. Could you just give us a real quick comment on how we should be thinking about that as it will ultimately pertain to '23 of -- do you think you'll get the expeditious pace of what you're realizing recently or kind of going back in the past? And is my assumption on the actual net realization a fair one? So just pace and realization would be very helpful.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Chris, I'd say that we expect that momentum to continue, I think for all the reasons -- I don't want to be labor the services and everything that we believe we bring and the value creation for our customers. But I'd say that it's a market where people are probably more understanding.  I mean they go to the gas pump and see what's happening. And so our execution on these prices are nothing that we -- we're not arrogant with it. We're determined because we want to keep our organization healthy so that we can help our customers remain healthy. And so the balance is important there. We continue to invest in products and services, innovation, programs that will help our customers on every part of our business. And it's easy to point to the TAG business and might recite that 85% roughly of their cost of goods is labor, and everything that we can do to help make that labor more efficient helps their profitability.  So the cost of the gallon of p is a lower percentage there. And they are in themselves deciding to move up in quality because they see that a higher-priced, high-quality product helps drive their success. But that logic actually carries through to every element of our business.  We're driving our customers' success. That's how we gauge our success. When our customers are successful, then we know that we're going to be a better part of their programs and their success. And that's what we're focused on, and we believe we'll be able to execute on these prices accordingly.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Greg Melich.\nGregory Melich: I'm with Evercore ISI. My question was a follow on, I think, Al, some of your points there in terms of the margin inflection. It sounds like now you are on top of raws just not as much as you would have thought. And remind us, last year of that 450 or 500 bp margin decline at TAG, how much of that was raws versus price as opposed to the volume declines that you saw?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. It would be the majority of the raws, but there's other input costs that are coming through, Greg. But that would be the majority. As you know, volume is always -- when our volume is backwards, it's always the biggest driver of operating margin. It's always the -- when it's positive and as we expected to be strong in our second half, it's going to be the driver of operating margin. But even if you offset raw material cost increases with selling price increases, your margin takes a hit. And it takes moderation -- a little bit of moderation on raws and increasing that last price increase effectiveness to start seeing the recovery, and we believe we're going to start seeing that in our third quarter.\nGregory Melich: And so maybe the backup question of that then is if you look at the third quarter guide, if sales are going to be up low to mid-teens and that presumably probably has price that's also low to mid-teens, are you assuming flat volume year-on-year in your third quarter guidance?\nAllen Mistysyn: On our third quarter, I think when we look at the second -- the September price increase, I probably have high single digits. You have to annualize the August price increase last year. You start annualizing the surcharge. So I have volume up high single digit, and then that would tell you volume would be up in that high single-digit range. I'm not as heavy on price as you've got in your -- as what you're saying.\nJohn Morikis: Greg, for the company on the back half, architectural gallons, I could give you a little color there. We're expecting low to mid-single-digit gain for the company with TAG up in the high single digits.\nGregory Melich: Got it. On volume?\nJohn Morikis: Right.\nGregory Melich: Got it. And then the rest is price. Great.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Maybe just following up a bit on the Consumer Brands piece. Obviously, we've seen what your volume was in the quarter. Can you talk about whether you think that is indicative of what the retail takeaway is, in line with it or worse? And where do you think your retail partners are in terms of their own inventories or sort of doing the destocking that seems to be going on?  And I guess really what I'm asking is just sort of -- you just mentioned you're expecting TAG gallons to be up more than -- total architecture gallons, but you're obviously expecting consumer gallons to be up it would sound like then. So what gives you the confidence that the consumer gallons can actually be up in the back half of the year?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Vincent, I think it's that careful line here that we are always cautious in crossing and talking about too much of our customers' business. I will say this, as it relates to our customers' inventory, we made great progress in filling our customers' shelves in the second quarter, and there are still opportunities for additional channel fill.  We're going in full speed to put everything we have behind this. We mentioned specifically some of the key areas of the oil stains, Minwax and Krylon, that have been impacted by the alkyd resins. That's going to impact the ability to fill inventory. But as it relates to our customers and their inventory levels, I think it's only appropriate that, that come from them, not us.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Vincent, just to clarify what John said is our second half architectural gallons are going to be up low to mid-single digits. TAG would be up high single digits. That tells you that consumer is actually going to be backwards probably by a mid-single-digit percentage, and it's driven by the continued trends we talked about with softer North America DIY. And I would say we did not see a significant destocking, and our second quarter remains to be seen going out, but we didn't see it in our second quarter. And then Europe and Asia, we expect to see continued softness in Europe and really choppiness in China as the rolling lockdowns continue.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: John, I'm just going back to Slide 7, looking at what changed since June 8. I don't see FX on the slide. Was that a headwind versus what you were expecting earlier? Or is it embedded in these numbers?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. It is going to be a little bit of a bigger headwind. But David, 80% percent of our sales and profit are in North America. So we're not as impacted. But we do expect it to be a slightly bigger headwind than our second half.\nDavid Begleiter: Got it. And John, just on North American DIY. Did it -- did demand soften versus your June expectation or just not get better versus that expectation?\nJohn Morikis: Can you repeat that? I'm sorry.\nDavid Begleiter: Looking at North American DIY, you called out softer demand versus maybe the earlier expectation. Is that -- did it get worse versus June 8 or just not improve? Or how should we think about that?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. I'd say that it did get worse, and we were expecting some improvement as we went into the holiday 4th of July season. We were expecting more improvement than we saw. And maybe it'd be good if I could -- I think I'm sure there's a lot of questions here regarding this topic. And I want to just make sure that we cover this completely and openly. Again, as Jim opened his prepared remarks, we were disappointed with the way that everything came together. But I would think that it's helpful for everyone if I put it in perspective. 2 of the 3 businesses performed within the range that we expected. And I'm going to jump to CBG in a moment, but I do think that it's worthy of just taking a couple of seconds to talk about the other 2 and then spend a little bit of time on CBG or Consumer Brands. I'll start very quickly with Performance Coatings. A pretty nice quarter. Sales were up mid-teens, expanded margins year-over-year, which reflects our pricing actions taking hold, as Al mentioned. And the cost environment remains a challenge. And again, we're responding with additional pricing actions accordingly. TAG, we talked briefly about here. And as I mentioned, we hit our guidance, albeit at the lower end. Demand here remains very strong. I mentioned very pleased with our sales trends right now, averaging in the high teens to low 20s per day. In this space, DIY is an area that remains softer. And I talked about the Protective & Marine. That remains strong, the demand. And areas -- only areas that we're feeling softness is in our ability to supply mainly in the alkyd resin area. Here again, as Al mentioned, we're putting price in through TAG. But getting to the heart of your question on CBG on our Analyst Day, that business was trending softer. It did further deteriorate as the quarter went on. And the deterioration mainly focused on 4 areas that I briefly talked about in our prepared remarks. The DIY demand was disappointing. You asked about it. We'd like to see a stronger performance there. There was no improvement in China. Al mentioned the COVID lockdowns as they were lifted. We saw virtually no improvement after those lockdowns were lifted. The European deterioration was further and faster as the quarter progressed than we expected.  And as -- again, not to overplay it, but there was virtually no improvement in the alkyd resin availability, and that had a significant impact on our ability to serve areas that are underserved right now, which is the ability to supply our stains and aerosols to the market. And as I mentioned in the other 2, pricing actions in CBG is going to be an important piece as well as we're responding to the cost issues in this business just as we are in TAG and the other businesses. The largest parts of our business, they deliver. We're executing on our strategy going forward. This second half of the year, we're going to drive earnings up by 35% at the midpoint of our guidance. Every business, we believe, has the leadership, the people to do it. Our group presidents are outstanding Justin Binns, our Todd Rea in Consumer Brands, he's carrying a heavy load right now, but he's -- we believe in delivering.  Karl Jorgenrud, who's running our Performance Coatings Group; and our COO, Heidi Petz, each one of them are out there every day driving doing what's right. And while this was a softer quarter than what we expected, and we don't take it lightly, we've got a lot of condition, a lot of determination but mostly confidence in what it is that we're doing. And we're going to deliver it. We've got it.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: I guess I wanted to drill down into North American housing dynamics a little bit. So we have seen many of the builders start to report slowdown in sales and potential cancellations as well, permits also. Even though the housing reports are okay, the actual numbers from the builders aren't as great. So could you just elaborate on how you see kind of TAG playing out over the next little while and maybe even the DIY side? I guess my specific questions are, you noted strength in R&R and residential repaint, but it seems like architectural gallons are still kind of 80% correlated to existing home sales. So if we do see a big slowdown there, how does TAG really kind of manage through that? And is it through share gains? Or what do you expect kind of for positive growth as we move forward just given the housing backdrop?\nJohn Morikis: Let me take a run at it, and then I'll have Jim get through some of the metrics on the housing that you mentioned, but it absolutely focuses on share gains. We've got great confidence in this team. I will highlight that the majority of the homebuilders that are out there, even a few that have lowered their numbers, their numbers have been lowered, but there's still an increase over the prior year.  So it may not be as robust as expected initially, but there's still good growth there. And the reason that I highlighted the fact that we're expanding our exclusivity rate, it wasn't upon my chest is to demonstrate exactly the fact that we know that if it's slowing down, we've got to have more customers we're doing business with to offset that demand.  And so we're continuing to push hard in New Residential, in residential repaint and property management. Commercial is very strong. It's -- we've got a great position there, and the momentum is very strong behind that. But our view is that the work that we're doing right now in establishing ourselves with these customers is what's going to pay off. Let me give you a little bit of background on that. So let's just talk in our TAG business. Our outreach effort right now executed by our TAG team is as strong as it's ever been. Our face-to-face call activity was at an all-time high last quarter. We've never made more sales calls in a quarter than we did last year. So it should be no surprise that the number of active accounts in our stores also hit an all-time high. We've never had more active accounts in our stores than we do right now. Second quarter, new account activity is very strong. These are the seeds that we're planting for the future. So clearly, our people are focused on the productivity of our customers, and this is how and when we're at our best. So we're capitalizing on the choppiness in the market by offering this consistent, reliable solution through the very best team that we have.  And we believe that the products, the store managers that I've mentioned, the reps, the services, the innovation that we're bringing, the whole specialty store format, we think, is very unique. And we believe that controlled distribution model allows us to respond to the variables in the market. Whichever way this market tilts, we're going to be there, and we're going to do whatever we have to do with the lead in each of those segments that are benefiting. And we'll gain share in those areas that might experience some softness. Let me turn it over to Jim to walk through his thoughts on the New Residential question that you had.\nJames Jaye: Yes. Arun, this is Jim. I'd agree with what John just said there. And what we always do, first and foremost, is in front of our customers. And recently, Al and I were traveling and we visited with several of our national homebuilders. And while the pace may be slowing a little bit, there's still a lot of confidence out there that I think takes them through the end of the year and well into next year. The completions right now are up year-over-year. And whether you look if it's single-family or multifamily, maybe multifamily is trending a little bit stronger now, but wherever it may be, we're there and ready to capitalize on that. You talk about mortgage rates, maybe a little bit of impact there, but they're still low in comparison to other periods.  And again, we're still seeing very strong demand there. And I think it's underpinned by what we've talked about for a couple of years now, this overall shortfall between houses being built and household formation. So I think that feels good. On the repaint side, as you mentioned, customers are telling us strong backlogs. Home price appreciation continues to be really strong. You look at some of the third-party metrics, LIRA, the NAHB remodeling index, all those are pointing in the right direction. And I'll remind you that res repaint, while it's our largest segment, it's our biggest opportunity. So feel good about that. We made comments about property management and commercial as well. I think our teams are primed and ready and the demand is out there, and we're going after it.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. I appreciate all the detail, guys. And then if I could just quickly on DIY. So we've been kind of weak here, and it looks like you guys are expecting that to continue. What would it take for DIY to turn around? In the past, I guess, you guys have seen some improvement there with unemployment when it goes higher. Is that what we should be thinking about? Or what else are we expecting for either a bottoming and maybe a turnaround in DIY?\nJohn Morikis: I think if your question is how do we see DIY or what -- would we see DIY driving. Is that...\nArun Viswanathan: Yes. How does DIY turn around from here, I guess, just given the weakness that we've seen here recently?\nJohn Morikis: Well, I think, first and foremost, I think it's fair to say that our focus to our stores is the professional painting contractor with 85% of our business focused on the contractor. We're focused on a very isolated DIY customer, those that are -- prefer a specialty store format.  Our outreach there is through various methods of advertising through social media, a few levers that we pull to drive that business. It's a good business for us, but our focus primarily is on the professional side through our stores.\nArun Viswanathan: No. I understand. I guess I was asking more about the Consumer Brands DIY piece. Sorry, John.\nJohn Morikis: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about the DIY through our stores. Through our Consumer Brands, I think the focus there, obviously, is on helping our customers to win. Here, you look at making sure that we have the right product, the right product assortment, ensuring that we have it at the right price.  We participate in helping to drive traffic through activities, including, as I mentioned, brand advertising, the training in the store, as an example, so that we want to help our customers convert shoppers into buyers. The innovation that we're bringing there will help to do that. And the training that we have inside the company and the centers of excellence that we have, we want to share that with all of our customers. There's a great deal of effort right now in the rep activity through this Pro Who Paints initiative. We want to continue to invest in that as well. We believe that, that customer going through a home center is a customer that we have been really not focused on through our own stores.  And those are the customers that kind of balance between DIY and Pro Who Paints. And Pro Who Paints, by definition, in our world is a contractor who's doing remodeling or some element of construction that's also painting at the completion of that project. We're supporting our customers' efforts there as well as various loyalty programs that our customers are initiating. We want to support those initiatives there. So there's a lot that we want to do and to execute with our customers to drive every category in the home center store that ultimately can come back to help drive the paint department as well.\nAllen Mistysyn: Arun, I'd just add to that. It would be helpful if we see some moderation in gas prices, some moderation in food prices that have been very -- have hit the consumer very hard over the last few months. So I think you have to start seeing some moderation in those costs to help get back to some of these discretionary projects.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Leithead at Barclays.\nMichael Leithead: Just one for me. I guess, why do you think there's this big divergence or at least some level of divergence between DIY and pro painters right now? I guess I'm just trying to square the weak North American consumer you're calling out in Consumer Brands with a pretty strong demand outlook in your pro business.\nJohn Morikis: So I think Al touched on it just now. I think right now, as the gas prices spiked up, I think many consumers who might choose to do some of those projects might be more influenced by the price of a gallon of paint and other areas of inflation than some consumers that can afford and want to have painters in their homes to do projects.  And so those prices, as they moderate over time, I think will have a more positive impact on the do-it-yourself customer. And those that are now working from home that are in an environment where they're saying, \"Hey, you know what to have a painter come in and freshen up my home is a relatively inexpensive but very impactful -- impact on my environment at home, and it's something that I want to invest in.\"\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: You have a slide where you say softer demand is hurting you by $0.50 a share. So $0.50 a share is about $163 million in operating profits. So does that reflect, I don't know, $400 million in lower sales than you expected or $1 billion in lower sales? And could you break it up between North American DIY, China and Europe?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Jeff, this is Al. You're closer on the $400 million than the $1 billion. And the way I look at it versus our expectations, which is what this is comparing, the -- about -- I'd say about half is Europe, and then the rest is pretty evenly split between the other two.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. Great. And in the first half, Al, is your raw material price spread about negative $250 million? In other words, $250 million was unrecovered in the first half by prices versus raw materials?\nAllen Mistysyn: It's not that -- not quite that big of a delta. It's almost flattish to down, but not quite to the $250 million that you talked about. And that is why we -- versus our expectations, and we talk about this higher input costs being down a dime. It's definitely heavier in the first half than the second half with the additional price increases that we're taking. And the actions we're going to be taking to help moderate some of those costs, but also the other input costs that we can influence to drive those lower or at least flatten those out so that we can start seeing the improvement. And like I talked about, our gross margin should start seeing year-over-year improvement in the third quarter. And then again, in the sequential -- or then again in the fourth quarter and then -- so yes, it's a kind of a tail of 2 halves versus our expectations on that price-cost line.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Sison at Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison: Just a quick question on sort of the price of the paint can given September increase. I know that the cost of the paint in a project is the smallest portion. But if you think about labor inflation and how much the paint can is now, do you think -- are we getting to the point where a paint project becomes -- starts to impact demand and could impact sort of pro demand as we go forward? Or is it still a fairly affordable project, I guess, in terms of renovation?\nJohn Morikis: We see the latter. It's a very affordable and impactful project. And as labor increases in costs, it's actually more beneficial to the contractor to use a higher-quality product. And we clearly see that in our products' mix shift. A definite shift in higher-quality products helps the customers' efficiency, productivity, even the opportunity cost. If they have to come back and rework or touch up or whatever it is, they are clearly recognizing that moving up in quality. So it's counter to -- it's a good question, Mike, but it's counterintuitive to what's happening. It's -- people are standing in line the bid list, as I mentioned, throughout the balance of the year. Our contractors are referencing a very full year, and they're moving up in quality.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Kevin McCarthy at Vertical Research Partners.\nKevin McCarthy: John, can you speak to labor cost trends? How much might your labor costs be running up on a year-over-year basis? And is the trend any better, worse or stable if we think about it sequentially? And is labor having an impact on your sales internally or your customers' ability to execute at this point?\nJohn Morikis: Well, I'll take a swipe at the first piece, and I'll ask Al to talk about the specific impact. But yes, I think many of our contractors would tell you that if they could hire additional labor, they would certainly hire and they frequently are now paying more for that labor than they were in the past. In our stores and even in our distribution centers and plants, we've made some adjustments to ensure that we're in market because, as I mentioned earlier, you don't achieve the retention rates that we have purely on the culture that you have. We have a wonderful culture, but we also know in respect and want to pay our employees a competitive wage in the market. And Al, maybe you can talk a little bit about that.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. So Kevin, we do expect our labor costs -- so we have high single digits on a consolidated basis. And I would say that's higher in our global supply chain. As you can imagine, it's -- there's less desire to work in a factory environment, a distribution environment. Drivers have been a challenge to get, although I would give the team a lot of credit in global supply chain. They've been able to attract drivers. They've been able to improve their attraction and retention rates in their plants and distribution centers and really have a well-thought-out plan for the future as it relates to automotive. We have not had issues within our TAG organization. Just a comment there. We've added 3,500 management trainees over the last 2.5 years, and that pipeline is strong. So I think we're shoring up the markets we need to shore up to retain people because turnover, as you know, is very costly. So sometimes -- and I think it's leveling out. That doesn't mean there's not a market here or there where we'll have to do more, but it's -- we seem to be leveling out at this point.\nJohn Morikis: It does seem to be leveling out. But I'd also say we'll take the appropriate steps to ensure that we keep our great people.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, if I may, I wanted to ask you about raw materials and alkyd resins in particular. I'm cognizant that there was a major outage of an alkyd resin manufacturer about a year ago, but in your commentary, I'm sensing that the shortage there has become more acute recently. Is that true? And if so, maybe you can talk about allocation level, what products are affected and what sort of impact that may have had on your sales.\nJohn Morikis: Well, you're right. It does date back to the OPC fire in Columbus in 2021, and that impacted the entire industry as about 130 million pounds of resins disappeared from the market. The important piece here, Kevin, is that there has also been an additional fire in St. Louis at an all next plant that will clearly be more pressure in the market, something we don't need. And my understanding as of just this morning was that there might have been another one here that -- in the same space that could also have a negative impact. So we're trying to work through that. That's real-time stuff. Since we've come into the boardroom here, I've not heard anything. What I'd say is we've been working hard to make monthly progress towards improvement, but it's likely going to be towards the end of the year before we're out of the woods. The solution here is going to be a combination of the internal utilization of assets. And I would say that the recently acquired SPI resins business, again, has proven its value in many ways. This is one of them. But we'll also utilize external assets through arrangements and agreements there as well. But it is safe to say that our plans, our efforts, we were planning on better supply rates than what we experienced. And we think it's going to be a lot of work by our team to continue to gain ground, but it's going to be in small increments. But we believe that by the end of the year or as we enter into next year, we'll be in a much better situation than we are today. The issue here, I think is -- and again, maybe just speaking openly and transparently, a couple of quarters or a quarter ago, we talked about that we didn't believe that the raw material issues were going to be an issue that we faced. And to the largest degree, it's not. We've built inventory in architectural inventory. We supplied our Consumer Brands customers and a growing rate of inventory. And so to the largest extent, everything we said, we stand behind. That said, we also said that it was going to be very tight and hand to mouth. And in times like this, any shocks or any shortages are far more impactful than they normally would be. There's no WIP. There's no inventory in the system to absorb any shocks or anything. So literally, in some cases, if one of our suppliers has something that goes down for a shift or 2, where in the past, we would never feel that. Now we're dispatching, in some cases, our own tanker trucks to offset those or we're producing -- as Al mentioned, we might produce a batch in one plant and deliberate freight -- from one part of the country to the other to serve our customers. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, all of these are very conscious decisions. We're not out just spending money here. I mean we're trying to drive it to the bottom line. But as I mentioned, we believe with our hearts that coming out of this era of challenges with our customers, many of whom understand completely what it is that we're doing to serve them, will ultimately be in the best interest of our shareholders. And so while in a quarter or 2, we're going to feel this pressure there's a reason why our exclusive relationships, as an example, are increasing because our customers see what we're doing. And we'd like to drive it to the bottom line faster and better, and we will. But some of these challenges and shortages are real, and we're responding real time to them, and we're going to serve our customers. And as I said, we'll come out with our -- with these customers on the backside.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson at Wolfe Research.\nTruman Patterson: First, John, I'm hoping you can give just a lay of the land for your supply chains in TAG and inventory levels. Are you all still manufacturing as quickly as you can kind of get it out the door? And March, April time frame, you mentioned that architectural volume production was at the highest levels in history. Should we assume now that July is still the highest levels?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Truman, I would say we are absolutely utilizing the 50 million gallons of architectural production capacity. And we are -- as John mentioned, we actually built inventory in our second quarter related to architectural, and that was both on TAG and CBG, where historically, as you know, we build inventory in our fourth quarter, in our first quarter. And we see inventory reduction in our middle 2 quarters, our highest volume quarters. So we're keeping pace with the level of sales, and we're very confident that also tells you, to John's point, the architectural availability issues, although may not be ideal, we're getting the raws we need to meet demand. And we'll be able to feel confident that we can meet the second half strong high single-digit demand from TAG and also build inventory in our fourth quarter this year and our first quarter next year to be ready for the next year's spring and summer selling season.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. And then, look, New Residential, if you look at builder orders, it's definitely decelerated. And we'll see if that goes into the repair and remodel market as well. But if I look back at kind of 2008-2010 time period, clearly different dynamics. But you all did slow your net store openings according to our data. I'm just trying to understand if we see an economic downturn. Would you all continue to try and open up anywhere, we'll call it, I don't know, 80 to 100 stores? Or would you guys maybe kind of call that back a little bit? Just trying to see how you all are thinking about the next couple of years.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Truman, it's a good observation. I think, if I recall, we lowered our store count at that time to around 60 new stores. And I would say this, that we have confidence in that model, particularly what's happening in the market right now with some of the changes. Some of our competitors choosing to change their model creates terrific opportunities for us. And so you should expect us to continue to leverage that opportunity to the fullest. Might we adjust down a little bit? Maybe. I mean we're going to take a disciplined approach. Right-hand guy here, Al, and while she's not in the room, our COO, Heidi, I mean those are conversations that the 3 of us, along with Justin that runs our stores, have on a regular basis. I think the takeaway I'd like for you to have is that we've seen this movie before. Investing in the face of adversity is something that we've done. We've not done it without discipline. We will invest. And at the rate -- if it drips down a little bit below 80, we might do that, but we see the value long term. We're actually getting continually better at opening new stores. The focus that we've given, Justin in TAG and all his division teams, is to continue to drive that profitability faster so that we can continue to invest and get those stores contributing faster. So I guess the quick answer is, yes, we might in some of those drift down a little bit, but it won't be by much.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Truman, the only thing I would add to that is if you think about 2008 and '09, we were more heavily weighted to new res to commercial. And over that last -- coming out of 2010 through 2020, our res repaint 10-year compounded average growth rate was low double digits. That was not at the expense of new res, which was also low double digits but on a smaller base. So if you look at our mix today, our new -- res repaint is our #1 segment, the fastest growing, does offer maybe a slightly different view of how we invest in new stores this year and going forward into next year and maybe being even more aggressive than we were back in '08 and '09 just because of that mix of those segments.\nJohn Morikis: It's a great point. Our is resi repaint business now is much stronger, much better part of our business than it was at that time. It's a great point, Al.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Josh Spector at UBS.\nJoshua Spector: Just a follow-up on the Consumer Brands. I mean if I look at the performance in the quarter, your ex U.S. sales were maybe down 30%. Volume's down a bit more. Obviously, China is a factor in there. But curious if you could comment on Europe. I think some of the peers' volumes were down maybe 15% mid-teens-ish. Were your volumes down similar to that in Europe or down much more? And if it's more, what would be the difference?\nJohn Morikis: I'd say they were similarly impacted. And we were impacted by all the same issues as you read in the news, everything from inflation to energy costs, certainly the war. Despite that pressure, we believe we're with the right partner there. Our TiO2 program has been very well received, and we'll fight to continue to grow share. But there's clearly some pressure in the market there that we're not immune to.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Adam Baumgarten at Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten: Just curious, in res repaint, do you have a sense for how much of demand is related to kind of a larger remodel projects such as a kitchen renovation or an addition versus just a refresh, something like someone just painting a few rooms in their home?\nJohn Morikis: I would say that in our TAG business, it's a relatively small percentage is tied to kind of a major remodel, big ticket. It's -- much more likely, it's going to be either an exterior or interior paint -- repaint. Certainly, we participate in those larger projects, but the largest percentages are painters pulling up -- jumping on the exterior of a home or knocking off the interior for res repaint.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Got it. And then just given the slowdown in DIY demand...\nJohn Morikis: Adam, If I may, maybe just -- where we would see more of that kitchen remodel in some of the other areas that you talked about would be through our Pros Who Paint program on the consumer side. The painters that we focus on to our stores would be the guys that are gals that are coming in and focused on painting is the largest percentage. We like to think of our customers as 90-plus percent focused on painting through our stores.\nAdam Baumgarten: Got it. That's helpful. And then just on DIY, just given the slowdown, do you expect to see promotional activity pick up going forward?\nJohn Morikis: No. I think there's more in the area of branding and kind of awareness. I think there will be some promotional supply levels get back into more normalized levels. But with inflationary issues that everyone is facing, it's a pretty disciplined industry because of the percentage of cost of goods and the total cost keeps everyone pretty honest. So it's not likely something that's going to -- the floor is going to fall out, I would suspect.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from John Roberts at Credit Suisse.\nJohn Roberts: Gallons in TAG were down year-over-year in the quarter. So how do you square that with the record number of customers and record number of sales calls? Is the average gallon per job down? Or is there some other mix effect that's going on?\nJohn Morikis: Well, I'd say part of it is the really strong comparisons that we had last year. John, I don't have those on the top of my head. Al, if you can get those, that would be great. But John, I'd say that with what we have seen from a comp standpoint, we knew going into the year that the first half was -- is going to be a challenge. But I'm glad you brought that up because it's part of why we have the confidence that we do not only in the results, the fact that we have more accounts now and more call activity. But I think as Justin mentioned at the analyst event, our ability to focus on this effort and then see the actual results -- there's a lot of people that talk about what they want to do. But the fact that we have this controlled distribution model gives us POS data, gives us -- we have over 3,000 reps, and our store manager call activity is easily logged as well. And so what I'm really proud of is not only can people say, \"Hey, we're going to go do this.\" But we're really seeing the impact in the results and the fact that we have the number of calls taking place and the number of active accounts really points to the level of execution of this wonderful team.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. John, I would just highlight, last year in the second quarter, tax sales were up 22.6%. Same-store sales was up 19%. Res repaint was up 36%. And commercial property maintenance, new res were up all high double digits. So really tough comp. And what we commented on in our press releases, our pro architectural volumes were actually up low single digits. So I think that goes and points to the calls and the activity that's happening that help drive us year-over-year on volume.\nJohn Roberts: And then, John, I think you mentioned that Interior was a bigger part of the TAG mix in the June quarter. Is that unusual seasonally in a June quarter? I would think exterior might be bigger in that quarter. And weather, I think, was uneventful essentially. It was just hot, but we didn't have unusual rains or anything.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. John, you're right in that exterior does ramp up during the season, but interior is by far a much larger percentage of total gallons. But you're right for recognizing that during this time of the year, exterior does ramp up. It is -- interior is a pretty significant load of the gallons.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois at Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: I'm sorry if this is done, but just on DIY. Just to be clear, did it slow sequentially late in the quarter? Or did it just not come in your initial expectations? Just wondering if there was just a material weakening in the DIY demand.\nJohn Morikis: Garik, I would say that it kind of bounced around. We had been working on trying to drive that. We expected a little more positive gallons than we actually saw. And so it was bouncing around without the gain that we had projected.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. Follow-up question just on the portfolio review you cited. Just to be clear, is this just normal course of business you look at either your portfolio regularly? Or are you perhaps accelerating some plans given some of the macro challenges that may be popping up?\nAllen Mistysyn: No. Garik, this is part of what our normal operating processes. We set market share or sales growth targets, ROS improvement targets, RONA targets and cash flow targets for each of our significant businesses, programs, regions, customer programs even and midterm and longer term. And it's an ongoing thing because the environment has changed. You look at just even in the last 2.5 years, the differences from the beginning of 2020 to today. So trying to look at macroeconomic trends and how that's impacting our investments and how that's impacting different businesses and then their path forward and action plans to still meet those targets regardless of what's happened in the macroeconomic environment. We have tremendous opportunities for market share growth in Europe and Asia across each of the businesses. So use that as one example. Okay, what's the value proposition that we're presenting to these customers? That gives us a clear line of sight to attaining those goals, midterm and longer term. And as an example, I highlighted our commitment if we don't believe we can hit those goals. Australia was an example, the Ace private label program was an example. Maybe those programs are better for somebody else.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky at Northcoast Research.\nCharles Cerankosky: John and Al, when you talk about some of these raw material shortages and transportation interruptions and all the other things that seem to be randomly getting inventories in the supply chain back on track, well, how do you deal with allocating the limited inventory ROS between different markets? And I'm thinking mainly the professional architectural and the DIY architectural.\nJohn Morikis: Well, oftentimes, Chuck, what we find are we're making the products that we have the raw materials for. So in our Consumer Brands Group as an example, we have primarily a different resin system than we would in some of our -- most of our TAG business products. So where -- as those raws are becoming available, we're converting those as quickly as possible to what's available. But I'll go back to the point that Al made that and what I tried to highlight earlier on the architectural front. The availability of raw materials now has really diminished. To your point, transportation is an area of concern, and mainly the issue is on rail. If we point to the 2 areas most impacted then by rail, it would be TiO2 and bioresin. And we previously mentioned that we -- we brought on a number of -- I think we've ordered 400 tanker wagons to be able to -- I think maybe we've gotten 200. I think we ordered 400 tank wagons to be able to bridge any gaps. We think that's -- we're uniquely positioned in our industry to be able to do that given the fleet that we have. And so Chuck, we make what we have. We try to get what we need as quickly as possible through our suppliers in the worst-case scenarios. We work with them to send our own tankers to get there, make it as quickly as possible and ship it from whatever plant we can get it to and convert it as quickly as possible.\nAllen Mistysyn: Chuck, the only add to that would be certainly within TAG as we were experiencing the severe raw material shortages in our fourth quarter and into our first quarter, we clearly emphasized the Pro versus DIY segment within TAG. So we certainly can do it when we're in a specific business. And similar kind of decisions had to be made in consumers. So when you're within a segment or a group, you can make those calls, and we did, to get the best utilization of those precious raw materials we had.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne at Bank of America.\nStephen Byrne: John, this initiative of yours to grow the business in consumer with Pros who Paint, do you feel that it's necessary to offer those pros some of the services that you provide from -- in TAG such as large volume shipments to the job site, the ability to place orders without having to call the Lowe's store? Are those functions that you're considering or do you consider not necessary?\nJohn Morikis: No. Steve, we're in this to win it. And so we're working with Lowe's on the services and fulfillment that will help that targeted customer be more successful. And so I say, Lowe's it's the entire consumer brands initiative is to align the our customers with the needs of their customers. So pricing and those types of things, we don't control that. Our customers would control that. But we're working with them to ensure that they have a complete offering, everything from the power brands that attract customers to the innovation in the can itself. We have reps that are working with their teams to drive their loyalty programs and other initiatives that they have. So yes, I mean, if we can do things to help attract those segments, it's a wonderful win for both of us. Those are customers that we're likely not penetrating through our own stores. They want a broader selection of products that are available in home centers. And we have great partners that we're trying to help to win, and we'll take the steps to do that.\nStephen Byrne: And maybe one more drill into the TAG expectations for the third quarter. Is the improvement in volumes that you're expecting, are those on an underlying improvement from the second quarter? Or is that a year-over-year improvement in that the comp isn't as challenging in the third as it was in the second? Is -- so just a question about underlying trends in those pro end markets. And do you have any concern about any challenge or pushback from those -- in those end markets for your price increase that's on the table?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Steve, it's both a sequential improvement in gallon growth, and it's also a year-over-year significant improvement in gallon growth. And no, we do not expect -- we talked about expecting our price increase to be a similar effectiveness as previous price increases. And I believe that's going to be the case.\nJohn Morikis: I agree. You don't judge the effectiveness of a price increase on the 30-minute discussion you have on we need a price increase. It's -- we have to earn that every day. And so every day, our reps are out there, our store people are delivering the products that we have. Every single day we have to go right back to the point I made earlier, which is do we help you make more money? And if the answer is no to that, then we don't deserve it. But we're working really hard to make sure that we do obviously. And I think the fact that we're seeing the metrics and the activity that we are experiencing, we think that bodes well for our efforts. It's -- there's no complacency here, though. We want to get better every day and, and we feel as though the activities that we are taking as well as the environment in which we're in will support the increase that we need.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Eric Bosshard at Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard: Al, just a point of clarification. I thought like earlier on this call, you talked about the pricing realization in the quarter not being up to expectations. Is that -- again, I'm not sure if I heard you right. Can you just talk about how pricing relative to your expectations paid in the quarter?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. So Eric, what I say -- I'm glad you asked that question just as clarity. Our pricing actions themselves were we expected them to be. If the price-cost differential was not quite where we wanted it to be -- was not quite where we wanted to be on our expectations. Our costs were higher, raws were a little bit higher. Our cost of freight, transportation, labor, those types of things were higher and then the cost to serve our customers. As we came into getting our inventories built at the end of the first quarter and coming into the second quarter, we thought we'd see less of that gallon movement around our distribution network than we actually saw. So there's higher costs related to that. So that's what drove that price-cost dynamic, I thought would be better in our second quarter than it actually was.\nEric Bosshard: And then within that, the pricing effectiveness, I think you commented earlier in the quarter was at least, if not better than the historic trend. That was the experience on pricing in the quarter? And is that the same expectation for this coming increase.\nAllen Mistysyn: That's right. And we actually did get on top -- the pricing in our second quarter was better and got on top of all those costs, just not to the expectation we have.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ken Zener at KeyBanc.\nKenneth Zener: I think you made a comment earlier on Slide 7, the $0.50 share reduction. I believe you said for the softer demand, you said 50% was Europe, and then it was equal parts North America and China. Is that correct?\nAllen Mistysyn: That's -- it's directionally accurate, yes.\nKenneth Zener: Okay. Yes, not exactly. And I raise this because it seems obviously with just 9% in line with kind of the earnings revision, it seems as though roughly half of the revision is tied to what I would consider lower-multiple non core U.S. businesses, which is to say, TAG, the pricing, your $0.10 hit on higher input costs is not that much. Is there something about the operating leverage that is different in Europe and China on that DIY? Because not a large piece of consumer, but it seemed to have really outsized impact on the guidance.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. The Europe and Asia comment not only includes consumer but has an impact on our certain businesses within our Performance Coatings Group as well. So it's a combination of the 2. It's not just consumer in Europe and Asia.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Adrien Tamagno at Berenberg.\nAdrien Tamagno: So it looks like you repurchased $700 million of shares in H1, and your 3x end-of-year leverage target seems to leave very little space for more M&A in H2. So are you taking the view that with the current environment, you are better off growing organically and not adding complexity to your business?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Adrien, I think we -- what we talked about and what John talked about in his opening comments, our leverage ratio ticked up, net debt-to-EBITDA 3.4:1, due to the acquisitions. The acquisitions aren't -- because we only have half a year, because we have amortization and inventory step-up, we're not going to be able to cover the increase in debt, the interest that goes with that. But what we're committed to doing is using excess cash in our second half to pay down debt will offset option dilution with share buybacks. But as you know, that will mean a lot more cash available for us to pay debt down. And I would just highlight our second half net operating cash is going to be slightly different than what we've experienced in the past. As you know, we generate almost 70% of our cash flow in the second half, and it really flips from first half to second half. And you'll see that in our second half this year and maybe even a little more aggressively because we built so much inventory in our first -- had to build in so much inventory in our first half of the year. So you will see a flip in a much stronger second half in cash flow maybe than even you've seen in prior years.\nAdrien Tamagno: All right. And just a second one, the cash flow still. I've seen you reduced CapEx by around $100 million. So how are you able to find these savings without harming the future work?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. That's primarily due to the new headquarters and R&D projects. We've maintained our core CapEx because you're right, we are absolutely moving forward with our architectural capacity expansion. And we're -- another part of that, that we're moving forward with is the packaging capacity expansions just so we can keep up with the mid-teen compounded average growth rate that we've seen in packaging volumes. So that's going to be a continued investment. And then the final one, as we've talked about labor and labor rates and the challenges around the labor market, is the continued investment in our automation activities within our global supply chain.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jim Jaye for closing remarks.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, Holly, and thanks, everybody, for listening to our call. Obviously, second quarter, a little bit challenging, but we're very confident about delivering a strong second half of the year. And I think that's really led by the strong demand we're seeing across our Pro architectural business in TAG. We're responding to ongoing cost pressures with additional pricing in all of our segments. We're continuing to invest in growth initiatives, and we're going to continue to manage our costs tightly. We're very determined, and I hope that came across. And we expect to deliver value. So thank you for joining us, and we'll be available for your follow-up calls. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Allen Mistysyn",
            "content": "Ghansham, this is Al Mistysyn. And building on that confidence in the strong demand, this is what gives us confidence in our second half adjusted EPS guidance to be up 35% with strong volume in TAG. Plus we announced, as John mentioned in his opening remarks, a 10% price increase effective September 6, along with the pricing actions we're taking across the rest of the groups.  Our expectation is that we're going to see nice gross margin improvement year-over-year, starting in our third quarter and trending through our fourth quarter. And I'd like to highlight another -- a couple of other points just to reiterate that confidence. If you look at our operating margin in TAG at 21% in the second quarter, yes, it was down year-over-year, but I think the strong volume and the pricing actions that we're taking are going to help us get into a strong improvement in our second half.  As it is, our second quarter was sequentially better by 420 basis points and better by 500 basis -- 90 basis points versus the fourth quarter. And I got to talk about Performance Coatings Group because, as you know, that has historically been our lowest operating margin business to date. And we have a lot of confidence in attaining our target operating margin of high teens to low 20%, and I think that will move the needle on our overall results, and we're making good progress. Our second quarter operating margin improved 80 basis points year-over-year and increased 400 -- and improved 200 basis points sequentially and improved 490 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. And this came on gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. And even with the macro challenges that we're facing in Europe and Asia that we can expect to continue in our second half, the pricing actions, the market share gains that we're experiencing in packaging and coil, in particular, gives us great confidence that we'll be able to expand our margins in the second half in that business.  And that's including the acquisitions that we made that John talked about, which are going to give us modest tailwind in our second half on operating profit. But as we integrate and realize synergies next year, and we'll talk more about this on our second -- our year-end call, we expect margin accretion with those acquisitions. And then finally, I'll talk about our Consumer Brands Group, which we absolutely understand and agree, we're under pressure in our second quarter. Still sequentially down but better than 490 basis points than our fourth quarter. Even though the volumes are down, our expectation is that business returns to 20% operating margins as we improve our operating efficiencies, as we focus on our continuous improvement initiatives and we drive shareholder value and generate cash flow, and that's going to be part of this portfolio review that we do. And we look at, as you know, profitable gallon growth, operating margin expansion, RONA and cash flow. And we're committed to driving the businesses within consumer to the targets that we set. And as you know, if we haven't and don't believe we have a path to hitting those targets, we are committed to making those changes. And that includes, as you recall, the ANZ divestiture and the Ace private label business that we walked away from. Yes. Chris, I mean we saw a nice sequential improvement in our margins. Our raw -- our pricing that we put in place to date did actually -- was over what the raw material cost increases were plus other input costs but just not up to the expectations we had. And with the outlook that we have on raw material costs being in the -- above the high end of our range, the cost to serve our customers, as we talked about, the supply chain is not ideal.  So we're moving product around this platform, if you will, to make sure we have the right products in the right place where our customers need them. And that's really is what's driving this additional 10% price increase September 6, which we do believe will have a similar effectiveness to previous price increases.  And as you recall and know, you go back to '10, '11 and '12, and we were out with 6 price increases in 22 months. Our margins in TAG were under pressure. And coming out of that, as raw materials moderated, our gross margins grew almost 600 basis points from '13 to '16. And we believe we're in a similar environment, and it's because we can hold on to that price, because we continue to make investments even though we're experiencing these headwinds. And if you go back full year 2022 -- or 2020, we're at 22.1, second half was 23.5. I don't believe we quite get to those levels, but we're starting on a much better base than we were in 2010. So we have a lot of confidence that as the market turns and raws start to moderate, we'll hang on to that price and we'll see a nice snapback to our gross margins and operating margins in the TAG going forward. Yes. It would be the majority of the raws, but there's other input costs that are coming through, Greg. But that would be the majority. As you know, volume is always -- when our volume is backwards, it's always the biggest driver of operating margin. It's always the -- when it's positive and as we expected to be strong in our second half, it's going to be the driver of operating margin. But even if you offset raw material cost increases with selling price increases, your margin takes a hit. And it takes moderation -- a little bit of moderation on raws and increasing that last price increase effectiveness to start seeing the recovery, and we believe we're going to start seeing that in our third quarter. On our third quarter, I think when we look at the second -- the September price increase, I probably have high single digits. You have to annualize the August price increase last year. You start annualizing the surcharge. So I have volume up high single digit, and then that would tell you volume would be up in that high single-digit range. I'm not as heavy on price as you've got in your -- as what you're saying. Yes. Vincent, just to clarify what John said is our second half architectural gallons are going to be up low to mid-single digits. TAG would be up high single digits. That tells you that consumer is actually going to be backwards probably by a mid-single-digit percentage, and it's driven by the continued trends we talked about with softer North America DIY. And I would say we did not see a significant destocking, and our second quarter remains to be seen going out, but we didn't see it in our second quarter. And then Europe and Asia, we expect to see continued softness in Europe and really choppiness in China as the rolling lockdowns continue. Yes. It is going to be a little bit of a bigger headwind. But David, 80% percent of our sales and profit are in North America. So we're not as impacted. But we do expect it to be a slightly bigger headwind than our second half. Arun, I'd just add to that. It would be helpful if we see some moderation in gas prices, some moderation in food prices that have been very -- have hit the consumer very hard over the last few months. So I think you have to start seeing some moderation in those costs to help get back to some of these discretionary projects. Yes. Jeff, this is Al. You're closer on the $400 million than the $1 billion. And the way I look at it versus our expectations, which is what this is comparing, the -- about -- I'd say about half is Europe, and then the rest is pretty evenly split between the other two. It's not that -- not quite that big of a delta. It's almost flattish to down, but not quite to the $250 million that you talked about. And that is why we -- versus our expectations, and we talk about this higher input costs being down a dime. It's definitely heavier in the first half than the second half with the additional price increases that we're taking. And the actions we're going to be taking to help moderate some of those costs, but also the other input costs that we can influence to drive those lower or at least flatten those out so that we can start seeing the improvement. And like I talked about, our gross margin should start seeing year-over-year improvement in the third quarter. And then again, in the sequential -- or then again in the fourth quarter and then -- so yes, it's a kind of a tail of 2 halves versus our expectations on that price-cost line. Yes. So Kevin, we do expect our labor costs -- so we have high single digits on a consolidated basis. And I would say that's higher in our global supply chain. As you can imagine, it's -- there's less desire to work in a factory environment, a distribution environment. Drivers have been a challenge to get, although I would give the team a lot of credit in global supply chain. They've been able to attract drivers. They've been able to improve their attraction and retention rates in their plants and distribution centers and really have a well-thought-out plan for the future as it relates to automotive. We have not had issues within our TAG organization. Just a comment there. We've added 3,500 management trainees over the last 2.5 years, and that pipeline is strong. So I think we're shoring up the markets we need to shore up to retain people because turnover, as you know, is very costly. So sometimes -- and I think it's leveling out. That doesn't mean there's not a market here or there where we'll have to do more, but it's -- we seem to be leveling out at this point. Yes. Truman, I would say we are absolutely utilizing the 50 million gallons of architectural production capacity. And we are -- as John mentioned, we actually built inventory in our second quarter related to architectural, and that was both on TAG and CBG, where historically, as you know, we build inventory in our fourth quarter, in our first quarter. And we see inventory reduction in our middle 2 quarters, our highest volume quarters. So we're keeping pace with the level of sales, and we're very confident that also tells you, to John's point, the architectural availability issues, although may not be ideal, we're getting the raws we need to meet demand. And we'll be able to feel confident that we can meet the second half strong high single-digit demand from TAG and also build inventory in our fourth quarter this year and our first quarter next year to be ready for the next year's spring and summer selling season. Yes. Truman, the only thing I would add to that is if you think about 2008 and '09, we were more heavily weighted to new res to commercial. And over that last -- coming out of 2010 through 2020, our res repaint 10-year compounded average growth rate was low double digits. That was not at the expense of new res, which was also low double digits but on a smaller base. So if you look at our mix today, our new -- res repaint is our #1 segment, the fastest growing, does offer maybe a slightly different view of how we invest in new stores this year and going forward into next year and maybe being even more aggressive than we were back in '08 and '09 just because of that mix of those segments. Yes. John, I would just highlight, last year in the second quarter, tax sales were up 22.6%. Same-store sales was up 19%. Res repaint was up 36%. And commercial property maintenance, new res were up all high double digits. So really tough comp. And what we commented on in our press releases, our pro architectural volumes were actually up low single digits. So I think that goes and points to the calls and the activity that's happening that help drive us year-over-year on volume. No. Garik, this is part of what our normal operating processes. We set market share or sales growth targets, ROS improvement targets, RONA targets and cash flow targets for each of our significant businesses, programs, regions, customer programs even and midterm and longer term. And it's an ongoing thing because the environment has changed. You look at just even in the last 2.5 years, the differences from the beginning of 2020 to today. So trying to look at macroeconomic trends and how that's impacting our investments and how that's impacting different businesses and then their path forward and action plans to still meet those targets regardless of what's happened in the macroeconomic environment. We have tremendous opportunities for market share growth in Europe and Asia across each of the businesses. So use that as one example. Okay, what's the value proposition that we're presenting to these customers? That gives us a clear line of sight to attaining those goals, midterm and longer term. And as an example, I highlighted our commitment if we don't believe we can hit those goals. Australia was an example, the Ace private label program was an example. Maybe those programs are better for somebody else. Chuck, the only add to that would be certainly within TAG as we were experiencing the severe raw material shortages in our fourth quarter and into our first quarter, we clearly emphasized the Pro versus DIY segment within TAG. So we certainly can do it when we're in a specific business. And similar kind of decisions had to be made in consumers. So when you're within a segment or a group, you can make those calls, and we did, to get the best utilization of those precious raw materials we had. Yes. Steve, it's both a sequential improvement in gallon growth, and it's also a year-over-year significant improvement in gallon growth. And no, we do not expect -- we talked about expecting our price increase to be a similar effectiveness as previous price increases. And I believe that's going to be the case. Yes. So Eric, what I say -- I'm glad you asked that question just as clarity. Our pricing actions themselves were we expected them to be. If the price-cost differential was not quite where we wanted it to be -- was not quite where we wanted to be on our expectations. Our costs were higher, raws were a little bit higher. Our cost of freight, transportation, labor, those types of things were higher and then the cost to serve our customers. As we came into getting our inventories built at the end of the first quarter and coming into the second quarter, we thought we'd see less of that gallon movement around our distribution network than we actually saw. So there's higher costs related to that. So that's what drove that price-cost dynamic, I thought would be better in our second quarter than it actually was. That's right. And we actually did get on top -- the pricing in our second quarter was better and got on top of all those costs, just not to the expectation we have. That's -- it's directionally accurate, yes. Yes. The Europe and Asia comment not only includes consumer but has an impact on our certain businesses within our Performance Coatings Group as well. So it's a combination of the 2. It's not just consumer in Europe and Asia. Yes. Adrien, I think we -- what we talked about and what John talked about in his opening comments, our leverage ratio ticked up, net debt-to-EBITDA 3.4:1, due to the acquisitions. The acquisitions aren't -- because we only have half a year, because we have amortization and inventory step-up, we're not going to be able to cover the increase in debt, the interest that goes with that. But what we're committed to doing is using excess cash in our second half to pay down debt will offset option dilution with share buybacks. But as you know, that will mean a lot more cash available for us to pay debt down. And I would just highlight our second half net operating cash is going to be slightly different than what we've experienced in the past. As you know, we generate almost 70% of our cash flow in the second half, and it really flips from first half to second half. And you'll see that in our second half this year and maybe even a little more aggressively because we built so much inventory in our first -- had to build in so much inventory in our first half of the year. So you will see a flip in a much stronger second half in cash flow maybe than even you've seen in prior years. Yes. That's primarily due to the new headquarters and R&D projects. We've maintained our core CapEx because you're right, we are absolutely moving forward with our architectural capacity expansion. And we're -- another part of that, that we're moving forward with is the packaging capacity expansions just so we can keep up with the mid-teen compounded average growth rate that we've seen in packaging volumes. So that's going to be a continued investment. And then the final one, as we've talked about labor and labor rates and the challenges around the labor market, is the continued investment in our automation activities within our global supply chain."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me be clear that we are not satisfied with our results in the quarter. Our job is not to just report results but to influence results. We fell short of our expectations this quarter as we continue to operate in a highly inflationary cost environment coupled with ongoing regional challenges impacting demand. Saying that, we continue to see positive trends in much of the business, and we expect to deliver a strong second half of the year. We have confidence in our strategy, we have confidence in our business model, and we have incredible confidence in our people. Let me start by describing how the quarter played out following our June 8 Investor Day event. Pro architectural demand remains strong. Encouragingly, sales have been particularly strong month to date in July, and contractors are reporting strong backlogs, which bodes very well for our second half. The lower demand for DIY that we described continued, and tight alkyd resin supply negatively impacted North America nonpaint categories. Europe has significantly softened further, and there was no meaningful recovery in China post the lifting of the COVID lockdown. This impacted Consumer Brands and portions of Performance Coatings. There was no improvement in raw material costs. While some key feedstocks have come down sequentially, the issue is timing as resins, solvents and other key inputs are taking longer to reflect this trend than anticipated. Additionally, the rest of the cost basket remained highly elevated, including labor, transportation, fuel and other costs.  While the supply chain for raw materials continue to improve, it remains tight and subject to shots. Notably, certain specialty resins crucial to several of our industrial coatings products were in short supply. With the tightness in the supply chain, we continue to have inefficiencies in our operations but have chosen to continue serving our customers, albeit at higher costs.  While the cost and regional pressures we are seeing are real, there is no sense of panic amongst our team, which is deep and experienced. We continue to operate with urgency and great determination, and we're taking the following actions. We've announced and are implementing a 10% price increase in The Americas Group effective September 6. Significant pricing actions are also being taken in our other 2 groups. We remain highly focused on capturing demand and gaining share. We're managing our expenses tightly across all our businesses. These are focused on general and administrative spending rather than growth. Before moving on to our outlook, let me provide some additional color on our second quarter. In The Americas Group, sales growth was strong and volumes were positive in pro architectural market segments. Excluding DIY and Protective & Marine, sales were up 8.7% in North America paint stores. Against very difficult comparisons and as we expected, sales gains for the group were driven by price as total volume was down slightly. The sales growth was led by property management and New Residential, both of which increased by a double-digit percentage. Residential repaint was up high single digits, and commercial was up by a mid-single-digit percentage. DIY was down low single digits. Limited availability of certain resins impacted us in Protective & Marine, which was up by mid-single-digit percentage. We've also begun to see margin recovery in the business as segment margin expanded sequentially. From a products perspective, exterior paint sales grew faster than interior sales with interior being the larger part of the mix. We opened 19 net new stores over the first half of the year and still plan 80 to 100 for the year. We also added sales reps and territories in the quarter, along with ongoing growth investments in management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services. Our Consumer Brands Group had a very difficult quarter. Sales in North America were up by a high single-digit percentage but well below our expectations given a favorable comparison. The slowing demand we cited at our Investor Day did not improve over the remainder of the month, so we experienced tight supply in certain resins, particularly alkyd resins, that significantly impacted our North American nonpaint sales. On a positive note, the Pros Who Paint segment, while small, again grew by a strong double-digit percentage. Sales in China were down by a very high double-digit percentage due to COVID-related lockdowns and a challenging comparison. Europe was also down high double digits due to the slowing macroeconomic environment and a challenging comparison. Pricing was positive in the quarter and in the high single-digit range. Segment margin decreased significantly due to lower sales volume, increased raw material costs and supply chain inefficiencies. In contrast, our Performance Coatings Group had a very nice quarter. Sales were up mid-teens, including mid-teens pricing. Low single-digit sales from acquisitions were more than offset by FX headwinds. Adjusted segment margin improved 80 basis points year-over-year and 200 basis points sequentially, indicative of executed pricing actions.  Regionally, sales increased strong double digits in North America and Latin America against difficult comparisons. Sales in Europe were up low single digits. Sales were backward in Asia, largely related to COVID lockdowns. Nearly every division in the group grew, led by coil and packaging, both of which were up strong double digits against double-digit comparisons. We are clearly gaining share in these businesses. Sales in general industrial and auto refinish increased high single digits against very strong double-digit comparisons. Industrial wood sales decreased low single digits, mainly related to Asia and COVID lockdowns and a slowdown in Europe. Before moving to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $453 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $296 million to purchase 1.1 million shares at an average price of $269.46. We distributed $156.2 million in dividend. We also invested $129 million in our business through capital expenditures, including $89 million in core CapEx and $40 million for Building Our Future projects.  Additionally, the acquisition of Gross & Perthun and Dur-A-Flex closed on July 1. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.4x as we increased short-term borrowings to fund our recent acquisitions. We expect to end the year around 3x and will drive the ratio to our long-term target of 2 to 2.5x range in 2023. We will use cash in the second half of 2022 to manage debt, and share buybacks will be done to offset option dilution. Turning to our outlook. As we've communicated multiple times going back to January of this year, we expected 2022 would be a year of 2 contrasting halves with difficult first half comparisons easing in the back half. We expect to deliver a strong second half with sales up low double digits to mid-teens percentage and diluted earnings per share up by 35% at the midpoint of our guidance. Within The Americas Group, we continue to see extremely strong demand across all of our pro-architectural markets, including New Residential despite higher interest rates with customers reporting strong backlogs that will take them through the end of the year and likely longer. We also see a unique opportunity to win new business as competitors transition their pro contractor business models. Within the Consumer Brands Group, we expect more modest growth as the North American DIY consumer faces inflationary pressures and Europe and China remain challenging. Within Performance Coatings Group, demand remained strongest in North America, our largest region. European demand has slowed in the second quarter, and we do not expect meaningful improvement in the second half of the year. In Asia, the pace of recovery from prior COVID lockdowns in China and prospects for additional lockdowns make it difficult to assess demand trajectory. From an industry supply chain perspective, we're getting the raw materials we need with some exceptions such as alkyd resins, which remain choppy. At the same time, it's not optimal. In our own operations, we expect inefficiencies to continue near term as we've decided to take the necessary steps required to overcome these challenges and ensure that we are serving our customers with product where and when they need it. Exiting this era with our customers will prove beneficial to our shareholders. On the cost side of the equation, we're raising our mid-teens raw material inflation guidance to high teens as expected cost moderation did not materialize in the second quarter and appears to be pushed out a quarter or 2. To be clear, while the timing is not precise, we do expect raw material costs to moderate. We do expect to hold on to our pricing based on the value we deliver and the customer-facing investments we've continued to make, and we do expect margins to expand. There's considerable short-term volatility in the market, and our visibility beyond a quarter or 2 is limited. Our pricing actions remain on track. Additionally, the highest rate of inflation we've seen in 40 years is affecting the other elements of our cost basket, including labor, transportation, fuel and other costs. We're combating these increases with additional selling price increases in all 3 segments in our second half of the year. So specifically for the third quarter of 2022, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a low to mid-teens percentage inclusive of a low double-digit price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a high teen's percentage. We expect Consumer Brands to be up by a low single-digit percentage. And we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a high single to low double-digit percentage. For the full year 2022, we are maintaining our consolidated net sales guidance based on the momentum we're seeing in pro architectural and North American industrial. We continue to expect consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage.  We expect Consumer Brands Group to be down by a low single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low double digits to mid-teens percentage. We are decreasing our earnings guidance for the full year based primarily on the headwinds we described previously. The incremental pricing actions and general and administrative cost reductions I described earlier will not fully offset these headwinds immediately.  We now expect diluted net income per share for 2022 to be in the range of $7.65 to $7.95 per share compared to $6.98 per share earned in 2021. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance includes Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share of $8.50 to $8.80, an increase of 6.1% at the midpoint, over the $8.15 we delivered in 2021.  This implies a second half adjusted diluted net income per share of $4.63 per share at the midpoint, an increase of 35% over the same time last year. In addition, we provided updated guidance on several of our full year data points in our slide deck, including our expectations for FX, CapEx, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. We expect our full year tax rate will remain in the low-20% range. While we continue to operate in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in our strategy. We expect to deliver a strong second half of the year, and more importantly, create shareholder value over the long term through the following actions. We will continue leveraging strong pro architectural volume demand in North America paint stores while investing in future growth with incremental new stores and sales reps.  We will continue implementing appropriate pricing actions across the company to offset persistently higher input costs with a focus on regaining our gross margins back to our long-term target range of 45% to 48%. We'll continue to invest in the Pros Who Paint initiative in Consumer Brands Group and in products and services that customers value in the Performance Coatings Group. We will continue investing in acquisitions that accelerate our long-term strategic plan, add top line growth and expand our operating margins as we've demonstrated recently through the Specialty Polymers, Sika, Gross & Perthun and Dur-A-Flex acquisitions.  We will continue appropriately managing our general and administrative costs while investing in future growth initiatives. We will continue to review our portfolio of businesses, brands and customer programs to ensure they are adding above-market growth and long-term shareholder value. We will maintain our disciplined capital allocation philosophy. We will not hold cash while investing appropriately in CapEx, paying the dividend, targeting acquisitions that accelerate our strategy, and absent M&A, buying back our stock. Our leadership team is experienced. Our 61,000 employees are focused on the task at hand. And we expect to win. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Well, Ghansham, I'd say our confidence in TAG remains as strong as it has always been. If you look at what's happening within those segments, maybe I could just run through them briefly here. If you look at New Residential, our position there is strong and getting stronger.  As a matter of fact, we've been very transparent in sharing that we've had these exclusive relationships with 18 of the top 20 national homebuilders. In fact, we've gotten a few inquiries because of some specific wording in the financial community presentation slide and if we've been able to maintain those relationships. The fact is that we've actually grown them. Proud of our team for hanging on to the 18 of the top 20, but we've actually now grown that to exclusive relationship with the top 23 of the top 25, and we're selling the majority of the remaining 2 in the top 25. So customers in this space are telling us they are confident in the balance of the year.  Demand is strong based on just the simple supply and demand. And so as we work with our national and regional homebuilders, the creativity that they are displaying to ensure that they keep building is high. But market demand here is high. Supply is below the demand space, and we think it's pretty visible to those of us in the industry that there is a strong level of demand. If I look at residential repaint, here is an area where the job itself is growing in size and value. Part of that is a continued positive mix shift into higher-quality products. These higher-quality products help our customers with productivity, with their appearance, touchup, just the whole ease of application. Our customers here, again, are very confident through the balance of the year with demand, and our position here is growing. And I do think that it might be interesting to point out that if you go back to the 2008 period where we -- last we really faced these significant challenges in residential, that was really the catalyst for our residential repaint business that we have now.  So it is a uniquely different position and I think much more favorable position for our company right now. Because if there is a slowdown in New Residential, we have a much stronger residential repaint business now than we did during the last slowdown. So it's an area of focus that we've had strategically to offset any puts and takes in the market. And we think that the stronger position in res repaint that we have now will be a strong position going forward. The other area, if you're following New Residential with concern would be, well, what happens if people are not buying new homes.  Again, we still think there's demand -- strong demand there. But property maintenance would be the other area that we would expect to benefit. And here again, we've spoken about the relationships that we have. In the past, we've talked about the 18 of the top 20 that we have exclusive relationships. We now have exclusive relationships with 21 of the top 25.  In fact, in the top 350, we have solid agreements with 70% of them exclusive relationships with 45%. So at 45% exclusive of the top 350, while we're pleased with that, it still offers a terrific opportunity, and again, room for growth for us. In property management CapEx, our teams would describe that as an area that's off the charts right now. There's considerable amount of investment taking place as well as in the turns, which is very robust and almost acts as a bit of an annuity in the business in many ways. In commercial, I would describe it, Ghansham, as historic backlog. The pipeline here is strong. We're seeing a lot of activity here in tilta, in distribution, data centers and some might even include multifamily in the commercial space as well. We run a good part of our business -- Protective & Marine business, as you know, through our TAG business. This is a business where demand has been strong, particularly in petrochem, water and wastewater, also high -- other value area of infrastructure, as I mentioned, data centers.  Also battery plants is another area. This is an area that we were impacted negatively. We talked in our prepared remarks about the alkyd resins. We felt a lot of pressure here. We could have really sold a lot more product if we could have gotten more of the alkyd resin that was in short supply. But our position here is very good and one that we believe has a tremendous runway ahead of us. Yes. Chris, this is going to be a little bit of a diversion from what you talked about. And let me just highlight that we're probably not going to be talking about '24 yet. So bear with us here. But I do want to mention, and I'll ask Al to get into the details. But I do think -- as maybe as a preface to your question, I think it's important to understand why we have the confidence that the margins improve the way that we're projecting. And I think highlighted is it's specifically focused on our ability to make our customers more successful is through products, is through service, is through our people.  It's the adversity that's in the market right now that we feed on. This is actually when we're at our best in servicing those customers. And I think you can see that right now. As we come through this second quarter -- and while TAG hit the number. It was on the lower end of the sales expectations, the fact is that we probably missed by less than a couple of weeks what we were projecting because we're experiencing that now.  As June went on, sales continued to grow, the momentum continued to increase. In fact, we don't normally show this level of color, but I would tell you that coming out of June with a double-digit gain in nearly every segment. Now as we enter into and finish up July, our average day in TAG right now is averaging high teens, low 20s.  So the momentum that we projected is in fact there, and we believe it's because of the value that we're helping create on the part of our customers to help them to be more successful in what it is that they're doing. They've got a lot of challenges in labor. They've got challenges in projects starting and stopping. And our people, our stores, our products are helping them to do that better than anyone else. And as I mentioned on numerous calls, what we evaluate the most is the research that we do who helps you make more money. And by a wide margin, we have a great distance between us and our competition here on the professional side. Let me let Al walk you through our projections on margins. And let me just top that off with the key driver behind that, we believe and we'll always believe that it's our people. The message on our differentiation here, I think, is probably as strong or stronger, particularly given the environment that we're finding ourselves in. We're going to war with store managers that average 10 years of experience, sales reps that average 12 years, our district managers averaging 22 years, our vice presidents averaging 24 years. So there's a lot of experience that we're leading with. And the fact that we've got this training and the experience that we have allows us a customer engagement. We feel that's a clear differentiation point between us and our competitors. And the fact that we are now able to get back into in-person training as opposed to virtual training and the way we're engaging with our people, we think, is just an outstanding element to our -- what we call our secret weapon, our people.  And our ability to right now attract talent is probably as strong as ever. We have been open about our management training program, which is entering its 40th year. We're recruiting anywhere from 1,400 to 1,500 college graduates. And this high-caliber, talented employee joining our family helps us to do exactly what Al laid out as far as the financials. It's the people that set us apart. Yes. Chris, I'd say that we expect that momentum to continue, I think for all the reasons -- I don't want to be labor the services and everything that we believe we bring and the value creation for our customers. But I'd say that it's a market where people are probably more understanding.  I mean they go to the gas pump and see what's happening. And so our execution on these prices are nothing that we -- we're not arrogant with it. We're determined because we want to keep our organization healthy so that we can help our customers remain healthy. And so the balance is important there. We continue to invest in products and services, innovation, programs that will help our customers on every part of our business. And it's easy to point to the TAG business and might recite that 85% roughly of their cost of goods is labor, and everything that we can do to help make that labor more efficient helps their profitability.  So the cost of the gallon of p is a lower percentage there. And they are in themselves deciding to move up in quality because they see that a higher-priced, high-quality product helps drive their success. But that logic actually carries through to every element of our business.  We're driving our customers' success. That's how we gauge our success. When our customers are successful, then we know that we're going to be a better part of their programs and their success. And that's what we're focused on, and we believe we'll be able to execute on these prices accordingly. Greg, for the company on the back half, architectural gallons, I could give you a little color there. We're expecting low to mid-single-digit gain for the company with TAG up in the high single digits. Right. Yes. Vincent, I think it's that careful line here that we are always cautious in crossing and talking about too much of our customers' business. I will say this, as it relates to our customers' inventory, we made great progress in filling our customers' shelves in the second quarter, and there are still opportunities for additional channel fill.  We're going in full speed to put everything we have behind this. We mentioned specifically some of the key areas of the oil stains, Minwax and Krylon, that have been impacted by the alkyd resins. That's going to impact the ability to fill inventory. But as it relates to our customers and their inventory levels, I think it's only appropriate that, that come from them, not us. Can you repeat that? I'm sorry. Yes. I'd say that it did get worse, and we were expecting some improvement as we went into the holiday 4th of July season. We were expecting more improvement than we saw. And maybe it'd be good if I could -- I think I'm sure there's a lot of questions here regarding this topic. And I want to just make sure that we cover this completely and openly. Again, as Jim opened his prepared remarks, we were disappointed with the way that everything came together. But I would think that it's helpful for everyone if I put it in perspective. 2 of the 3 businesses performed within the range that we expected. And I'm going to jump to CBG in a moment, but I do think that it's worthy of just taking a couple of seconds to talk about the other 2 and then spend a little bit of time on CBG or Consumer Brands. I'll start very quickly with Performance Coatings. A pretty nice quarter. Sales were up mid-teens, expanded margins year-over-year, which reflects our pricing actions taking hold, as Al mentioned. And the cost environment remains a challenge. And again, we're responding with additional pricing actions accordingly. TAG, we talked briefly about here. And as I mentioned, we hit our guidance, albeit at the lower end. Demand here remains very strong. I mentioned very pleased with our sales trends right now, averaging in the high teens to low 20s per day. In this space, DIY is an area that remains softer. And I talked about the Protective & Marine. That remains strong, the demand. And areas -- only areas that we're feeling softness is in our ability to supply mainly in the alkyd resin area. Here again, as Al mentioned, we're putting price in through TAG. But getting to the heart of your question on CBG on our Analyst Day, that business was trending softer. It did further deteriorate as the quarter went on. And the deterioration mainly focused on 4 areas that I briefly talked about in our prepared remarks. The DIY demand was disappointing. You asked about it. We'd like to see a stronger performance there. There was no improvement in China. Al mentioned the COVID lockdowns as they were lifted. We saw virtually no improvement after those lockdowns were lifted. The European deterioration was further and faster as the quarter progressed than we expected.  And as -- again, not to overplay it, but there was virtually no improvement in the alkyd resin availability, and that had a significant impact on our ability to serve areas that are underserved right now, which is the ability to supply our stains and aerosols to the market. And as I mentioned in the other 2, pricing actions in CBG is going to be an important piece as well as we're responding to the cost issues in this business just as we are in TAG and the other businesses. The largest parts of our business, they deliver. We're executing on our strategy going forward. This second half of the year, we're going to drive earnings up by 35% at the midpoint of our guidance. Every business, we believe, has the leadership, the people to do it. Our group presidents are outstanding Justin Binns, our Todd Rea in Consumer Brands, he's carrying a heavy load right now, but he's -- we believe in delivering.  Karl Jorgenrud, who's running our Performance Coatings Group; and our COO, Heidi Petz, each one of them are out there every day driving doing what's right. And while this was a softer quarter than what we expected, and we don't take it lightly, we've got a lot of condition, a lot of determination but mostly confidence in what it is that we're doing. And we're going to deliver it. We've got it. Let me take a run at it, and then I'll have Jim get through some of the metrics on the housing that you mentioned, but it absolutely focuses on share gains. We've got great confidence in this team. I will highlight that the majority of the homebuilders that are out there, even a few that have lowered their numbers, their numbers have been lowered, but there's still an increase over the prior year.  So it may not be as robust as expected initially, but there's still good growth there. And the reason that I highlighted the fact that we're expanding our exclusivity rate, it wasn't upon my chest is to demonstrate exactly the fact that we know that if it's slowing down, we've got to have more customers we're doing business with to offset that demand.  And so we're continuing to push hard in New Residential, in residential repaint and property management. Commercial is very strong. It's -- we've got a great position there, and the momentum is very strong behind that. But our view is that the work that we're doing right now in establishing ourselves with these customers is what's going to pay off. Let me give you a little bit of background on that. So let's just talk in our TAG business. Our outreach effort right now executed by our TAG team is as strong as it's ever been. Our face-to-face call activity was at an all-time high last quarter. We've never made more sales calls in a quarter than we did last year. So it should be no surprise that the number of active accounts in our stores also hit an all-time high. We've never had more active accounts in our stores than we do right now. Second quarter, new account activity is very strong. These are the seeds that we're planting for the future. So clearly, our people are focused on the productivity of our customers, and this is how and when we're at our best. So we're capitalizing on the choppiness in the market by offering this consistent, reliable solution through the very best team that we have.  And we believe that the products, the store managers that I've mentioned, the reps, the services, the innovation that we're bringing, the whole specialty store format, we think, is very unique. And we believe that controlled distribution model allows us to respond to the variables in the market. Whichever way this market tilts, we're going to be there, and we're going to do whatever we have to do with the lead in each of those segments that are benefiting. And we'll gain share in those areas that might experience some softness. Let me turn it over to Jim to walk through his thoughts on the New Residential question that you had. I think if your question is how do we see DIY or what -- would we see DIY driving. Is that... Well, I think, first and foremost, I think it's fair to say that our focus to our stores is the professional painting contractor with 85% of our business focused on the contractor. We're focused on a very isolated DIY customer, those that are -- prefer a specialty store format.  Our outreach there is through various methods of advertising through social media, a few levers that we pull to drive that business. It's a good business for us, but our focus primarily is on the professional side through our stores. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about the DIY through our stores. Through our Consumer Brands, I think the focus there, obviously, is on helping our customers to win. Here, you look at making sure that we have the right product, the right product assortment, ensuring that we have it at the right price.  We participate in helping to drive traffic through activities, including, as I mentioned, brand advertising, the training in the store, as an example, so that we want to help our customers convert shoppers into buyers. The innovation that we're bringing there will help to do that. And the training that we have inside the company and the centers of excellence that we have, we want to share that with all of our customers. There's a great deal of effort right now in the rep activity through this Pro Who Paints initiative. We want to continue to invest in that as well. We believe that, that customer going through a home center is a customer that we have been really not focused on through our own stores.  And those are the customers that kind of balance between DIY and Pro Who Paints. And Pro Who Paints, by definition, in our world is a contractor who's doing remodeling or some element of construction that's also painting at the completion of that project. We're supporting our customers' efforts there as well as various loyalty programs that our customers are initiating. We want to support those initiatives there. So there's a lot that we want to do and to execute with our customers to drive every category in the home center store that ultimately can come back to help drive the paint department as well. So I think Al touched on it just now. I think right now, as the gas prices spiked up, I think many consumers who might choose to do some of those projects might be more influenced by the price of a gallon of paint and other areas of inflation than some consumers that can afford and want to have painters in their homes to do projects.  And so those prices, as they moderate over time, I think will have a more positive impact on the do-it-yourself customer. And those that are now working from home that are in an environment where they're saying, \"Hey, you know what to have a painter come in and freshen up my home is a relatively inexpensive but very impactful -- impact on my environment at home, and it's something that I want to invest in.\" We see the latter. It's a very affordable and impactful project. And as labor increases in costs, it's actually more beneficial to the contractor to use a higher-quality product. And we clearly see that in our products' mix shift. A definite shift in higher-quality products helps the customers' efficiency, productivity, even the opportunity cost. If they have to come back and rework or touch up or whatever it is, they are clearly recognizing that moving up in quality. So it's counter to -- it's a good question, Mike, but it's counterintuitive to what's happening. It's -- people are standing in line the bid list, as I mentioned, throughout the balance of the year. Our contractors are referencing a very full year, and they're moving up in quality. Well, I'll take a swipe at the first piece, and I'll ask Al to talk about the specific impact. But yes, I think many of our contractors would tell you that if they could hire additional labor, they would certainly hire and they frequently are now paying more for that labor than they were in the past. In our stores and even in our distribution centers and plants, we've made some adjustments to ensure that we're in market because, as I mentioned earlier, you don't achieve the retention rates that we have purely on the culture that you have. We have a wonderful culture, but we also know in respect and want to pay our employees a competitive wage in the market. And Al, maybe you can talk a little bit about that. It does seem to be leveling out. But I'd also say we'll take the appropriate steps to ensure that we keep our great people. Well, you're right. It does date back to the OPC fire in Columbus in 2021, and that impacted the entire industry as about 130 million pounds of resins disappeared from the market. The important piece here, Kevin, is that there has also been an additional fire in St. Louis at an all next plant that will clearly be more pressure in the market, something we don't need. And my understanding as of just this morning was that there might have been another one here that -- in the same space that could also have a negative impact. So we're trying to work through that. That's real-time stuff. Since we've come into the boardroom here, I've not heard anything. What I'd say is we've been working hard to make monthly progress towards improvement, but it's likely going to be towards the end of the year before we're out of the woods. The solution here is going to be a combination of the internal utilization of assets. And I would say that the recently acquired SPI resins business, again, has proven its value in many ways. This is one of them. But we'll also utilize external assets through arrangements and agreements there as well. But it is safe to say that our plans, our efforts, we were planning on better supply rates than what we experienced. And we think it's going to be a lot of work by our team to continue to gain ground, but it's going to be in small increments. But we believe that by the end of the year or as we enter into next year, we'll be in a much better situation than we are today. The issue here, I think is -- and again, maybe just speaking openly and transparently, a couple of quarters or a quarter ago, we talked about that we didn't believe that the raw material issues were going to be an issue that we faced. And to the largest degree, it's not. We've built inventory in architectural inventory. We supplied our Consumer Brands customers and a growing rate of inventory. And so to the largest extent, everything we said, we stand behind. That said, we also said that it was going to be very tight and hand to mouth. And in times like this, any shocks or any shortages are far more impactful than they normally would be. There's no WIP. There's no inventory in the system to absorb any shocks or anything. So literally, in some cases, if one of our suppliers has something that goes down for a shift or 2, where in the past, we would never feel that. Now we're dispatching, in some cases, our own tanker trucks to offset those or we're producing -- as Al mentioned, we might produce a batch in one plant and deliberate freight -- from one part of the country to the other to serve our customers. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, all of these are very conscious decisions. We're not out just spending money here. I mean we're trying to drive it to the bottom line. But as I mentioned, we believe with our hearts that coming out of this era of challenges with our customers, many of whom understand completely what it is that we're doing to serve them, will ultimately be in the best interest of our shareholders. And so while in a quarter or 2, we're going to feel this pressure there's a reason why our exclusive relationships, as an example, are increasing because our customers see what we're doing. And we'd like to drive it to the bottom line faster and better, and we will. But some of these challenges and shortages are real, and we're responding real time to them, and we're going to serve our customers. And as I said, we'll come out with our -- with these customers on the backside. Yes. Truman, it's a good observation. I think, if I recall, we lowered our store count at that time to around 60 new stores. And I would say this, that we have confidence in that model, particularly what's happening in the market right now with some of the changes. Some of our competitors choosing to change their model creates terrific opportunities for us. And so you should expect us to continue to leverage that opportunity to the fullest. Might we adjust down a little bit? Maybe. I mean we're going to take a disciplined approach. Right-hand guy here, Al, and while she's not in the room, our COO, Heidi, I mean those are conversations that the 3 of us, along with Justin that runs our stores, have on a regular basis. I think the takeaway I'd like for you to have is that we've seen this movie before. Investing in the face of adversity is something that we've done. We've not done it without discipline. We will invest. And at the rate -- if it drips down a little bit below 80, we might do that, but we see the value long term. We're actually getting continually better at opening new stores. The focus that we've given, Justin in TAG and all his division teams, is to continue to drive that profitability faster so that we can continue to invest and get those stores contributing faster. So I guess the quick answer is, yes, we might in some of those drift down a little bit, but it won't be by much. It's a great point. Our is resi repaint business now is much stronger, much better part of our business than it was at that time. It's a great point, Al. I'd say they were similarly impacted. And we were impacted by all the same issues as you read in the news, everything from inflation to energy costs, certainly the war. Despite that pressure, we believe we're with the right partner there. Our TiO2 program has been very well received, and we'll fight to continue to grow share. But there's clearly some pressure in the market there that we're not immune to. I would say that in our TAG business, it's a relatively small percentage is tied to kind of a major remodel, big ticket. It's -- much more likely, it's going to be either an exterior or interior paint -- repaint. Certainly, we participate in those larger projects, but the largest percentages are painters pulling up -- jumping on the exterior of a home or knocking off the interior for res repaint. Adam, If I may, maybe just -- where we would see more of that kitchen remodel in some of the other areas that you talked about would be through our Pros Who Paint program on the consumer side. The painters that we focus on to our stores would be the guys that are gals that are coming in and focused on painting is the largest percentage. We like to think of our customers as 90-plus percent focused on painting through our stores. No. I think there's more in the area of branding and kind of awareness. I think there will be some promotional supply levels get back into more normalized levels. But with inflationary issues that everyone is facing, it's a pretty disciplined industry because of the percentage of cost of goods and the total cost keeps everyone pretty honest. So it's not likely something that's going to -- the floor is going to fall out, I would suspect. Well, I'd say part of it is the really strong comparisons that we had last year. John, I don't have those on the top of my head. Al, if you can get those, that would be great. But John, I'd say that with what we have seen from a comp standpoint, we knew going into the year that the first half was -- is going to be a challenge. But I'm glad you brought that up because it's part of why we have the confidence that we do not only in the results, the fact that we have more accounts now and more call activity. But I think as Justin mentioned at the analyst event, our ability to focus on this effort and then see the actual results -- there's a lot of people that talk about what they want to do. But the fact that we have this controlled distribution model gives us POS data, gives us -- we have over 3,000 reps, and our store manager call activity is easily logged as well. And so what I'm really proud of is not only can people say, \"Hey, we're going to go do this.\" But we're really seeing the impact in the results and the fact that we have the number of calls taking place and the number of active accounts really points to the level of execution of this wonderful team. Yes. John, you're right in that exterior does ramp up during the season, but interior is by far a much larger percentage of total gallons. But you're right for recognizing that during this time of the year, exterior does ramp up. It is -- interior is a pretty significant load of the gallons. Garik, I would say that it kind of bounced around. We had been working on trying to drive that. We expected a little more positive gallons than we actually saw. And so it was bouncing around without the gain that we had projected. Well, oftentimes, Chuck, what we find are we're making the products that we have the raw materials for. So in our Consumer Brands Group as an example, we have primarily a different resin system than we would in some of our -- most of our TAG business products. So where -- as those raws are becoming available, we're converting those as quickly as possible to what's available. But I'll go back to the point that Al made that and what I tried to highlight earlier on the architectural front. The availability of raw materials now has really diminished. To your point, transportation is an area of concern, and mainly the issue is on rail. If we point to the 2 areas most impacted then by rail, it would be TiO2 and bioresin. And we previously mentioned that we -- we brought on a number of -- I think we've ordered 400 tanker wagons to be able to -- I think maybe we've gotten 200. I think we ordered 400 tank wagons to be able to bridge any gaps. We think that's -- we're uniquely positioned in our industry to be able to do that given the fleet that we have. And so Chuck, we make what we have. We try to get what we need as quickly as possible through our suppliers in the worst-case scenarios. We work with them to send our own tankers to get there, make it as quickly as possible and ship it from whatever plant we can get it to and convert it as quickly as possible. No. Steve, we're in this to win it. And so we're working with Lowe's on the services and fulfillment that will help that targeted customer be more successful. And so I say, Lowe's it's the entire consumer brands initiative is to align the our customers with the needs of their customers. So pricing and those types of things, we don't control that. Our customers would control that. But we're working with them to ensure that they have a complete offering, everything from the power brands that attract customers to the innovation in the can itself. We have reps that are working with their teams to drive their loyalty programs and other initiatives that they have. So yes, I mean, if we can do things to help attract those segments, it's a wonderful win for both of us. Those are customers that we're likely not penetrating through our own stores. They want a broader selection of products that are available in home centers. And we have great partners that we're trying to help to win, and we'll take the steps to do that. I agree. You don't judge the effectiveness of a price increase on the 30-minute discussion you have on we need a price increase. It's -- we have to earn that every day. And so every day, our reps are out there, our store people are delivering the products that we have. Every single day we have to go right back to the point I made earlier, which is do we help you make more money? And if the answer is no to that, then we don't deserve it. But we're working really hard to make sure that we do obviously. And I think the fact that we're seeing the metrics and the activity that we are experiencing, we think that bodes well for our efforts. It's -- there's no complacency here, though. We want to get better every day and, and we feel as though the activities that we are taking as well as the environment in which we're in will support the increase that we need."

And thank you for joining The Sherwin-Williams Company\u2019s review of the First Quarter 2021 Results and our outlook for the Second Quarter and Full Year of 2022. With us on today\u2019s call are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; Al Mistysyn, CFO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com.

After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered first quarter results in line with our expectations in an environment characterized by strong demand, ongoing cost inflation and choppy raw material availability, which began improving meaningfully in the final weeks of the quarter. Sales in the quarter grew by a high single-digit percentage against a double-digit comparison a year ago, and we delivered sequential improvement and consolidated gross margin and segment margins in all of our businesses. Our margins remained under pressure on a year-over-year basis, a significant pricing actions previously announced in all businesses have not yet fully caught up to highly elevated raw material costs near-term. This remains an area of volatility. Our team is operating with confidence and momentum, as we begin to enter the painting season. Our strategy is clear and we remain focused on delivering solutions that help our customers succeed. Let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers before turning to John Morikis, who will provide some additional commentary on the quarter and our outlook. Comparisons in my comments are to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Starting with the topline, first quarter 2022 consolidated sales increased 7.4% to $5 billion. Pricing was in the low double-digit range. Volume was lower in the Consumer Brands Group and The Americas Group, primarily due to challenging prior year comparisons, along with anticipated raw material availability challenges, which are largely behind us now. Consolidated gross margin decreased to 41.1%, driven by lower sales volume, primarily due to raw material availability issues and cost inflation outpacing our price increases near-term. Our gross margin improved each month during the quarter and compared to last year. On a sequential basis, gross margin improved by 160 basis points, due primarily to additional pricing actions taken in the first quarter. SG&A expense decreased to 28.2% of sales. Our SG&A expense was 2.3% below fourth quarter 2021 and on a sequential basis was 200 basis points better. Consolidated profit before tax decreased 9.4% to $461.1 million. Sequentially, profit before tax improved by $152.2 million, or 49.3%. The quarter included $70 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense, compared to $75.6 million a year ago. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $1.41 per share versus $1.51 per share a year ago. Excluding acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense and the Wattyl divestiture first quarter adjusted diluted net income per share was $1.61 per share versus $2.06 per share a year ago. On a sequential basis, adjusted diluted net income per share increased 20.1%. EBITDA in the quarter was $693 million or 13.9% of sales. Moving on to our operating segments, sales in The Americas Group increased 5.6% against a high single-digit comparison, as low double-digit pricing offset lower volume related to challenging comparisons into raw material availability, which improved significantly over the last few weeks of the quarter and has continued to improve as we enter the second quarter. DIY volume was impacted the most, as we prioritize serving the professional contractors, which make up the largest part of our business. Segment margin decreased to 16.8%, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases and good cost control. Segment margin improved 170 basis points sequentially. Sales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 10.1%, due primarily to lower sales outside of North America and an impact of 6 percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. This was in comparison to an extremely strong quarter a year ago, where sales were up 25%. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 12.1% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, and supply chain inefficiencies, partially offset by selling price increases. Segment margin improved 580 basis points sequentially. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 20.4%, against a double-digit comparison and were driven by volume and price increases. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 11.8% of sales, as operating leverage from the higher volume, selling price increases and good cost control were more than offset by higher raw material costs, where inflation was the highest among the company\u2019s three operating segments. Adjusted segment margin improved 290 basis points sequentially. Let me now turn the call over to John for some additional commentary on the first quarter along with our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2022. John?\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone listening. Before getting into some color on our three segments, I\u2019d like to frame today\u2019s call with some themes we are seeing across the business. First, demand remains very strong across most of the business. Our teams are highly engaged and focused on growing volume through new accounts and share of wallet, as well as reactivating customers that may have shopped elsewhere to meet the needs of a specific project over the past year due to product availability challenges. Second, raw material availability improved meaningfully late in the quarter and this has continued into the second quarter. We do not expect lack of raw materials to have a material impact on sales going forward. To be clear, the supply chain has not completely recovered, as the bottleneck has now largely moved from suppliers\u2019 production to their transportation and logistics. In the near-term, we are speeding this recovery by employing our own fleet and tank wagons to supplement suppliers\u2019 delivery capabilities. Our ability in this area is unique among our competitors. We are also focusing on SKU prioritization and formulations to make the most of the raw materials that are available to us. Additionally, the Specialty Polymers acquisition is meaningfully contributing to our resin needs. Third, inventory in our stores and distribution centers is in a markedly better place than it was at the end of December. The 50 million gallons of incremental architectural capacity we brought on in the fourth quarter is up and running. As the supply of raw materials improves, we are quickly converting those materials to paint. In fact, we made more architectural paint gallons in March than in any previous month in our company\u2019s history. We expect to run this additional capacity at a high rate to keep up with demand through the painting season and then begin building inventory in our fourth quarter as we typically would. And looking to the future, we announced a $300 million investment to begin expanding production and distribution at our Statesville, North Carolina architectural facility that serves both TAG and CBG, which will be completed in 2024. Finally, inflation remains significant and is trending toward the high end of the guidance we previously provided. In addition to raw materials, we have seen increases in other elements of the cost basket including freight, energy and labor. As we have said in the past, our continuous improvement efforts are focused on offsetting these increased costs. Additionally, we have been aggressive with pricing actions in all of our businesses to offset these costs and we will continue to do so as necessary. As far as our first quarter, I will keep my comments brief in order to get to our outlook. The Americans Group, sales growth in the first quarter was led by Protective and Marine and Property Management, both of which were up by a double-digit percentage. New residential, residential repaint and commercial were up by a mid single-digit percentage. DIY was down double digits, as we faced a strong double-digit comparison and prioritize sales to professional contractors. We have also begun to see margin recovery in the business as segment margin expanded sequentially. From a product perspective, exterior paint sales performed better than interior sales, with interior being the larger part of the mix. We realized a low double-digit increase in price in the first quarter, with volume remaining under pressure. The 12% price increase we announced February 1st is going in as planned. We opened for net new stores in the first quarter and still plan 80 to 100 for the year. We also continued our growth investments and sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, ecommerce and productivity enhancing services. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. While this business faced a very challenging comparison, we are encouraged by our sales in North America, which were nearly flat as we continue to focus on supporting key strategic retail partners and growing our pros who paint initiative. Sales were softer in Europe and China, as we faced double-digit comparisons and COVID-related lockdowns. Note that we have now anniversary the Wattyl divestiture, which was a drag on Group sales of about 6 percentage points in the quarter. Pricing was positive in the quarter and in the high single-digit range. Segment margin expanded significantly on a sequential basis benefiting from increased volume, leverage on SG&A and incremental pricing. Last let me comment on first quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. Group sales increased by 20.4% in the quarter, including high single-digit volume growth against a double-digit comparison. Price realization was in the low teens range, and all regions and all divisions generated growth. As in the other groups, we saw meaningful sequential margin improvement during the quarter. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in North America, followed by Latin America, Asia and Europe. Every division in the Group grew, with nearly all by double digits, driven by robust underlying demand, new customer wins, share of wallet gains and pricing. Packaging was strongest, followed by coil, general industrial, auto refinish and industrial wood, respectively. Before moving to our outlets, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $558 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $407 million to purchase 1.45 million shares at an average price of $280.77. We distributed $150.9 million in dividends. We also invested $106.3 million in our business through capital expenditures, including $77 million in core CapEx and $29 million for our building our futures project. Additionally, the acquisition of Sika European Industrial Coatings business closed on April 1. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBIT ratio of 3.3 times, as we increased short-term borrowing to fund our share repurchases and the Sika acquisition. We expect to be closer to the high end of our 2 times to 2.5 times range by the end of the year. Turning to our outlook, as I referenced earlier, we continue to see very strong demand in North America, Pro architectural end markets, though we are facing a comparison to a strong double-digit growth quarter that was driven by very robust post-pandemic recovery. Comparisons will ease in the back half of the year. Rising mortgage rates have not made an appreciable dent in the demand for our new residential customers to this point. Should the residential demand slow, we remain extremely well-positioned in multiple architectural segments, including residential repaint and property management, which have proven to be more defensive in nature. We expect industrial demand will remain strong as the year progresses based on the outlook our customers have shared with us. Comparisons will be challenging over the remainder of the year. Demand remains strongest in North America, our largest region. European demand also remains strong, although we continue to closely monitor for potential impacts from the war in Ukraine. For the record, our sales in Russia and Belarus are well below 1% of the total company sales and we are suspending operations in these regions. In Asia and in China particular, demand has been dampened near-term by the latest COVID-19 wave. On the architectural and industrial sides, we will continue to leverage our strengths in innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution, as we expect to grow at a rate that outpaces the market. From a supply chain perspective, we believe we are through the most challenging aspects. As I described in my earlier comments, we expect this to continue improving and to have a minimal impact on sales going forward. On the cost side of the equation, we are maintaining our low double-digit to mid-teens raw material inflation guidance. Though, we are trending toward the high end of the range, driven primarily by Performance Coatings Group. There is considerable short-term volatility in the market and our visibility beyond the quarter or two is limited. We do expect the level of year-over-year inflation to remain elevated, but to moderate in the back half of the year. Our pricing actions remain on track and we are prepared for additional increases if necessary. For the second quarter of 2022, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage compared to the second quarter of 2021, inclusive of a low double-digit price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect Consumer Brands to be up by the high-teens to a low 20 percentage. And we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage. Our full year guidance is heavily second half weighted due to stronger volume, the impact of pricing actions and weaker second half 2021 comparisons. I will remind you we began 2021 with great momentum, including first half sales growth of 14.7% and adjusted EPS growth of 26.6%, before the natural disasters, supply chain and COVID issues derail the second half of the year. For the full year 2022, our guidance remains unchanged. We expect consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect The Americas group to be up a mid-to-high single-digit percentage, with North American paint stores at or above the high end of the range. We expect Consumer Brands Group to be up a low-to-mid single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a high single to low double-digit percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2022 to be in the range of $8.40 per share to $8.80 per share, compared to $6.98 per share, earn in 2021. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share $9.25 and $9.65, an increase of 16% at the midpoint over the $8.15 we delivered in 2021. The additional data points we provided last quarter on full year currency exchange, tax rate, CapEx, interest expense, depreciation and amortization are unchanged. As we enter the heart of the painting season, we remain confident our strategy, our capabilities, and the differentiated product and service solutions we bring to customers. The 61,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams are focused on the tasks at hand and there is no better team in the industry. Our business remains extremely well-positioned and we are emerging as an even stronger Sherwin-Williams following the challenges we faced the last two years. I am excited by the momentum we are gaining as we progress towards what we expect will be a very strong second half of the year. In addition to today\u2019s call, I will remind you, we will provide additional commentary on the market and our business at our upcoming Financial Community Presentation event scheduled for Wednesday, June 8th in New York City. Details are available on our website and we are very much looking forward to seeing many of you in person. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am wondering if you could just talk about your volume possibilities in TAG in the second quarter. If I sort of back out the price we think you are going to get in the second quarter to sort of imply some volume. I am just wondering how much better you might be able to do versus that and if you are concerned that maybe just I know you had big volume production in March. But is there any limit at all for the amount of volume you could flow through the stores in the second quarter?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. Vincent, maybe the way I will go out this is, just to take a quick run through the different segments and give you a little bit of color on the demand, because I think that speaks to what you are asking here. So let me start with raspberry paint and tell you that our customers are experiencing really strong backlogs. There\u2019s a positive mix shift in quality that\u2019s also taking place and we believe that plays really well to our advantage. So when you talk about volume, our ability to grow our volume faster than market also includes the ability to drive greater productivity through for our contractors is this quality that we are providing them helps to provide the finished product that a more experienced painter applicator might be able to apply and so we are helping them do that with through product. If you look at this area, you would clearly see home appreciation driving demand. LIRA their forecasting for the growth in 2022 is in double digits. If you look at the NHAB -- NAHB Remodeling Index is strong well above 50. And existing home sales have slowed year-over-year against a very strong comp in lack of inventory, but overall it\u2019s a very strong market for us. So we expect to continue to see a good strong demand market in residential repaint our contractors are telling us. I mentioned many of them are looking through the end of the year with a pretty solid backlog of projects and we are going to grow with those customers. But this is an area that we absolutely expect to continue to grow our market share pretty aggressive rate. Property Maintenance is -- really underlying demand is solid here as well. There\u2019s been delayed maintenance that\u2019s now being addressed and we see improved areas and apartment turns along with the return to travel, office, even school that\u2019s driving demand. And I\u2019d say, in this area as well there\u2019s an increased awareness of the need to keep these assets fresh, current and clean, and as you know, paint is inexpensive, yet impactful solution in this area. Commercial, I would say, the underlying demand here is also solid. Projects are resuming albeit at varying paces, but the starts are positive. Customers are reporting labor constraints and material shortages on these projects are acting as governors of growth. So any aspect of this project that could be anything from drywall to roofing project -- products, anything could have an impact here that\u2019s could be significant. Dodge Momentum Index here is strong, as is the Architectural Building Index, which has been positive for straight months, and as you know, that tracks the current building by architects, which generally leads to the commercial construction spending nine months to 12 months out. And the other area, obviously, that we are really focused on is new residential, we got a great position here and growing by the way, starts and permits remain strong year-over-year with multifamily stronger than single, but both really terrific markets for us. Completions are softer due to material availability here, in some cases, labor as well. We have not seen a meaningful slowdown, as I mentioned earlier from rising mortgage rates, which are still low in comparison to other periods. In this area, we have gotten a lot of questions about throughout the quarter and I thought I\u2019d just highlight one area, this article by USA today that I think captures kind of the sentiment that we have in new residential. They talked about the housing unit shortfall ranging between 5.5 million and 6.8 million, despite an annual average of 1.5 million new housing units completed and a 1.7 million spike in 2020 alone, a new construction would need to accelerate to a pace that\u2019s well above this current trend to more than 2 million housing units per year to close this gap. Even if building were to continue at the current level, the most rapid pace in more than a decade, it still take more than 20 years to close the 5.5 million unit gap. So as I mentioned, we have got a strong position here. We are determined to get stronger here. And I will tell you that, regardless of what happens in these professional areas, way that we have been driving this company for years now with our strategy development and strategy deployment is to be in position to capitalize on it whichever way it tilts. So if any one of these areas should for some reason slow down, we have worked really hard to position ourselves to be able to capitalize on whichever way the market might shift to and we believe that we would be able to capitalize on it. I am going to touch on one more area then I am going to ask Al to talk on the volume a little bit further as DIY. We did talk about the fact that DIY behaved as we expected. As demand continued to return to more normal level and this was against, as I mentioned earlier, difficult comp. But we also prioritized our professional contractors and our key strategic customers in our Consumer Brands business that impacted this DIY business.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. As I -- just as a level set on our January call, we talked about our expectation for the first half architectural volume, which includes Consumer and TAG to be flat to down low-single digits primarily because of the difficult comps that John talked about. In our second quarter with our TAG sales projected be up high low, high single to low-double digits with price up low-double digits and volume flat to down slightly. That\u2019s a sequential improvement for the first quarter. So we talked about the first quarter being down mid-single, flat to down slightly in the second quarter. That leads you to the momentum on an easier comp in the second half. We talked about the full year TAG sales of mid-to-high single digits with North America paint stores at or above the high end of that range. When you look at price low-double digit in our first half, as you analyze the price increases we took in in the second half of last year, our price in the second half will trend for the year to be at mid-to-high which gets you a low-to-mid single-digit volume growth in TAG and North America paint stores and I fully expect that to be the case.\nVincent Andrews: Thanks so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Vincent.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Can you comment on the effects of raw material shortages on volumes in the first quarter? And can you talk about your volumes in the first quarter in residential repaint and new residential, commercial, what was the business like excluding the volume contraction in DIY?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Jeff, on raw material availability, what I would say is, we talked about on our year end call that we thought it might be a low single-digit to mid headwind. The way the quarter rolled out with availability, we saw some choppiness in January, improved in February. As John talked about, it was significantly better into March and into -- and it continues to improve in April. And in the data points that I have to show that, as John talked about, March was a single largest architectural production volume on -- in the history of the company. We significantly improved architectural gallons from December year end through the end of March. It\u2019s not our historic levels, but it is a significant improvement 20 plus million gallon increase. So, I think, to pinpoint exactly how much availability had on the quarter, it\u2019s really tough, because I look at how much of that would have been in sales versus how much we could have put in inventory. The fact is, the availability behind us, we have a lot of confidence to fill our 50 million gallons of additional capacity, along with the help of SPI. And the other data point I would highlight is, our expectation for architectural inventory through our seasonally highest second quarter and third quarter sales quarters to be flattish from the first quarter. As you know, Jeff, historically, our inventory would decline through the summer quarters, because you can\u2019t keep up with the volume. Because of the capacity we put in, we are going to be able to keep up with the sales volumes and increased buying inventory in our fourth quarter similar -- getting back similar to where we were back in 2019 and significantly higher than the last two years.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. The only thing I would add to those great responses. I think the trend of manufacturing will continue to your point all the way through till probably this time next year, we will run our assets hard to build that inventory back up. And maybe clarifying point that I think is important is that to your question about volume on each of those segments, Jeff, I don\u2019t need to break them all down, because they were all very similar. They all improved as the quarter improved, quarter went on.\nJeff Zekauskas: Were they higher for the quarter or lower?\nJohn Morikis: Year-over-year they were lower?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Jeff, they would be lower, primarily because of the more difficult comps that we had. Whereas repaint was up -- raspberry paint, new res, DIY roll up strong double digits and new res and commercial were up as well. So tougher comp in our first quarter.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. And for my second question, the -- are you done with price increases in The Americas Group, you have commented in your slides that you have more pricing actions to go in Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings. But I didn\u2019t see that in America. So are we done in Americas for this year?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Jeff, I wouldn\u2019t say we are done. I would say, when we look at the visibility and the volatility we have in the market around, not just raw materials, but other input costs. That visibility is out one quarter at best. I think what you will see us do is like we have in the past. We will monitor those input costs very closely and if we see a meaningful or if we see a meaningful change in them, we are prepared and discipline to go out with additional price. Similar to what we did last year, we went out August 1st 8% and we went out in September with a surcharge. So we have to monitor these situations closely and really react to what we anticipate.\nJeff Zekauskas: Great. Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is live.\nJosh Spector: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just on the consumer side, I mean, kind of goes to some of your prior points on The Americas Group. Just wondering how much of the 20% growth would you say as volume refill versus pricing moving up from the high single-digit level?\nJohn Morikis: The -- if I look at the -- you say the 20% growth in our first quarter. Josh, are you talking about our second\u2026\nJosh Spector: Sorry. In your second quarter guide?\nJohn Morikis: Sorry. Thank you. When you look at high-teens, low 20%, expect price to be up a similar amount. As TAG, we have significantly easier comps, which was down strong double-digit. I think when you look at our inventory build. We had an inventory built in the first quarter through our strategic partners. As you would expect, we were in a similar situation that we talked about as the third quarter and fourth quarter went on, we drove our inventories down across the chain, both the TAG, Consumer and our retail partner. So we did have to build some inventory at store level with these partners. But really the -- we did have a weak comp, we expect North America to be strong, we do expect with Asia and Europe to be softer in our second quarter. That\u2019s about 15% of our sales and pretty strong comps outside the U.S. and Europe and Asia. So, I don\u2019t have an exact number to say, how much was building versus sell-through, but rest assured, we had to build inventory in our first quarter in our retail partners.\nJosh Spector: Thanks. And I guess just as a follow up, are you seeing any change in the Consumer channel or -- and the DIY channel, either your own stores or in your Consumer Brands group? I guess as pricing goes up, is there any trade down or any things generally pretty stable?\nJohn Morikis: No. I\u2019d say they are pretty stable. I\u2019d say in -- as it relates to the Consumer side of our stores and in our Consumer Brands customers. I\u2019d say in our Professional side, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing more of a positive mix shift moving into higher quality rather than shift down.\nJosh Spector: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Again, that\u2019s driven mainly off of labor and the design of the painting contractor has to be as productive as they can, so they can attack the backlog that they are facing. Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Parkinson from Mizuho. Your line is live.\nChris Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. So you had a little on the raw material shortages? Can you hit on your own, as well as probably the industry\u2019s efforts to further backward integrate into certain resins and also some additives? Just where do we stand with that and when should the investment community see the effects from those efforts? Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Well, importantly, our customers are starting to see the effects as we purchased this SPI with the idea of really trying to leverage that asset, Chris, I think, it\u2019s doing that and it\u2019s only going to get better for us. I don\u2019t think you should expect us to continue further upstream. We believe -- we have always had a resin strategy and we have always manufactured resin. SPI was a top producer for us, terrific people, terrific assets and an opportunity to get in there and get the most out of that that set of assets. It also, as you mentioned, as we mentioned, when we announced this, it helped us to deleverage, if you will, a little bit of the dependence on the Gulf Coast, these manufacturing facilities are on Each Coast and to get a little bit away from some of the hurricane risk that, while they are on the coast or inland and terrific assets. We are already starting to see more productivity out of these assets. We expect that to continue. There will be some investments in there, but very reasonable with great return. We don\u2019t expect us to get into the additives, TiO2 business, that\u2019s not where we belong.\nChris Parkinson: Got it. There\u2019s also been a lot of chatter just in the investment community, at least in the past quarter to just regarding market share shifts, potential market share shifts, in some part due to finish product shortages. Now that you have the opportunity to speak to all of us, what\u2019s your public response to those debates and what confidence level can you convey to us regarding your ability to maintain or likely build market share, once everything normalizes in the supply chain? Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. Chris, I appreciate that question, and I\u2019d tell you that, our confidence level is very high. We can always speak to our strategy. And I will tell you that we are blessed with a control distribution model that serves us well. And we leverage this model, and that includes a strong and very consistent brand strategy. We think that branding strategy and the consistency of it is equally important. We have an innovation program designed to develop segments specific product. So because we have a control model, we are able to talk to each of these segments to understand what are the needs of these customers, what are the challenges and we develop probably products that are specific for these segments. And we do the same with our services, so that we have a very good understanding of what the needs are of these painting contractors and we build the services to help them make more money. And finally, the reason I have probably the most confidence is our people. I believe we have the best people in the industry and I am not apologetic about making that claim. We hire around 1,400 to 1,500 college graduates a year to enter our Management Trainee Program and we recruit outstanding talent. We train and develop this talent and we retain this talent. These are the people that serve our customers. And for nearly 40 years, we have been investing in this program. This training program is 40 years old. We now have thousands of graduates from our Management Training Program throughout the company. In just our TAG business, as an example, four of our five division Presidents were management trainees, our Group President was a trainee and throughout the company, we have over 26 Vice Presidents that were management trainees. And by the way, one CEO that was a training. We think this is important. Our customers, they are buying more than a gallon of paint, that -- we tell our people constantly that, companies don\u2019t compete, people do. 70% of our field leaders are graduates of our Management Training Program and they provide the leadership and direction to our tenured organization, they know what to do, they know how to win. And I say tenure, because over 7,000 of our employees are -- have greater than 20 years service. That\u2019s nearly 15% of our workforce has 20 years or more of paint experience. And these leaders created an environment where people win and they want to stay. One half of our rep force has over 10 years of service. Turnover of our customer facing reps and managers is still in single digits. In this environment still in single digits, we are hanging out of the most important assets we have and that\u2019s our people. Our people wake up every day, they focus on two things, paint and making painting contractor successful. So this specialty store format, it works for painting contractors. We have always talked about avoiding complacency in our company. In fact, we often say that complacency kills. We are working to get better every day. We were working to make our painting contractors better every day. But I will say this, I do believe this will come down to our people versus others. We have a 40-year head start, a lot of drive, a lot of determination. We are not going to win by a little bit. I am looking forward to competing against any model.\nChris Parkinson: Great color. Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is live.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess just going back to your earnings guidance through iteration for 2022. The macroeconomic backdrop seems a bit less certain, especially in Europe and China, along with any potential supply disruptions in these regions as well. Now understanding that you have a wide earnings range still for the year, what would you call it as sort of incremental positives relative to initial view that are offsets to some of the risks on the global macro? Is it as simple as just better raw material access visibility or what else would you have to think about?\nJohn Morikis: Well, I\u2019d say first, we just talked a lot about people. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a third advantage. But I\u2019d also say that if you look at the assets, we have talked about that we have deployed, the responsiveness that we have. And I will say this, our Chief Procurement Officer, Colin Davie and his team are working really well with our customers and I have learned to appreciate the demonstration of rewarding suppliers who have stepped up to serve us and the suppliers have been creative in responding to our needs. The assurance of supply to your point continues to be an important element in this market and once you have that supply, I think, we demonstrated in the month of March, we had a record month in the company\u2019s history of producing product. And so, what I\u2019d say is that, it\u2019s not one thing. It\u2019s the entire ecosystem. It\u2019s everything we are doing. Everything that we bring and it\u2019s all focused and starts with one thing, the customer. So we are looking through that lens we are working back and this large 156-year-old company is learning to be nimble and quick and respond. And so I\u2019d say that, if I am looking at it from the outside in, I am looking at a lot of assets that are really positioned well to be able to respond to a high demand market.\nAl Mistysyn: Ghansham, I would just add to that. You look at our sequential gross margin and operating segment improvement -- sequential improvement across each of the operating segments and all the hard work that those teams have done. Ad I will highlight one in particular, Performance Coatings Group that took the really the brunt of the raw material increases in the second half have been out with price on multiple occasions. You look at our first quarter operating -- adjusted operating margin about flat year-over-year. And if you recall, the increase -- significant increases we took for raw materials for that segment were primarily in the second half. So that team has done just an absolutely terrific job getting price, holding price and its showing and we are going to see that continued improvement in our gross margin in the second quarter. We expect to see sequential improvement in our gross margin and across each of the operating segments, albeit Consumer from a historic low operating margin and adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter, but the pricing actions, the volume and all the continuous improvement efforts across each of the segments that are helping to drive our bottomline faster than our topline. So that\u2019s what gives me confidence that we are going to continue to see improvements as the year goes on.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. Thanks for that. And then if we have just switched to Performance Coatings, several businesses in their packaging, coil, et cetera, have had a very, very good run volumetrically. There\u2019s lots of evidence of kind of mean reversion of consumer habits that have occurred post-COVID as mobility sort of normalizes. So as you kind of think about these various individual businesses within PCG, how do you expect the volume trend line to unfold over the next few quarters?\nJohn Morikis: Well, we are really excited to your point. We have got a lot of momentum in these businesses and there\u2019s no expectation for less if that\u2019s the question. We sit in this room, this boardroom and we talk with our teams regularly about the competence that we have. And maybe I could walk through quickly, if you would like each of these segments, just to give you a little bit of color, because there is a lot of strength, but boy, there\u2019s so much opportunity. If you look at our packaging, we had a strong double-digit growth in the quarter. In fact, each of the last three quarters we have had record quarters in this business, packaging sales, with sales of around 30% per quarter for the last three. So if you look at this business, the demand is very robust and food and beverage, our non-BPA coatings continues to gain traction. Both we and our customers are investing in capacity expansions in anticipation of a strong demand year here in 2022 and beyond. So we are thrilled about that business. The differentiation that we have in the technology and the people we have, it is just phenomenal. This is a nugget that came obviously with the Valspar acquisition as this coil. We had a double-digit growth quarter in coil. That\u2019s the fourth straight quarter we have had sales of double-digit growth here and double-digit in every region, led here by extrusion and metal buildings. So we are excited about this business going forward. Our general industrial, again double-digit growth in the first quarter. That\u2019s the fifth straight quarter with double-digit growth in GI. Every region was positive led by North America and our LatAm business, transportation and general finishing were strongest here. Our auto refinish had double-digit growth. Miles driven here are below, but nearing pre-pandemic levels and continue to leveraging our technology as a key here. We brought in some wonderful technology from Valspar that works terrifically with our Sherwin tech technology and we are growing share here pretty aggressively. And in industrial wood, we had a high single-digit quarter. We have got very good momentum here, furniture, kitchen cabinetry, cabinetry and flooring, which obviously correlate to similar positive trends in new res construction. So we saw increases in all end markets, most by double digits and clearly really pleased with packaging and coil, but all of them were strong and by region, North America, our largest region grew the fastest and LatAm, Asia and Europe right behind. So expectations of this team remain really strong. We got a terrific leader here as well. Karl Jorgenrud came to us from Valspar. Got a lot of division presidents beneath Karl that are really experienced as well. We talk a lot about our TAG organization and the retention of people and the importance of that in TAG. But the same stands true in PCG. Our average division presidents average 29 years between Sherwin-Williams and Valspar. And again, when you look back, we talked openly about this greatest infusion of talent, when Valspar and Sherwin came together and we have been terrific in the retention of those people. Our turnover still and this is years after the integration is below 7%. And so, on the architectural side, I think if you look at the legacy Sherwin and the talent we had on the architectural side, we are pretty -- we like to think we are pretty strong, always could get better. They brought, obviously, some talent came in from the architectural side of Valspar. In fact, our new Chief Operating Officer came through the architectural side of Valspar. But when I look at the PCG side and the benefits we have had on the talent that\u2019s come in from Valspar and our ability to retain it, yeah, it gives us terrific confidence going forward. So fundamentals, we have got great assets. We have got great technology. We have got great people. And we have great customers and we are going to leverage that for everything we get.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Ghansham.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nGreg Melich: Hi. Thanks. I want to follow-up a little more detail on the gross margin progression in the quarter. I think you mentioned that gross margins were down year-over-year, more due to volume than the gross price. Could you give us the number on that and do you think that continues that mix of gross margin pressure in the second quarter?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Greg, it -- the volume, as you know, and what we have always talked about is the single biggest driver of not just gross margin but operating margin and that clearly is a higher impact. If you look at year-over-year in our -- if you look at price cost in our first quarter, we are still chasing a little bit. I think we get on top of that as we get towards the end of the second quarter. So it will be less of a drag. And also in our second quarter, you see a seasonal increase in our architectural volume as you normally would. That\u2019s going to help drive our gross margin, it is going to help drive our operating margin, and Greg, it\u2019s still tough comps against TAGs, but you look at the volume down mid-single digits, it\u2019s a significant drag in our first quarter. And to be down flat to down slightly in our second quarter is going to be a positive mix shift as well in our second quarter that\u2019s going to help grow the margin.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And when we look at the back half, if price is on top of raws by the end of the second quarter, for the back half, do we need another round of pricing to stay on top of the costs, given what we have seen year-to-date with, I guess, raws at the higher end of the range?\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Greg, I think, what you -- what we are looking at is more on the industrial side right now. I think when we talk about the basket moving to the high end of the range. It\u2019s more on industrial. As you know, industrial price increases aren\u2019t as uniform. So there may be -- I talked about on our year end call, some in the first quarter, some that roll into the second quarter. I think the timing of those are pretty much the same. It\u2019s just the -- that the amount or the percent increase that may have had to get adjusted. But like we talked about earlier, I think, our visibility is one quarter out at best, a lot of volatility and we will continue to monitor that, based on the last year and a half, I am not going to say, we don\u2019t need more, we are just going to have to monitor it and go out and react accordingly.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. What we will say is that if we need to, we will. It\u2019s not a hesitation.\nGreg Melich: And maybe, John, just a follow-up on that, given the volume shortfalls, especially in the back half last year, are you a little more resident to hike prices again within a quarter. I am just thinking in the past, I think, you have waited about four months, now as you are trying to rebuild that volume and share. Do you think, obviously, you will get the pricing, but is there a tendency to want to wait an extra month or two just to be sure?\nJohn Morikis: I think we have, you are right, Greg. Good for you, because I know you know our company well, we have done that. And I think what\u2019s different now is that we are a little bit further into the volatility portion of this cycle and we have been communicating to our customers with greater clarity about the volatility. So I don\u2019t know that we need to wait as we have had in the past, because we have been communicating to the customers, that our intent is to try to keep the price increase to a minimum. But with that, we are not building a buffer to be able to absorb the volatility and if there is more volatility, then we will need to be out quicker with additional price. So, I think, we would be moving quicker, and to your point, it\u2019s nothing we would prefer to do or enjoy doing. We have yet to get a thank you note from any of our customers for it. But if the need be, we are going to do it, we will do it quickly.\nGreg Melich: Great. Thanks and good luck.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO. Your line is live.\nJohn McNulty: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. You had mentioned early in the call that you were using your own fleet and the flexibility that you have with that to help your customers from a logistics perspective. Can you help us to understand, one, is that something you actually incrementally charge or is it just kind of part of the service that your customers are appreciative of? And I guess, on top of that, how should we think about -- if it is just more of a, hey, it\u2019s part of our service, then how should we think about the cost of that and how that might decline once the -- all the big logistic issues kind of get put in the rearview mirror for us all?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. John, let me first go back to your question and the comment that we made earlier. What we were speaking to specifically there was suppliers not customers. And we do work with our suppliers, mainly to bridge gaps to ensure that we have the product when we need it, where we need it. It\u2019s not our intent to do their jobs, but we are in this together with them, trying to work with them, and as you would expect, when that happens, there\u2019s a discussion about what it cost that goes along with the fact that we are going to do that. So right now and you know our company, our focus is on taking care of the customer and the fact that we have got our fleet and it is a point of differentiation. We do leverage those and there are times when we are less efficient doing that. For example, one of our largest customers on the Consumer Brand side was very adamant about a South to North recovery approach that was a little less efficient than we would have liked to have seen, but important to our customers. And so we took that undertaking and served our customers in a way that allowed us to respond to their needs, not what -- not which was most or least expensive to us and that\u2019s our DNA. And so, if it\u2019s to use our fleet of trucks to help in the pinch to be able to get raw materials to a plant, or in some cases, right now, we are producing where we can get the raw materials and we are shipping it in some cases across the country to ensure that we have supply where we need it and if we were less efficient than what we would like and we have this terrific footprint. We want to optimize our supply chain to its fullest. But when it comes down to it, we are going to choose serving our customers. And over time, that the efficiency will work its way back in, we are not just waiting for that to happen. You should expect that, as a leadership team, we are very focused on it. Our teams understand that, but we also understand that servicing our customers is the highest priority we have.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. John\u2026\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much. Yeah. Go ahead.\nAl Mistysyn: The only anything I would add to that is, we did call out that supply chain comment that John talked about in our Consumer Brand Group being a little bit of a drag in our first quarter. But clearly -- and that\u2019s -- to John\u2019s point, that\u2019s an investment we are willing to make in servicing our customers better. That drag, if you look at the operating margins and what they were down, volume is still number one in consumer is driving that operating margin lower year-over-year, and then, let -- probably a third is the supply chain efficiencies, just to make that clear.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Thanks. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is live.\nSteve Byrne: Yeah. Thank you. The inventory build at the end of the quarter is noteworthy. Is that largely driven by the raw material costs or do you really have much more volume than previously you might have been low going into the quarter, but you commented that March was a big volume production month for you. So is that -- if that\u2019s volume driven, is that a reflection of what you are seeing your Pro contractors have as backlog and is that what is giving you this confidence in such a strong second half?\nJohn Morikis: Well, Steve, let me be very clear. We have incredible confidence in the second half, hard stop. We are growing inventory sequentially each month of the first quarter, because raw materials became more available. We added 50 million gallons of capacity. It\u2019s online. It\u2019s supporting the demand, and we are building inventory. We don\u2019t have the inventory that we normally would have had coming out of the first quarter, but given the additional capacity that we have, we are able to serve our customers and we are going to utilize that additional capacity in everything we have between now and likely this time next year to run full speed, all out, building inventory to be able to continue to serve our customers. And if we have to put a little more in working capital to be able to serve our customers, we are going to do that.\nSteve Byrne: And perhaps, relative to historical splits between first half and second half sales, how much stronger do you think second half this year could be?\nJohn Morikis: It\u2019s going to be a much stronger part of our success this year, partially because of the comparisons that we have, for sure. And second, as I -- we have just talked, the ability to make a record year -- a record month of production in March, says that, we have product, we have raw materials. And so, the demand is strong. We have raw materials. We have capacity. We are going to have a good time in the back half.\nSteve Byrne: Maybe just one quick one, what fraction of your consumer sales are Pros that pain and how do you get that data? Is that from your partner?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. We are not going to comment about our customers\u2019 mix of business. I will tell you that it\u2019s overall a relatively small, but is a very important and growing area. We have been talking for a number of quarters about the investments that we are making here, the commitments that we are making here. In fact, even the fact that we just came through a pretty challenging time and we were prioritizing that business with raw materials. I think it should speak volumes. We love this controlled distribution model through our own stores, but we are very excited about this Pro who paints model. And we have, through our own stores had, if you look at it, marginal success, because there are customers that prefer a home centre channel. They want to be able to get in and they want to be able to buy a full array of products that are only available at a home centre. In the marketplace, there\u2019s been a limited amount of competition in this space for too long and we believe, along with our strategic partners that there\u2019s a terrific opportunity and we are determined to help our strategic partners win in this space.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is live.\nP.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, John. You talked about raw material shortages and supply chain issues for a while. Do you think adding 80 new stores is going to add to that complexity or do you think you have this new capacity and excess inventory that you can load in these new stores? And also, what\u2019s the cadence of new stores? I think you opened, you said, only four new stores in the first quarter, so what\u2019s the cadence of that?\nJohn Morikis: Well, let me finish -- start with your finishing portion. We are going to be between 80 and 100 stores this year. And the answer as to why perhaps in a market like this to add stores is, we believe in the model. And we play a long game here and we didn\u2019t predict that the world was coming to an end because we couldn\u2019t get the raw materials. We knew we would and we continue to invest in every aspect of our business. Including, if you look at it in our manufacturing, we invested in labor to have people in our facilities, so that when raw materials became available, we could convert them. We did that and I think Mark demonstrated that. So now you follow the pipeline a little bit further, and you say, okay, now we are producing products. I am not going to be sitting here saying, oh, I wish we would have had the courage to invest in stores when things got a little bit tight. Maybe it comes with the 37 years of scar tissue that I have in the 30-plus years that all have and our other employee. We have seen this movie before. We know how it works. And we have got confidence. And when you have confidence, you look at adversity in the eye and you say we are going to run right at this. And during these tough times, we knew that others would do exactly what they do, close stores, close territories, get in their bunker and we are going after. We are bunker hunting right now and we are going to continue to do that.\nP.J. Juvekar: Great. And also about the cadence of the new stores?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. Four in the -- net four, I think it was in the first quarter, we would like to see a little bit more than that. But it\u2019s going to ramp up here between now and the end of the year. We will be in the 80 to 100 before the end of the year.\nP.J. Juvekar: Great. And one of your competitors has a new partnership at Home Depot to target Pros at the big boxes. Have you seen any impact of that on your business?\nJohn Morikis: Well, as I mentioned earlier, we have a model that we believe is the right model in the market. It certainly is for us. We believe painting contractors thrive in a specialty store format with the -- with people behind the counter that have 10 years, 20 years and 30 years of experience with products that were built for them in their specific areas and services that are focused on making them as productive as possible and as profitable as possible. So, I would just say, we welcome with no arrogance the competition. Competition makes you better. I am going to bet really big on Sherwin.\nP.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you and good to see your confidence. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Leithead from Barclays. Your line is live.\nMike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nJohn Morikis: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Leithead: Maybe to start with John, in the release, you talked about the worst the supply chain challenges being behind us, was that mostly a U.S. architectural comment or I guess when you look at your international operations or maybe the legacy Valspar businesses are you seeing conditions there meaningfully improve as well?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. I want to give -- earlier, I mentioned Colin Davie, our CPO and also Heidi Petz, our Chief Operating Officer. I want to give her credit as well and she started in her role on March 1 and I don\u2019t think she came up for air throughout the balance of the quarter out of this area. I mean terrific work by the entire team of really ensuring that we have the raw materials we need, and importantly, where we had it. When we look at what\u2019s been happening, I don\u2019t -- the impact on our architectural business outside of the U.S. is, obviously, a very small part of our business, not significantly impacted by this. The confidence that we have by working with our suppliers and in a partnership way, I think, is why we have this confidence. And again, the talent that we have in procurement and another fellow has to get the attention here. Joe Sladek, our President of our Global Supply Chain is the one that takes all these products and quickly is turning those in to finished goods and getting them to our stores and to our customers in a very nimble and quick way. It\u2019s amazing behind the scenes the things that are happening to be able to convert quickly and take advantage of these opportunities and we expect that to continue going forward.\nMike Leithead: Great. Super helpful. And then, second, I was just hoping to drill a bit more into the raw materials basket. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of focus on oil-based inputs, but just curious what you are seeing on the inorganic side both in TiO2 with color payments? Thank you.\nJim Jaye: Yeah, Mike, this is Jim. What I\u2019d say on the oil prices, we talked about probably going to be at the higher end of our guidance this year and part of that is because of the oil prices that we have seen. I think it remains to be seen how long those oil prices are going to stay sustained and I\u2019d remind you really that propylene is more meaningful as an input for us for our resins and solvent than this oil. So oil and propylene are connected over the long-term, but in the short-term, we have seen disconnects in the past. So think as Al said earlier, we will continue to monitor all of these things if we need to go out with more there in terms of price, we will. Your question on the TiO2 side, we have seen inflationary pressures there given the strong demand, there\u2019s tight inventories, and certainly, rising energy costs, which are used to convert the ore into TiO2. We haven\u2019t had any availability issues really there. We are in a good place with our suppliers, I think. So really on the supply chain, we will continue to monitor it. We will get pricing as necessary and we expect it to -- from an availability perspective, that\u2019s really behind us.\nMike Leithead: Great. Thank you so much.\nJim Jaye: You are welcome, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. John, there have been some reports that Sherwin is discounting paint prices in the U.S. Are those reports just inaccurate?\nJohn Morikis: Yes.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good. And the same trend of the 12% pricing you announced for February 1st, how much are you getting and how is it compared to historical levels?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. David, the price increase has been actually a little bit better than the price increases we went out with last year. So the effectiveness has been maintained and improved as the months have gone on, has it been -- it has been filtered through the market and we feel very good about where that is at right now.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Your line is live.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions on Performance Coatings, if I may. First, on the margin side, John, it looks like you made some nice sequential improvement there of 290 basis points. At one time, though, I think, you had a goal of high teens or low 20s, is that still the case for PCG margins, and if so, it looks like volumes are running pretty nicely nowadays. What do you think the path is to get there over the medium-term?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. Kevin, it absolutely is and we have great confidence in our ability to do that. I think you are going to continue to see that with volume. We have obviously seen the pickup in raw material cost has had an impact on it. So the price that has been announced rolls through. That\u2019s going to have an impact. We have also talked publicly about some of the other that are available to us that we are continuing to emphasize and attack. And some of that includes the simplification of our product lines, our raw materials, less complexity going through our plants. I want to be very clear in our confidence and our ability to reach those metrics that we have been talking about. We were gaining some ground on it unfortunately, with the raw material spike. We gave up a little bit of ground in this, but we have got -- this isn\u2019t just Bravado, we are going to do it. We are going to take the -- we have got confidence, we have got plans and we are executing on those. So we are going to deliver on this.\nKevin McCarthy: And then, secondly, you acquired Sika\u2019s Industrial Coatings business just recently on April 1st, I believe. I realize it\u2019s not a huge deal. But can you speak to what the opportunity is there and why you chose to do that?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. It\u2019s a -- I think a great example of our M&A strategy, which we have always said, we are not trying to be everything to everyone, everywhere and that we don\u2019t need practice. We are creating shareholder value. And so, when you look at the opportunity to acquire a strong position and protection in Germany with local production, Sherwin-Williams is strong in fire protection in the U.K. also with local production. And our ability to leverage the strength of each and production capabilities in each of the primary markets and drive new corrosion protection and fire protection sales together and then really connect the dot is a terrific opportunity for us. And I think it\u2019s a great example of our ability to identify assets, work with owners and to really capture the best of both. The leadership team, just as we have talked about with Valspar, the leadership team of Sika has also joined us. Thomas Hasler [ph] is a very strong leader in the Sika business that\u2019s joined and we believe that the combination of the legacy Sherwin and the new Sika assets and people is going to provide a great platform for growth.\nKevin McCarthy: Great. I appreciate the thoughts.\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Really quickly, so I guess, just curious when you think about that mid-to-high single-digit sales growth for the year. You said TAG would be at the upper end or even above that. I think you already covered this. But is there a possibility that you could -- so that should be more weighted towards price, I imagine. So when we look at same-store sales, should you expect that to remain in that $3.8 million and above level as we go through the year?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. It will improve as the year goes on. Arun? Arun, you are still there?\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Your line is live.\nGarik Shmois: Oh! Hi. Thanks. A couple of big picture questions for me. You talked about a number of positive leading indicators for TAG and you are sounding obviously pretty bullish about the outlook. But just curious if you are anticipating any impact from the increase in interest rates and how you could see TAG volumes evolving beyond existing contracted backlog.\nJohn Morikis: Well, I am sure that you are all getting tired talking about leadership. But I would say, I am going to start here with, we have got a terrific leader in our Group President, Justin Benshere, that has this team really positioned very well. So I am going to take your answer slightly differently than what you have asked and start with the fact that our team is positioned to be able to capture market share in any situation. So new residential slows down, we are going to capture it on residential repaint and property maintenance or any other way that it tilts. That said, given my comments earlier about just the shortage in new residential housing and the demand, we expect that there\u2019s going to be a strong demand and it\u2019s going to continue. The homebuilders that we are working with, they have described this as a bump in the road here, but they are driving through it. And I suspect that as demand continues, there\u2019s going to be more and more starts and we are going to be there. But if it does tilt another way, we are okay. We are going to be right on top of whatever way itself.\nAl Mistysyn: Just to put some perspective on that, Garik, just to remind you. I mean, new residential is sort of a mid-teens type percentage of our TAG business. So while it\u2019s meaningful to us, as John points out, we are strongly positioned in all these other segments as well.\nGarik Shmois: Yeah. Got it. Makes sense. I guess the follow-up question is, just with respect to the 50 million gallons capacity increase. And just to be clear, is that fully ramped at this point just going the surge in production, particularly in March or is there more capacity to be able to get out of that project.\nJohn Morikis: Well, it\u2019s up and running. But to say is there more capacity to be captured. The answer is, yes. Joe Sladek, as I mentioned, the Global Supply Chain President. He and his team are constantly working on debottlenecking and finding more capacity in every asset that we have. But the 50 million gallons that we spoke to is up and running, I also mentioned the $300 million we are investing in Statesville in that facility to add additional capacity. That will be coming up I believe in 2024. It will be coming online. So we are looking ahead. We expect to continue to drive volume and we are ahead of the curve. Again, speaking with the confidence and determination we have, we are not going to look back and wish we would have and we have great determination and confidence in the execution of our strategy. We are going to have the capacity to be able to take care of it.\nGarik Shmois: Great. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman. Your line is live.\nAdam Baumgarten: Thanks for taking my question. I think you said you expect input costs to decline or moderate at least in the second half. Is that the case?\nJohn Morikis: I think what we have talked about for input costs, yes, we said the first quarter would probably be the highest inflation of the year, second quarter, we expect it to moderate and then come down a little bit further in the back half based on what we see now. As Al mentioned, we have got the best visibility is maybe about a quarter or so. But, yes, that\u2019s correct. Our current outlook shows moderation in the back half.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Got it. And then just on the positive mix shift in quality. How much of that is related to simply more higher quality product availability, given the SKU rationalization and then maybe some weaker DIY demand versus a true mix up in the business.\nJohn Morikis: Well, I would say, it\u2019s a very good question, except that we have been witnessing this for some time now and it\u2019s only continued. And I would attribute it largely to more of a labor issue than availability. These paint contractors, when you recognize that labor represents 80% to 85%, sometimes 90% of their cost. If you can make that per man hour more productive, you have more projects that you can complete, less callbacks, the opportunity cost issues resolve and so more and more people are moving up in quality. We have a full breadth -- we have the full breadth of products. And I would tell you, even going back to when I was in a store. Rarely did you see people that would stay in that lower price. Typically, what they -- what you would find is people that would be very price conscious would get in there and there are some applications for it. The ceilings of a closet or so, okay, I get that. But what you find is people quickly are learning -- they learn that I can spend a little bit more on a higher quality product and get more productivity, better touch up, get off the project with no callbacks and go on, it\u2019s well worth it. When you look at the cost, if it\u2019s a high cost market, the per man hour expense, it\u2019s not a big investment to pay a little bit more for a higher quality product and get on to the next project for sure. And our people are trained in that. They understand how to do that. And again, it speaks to the tenure of our people. Again, Justin and his team, all our division presidents, they -- this is a program. We don\u2019t just wait for this to happen. We don\u2019t open doors and hope people walk in. We don\u2019t hope that they just move up the food chain and quality by themselves. These are programs that we execute and it\u2019s working very well.\nAdam Baumgarten: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is live.\nEric Bosshard: Thank you. Two things, first of all, on raw materials, inflation broadly seems like it\u2019s worse versus 90 days ago. You talked about energy and oil and TiO2. Is the paper read from today you are still comfortable with that original guidance for raws and is there something incremental you are doing to manage to stay within that original range and the environment, it seems a bit more difficult than 90 days ago?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. Eric, as we said on that range, we are trending towards the higher end of that low double-digit to mid-teens range. But we feel right now, as I mentioned on my previous answer related to oil and propylene and some of the other things, we are comfortable in that range right now. If it moves beyond that, I think, you have heard multiple times today, we will be ready to react with more pricing as needed.\nAl Mistysyn: Eric, I would just add to that. You talk about what are we doing in response to it\u2019s not in response to any short-term tweaks that we see in our raw material basket, our labs, whether it\u2019s industrial, working with marketing, working with procurement or architectural working with marketing, working with procurement, really driving platform consolidation, simplification, so that we can drive more volume through a smaller base of raw materials. That\u2019s an ongoing effort and not response to the current environment.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. And then, secondly, John, you talked about reactivating customers in the architectural business. And in this environment, that\u2019s I don\u2019t know if I have heard you talk about that before. So if you could just give us a little bit of color of what that looks like, that would be helpful?\nJohn Morikis: Yeah. I might give you more of a description of what we are doing and what it looks like for obvious reasons. We will tell you about it after we have done it and show you the scoreboard on how we have achieved it. But I want to be very clear on, Eric, is that it\u2019s not through price. We bring solutions and we bring profitability to our customers and we do it in a way that people are willing to stay for. Earlier there was a question about, we -- there was rumors about are we discounting to be able to do that and I want to be very clear and very direct that, that is not the case. But what we are doing though is leveraging what I just spoke to, the quality of people, the products and services that we have [Technical Difficulty] booked. And they have a strong desire to complete as many projects as they can and protect their reputation. And so if you could imagine all the activities you would do, if you were a store manager or a sales rep of Sherwin-Williams and building relationships, building trust, the connectivity and consistency is important. Every day over 3,000 sales reps wake up -- Sherwin-Williams reps determined to go be a better partner for their customers. And our ability to reengage with those customers and be responsive to their needs, have the products they need anticipate what challenges they might have shifts in weather to project delays, whatever it might be, all aligned in helping us to reengage. And while we don\u2019t think we lost customers through these challenging times. We do feel as though we have lost some sales and we take great pride in our controlled model of anticipating what products they are going to need and having them there. But there were times where it may have gotten their late or we couldn\u2019t get it there when they needed it and they might have had to go somewhere else. Well, you could rest assure of one thing here. We are not going to just assume they are coming back and so we are going to be very deliberate, very active and engaged with these customers to ensure that they are back in our stores, start with a cup of coffee, make a friend, use our paint. We are going to be after it pretty regularly.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Richard [ph]. Thanks for taking my question. Just one point on The Americas Group, when you look at volumes, which were down largely due to raw material availability, now that you have that easing and you have more capacity that you can bring on, do you expect to increase production on the DIY side or are you going to focus majority of your production on building inventories on the architectural side?\nJohn Morikis: Well, we are going to be converting these precious raw materials into finished goods and pursuing all segments of our business and so I think at this point, that\u2019s the extent that we want to talk about. We will talk about what we did next quarter, but we see a terrific opportunity to utilize the capacity that we have.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just related on that, in terms of SKUs in your stores, I know in the past, you talked about potentially limiting the number of SKUs in order to get more production out. Is that still happening or -- and is there any SKUs that are getting increased demand that you want to focus on [Technical Difficulty]\nJohn Morikis: This was a challenging time. It did give us an opportunity to look at our SKUs and rationalize some of those down that will never return. There will be simplification opportunities in what we come out as a product line with. And I would suspect that what you will see in the very near future is a little bit of expansion beyond what we had coming through last year. But we are not going to just jump back to where we were. We are going to be a better company, more efficient with our working capital. We will have the inventory we need, but it may not be spread out as wide as it has in the past, but we will have what our customers need.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Research. Your line is live.\nJaideep Pandya: Thanks a lot. I guess it\u2019s sort of a two-part question to the same topic. This cycle, you yourself and a lot of your peers have done a phenomenal job on pricing, increasing prices very dynamically in the last sort of four, five quarters. And in the previous cycle, whenever you have sort of had inflation, the gross margin progression in the subsequent two years increases quite dynamically in the region of sort of 4%, 5%. So, do you expect in this cycle, when you catch up with raw materials with your pricing and other inflation with your pricing, we should sort of see gross margin expansion in year 2023, 2024, the same magnitude or do you think that because pricing went up so dynamically in this cycle, you will have to give back some of the price increases as raw materials stabilize and potentially go down if demand weakens in Asia and Europe? Thanks a lot.\nJohn Morikis: So I\u2019d say this. You are right. If you look historically, there\u2019s been an opportunity there, but there\u2019s also been the opportunity to invest back in the business. And so I would answer your question this way, our determination is to make our [Technical Difficulty] and help them make more money. There are other costs that go into this, labor, transportation, all of these things that we are doing, it might not necessarily hit the gross margin line, but our investments that we invest in to help our customers in their profitability. So I\u2019d say that each one of these, we take a very in-depth view and very thoughtful view in how we can continue to ensure that what happens as a result of all these investments, all the pricing, everything that goes into it is that our customers win and when they win, we win. And if for whatever reason, we got piggish and tried to put pricing in that didn\u2019t help our customers to achieve their goals and be more profitable, then we don\u2019t deserve that business and you are not going to see us do that. And so our investments, our commitments and the ability to help customers be successful will be the drivers.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah. Jaideep, I\u2019d just add to that. We do believe we are in a similar environment where as raw material costs go up and we put pricing in and pricing starts to catch up with the raw material costs and we see a short-term margin contraction, then you start seeing recovery and you saw sequential improvement in our gross margin in our first quarter. Our expectation is that we will see sequential improvement in our second quarter. And then as I talked about on our year end call, we expect to start seeing a recovery in the second half with -- at the midpoint, adjusted EPS of 16%. We talked about we need to see gross margin expansion for the year. And then going out, you would expect to start getting back to that long-term gross margin target of 45% to 48%, which we are not coming off.\nJaideep Pandya: Thanks a lot. And just one follow-up on Valspar really, I appreciate there has been so much that has changed. But if you go back to your original plan, it\u2019s been sort of five-ish years since you did the deal. What are the areas where you are running well ahead and what are the areas which in hindsight, you could have done better, and actually, there\u2019s still more room for us to be positively surprised on this deal?\nJohn Morikis: Well, I\u2019d say we are well ahead, I think, as the leverage of talent is number one. I mentioned starting at the top with our new COO, Heidi Petz, all the way through to Group President and Performance Coatings and throughout the company, I\u2019d say there\u2019s a terrific infusion of talent. I\u2019d say the assets and the technology and the leveraging of the customers has been exciting. I mentioned earlier, automotive, the combination of some technology there is -- I was with one of our larger automotive refinish customers who asked, if that\u2019s why we bought auto -- or bought Valspar for the automotive finish, it was that good. So I\u2019d say there are terrific opportunities there. The brand itself is a very strong brand and growing in relevance and importance. And I think that\u2019s terrific opportunity and one that I think were to add. I\u2019d say if I look back and say, what we could have done differently or faster or better. I do think that coming out of 2016 when there was some hesitation on the previous leadership of Valspar to put pricing in. It took us years to recover that. And I think we learned from that and I think it\u2019s a big part of why you see the determination always I hear -- I hope you hear the determination that we have not to allow that happen. And part of that is so that we can remain healthy and serve our customers so we can continue to invest in our business. I think the working capital is another area. I think we have gotten to it. I think there\u2019s still more opportunities as are the asset utilization of the plants. So we are proud of what we have accomplished there. But I would tell you, just as we mentioned earlier, complacency kills, we are not done. There\u2019s still plenty of opportunities, and we find ourselves still prioritizing and that speaks to, I think, the quality of the company that we acquired and the quality of the people that came along with it. But we are just getting started. There\u2019s still a lot of work to be done there.\nJaideep Pandya: Thanks a lot.\nAl Mistysyn: You bet.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, Matthew, and thanks everybody for joining the call. I hope you heard today that we are operating here with a lot of momentum, a lot of confidence and we are really focused on driving results.

            "name": "Al Mistysyn",
            "content": "Yeah. Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. As I -- just as a level set on our January call, we talked about our expectation for the first half architectural volume, which includes Consumer and TAG to be flat to down low-single digits primarily because of the difficult comps that John talked about. In our second quarter with our TAG sales projected be up high low, high single to low-double digits with price up low-double digits and volume flat to down slightly. That's a sequential improvement for the first quarter. So we talked about the first quarter being down mid-single, flat to down slightly in the second quarter. That leads you to the momentum on an easier comp in the second half. We talked about the full year TAG sales of mid-to-high single digits with North America paint stores at or above the high end of that range. When you look at price low-double digit in our first half, as you analyze the price increases we took in in the second half of last year, our price in the second half will trend for the year to be at mid-to-high which gets you a low-to-mid single-digit volume growth in TAG and North America paint stores and I fully expect that to be the case. Yeah. Jeff, on raw material availability, what I would say is, we talked about on our year end call that we thought it might be a low single-digit to mid headwind. The way the quarter rolled out with availability, we saw some choppiness in January, improved in February. As John talked about, it was significantly better into March and into -- and it continues to improve in April. And in the data points that I have to show that, as John talked about, March was a single largest architectural production volume on -- in the history of the company. We significantly improved architectural gallons from December year end through the end of March. It's not our historic levels, but it is a significant improvement 20 plus million gallon increase. So, I think, to pinpoint exactly how much availability had on the quarter, it's really tough, because I look at how much of that would have been in sales versus how much we could have put in inventory. The fact is, the availability behind us, we have a lot of confidence to fill our 50 million gallons of additional capacity, along with the help of SPI. And the other data point I would highlight is, our expectation for architectural inventory through our seasonally highest second quarter and third quarter sales quarters to be flattish from the first quarter. As you know, Jeff, historically, our inventory would decline through the summer quarters, because you can't keep up with the volume. Because of the capacity we put in, we are going to be able to keep up with the sales volumes and increased buying inventory in our fourth quarter similar -- getting back similar to where we were back in 2019 and significantly higher than the last two years. Yeah. Jeff, they would be lower, primarily because of the more difficult comps that we had. Whereas repaint was up -- raspberry paint, new res, DIY roll up strong double digits and new res and commercial were up as well. So tougher comp in our first quarter. Yeah. Jeff, I wouldn't say we are done. I would say, when we look at the visibility and the volatility we have in the market around, not just raw materials, but other input costs. That visibility is out one quarter at best. I think what you will see us do is like we have in the past. We will monitor those input costs very closely and if we see a meaningful or if we see a meaningful change in them, we are prepared and discipline to go out with additional price. Similar to what we did last year, we went out August 1st 8% and we went out in September with a surcharge. So we have to monitor these situations closely and really react to what we anticipate. Ghansham, I would just add to that. You look at our sequential gross margin and operating segment improvement -- sequential improvement across each of the operating segments and all the hard work that those teams have done. Ad I will highlight one in particular, Performance Coatings Group that took the really the brunt of the raw material increases in the second half have been out with price on multiple occasions. You look at our first quarter operating -- adjusted operating margin about flat year-over-year. And if you recall, the increase -- significant increases we took for raw materials for that segment were primarily in the second half. So that team has done just an absolutely terrific job getting price, holding price and its showing and we are going to see that continued improvement in our gross margin in the second quarter. We expect to see sequential improvement in our gross margin and across each of the operating segments, albeit Consumer from a historic low operating margin and adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter, but the pricing actions, the volume and all the continuous improvement efforts across each of the segments that are helping to drive our bottomline faster than our topline. So that's what gives me confidence that we are going to continue to see improvements as the year goes on. Yeah. Greg, it -- the volume, as you know, and what we have always talked about is the single biggest driver of not just gross margin but operating margin and that clearly is a higher impact. If you look at year-over-year in our -- if you look at price cost in our first quarter, we are still chasing a little bit. I think we get on top of that as we get towards the end of the second quarter. So it will be less of a drag. And also in our second quarter, you see a seasonal increase in our architectural volume as you normally would. That's going to help drive our gross margin, it is going to help drive our operating margin, and Greg, it's still tough comps against TAGs, but you look at the volume down mid-single digits, it's a significant drag in our first quarter. And to be down flat to down slightly in our second quarter is going to be a positive mix shift as well in our second quarter that's going to help grow the margin. Yeah. Greg, I think, what you -- what we are looking at is more on the industrial side right now. I think when we talk about the basket moving to the high end of the range. It's more on industrial. As you know, industrial price increases aren't as uniform. So there may be -- I talked about on our year end call, some in the first quarter, some that roll into the second quarter. I think the timing of those are pretty much the same. It's just the -- that the amount or the percent increase that may have had to get adjusted. But like we talked about earlier, I think, our visibility is one quarter out at best, a lot of volatility and we will continue to monitor that, based on the last year and a half, I am not going to say, we don't need more, we are just going to have to monitor it and go out and react accordingly. Yeah. John... The only anything I would add to that is, we did call out that supply chain comment that John talked about in our Consumer Brand Group being a little bit of a drag in our first quarter. But clearly -- and that's -- to John's point, that's an investment we are willing to make in servicing our customers better. That drag, if you look at the operating margins and what they were down, volume is still number one in consumer is driving that operating margin lower year-over-year, and then, let -- probably a third is the supply chain efficiencies, just to make that clear. Yes. It will improve as the year goes on. Arun? Arun, you are still there? Just to put some perspective on that, Garik, just to remind you. I mean, new residential is sort of a mid-teens type percentage of our TAG business. So while it's meaningful to us, as John points out, we are strongly positioned in all these other segments as well. You bet. Eric, I would just add to that. You talk about what are we doing in response to it's not in response to any short-term tweaks that we see in our raw material basket, our labs, whether it's industrial, working with marketing, working with procurement or architectural working with marketing, working with procurement, really driving platform consolidation, simplification, so that we can drive more volume through a smaller base of raw materials. That's an ongoing effort and not response to the current environment. You bet. You bet. Yeah. Jaideep, I'd just add to that. We do believe we are in a similar environment where as raw material costs go up and we put pricing in and pricing starts to catch up with the raw material costs and we see a short-term margin contraction, then you start seeing recovery and you saw sequential improvement in our gross margin in our first quarter. Our expectation is that we will see sequential improvement in our second quarter. And then as I talked about on our year end call, we expect to start seeing a recovery in the second half with -- at the midpoint, adjusted EPS of 16%. We talked about we need to see gross margin expansion for the year. And then going out, you would expect to start getting back to that long-term gross margin target of 45% to 48%, which we are not coming off. You bet."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone listening. Before getting into some color on our three segments, I'd like to frame today's call with some themes we are seeing across the business. First, demand remains very strong across most of the business. Our teams are highly engaged and focused on growing volume through new accounts and share of wallet, as well as reactivating customers that may have shopped elsewhere to meet the needs of a specific project over the past year due to product availability challenges. Second, raw material availability improved meaningfully late in the quarter and this has continued into the second quarter. We do not expect lack of raw materials to have a material impact on sales going forward. To be clear, the supply chain has not completely recovered, as the bottleneck has now largely moved from suppliers' production to their transportation and logistics. In the near-term, we are speeding this recovery by employing our own fleet and tank wagons to supplement suppliers' delivery capabilities. Our ability in this area is unique among our competitors. We are also focusing on SKU prioritization and formulations to make the most of the raw materials that are available to us. Additionally, the Specialty Polymers acquisition is meaningfully contributing to our resin needs. Third, inventory in our stores and distribution centers is in a markedly better place than it was at the end of December. The 50 million gallons of incremental architectural capacity we brought on in the fourth quarter is up and running. As the supply of raw materials improves, we are quickly converting those materials to paint. In fact, we made more architectural paint gallons in March than in any previous month in our company's history. We expect to run this additional capacity at a high rate to keep up with demand through the painting season and then begin building inventory in our fourth quarter as we typically would. And looking to the future, we announced a $300 million investment to begin expanding production and distribution at our Statesville, North Carolina architectural facility that serves both TAG and CBG, which will be completed in 2024. Finally, inflation remains significant and is trending toward the high end of the guidance we previously provided. In addition to raw materials, we have seen increases in other elements of the cost basket including freight, energy and labor. As we have said in the past, our continuous improvement efforts are focused on offsetting these increased costs. Additionally, we have been aggressive with pricing actions in all of our businesses to offset these costs and we will continue to do so as necessary. As far as our first quarter, I will keep my comments brief in order to get to our outlook. The Americans Group, sales growth in the first quarter was led by Protective and Marine and Property Management, both of which were up by a double-digit percentage. New residential, residential repaint and commercial were up by a mid single-digit percentage. DIY was down double digits, as we faced a strong double-digit comparison and prioritize sales to professional contractors. We have also begun to see margin recovery in the business as segment margin expanded sequentially. From a product perspective, exterior paint sales performed better than interior sales, with interior being the larger part of the mix. We realized a low double-digit increase in price in the first quarter, with volume remaining under pressure. The 12% price increase we announced February 1st is going in as planned. We opened for net new stores in the first quarter and still plan 80 to 100 for the year. We also continued our growth investments and sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, ecommerce and productivity enhancing services. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. While this business faced a very challenging comparison, we are encouraged by our sales in North America, which were nearly flat as we continue to focus on supporting key strategic retail partners and growing our pros who paint initiative. Sales were softer in Europe and China, as we faced double-digit comparisons and COVID-related lockdowns. Note that we have now anniversary the Wattyl divestiture, which was a drag on Group sales of about 6 percentage points in the quarter. Pricing was positive in the quarter and in the high single-digit range. Segment margin expanded significantly on a sequential basis benefiting from increased volume, leverage on SG&A and incremental pricing. Last let me comment on first quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. Group sales increased by 20.4% in the quarter, including high single-digit volume growth against a double-digit comparison. Price realization was in the low teens range, and all regions and all divisions generated growth. As in the other groups, we saw meaningful sequential margin improvement during the quarter. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in North America, followed by Latin America, Asia and Europe. Every division in the Group grew, with nearly all by double digits, driven by robust underlying demand, new customer wins, share of wallet gains and pricing. Packaging was strongest, followed by coil, general industrial, auto refinish and industrial wood, respectively. Before moving to our outlets, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $558 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $407 million to purchase 1.45 million shares at an average price of $280.77. We distributed $150.9 million in dividends. We also invested $106.3 million in our business through capital expenditures, including $77 million in core CapEx and $29 million for our building our futures project. Additionally, the acquisition of Sika European Industrial Coatings business closed on April 1. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBIT ratio of 3.3 times, as we increased short-term borrowing to fund our share repurchases and the Sika acquisition. We expect to be closer to the high end of our 2 times to 2.5 times range by the end of the year. Turning to our outlook, as I referenced earlier, we continue to see very strong demand in North America, Pro architectural end markets, though we are facing a comparison to a strong double-digit growth quarter that was driven by very robust post-pandemic recovery. Comparisons will ease in the back half of the year. Rising mortgage rates have not made an appreciable dent in the demand for our new residential customers to this point. Should the residential demand slow, we remain extremely well-positioned in multiple architectural segments, including residential repaint and property management, which have proven to be more defensive in nature. We expect industrial demand will remain strong as the year progresses based on the outlook our customers have shared with us. Comparisons will be challenging over the remainder of the year. Demand remains strongest in North America, our largest region. European demand also remains strong, although we continue to closely monitor for potential impacts from the war in Ukraine. For the record, our sales in Russia and Belarus are well below 1% of the total company sales and we are suspending operations in these regions. In Asia and in China particular, demand has been dampened near-term by the latest COVID-19 wave. On the architectural and industrial sides, we will continue to leverage our strengths in innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution, as we expect to grow at a rate that outpaces the market. From a supply chain perspective, we believe we are through the most challenging aspects. As I described in my earlier comments, we expect this to continue improving and to have a minimal impact on sales going forward. On the cost side of the equation, we are maintaining our low double-digit to mid-teens raw material inflation guidance. Though, we are trending toward the high end of the range, driven primarily by Performance Coatings Group. There is considerable short-term volatility in the market and our visibility beyond the quarter or two is limited. We do expect the level of year-over-year inflation to remain elevated, but to moderate in the back half of the year. Our pricing actions remain on track and we are prepared for additional increases if necessary. For the second quarter of 2022, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage compared to the second quarter of 2021, inclusive of a low double-digit price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect Consumer Brands to be up by the high-teens to a low 20 percentage. And we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage. Our full year guidance is heavily second half weighted due to stronger volume, the impact of pricing actions and weaker second half 2021 comparisons. I will remind you we began 2021 with great momentum, including first half sales growth of 14.7% and adjusted EPS growth of 26.6%, before the natural disasters, supply chain and COVID issues derail the second half of the year. For the full year 2022, our guidance remains unchanged. We expect consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect The Americas group to be up a mid-to-high single-digit percentage, with North American paint stores at or above the high end of the range. We expect Consumer Brands Group to be up a low-to-mid single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a high single to low double-digit percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2022 to be in the range of $8.40 per share to $8.80 per share, compared to $6.98 per share, earn in 2021. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share $9.25 and $9.65, an increase of 16% at the midpoint over the $8.15 we delivered in 2021. The additional data points we provided last quarter on full year currency exchange, tax rate, CapEx, interest expense, depreciation and amortization are unchanged. As we enter the heart of the painting season, we remain confident our strategy, our capabilities, and the differentiated product and service solutions we bring to customers. The 61,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams are focused on the tasks at hand and there is no better team in the industry. Our business remains extremely well-positioned and we are emerging as an even stronger Sherwin-Williams following the challenges we faced the last two years. I am excited by the momentum we are gaining as we progress towards what we expect will be a very strong second half of the year. In addition to today's call, I will remind you, we will provide additional commentary on the market and our business at our upcoming Financial Community Presentation event scheduled for Wednesday, June 8th in New York City. Details are available on our website and we are very much looking forward to seeing many of you in person. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time. Yeah. Vincent, maybe the way I will go out this is, just to take a quick run through the different segments and give you a little bit of color on the demand, because I think that speaks to what you are asking here. So let me start with raspberry paint and tell you that our customers are experiencing really strong backlogs. There's a positive mix shift in quality that's also taking place and we believe that plays really well to our advantage. So when you talk about volume, our ability to grow our volume faster than market also includes the ability to drive greater productivity through for our contractors is this quality that we are providing them helps to provide the finished product that a more experienced painter applicator might be able to apply and so we are helping them do that with through product. If you look at this area, you would clearly see home appreciation driving demand. LIRA their forecasting for the growth in 2022 is in double digits. If you look at the NHAB -- NAHB Remodeling Index is strong well above 50. And existing home sales have slowed year-over-year against a very strong comp in lack of inventory, but overall it's a very strong market for us. So we expect to continue to see a good strong demand market in residential repaint our contractors are telling us. I mentioned many of them are looking through the end of the year with a pretty solid backlog of projects and we are going to grow with those customers. But this is an area that we absolutely expect to continue to grow our market share pretty aggressive rate. Property Maintenance is -- really underlying demand is solid here as well. There's been delayed maintenance that's now being addressed and we see improved areas and apartment turns along with the return to travel, office, even school that's driving demand. And I'd say, in this area as well there's an increased awareness of the need to keep these assets fresh, current and clean, and as you know, paint is inexpensive, yet impactful solution in this area. Commercial, I would say, the underlying demand here is also solid. Projects are resuming albeit at varying paces, but the starts are positive. Customers are reporting labor constraints and material shortages on these projects are acting as governors of growth. So any aspect of this project that could be anything from drywall to roofing project -- products, anything could have an impact here that's could be significant. Dodge Momentum Index here is strong, as is the Architectural Building Index, which has been positive for straight months, and as you know, that tracks the current building by architects, which generally leads to the commercial construction spending nine months to 12 months out. And the other area, obviously, that we are really focused on is new residential, we got a great position here and growing by the way, starts and permits remain strong year-over-year with multifamily stronger than single, but both really terrific markets for us. Completions are softer due to material availability here, in some cases, labor as well. We have not seen a meaningful slowdown, as I mentioned earlier from rising mortgage rates, which are still low in comparison to other periods. In this area, we have gotten a lot of questions about throughout the quarter and I thought I'd just highlight one area, this article by USA today that I think captures kind of the sentiment that we have in new residential. They talked about the housing unit shortfall ranging between 5.5 million and 6.8 million, despite an annual average of 1.5 million new housing units completed and a 1.7 million spike in 2020 alone, a new construction would need to accelerate to a pace that's well above this current trend to more than 2 million housing units per year to close this gap. Even if building were to continue at the current level, the most rapid pace in more than a decade, it still take more than 20 years to close the 5.5 million unit gap. So as I mentioned, we have got a strong position here. We are determined to get stronger here. And I will tell you that, regardless of what happens in these professional areas, way that we have been driving this company for years now with our strategy development and strategy deployment is to be in position to capitalize on it whichever way it tilts. So if any one of these areas should for some reason slow down, we have worked really hard to position ourselves to be able to capitalize on whichever way the market might shift to and we believe that we would be able to capitalize on it. I am going to touch on one more area then I am going to ask Al to talk on the volume a little bit further as DIY. We did talk about the fact that DIY behaved as we expected. As demand continued to return to more normal level and this was against, as I mentioned earlier, difficult comp. But we also prioritized our professional contractors and our key strategic customers in our Consumer Brands business that impacted this DIY business. Thank you, Vincent. Yeah. The only thing I would add to those great responses. I think the trend of manufacturing will continue to your point all the way through till probably this time next year, we will run our assets hard to build that inventory back up. And maybe clarifying point that I think is important is that to your question about volume on each of those segments, Jeff, I don't need to break them all down, because they were all very similar. They all improved as the quarter improved, quarter went on. Year-over-year they were lower? Thanks, Jeff. The -- if I look at the -- you say the 20% growth in our first quarter. Josh, are you talking about our second... Sorry. Thank you. When you look at high-teens, low 20%, expect price to be up a similar amount. As TAG, we have significantly easier comps, which was down strong double-digit. I think when you look at our inventory build. We had an inventory built in the first quarter through our strategic partners. As you would expect, we were in a similar situation that we talked about as the third quarter and fourth quarter went on, we drove our inventories down across the chain, both the TAG, Consumer and our retail partner. So we did have to build some inventory at store level with these partners. But really the -- we did have a weak comp, we expect North America to be strong, we do expect with Asia and Europe to be softer in our second quarter. That's about 15% of our sales and pretty strong comps outside the U.S. and Europe and Asia. So, I don't have an exact number to say, how much was building versus sell-through, but rest assured, we had to build inventory in our first quarter in our retail partners. No. I'd say they are pretty stable. I'd say in -- as it relates to the Consumer side of our stores and in our Consumer Brands customers. I'd say in our Professional side, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing more of a positive mix shift moving into higher quality rather than shift down. Again, that's driven mainly off of labor and the design of the painting contractor has to be as productive as they can, so they can attack the backlog that they are facing. Thank you, Josh. Well, importantly, our customers are starting to see the effects as we purchased this SPI with the idea of really trying to leverage that asset, Chris, I think, it's doing that and it's only going to get better for us. I don't think you should expect us to continue further upstream. We believe -- we have always had a resin strategy and we have always manufactured resin. SPI was a top producer for us, terrific people, terrific assets and an opportunity to get in there and get the most out of that that set of assets. It also, as you mentioned, as we mentioned, when we announced this, it helped us to deleverage, if you will, a little bit of the dependence on the Gulf Coast, these manufacturing facilities are on Each Coast and to get a little bit away from some of the hurricane risk that, while they are on the coast or inland and terrific assets. We are already starting to see more productivity out of these assets. We expect that to continue. There will be some investments in there, but very reasonable with great return. We don't expect us to get into the additives, TiO2 business, that's not where we belong. Yeah. Chris, I appreciate that question, and I'd tell you that, our confidence level is very high. We can always speak to our strategy. And I will tell you that we are blessed with a control distribution model that serves us well. And we leverage this model, and that includes a strong and very consistent brand strategy. We think that branding strategy and the consistency of it is equally important. We have an innovation program designed to develop segments specific product. So because we have a control model, we are able to talk to each of these segments to understand what are the needs of these customers, what are the challenges and we develop probably products that are specific for these segments. And we do the same with our services, so that we have a very good understanding of what the needs are of these painting contractors and we build the services to help them make more money. And finally, the reason I have probably the most confidence is our people. I believe we have the best people in the industry and I am not apologetic about making that claim. We hire around 1,400 to 1,500 college graduates a year to enter our Management Trainee Program and we recruit outstanding talent. We train and develop this talent and we retain this talent. These are the people that serve our customers. And for nearly 40 years, we have been investing in this program. This training program is 40 years old. We now have thousands of graduates from our Management Training Program throughout the company. In just our TAG business, as an example, four of our five division Presidents were management trainees, our Group President was a trainee and throughout the company, we have over 26 Vice Presidents that were management trainees. And by the way, one CEO that was a training. We think this is important. Our customers, they are buying more than a gallon of paint, that -- we tell our people constantly that, companies don't compete, people do. 70% of our field leaders are graduates of our Management Training Program and they provide the leadership and direction to our tenured organization, they know what to do, they know how to win. And I say tenure, because over 7,000 of our employees are -- have greater than 20 years service. That's nearly 15% of our workforce has 20 years or more of paint experience. And these leaders created an environment where people win and they want to stay. One half of our rep force has over 10 years of service. Turnover of our customer facing reps and managers is still in single digits. In this environment still in single digits, we are hanging out of the most important assets we have and that's our people. Our people wake up every day, they focus on two things, paint and making painting contractor successful. So this specialty store format, it works for painting contractors. We have always talked about avoiding complacency in our company. In fact, we often say that complacency kills. We are working to get better every day. We were working to make our painting contractors better every day. But I will say this, I do believe this will come down to our people versus others. We have a 40-year head start, a lot of drive, a lot of determination. We are not going to win by a little bit. I am looking forward to competing against any model. Thanks, Chris. Well, I'd say first, we just talked a lot about people. I'd say that's a third advantage. But I'd also say that if you look at the assets, we have talked about that we have deployed, the responsiveness that we have. And I will say this, our Chief Procurement Officer, Colin Davie and his team are working really well with our customers and I have learned to appreciate the demonstration of rewarding suppliers who have stepped up to serve us and the suppliers have been creative in responding to our needs. The assurance of supply to your point continues to be an important element in this market and once you have that supply, I think, we demonstrated in the month of March, we had a record month in the company's history of producing product. And so, what I'd say is that, it's not one thing. It's the entire ecosystem. It's everything we are doing. Everything that we bring and it's all focused and starts with one thing, the customer. So we are looking through that lens we are working back and this large 156-year-old company is learning to be nimble and quick and respond. And so I'd say that, if I am looking at it from the outside in, I am looking at a lot of assets that are really positioned well to be able to respond to a high demand market. Well, we are really excited to your point. We have got a lot of momentum in these businesses and there's no expectation for less if that's the question. We sit in this room, this boardroom and we talk with our teams regularly about the competence that we have. And maybe I could walk through quickly, if you would like each of these segments, just to give you a little bit of color, because there is a lot of strength, but boy, there's so much opportunity. If you look at our packaging, we had a strong double-digit growth in the quarter. In fact, each of the last three quarters we have had record quarters in this business, packaging sales, with sales of around 30% per quarter for the last three. So if you look at this business, the demand is very robust and food and beverage, our non-BPA coatings continues to gain traction. Both we and our customers are investing in capacity expansions in anticipation of a strong demand year here in 2022 and beyond. So we are thrilled about that business. The differentiation that we have in the technology and the people we have, it is just phenomenal. This is a nugget that came obviously with the Valspar acquisition as this coil. We had a double-digit growth quarter in coil. That's the fourth straight quarter we have had sales of double-digit growth here and double-digit in every region, led here by extrusion and metal buildings. So we are excited about this business going forward. Our general industrial, again double-digit growth in the first quarter. That's the fifth straight quarter with double-digit growth in GI. Every region was positive led by North America and our LatAm business, transportation and general finishing were strongest here. Our auto refinish had double-digit growth. Miles driven here are below, but nearing pre-pandemic levels and continue to leveraging our technology as a key here. We brought in some wonderful technology from Valspar that works terrifically with our Sherwin tech technology and we are growing share here pretty aggressively. And in industrial wood, we had a high single-digit quarter. We have got very good momentum here, furniture, kitchen cabinetry, cabinetry and flooring, which obviously correlate to similar positive trends in new res construction. So we saw increases in all end markets, most by double digits and clearly really pleased with packaging and coil, but all of them were strong and by region, North America, our largest region grew the fastest and LatAm, Asia and Europe right behind. So expectations of this team remain really strong. We got a terrific leader here as well. Karl Jorgenrud came to us from Valspar. Got a lot of division presidents beneath Karl that are really experienced as well. We talk a lot about our TAG organization and the retention of people and the importance of that in TAG. But the same stands true in PCG. Our average division presidents average 29 years between Sherwin-Williams and Valspar. And again, when you look back, we talked openly about this greatest infusion of talent, when Valspar and Sherwin came together and we have been terrific in the retention of those people. Our turnover still and this is years after the integration is below 7%. And so, on the architectural side, I think if you look at the legacy Sherwin and the talent we had on the architectural side, we are pretty -- we like to think we are pretty strong, always could get better. They brought, obviously, some talent came in from the architectural side of Valspar. In fact, our new Chief Operating Officer came through the architectural side of Valspar. But when I look at the PCG side and the benefits we have had on the talent that's come in from Valspar and our ability to retain it, yeah, it gives us terrific confidence going forward. So fundamentals, we have got great assets. We have got great technology. We have got great people. And we have great customers and we are going to leverage that for everything we get. Thanks, Ghansham. Yeah. What we will say is that if we need to, we will. It's not a hesitation. I think we have, you are right, Greg. Good for you, because I know you know our company well, we have done that. And I think what's different now is that we are a little bit further into the volatility portion of this cycle and we have been communicating to our customers with greater clarity about the volatility. So I don't know that we need to wait as we have had in the past, because we have been communicating to the customers, that our intent is to try to keep the price increase to a minimum. But with that, we are not building a buffer to be able to absorb the volatility and if there is more volatility, then we will need to be out quicker with additional price. So, I think, we would be moving quicker, and to your point, it's nothing we would prefer to do or enjoy doing. We have yet to get a thank you note from any of our customers for it. But if the need be, we are going to do it, we will do it quickly. Yeah. You bet. Yeah. John, let me first go back to your question and the comment that we made earlier. What we were speaking to specifically there was suppliers not customers. And we do work with our suppliers, mainly to bridge gaps to ensure that we have the product when we need it, where we need it. It's not our intent to do their jobs, but we are in this together with them, trying to work with them, and as you would expect, when that happens, there's a discussion about what it cost that goes along with the fact that we are going to do that. So right now and you know our company, our focus is on taking care of the customer and the fact that we have got our fleet and it is a point of differentiation. We do leverage those and there are times when we are less efficient doing that. For example, one of our largest customers on the Consumer Brand side was very adamant about a South to North recovery approach that was a little less efficient than we would have liked to have seen, but important to our customers. And so we took that undertaking and served our customers in a way that allowed us to respond to their needs, not what -- not which was most or least expensive to us and that's our DNA. And so, if it's to use our fleet of trucks to help in the pinch to be able to get raw materials to a plant, or in some cases, right now, we are producing where we can get the raw materials and we are shipping it in some cases across the country to ensure that we have supply where we need it and if we were less efficient than what we would like and we have this terrific footprint. We want to optimize our supply chain to its fullest. But when it comes down to it, we are going to choose serving our customers. And over time, that the efficiency will work its way back in, we are not just waiting for that to happen. You should expect that, as a leadership team, we are very focused on it. Our teams understand that, but we also understand that servicing our customers is the highest priority we have. Thanks, John. Well, Steve, let me be very clear. We have incredible confidence in the second half, hard stop. We are growing inventory sequentially each month of the first quarter, because raw materials became more available. We added 50 million gallons of capacity. It's online. It's supporting the demand, and we are building inventory. We don't have the inventory that we normally would have had coming out of the first quarter, but given the additional capacity that we have, we are able to serve our customers and we are going to utilize that additional capacity in everything we have between now and likely this time next year to run full speed, all out, building inventory to be able to continue to serve our customers. And if we have to put a little more in working capital to be able to serve our customers, we are going to do that. It's going to be a much stronger part of our success this year, partially because of the comparisons that we have, for sure. And second, as I -- we have just talked, the ability to make a record year -- a record month of production in March, says that, we have product, we have raw materials. And so, the demand is strong. We have raw materials. We have capacity. We are going to have a good time in the back half. Yeah. We are not going to comment about our customers' mix of business. I will tell you that it's overall a relatively small, but is a very important and growing area. We have been talking for a number of quarters about the investments that we are making here, the commitments that we are making here. In fact, even the fact that we just came through a pretty challenging time and we were prioritizing that business with raw materials. I think it should speak volumes. We love this controlled distribution model through our own stores, but we are very excited about this Pro who paints model. And we have, through our own stores had, if you look at it, marginal success, because there are customers that prefer a home centre channel. They want to be able to get in and they want to be able to buy a full array of products that are only available at a home centre. In the marketplace, there's been a limited amount of competition in this space for too long and we believe, along with our strategic partners that there's a terrific opportunity and we are determined to help our strategic partners win in this space. You bet. Well, let me finish -- start with your finishing portion. We are going to be between 80 and 100 stores this year. And the answer as to why perhaps in a market like this to add stores is, we believe in the model. And we play a long game here and we didn't predict that the world was coming to an end because we couldn't get the raw materials. We knew we would and we continue to invest in every aspect of our business. Including, if you look at it in our manufacturing, we invested in labor to have people in our facilities, so that when raw materials became available, we could convert them. We did that and I think Mark demonstrated that. So now you follow the pipeline a little bit further, and you say, okay, now we are producing products. I am not going to be sitting here saying, oh, I wish we would have had the courage to invest in stores when things got a little bit tight. Maybe it comes with the 37 years of scar tissue that I have in the 30-plus years that all have and our other employee. We have seen this movie before. We know how it works. And we have got confidence. And when you have confidence, you look at adversity in the eye and you say we are going to run right at this. And during these tough times, we knew that others would do exactly what they do, close stores, close territories, get in their bunker and we are going after. We are bunker hunting right now and we are going to continue to do that. Yeah. Four in the -- net four, I think it was in the first quarter, we would like to see a little bit more than that. But it's going to ramp up here between now and the end of the year. We will be in the 80 to 100 before the end of the year. Well, as I mentioned earlier, we have a model that we believe is the right model in the market. It certainly is for us. We believe painting contractors thrive in a specialty store format with the -- with people behind the counter that have 10 years, 20 years and 30 years of experience with products that were built for them in their specific areas and services that are focused on making them as productive as possible and as profitable as possible. So, I would just say, we welcome with no arrogance the competition. Competition makes you better. I am going to bet really big on Sherwin. Yeah. Good morning, Mike. Yeah. I want to give -- earlier, I mentioned Colin Davie, our CPO and also Heidi Petz, our Chief Operating Officer. I want to give her credit as well and she started in her role on March 1 and I don't think she came up for air throughout the balance of the quarter out of this area. I mean terrific work by the entire team of really ensuring that we have the raw materials we need, and importantly, where we had it. When we look at what's been happening, I don't -- the impact on our architectural business outside of the U.S. is, obviously, a very small part of our business, not significantly impacted by this. The confidence that we have by working with our suppliers and in a partnership way, I think, is why we have this confidence. And again, the talent that we have in procurement and another fellow has to get the attention here. Joe Sladek, our President of our Global Supply Chain is the one that takes all these products and quickly is turning those in to finished goods and getting them to our stores and to our customers in a very nimble and quick way. It's amazing behind the scenes the things that are happening to be able to convert quickly and take advantage of these opportunities and we expect that to continue going forward. Yes. Yeah. David, the price increase has been actually a little bit better than the price increases we went out with last year. So the effectiveness has been maintained and improved as the months have gone on, has it been -- it has been filtered through the market and we feel very good about where that is at right now. Thanks, David. Yeah. Kevin, it absolutely is and we have great confidence in our ability to do that. I think you are going to continue to see that with volume. We have obviously seen the pickup in raw material cost has had an impact on it. So the price that has been announced rolls through. That's going to have an impact. We have also talked publicly about some of the other that are available to us that we are continuing to emphasize and attack. And some of that includes the simplification of our product lines, our raw materials, less complexity going through our plants. I want to be very clear in our confidence and our ability to reach those metrics that we have been talking about. We were gaining some ground on it unfortunately, with the raw material spike. We gave up a little bit of ground in this, but we have got -- this isn't just Bravado, we are going to do it. We are going to take the -- we have got confidence, we have got plans and we are executing on those. So we are going to deliver on this. Yeah. It's a -- I think a great example of our M&A strategy, which we have always said, we are not trying to be everything to everyone, everywhere and that we don't need practice. We are creating shareholder value. And so, when you look at the opportunity to acquire a strong position and protection in Germany with local production, Sherwin-Williams is strong in fire protection in the U.K. also with local production. And our ability to leverage the strength of each and production capabilities in each of the primary markets and drive new corrosion protection and fire protection sales together and then really connect the dot is a terrific opportunity for us. And I think it's a great example of our ability to identify assets, work with owners and to really capture the best of both. The leadership team, just as we have talked about with Valspar, the leadership team of Sika has also joined us. Thomas Hasler [ph] is a very strong leader in the Sika business that's joined and we believe that the combination of the legacy Sherwin and the new Sika assets and people is going to provide a great platform for growth. Yeah. You bet. Well, I am sure that you are all getting tired talking about leadership. But I would say, I am going to start here with, we have got a terrific leader in our Group President, Justin Benshere, that has this team really positioned very well. So I am going to take your answer slightly differently than what you have asked and start with the fact that our team is positioned to be able to capture market share in any situation. So new residential slows down, we are going to capture it on residential repaint and property maintenance or any other way that it tilts. That said, given my comments earlier about just the shortage in new residential housing and the demand, we expect that there's going to be a strong demand and it's going to continue. The homebuilders that we are working with, they have described this as a bump in the road here, but they are driving through it. And I suspect that as demand continues, there's going to be more and more starts and we are going to be there. But if it does tilt another way, we are okay. We are going to be right on top of whatever way itself. Well, it's up and running. But to say is there more capacity to be captured. The answer is, yes. Joe Sladek, as I mentioned, the Global Supply Chain President. He and his team are constantly working on debottlenecking and finding more capacity in every asset that we have. But the 50 million gallons that we spoke to is up and running, I also mentioned the $300 million we are investing in Statesville in that facility to add additional capacity. That will be coming up I believe in 2024. It will be coming online. So we are looking ahead. We expect to continue to drive volume and we are ahead of the curve. Again, speaking with the confidence and determination we have, we are not going to look back and wish we would have and we have great determination and confidence in the execution of our strategy. We are going to have the capacity to be able to take care of it. I think what we have talked about for input costs, yes, we said the first quarter would probably be the highest inflation of the year, second quarter, we expect it to moderate and then come down a little bit further in the back half based on what we see now. As Al mentioned, we have got the best visibility is maybe about a quarter or so. But, yes, that's correct. Our current outlook shows moderation in the back half. Well, I would say, it's a very good question, except that we have been witnessing this for some time now and it's only continued. And I would attribute it largely to more of a labor issue than availability. These paint contractors, when you recognize that labor represents 80% to 85%, sometimes 90% of their cost. If you can make that per man hour more productive, you have more projects that you can complete, less callbacks, the opportunity cost issues resolve and so more and more people are moving up in quality. We have a full breadth -- we have the full breadth of products. And I would tell you, even going back to when I was in a store. Rarely did you see people that would stay in that lower price. Typically, what they -- what you would find is people that would be very price conscious would get in there and there are some applications for it. The ceilings of a closet or so, okay, I get that. But what you find is people quickly are learning -- they learn that I can spend a little bit more on a higher quality product and get more productivity, better touch up, get off the project with no callbacks and go on, it's well worth it. When you look at the cost, if it's a high cost market, the per man hour expense, it's not a big investment to pay a little bit more for a higher quality product and get on to the next project for sure. And our people are trained in that. They understand how to do that. And again, it speaks to the tenure of our people. Again, Justin and his team, all our division presidents, they -- this is a program. We don't just wait for this to happen. We don't open doors and hope people walk in. We don't hope that they just move up the food chain and quality by themselves. These are programs that we execute and it's working very well. You bet. Yeah. Eric, as we said on that range, we are trending towards the higher end of that low double-digit to mid-teens range. But we feel right now, as I mentioned on my previous answer related to oil and propylene and some of the other things, we are comfortable in that range right now. If it moves beyond that, I think, you have heard multiple times today, we will be ready to react with more pricing as needed. Yeah. I might give you more of a description of what we are doing and what it looks like for obvious reasons. We will tell you about it after we have done it and show you the scoreboard on how we have achieved it. But I want to be very clear on, Eric, is that it's not through price. We bring solutions and we bring profitability to our customers and we do it in a way that people are willing to stay for. Earlier there was a question about, we -- there was rumors about are we discounting to be able to do that and I want to be very clear and very direct that, that is not the case. But what we are doing though is leveraging what I just spoke to, the quality of people, the products and services that we have [Technical Difficulty] booked. And they have a strong desire to complete as many projects as they can and protect their reputation. And so if you could imagine all the activities you would do, if you were a store manager or a sales rep of Sherwin-Williams and building relationships, building trust, the connectivity and consistency is important. Every day over 3,000 sales reps wake up -- Sherwin-Williams reps determined to go be a better partner for their customers. And our ability to reengage with those customers and be responsive to their needs, have the products they need anticipate what challenges they might have shifts in weather to project delays, whatever it might be, all aligned in helping us to reengage. And while we don't think we lost customers through these challenging times. We do feel as though we have lost some sales and we take great pride in our controlled model of anticipating what products they are going to need and having them there. But there were times where it may have gotten their late or we couldn't get it there when they needed it and they might have had to go somewhere else. Well, you could rest assure of one thing here. We are not going to just assume they are coming back and so we are going to be very deliberate, very active and engaged with these customers to ensure that they are back in our stores, start with a cup of coffee, make a friend, use our paint. We are going to be after it pretty regularly. Well, we are going to be converting these precious raw materials into finished goods and pursuing all segments of our business and so I think at this point, that's the extent that we want to talk about. We will talk about what we did next quarter, but we see a terrific opportunity to utilize the capacity that we have. This was a challenging time. It did give us an opportunity to look at our SKUs and rationalize some of those down that will never return. There will be simplification opportunities in what we come out as a product line with. And I would suspect that what you will see in the very near future is a little bit of expansion beyond what we had coming through last year. But we are not going to just jump back to where we were. We are going to be a better company, more efficient with our working capital. We will have the inventory we need, but it may not be spread out as wide as it has in the past, but we will have what our customers need. So I'd say this. You are right. If you look historically, there's been an opportunity there, but there's also been the opportunity to invest back in the business. And so I would answer your question this way, our determination is to make our [Technical Difficulty] and help them make more money. There are other costs that go into this, labor, transportation, all of these things that we are doing, it might not necessarily hit the gross margin line, but our investments that we invest in to help our customers in their profitability. So I'd say that each one of these, we take a very in-depth view and very thoughtful view in how we can continue to ensure that what happens as a result of all these investments, all the pricing, everything that goes into it is that our customers win and when they win, we win. And if for whatever reason, we got piggish and tried to put pricing in that didn't help our customers to achieve their goals and be more profitable, then we don't deserve that business and you are not going to see us do that. And so our investments, our commitments and the ability to help customers be successful will be the drivers. Well, I'd say we are well ahead, I think, as the leverage of talent is number one. I mentioned starting at the top with our new COO, Heidi Petz, all the way through to Group President and Performance Coatings and throughout the company, I'd say there's a terrific infusion of talent. I'd say the assets and the technology and the leveraging of the customers has been exciting. I mentioned earlier, automotive, the combination of some technology there is -- I was with one of our larger automotive refinish customers who asked, if that's why we bought auto -- or bought Valspar for the automotive finish, it was that good. So I'd say there are terrific opportunities there. The brand itself is a very strong brand and growing in relevance and importance. And I think that's terrific opportunity and one that I think were to add. I'd say if I look back and say, what we could have done differently or faster or better. I do think that coming out of 2016 when there was some hesitation on the previous leadership of Valspar to put pricing in. It took us years to recover that. And I think we learned from that and I think it's a big part of why you see the determination always I hear -- I hope you hear the determination that we have not to allow that happen. And part of that is so that we can remain healthy and serve our customers so we can continue to invest in our business. I think the working capital is another area. I think we have gotten to it. I think there's still more opportunities as are the asset utilization of the plants. So we are proud of what we have accomplished there. But I would tell you, just as we mentioned earlier, complacency kills, we are not done. There's still plenty of opportunities, and we find ourselves still prioritizing and that speaks to, I think, the quality of the company that we acquired and the quality of the people that came along with it. But we are just getting started. There's still a lot of work to be done there. Thank you."

With us on today's call are Heidi Petz, President and CEO; Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Finance; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJames Jaye: Thank you and good morning to everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered solid fourth quarter results that concluded a record year for the company, where sales grew 4.1% to $23.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 18.6% to $10.35 a share. Sales in the fourth quarter increased by a low-single digit percentage against a tough comparison, and we generated significant year-over-year gross margin improvement. As we previously described, we also continue our deliberate and accelerated investments in the business as reflected by the low-double-digit year-over-year increase in SG&A in the quarter. These investments are being made to take advantage of current market uncertainty and are aimed at driving the success of our customers and above-market growth across all businesses. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter decreased by a mid-single-digit percentage related to higher non-operating costs. We maintained our disciplined capital allocation approach and returned $641 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Sales in all three of our reportable segments were within or better than our guidance. In our architectural business, commercial and residential repaint were the strongest performers, while DIY remained challenging. In our industrial business, growth was variable by division. Sales grew in Europe and Latin America with softness in North America and Asia. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our fourth quarter results by segment and a few full-year highlights before moving on to our 2024 outlook and your questions.\nHeidi Petz: Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, where sales increased 2.3% against a mid-teens comparison. Volume drove the increase as our previous price increase annualized in September. Segment margin improved 210 basis points to 19.3%. Protective & Marine, commercial and residential repaint drove the growth. Strength in these markets was partially offset by decreases in New Residential and property management. From a product perspective, exterior and interior paint sales both increased by low-single digit percentages. Exterior sales grew faster but were a smaller part of the mix. We opened 35 new paint stores in Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter and a total of 76 new stores in 2023. We also announced a 5% price increase to our customers in the quarter effective February 1. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased by 7.1% in the quarter, which was better than our guidance. Sales increased mid-teens percentage in Europe and Latin America. Sales decreased in North America by a low-double-digit percentage as customers managed their inventories lower due to soft paint demand, partially offset by an increase in the pro paint sales. Adjusted segment margin, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and impairment charge related to trademarks in Europe and the negative impact from the significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso in December was 10.8%. The decrease from last year's fourth quarter was driven by lower volume and higher nonoperating costs. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased slightly with continued choppiness across each of our businesses and regions. Acquisitions and favorable FX were offset by lower volume. Adjusted segment margin, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the Argentine devaluation impact, improved to 17.3%. This is the fourth straight quarter this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement. This performance reflects execution of our strategy, moderating raw material costs and the ongoing value we are providing customers. Industrial wood led the growth, including the impact of recent acquisitions. Coil and Automotive Refinish also delivered solid growth. Packaging was down as expected. General industrial was impacted by lower demand in all regions. PCG sales varied significantly by region with growth in Europe and Latin America and decreases in North America and Asia-Pacific. From a full-year perspective, I'll provide just a few highlights before turning to our 2024 outlook. At this time a year ago, you'll recall an environment of tremendous macro uncertainty with single-family housing starts down an average of more than 20% for seven consecutive months, existing home sales down a similar percentage, soft PMI manufacturing indices in all regions and most economists predicting a hard recession. Against that backdrop, we provided guidance that we believed was appropriate. We also said that if conditions improved, our performance would be better than our initial guidance, and that is exactly what happened. I could not be more proud or thankful for the efforts of our 64,000 employees throughout 2023. On a consolidated basis, our team delivered record full-year sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted net income per share and net operating cash. We returned a total of $2.1 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks in 2023. We delivered these results while reinvesting in the business by design and at an accelerated rate to drive continued above-market growth and enhanced profitability. In terms of CapEx, we invested $590 million, including approximately $205 million for building our future R&D lab projects. We expect to begin occupying these facilities by the end of 2024. We ended the year with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3x. Looking at our reportable segment on a full-year basis. Paint Stores grew sales by a high-single digit percentage and expanded its margin. Sales increased in all end markets except New Residential, which was down less than 1%. This New Residential performance was remarkable given the state of the market and reflects our share gains. Performance Coatings also grew its top line while further integrating recent acquisitions and achieving a high teens adjusted segment margin. The full-year adjusted margin performance is the best since the Valspar acquisition in 2017. Consumer Brands had a challenging year on the top line with lower sales resulting from soft DIY demand, but adjusted segment margin expanded. We're confident our aggressive portfolio adjustments completed during the year, including the divestiture of noncore aerosol product lines and the China architectural business, should result in improved future profitability. I am confident that we further separated ourselves from our competitors in 2023, and that's exactly what we intend to do again in 2024. Our success in 2023 stemmed from executing on our strategy, which remains unchanged. We provide differentiated solutions that enable our customers to increase their productivity and profitability and for which they are willing to pay and stay. These solutions center on industry and application expertise, innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution. We also have momentum in the enterprise strategic priorities that are illustrated in our slide deck and I first described at our Investor Day last August. I am confident the continued execution of our strategy and our enterprise priorities will spur the next era of profitable growth for Sherwin-Williams. So turning to our outlook. We entered 2024 with confidence, energy and a commitment to seize profitable growth opportunities in our targeted end-market segments. We expect to outperform the market just as we have in the past. And while the macro environment feels better today than it did a year ago, it still contains a number of uncertainties. On the architectural side, U.S. New Residential sentiment has improved. Single-family starts have been up year-over-year for six consecutive months. Mortgage rates are expected to begin moderating but will remain well above historic levels. In residential repaint, existing home sales drove a portion of our sales and have declined year-over-year for 28 straight months. The trajectory of recovery is not clear here, and the LIRA index is forecasting negative remodeling spend in 2024. However, there are numerous other drivers for repaint, and our investments and our model give us confidence that we will continue to grow share. In new commercial, starts slowed considerably in 2023, which we expect will impact completions starting midway through 2024. Commercial lending standards have also tightened, and the Architectural Billing Index has been negative for five consecutive months. On the DIY side, we'll remain in share gain mode as we do not currently see a macroeconomic catalyst driving meaningful improvement in consumer demand, though any improvement in existing home sales could be a tailwind. On the industrial side, the PMI numbers for manufacturing in the U.S., Europe and Brazil have largely been negative for multiple months with China being slightly better recently. We expect Automotive Refinish to be our most resilient business in this environment, and we expect to see ongoing benefit from recent share gains. Industrial wood is likely to benefit from recovery in New Residential given the furniture, flooring and cabinetry end markets it serves. We expect Coil will grow driven by significant new account wins over the past year. Protective & Marine should continue to have momentum but will face challenging comps. We expect general industrial demand to remain choppy. In packaging, we expect industry volume for food and beverage cans to be flat to down in 2024. We will also see a negative short-term impact related to temporary volume shifts, which occurred as a result of our Garland production plant incident last August. We fully expect to recover this volume in stages in 2024 and 2025 while also winning new business. Longer term, we remain bullish on our packaging business and our differentiated non-BPA solutions. Our Garland plant is fully back online, and we are bringing on additional capacity in other locations during the first half of the year. We continue to have excellent new account and share-of-wallet opportunities in every business and in every region. The continued growth investments we have made over the past year give us tremendous confidence in pursuing these opportunities and gaining share. Moving to the cost environment. Our outlook assumes our raw material costs will be down by a low-single digit percentage in 2024 compared to 2023. We expect to see the largest benefit occurring in the first half of the year as comparisons become more challenging in the back half, where the entire basket decreased low-double-digits. While raw materials will likely be a benefit for us, other costs, including wages, health care, energy and transportation are expected to be up in the mid- to high-single digit range in 2024. I will remind you that these categories also inflated in 2023. Working with our customers, we delayed additional Paint Stores price increases last year given the pricing actions that we took in 2021 and 2022. We cannot however ignore these escalating costs indefinitely. As I mentioned earlier, Paint Stores Group is implementing a 5% price increase effective February 1st. The Performance Coatings and the Consumer Brands Group are also likely to have some targeted pricing activity in 2024 though at a more modest level than Paint Stores. As for our specific outlook, the slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the first quarter of 2024. The deck also includes our expectations for the full-year, where consolidated sales are expected to be up a low to mid-single-digit percentage and diluted net income per share is expected to be in the range of $10.05 to $10.55 per share. Excluding acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.80 per share, adjusted diluted net income per share is expected in the range of $10.85 to $11.35, an increase of over 7% at the midpoint compared to 2023's adjusted diluted net income per share of $10.35. We've provided a GAAP reconciliation in Reg G table within our press release. Let me provide some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Given incremental 2024 pricing, raw material deflation and Paint Stores Group, our largest and highest gross margin segment, growing sales faster than the other two segments, we would expect full-year gross margin expansion. We expect SG&A dollars to increase by a more typical level and increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2024, a moderation from the low-double-digit percentage increase we reported in 2023. We expect the investments we made last year and those we plan to make this year will enable us to grow at a multiple of the market. We plan to control costs tightly in noncustomer-facing functions. And we have a variety of SG&A levers we can pull, depending on a material change to our outlook up or down. We expect to open 80 to 100 new stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2024. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity, system improvements and product innovation. Next month, at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 18.2% to $2.86 per share, up from $2.42 last year. If approved, this will mark the 46th consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. We have a manageable $1.1 billion of long-term debt due in 2024 and expect to refinance the debt at higher rates. We expect to be within our current long-term target debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x. In addition, I will refer you to the slide deck issued with our press release this morning, which provides guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. Our team is operating with great confidence as we begin 2024. We are extremely well positioned to continue delivering shareholder value. And I want to thank John Morikis for the incredibly strong foundation he leaves with us as he moves into his role as Executive Chair. I'm also grateful for the outstanding executive leadership team surrounding me. Given that there is still a considerable amount of uncertainty in the global economy, we believe our initial 2024 outlook is an appropriate one. Should the demand environment prove to be stronger than we are currently assuming, we would expect to do better than the guidance we are laying out today. Our first quarter is a seasonally smaller one. For that reason, we will not be making any updates to full-year guidance until our second quarter is completed and we have a better view of how the painting season is unfolding. Our strategy is clear, our priorities are focused, and our people are ready. We will continue to win by providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and more profitable. We expect to deliver meaningful earnings growth in 2024. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question for today is coming from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning everyone. Heidi, I'm wondering if you could sort of break down the Paint Stores Group top line guidance for I see low single to mid-single-digits, and maybe there's 3% of net pricing there. And I guess, what I'm really trying to get at is where do you think that sales guidance would be if you hadn't made the significant growth investments in 2023. What are you anticipating you're going to get from that this year?\nHeidi Petz: Well, I'll tell you right now -- I'll start this off, and then I'll hand it over to Al to give some color commentary as well. I would start by, you said this beautifully. As you look at kind of the drivers of what's making us effective in the investments that we're laying in, we'll talk to this in a minute, but we've made some very significant choices relative to some of these segments. And I'll start with Residential Repaint. We talked about despite some of the choppiness out there, we are continuing rather to take share based on some of these investments that we laid in. It's interesting, in this environment, there's a lot of people that are out there talking about market share gains. And I would say that no one's really posting the mid-single-digit gallon gains that we're seeing versus our mid-teen comparison last year. So not everyone will be able to grow share. I'm confident that we are. And I would also say, given some of these investments, no one is better positioned in the market than we are to help these contractors. Specific to residential repaint and some of these investments, we're really able to demonstrate our model. We're interacting with these contractors that are looking to move beyond just painting but becoming business owners. So if you can imagine some of the investments that are allowing our teams, our reps to help them in real time in terms of marketing, customer acquisition, even as they look to expand into different substrates. We launched our Gallery Series last year, helping these contractors move from just walls into other surfaces in the home while they're there, kitchen cabinets being a great example. And all of these areas are really our sweet spot. So in this environment, while we're laying these investments in and we're clearly posting results, I'd also say and characterize this as the residential repaint contractor has never been more receptive to all that we can bring them in terms of our consistent store-to-store experience as they're traveling and growing, access to our highly trained reps that are helping them not just plan work, but helping them in real time to troubleshoot. So the accessibility, that's really important. So there's a list of items here that are really paying off. I'm going to hand it over to Al to give a little bit of specific color on the numbers.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Vincent. This is Al Mistysyn. Yes, when you look at the 2024 volume number, up low-single digits. If you go back to -- coming out of the second quarter of 2023 and looking at the indicators that we were, we were talking about our volumes really being flat. And as John and Heidi like to say, we got to influence the numbers. So with our line of sight being better than -- or better, the investments we made in Res Repaint and what you'll see is we expect Res Repaint to be at the high end or above the high end of that range. In the fourth quarter, you saw a low-single digit volume growth. And again, our Res Repaint volumes were up mid-single digits. So even in the short term, we're seeing the benefits of those investments, and we fully expect to realize those benefits in 2024 to accelerate our volume growth in Res Repaint.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So there's a lot of focus on the SG&A jump and administrative jump. And I guess, when you think about the roughly $300 million of the 20% investment that you had there or growth that you had there, I guess, how would you break it out in terms of just general inflation versus investment for growth versus management comp? Because primarily, the team did pretty darn well this year. So I guess, how would you break that out? And can you help us to think about on the growth investment side, the types of investments that are, I guess grabbing those costs or grabbing those dollars?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. John, if you look at the adjusted -- I'll use the adjusted increase in SG&A. Almost 70% of that is attributed to our operating segments with the majority of that being in Paint Stores Group. And as Heidi mentioned in her opening remarks, we added 35 new stores in the quarter, 76 new stores for the year as well as additional reps, which with the additional investments that we've made in the second half, our rep count is up a multiple of that. The remaining increase is evenly split between our Consumer Brands and the Pro Paint reps increases and also with our Performance Coatings Group sales and tech service reps. And John, I believe the teams have done a really good job at driving the metrics and monitoring the metrics to make sure we're going to get a return for those. And then as you mentioned, the remaining portion of the increase is really related to the admin segment and primarily compensation, including stock-based comp, which as you know is typically heavier in our fourth quarter. It's really driven by the stock price. We had some deferred comp and wage inflation. But I'd say those are the primary drivers of the SG&A. And I'd just add one more comment to that. Those will annualize in our first half next year. But we do expect, as Heidi mentioned in the opening, to be back to more typical investments and SG&A investments in 2024. So we'll see a bigger increase in our first half and at or below the range in our second half to get to that mid-single-digit range for 2024.\nHeidi Petz: John, one thing I would add to that, too, I think when you've got significant points of differentiation and you believe in your strategy, you're going to invest in them. So while we're growing faster than the market, then we're confident, as Al pointed out, on the return we're going to get here. Our heads are not in the sand. We absolutely know that it's an expense, and we expect to get a return. There's no doubt about that. But we do see this also as an investment to make sure that we continue to outpace the market.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In your remarks, you said that your raw materials, I think in the second half of 2023 were down more than 10%. And that makes sense. Your cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter was down 10%, you have higher people costs. But next year, in the first quarter, you have your easiest raw material comparison. The second quarter is pretty easy, too. So if the first quarter continuing the pattern we've seen is down again low-double-digits and the second quarter is down high-single digits, shouldn't your raw material base case for next year be down mid-single-digits rather than low-single digits?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Jeff. The way we have the raw material benefit rolling out in 2024, about 85% of that benefit is in our first half. And the assumption we're making is that we're not going to see another material drop as the year goes on. So essentially, we're annualizing the benefits that we saw through the second half of 2023. That being said, the market is driven by supply and demand, and the raw material costs are driven by supply and demand. And as we see how demand unfolds, certainly, there's plenty availability of supply in the market. That may change. But that's based -- our low-single digit outlook is based on the indicators we see today.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison: Hey, good morning. Nice end of the year. Heidi, I think you noted that resi repaint would be up or is tracking mid-single-digit volume growth in '24. And at this point, I suspect that's what you're looking at for the first quarter. I just wanted to be clear, so the market for resi repaint, would that imply it would be flat or maybe slightly up and that mid-single-digits is your outperformance? And then what are you looking for in terms of any indicators that would help you -- would suggest that the market growth could be better or worse than '24?\nHeidi Petz: So just to clarify, the mid-single-digit reference was relative to '23. So I think, yes, we would expect it to be flat. Now having said that, I'll go back to my earlier comments that the investments that we placed in, we're not waiting for the market and we don't think the market is going to help us this year. So the team was very diligent. We were very clear on putting those investments in long enough ago last year so that we were in a position to take advantage of this. So in this environment, while I would characterize the demand as flat, you can absolutely count on our ability to take share. We've got the right positioning in the market. We've got a model that allows us to absolutely understand largely not just through our stores and our reps, through our data, our ability to follow these customers to partner with these customers and helping them not just to get by with their current projects, helping them travel, helping them grow and really helping partner with them as they're looking to grow their business. So the characterization would be flat, but I would expect us absolutely to outpace the market there.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Mike, the only thing I would add to that is, you talk about indicators that might help drive the market, existing home turnover would be one of those. As interest rates moderate, and we do expect that to happen as we progress through the year, existing home turnover does have an impact; as well as home price appreciation, which is still up; the aging housing stock in the U.S.; baby boomers staying in place. All of those are driving Res Repaint. But your comment about the market being flat, we believe that could be true. But if existing home turnover would pick up, that would be a tailwind for us and likely second half view of that.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.\nGhansham Panjabi: Hi, everyone. Good morning. I guess, first off, on the Paint Stores Group pricing, maybe you can give us a sense as to how to think about the time line, the price realization specific to the segment. And I'm just asking because historically, it took a couple of quarters to realize increases. And then during the COVID supply chain chaos, it was of course, much faster just given the extent of inflation. And then also related to that, what do you expect productivity to be in 2024 in context of the non-commodity inflation, such as wages and also with all the investments you have been making? Thank you.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Ghansham. The 5% effective February 1, I do think there is a lay-in that will be similar to past price increases. I do expect to get to a similar effectiveness. Mind you, at a consolidated basis, we talk about price being up low-single digits. There's some headwind for customers that are on contracts with index pricing, small amount but a headwind. And I do expect our -- and Heidi mentioned this, the raw basket is down low-single digits. Still highly elevated over the three year period that we're looking at. We didn't go out with a price increase in 2023. And if you look at wage inflation, the health care, energy, transportation cost on that two-year stack is mid- to high-single digits. So to continue to offer the services and -- that we do and the convenience and the differentiated solutions, we need to recover some of -- recoup some of these costs.\nJames Jaye: Thanks, Ghansham.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thank you. Good morning everyone. I just wanted to ask you about the Property Maintenance subsegment. You're showing negative low-single digit number there, down from double-digit growth earlier in first half '23. Can you just address what's going on in this segment?\nHeidi Petz: Yes, property management right now, I would characterize this similar to how we look at New Residential. So this is going to be a segment, that's going to be extremely exciting to watch. We're growing share through some additional agreements with customers that at all sizes, all the way through. So it's been I think clear out in the market there's been some incremental capacity that's been entering the market, which we benefit from during construction. And then these turns become an annuity for us which is a significant part of our business. So we're looking at this on both sides. There's another piece of this. And I think if you look at the dynamics between what's happening with kind of new commercial property management, we're also benefiting from the upgrading of properties that are competing with these new units and investing in keeping their properties current and fresh. So our teams are touching certainly both the CapEx projects and maintenance as well as color and design support, trying to make our customers successful. So we're going to catch them on either side. They're -- people are going to live somewhere. So we're going to make sure that we're meeting our customers where they're at regardless of what's going on with the economy. And you can expect that we'll take share in this current environment.\nJames Jaye: Yes. Aleksey, you mentioned the fourth quarter. So property maintenance was down low-single digits in the quarter, but that was against a really strong fourth quarter a year ago, where we were north of 20%. If you look at property management for the year, I mean, it was up mid-to-high single digits. So we continue to feel good there. And the investments that Al and Heidi are talking about, many of those are aimed at growing our position there and continuing to add to what we're doing in that property maintenance segment. Thanks, Aleksey.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Mike Leithead with Barclays.\nMichael Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning team.\nAllen Mistysyn: Hey, Mike.\nMichael Leithead: Good morning. I wanted to ask on the 2024 EPS outlook. It looks like you're guiding for low-to-mid single digit top line growth. You mentioned you expect some degree of gross margin expansion, and you should also have a good amount of cash flow to deploy. So even with SG&A up a bit, I would think that leverage itself through the P&L, maybe greater than 7% EPS year-over-year. So can you maybe just walk through some of the key offsets or other items there that maybe I'm missing?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Mike. The biggest variability is on volume. And we talked about the choppiness in demand across different segments, different businesses, and different regions. And if you -- an example of paint -- well, I'll use Paint Stores Group and you look at what volume assumptions we kind of have embedded in our guidance. And I mentioned, I think Res Repaint, the market being flat with the investments we make being at the high end of our low single-digit volumes, so low-single to mid-single digits. You'll get New Residential. You've seen the positive new single-family starts for the last six months. That takes time to get through the market. And our expectation is going up against a really strong first quarter last year, our first half will be softer, and then improving in our second half. And that will be timing more than anything. Conversely, commercial, we expect to be exactly the opposite of that, where we have a line of sight to a stronger first half and then softening in the second half based on the dynamics and the indicators that we see. We just talked about property maintenance and the CapEx side being softer than we have. And as interest rates improve and lending standards get a little more open, we'd expect that to continue to improve. And P&M, we expect growth to continue. When you get into industrial, we feel very good about Auto Refinish, Coil, Industrial Wood returning with new res. But there is choppiness across each of those and including GI, and we talked about packaging in the opening. So I think, as I've mentioned in the past, volume is the single biggest driver of operating margin and leverage. If the volume is better than what we have in our guidance today, we would expect to do better than that EPS.\nMichael Leithead: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Heidi and Al, in terms of your plans, I believe you ran your plans below your volumes in 2023. If so, what was your earnings hit from that under-absorption? And should they all reverse in '24? Thank you.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, David. I would say that we saw the bigger impact of that through the first three quarters of 2023. Our expectation is we're going to see a headwind in the fourth quarter. And even though we had volume down low-single digit, I think the team did a really nice job of controlling their costs. And we actually saw a little bit of a tailwind in our fourth quarter, which allowed us to be a little bit stronger in gross margin in our fourth quarter. For 2024, my expectation is that because we're getting back to what I would call a more normalized bell curve when you look at inventories and how we build inventory coming into the spring selling season will drop inventory in our second and third quarters, and then build inventory again in our fourth quarter. It really allows -- and I'll talk specifically about our architectural plants. It really allows us to schedule those plants more efficiently plan our staffing the right way. And I do expect to see an improved performance from our global supply chain and our supply chain in general in 2024. We're not going to talk specifics on dollars in that, but we certainly expect a better performance as we get into '24.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, David. \nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners.\nMichael Harrison: Hi, good morning. Within the Consumer Brands Group, curious if you can talk a little bit about your expectations around customer order patterns into the spring paint season. It sounds like as of Q4, they were maybe still managing their inventory levels lower. But I'm just curious if right now you're expecting kind of a more normal seasonal improvement or if there's still going to be some caution on inventory management.\nHeidi Petz: Yes, Mike. Normal is exactly how I would characterize that. And I think as we've all come through the last few years, I would also say that the alignment and the partnership has never been at a better place.\nAllen Mistysyn: Mike, can I just add one thing about that that we're talking specifically DIY. On the Pros Who Paint side of that, I know it's not a huge portion of that business. But I think the team has invested in that, working closely with our partners. And we have been taking share and growing faster than the market, and we expect that to continue going into 2024.\nJames Jaye: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nJames Jaye: Hey, Greg, might be on mute. Greg.\nOperator: Greg, your line is live.\nJames Jaye: Come back to you, Greg. We'll come back to you, Greg. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.\nCharles Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone. Great quarter. When you look at the do-it-yourself business at the Paint Stores and Consumer Brands, you marked that it was weak in both areas. Can you sort of contrast the reasons for that weakness, especially at Consumer Brands, because it's the bulk of the business, whereas the Paint Stores, it's a smaller part of the business, but still significant? Thank you.\nHeidi Petz: Yes. Chuck, it's certainly an interesting environment right now. I'll start with our stores. I know you want to get to the consumer piece. As you know, in our stores, it's a small part of the business, and we are catering to a unique, I would call it a subsegment, which is a higher end customer that really values more of that high touch that we can provide. And candidly, this time of year, it's even smaller. And we'll need to see how the consumer is going to react to the macro conditions during the paint season. So I would say that it's early, and we're certainly watching that. But you talk about the Consumer Brands Group, which is obviously our focus on circling the market from every angle. So you've got more price points certainly within that environment. And Al mentioned the Pros Who Paint already. But in terms of the DIY, it certainly is -- it's a choppy market right now. We're trying to stay really close to it and being in lockstep with our retail partners to look for opportunities to continue to build strength in that end segment.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Chuck, the only thing I would add is we beat guidance in the fourth quarter. And I would say that a couple of things that drove that is less destocking than what we expected. As you typically see in the fourth quarter architecture, the seasonality, you see some destocking in the fourth quarter. But also, I give our Latin America and Europe teams, they grew low teens in the quarter, which was better than our expectations. So a little bit of positivity there.\nJames Jaye: Thanks, Chuck.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg your line is live.\nGreg Melich: Hi, hopefully, this is working now.\nHeidi Petz: Yes.\nJames Jaye: Welcome back, Greg.\nGreg Melich: Okay. Great. No, it's good to be back. So I just wanted to frame a little bit differently how important mean the gross margins back up to the middle upper part of your range. And if I take your guidance, it seems like there's another 100 bps of gross margin expansion assumed this year. How important is volume versus price raws and mix for that 100 improvement this year? And I guess that, how long do you wait before you end up raising that long-term goal?\nHeidi Petz: Well, first and foremost, it's volume. I'll go back to Al's comments earlier. We certainly are looking at the margin expansion and ultimately operating margin, but volume is no doubt the key focus. Al, I know -- Al and I are both sitting here wanting to jump at this answer. So I'll share this with him.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. No. And Greg, in 2024 price will be a little heavier than raw materials. As we talked about, raw materials will be down low-single digits, certainly nowhere near where it was in 2023. But I think Heidi said it, volume and specifically our pro architectural volume in our Paint Stores Group is what's going to drive that gross margin. It's our highest margin segment. It's growing the fastest and has the biggest opportunity. Don't get me wrong, all our segments have great opportunity in the targeted segments they play in. But certainly, Res Repaint, as we've talked in the past, largest segment, fastest growing, biggest opportunity. And like we've talked about in the past, we -- historically, we challenged the teams pretty hard. We set a tough goal for them. And as they have consistency achieving or above that goal, we'll raise the target. And we've done that in the past, and I need to get some comfort and consistency. But yes, we'll take the target up when appropriate.\nJames Jaye: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne: Yes, thank you. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions about price mix. When you look at your Paint Stores and you look at your end markets, which of them do you think you have the greatest ability to drive a mix shift? If you stroll through any of your stores, one of the characteristics that just jumps out is the huge range of price points. And I'm curious, do you see the ability for your investments to not just drive share gains in volume? But can you drive a mix shift up in price? And just conversely to that, is there any risk that you've seen in the past when you raise pricing, does it cause any of your pros to shift down to a lower price point?\nHeidi Petz: Well, Steve, I'll start. And I would say that there's absolutely opportunity to drive some improvement here in terms of mix shift. And if you look at this through our view, it's very much segment driven. And I'll go back to my earlier comments on the Res Repaint. That is such a -- and Al said this just a few moments ago. We have opportunity to gain share in every one of our targeted segments, and Residential Repaint in particular. So as you think about the opportunity for us to help this contractor, we talk a lot about helping them be more productive and more profitable. But your point is spot on here that it is our best interest to help partner with them to make them as productive as possible. So the role of premium products, making sure that they understand that the time saving, the labor cost saving that correlates to the use of some of those products is a great -- it's a win-win for them and for us. That's a great example given where the macro is right now. So we absolutely expect mix to be a significant part of that. Having said that, as we watch New Residential come back, the teams are working hard on our simplification efforts there to ensure that we continue to put the right products in the hands of the right contractors on those jobs as well. So I would expect across the board, a focus on those premium products is a critical part of our strategy.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Steve, the other part of your question, we typically do not see contractors go down in quality in an inflationary environment. Typically, in an inflationary environment, and we've talked about this in the past. We tend to do better on converting contractors to a higher quality product with the idea they're going to pay more for the product anyway. So try this better quality product. And to Heidi's point, it's going to make you more efficient and effective, and you'll get on and off jobs faster.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Josh Spector with UBS.\nJosh Spector: Yes, hi. Good morning. So I wanted to ask on Resi Repaint, kind of revisit that a little bit and maybe just kind of test the downside scenario there. So if you look over the last couple of years and say, existing home sales are down 30% plus, typically, that has some impact on Resi Repaint. Your volumes look like, generally, they haven't declined at all over the last couple of years. So I know initially that was higher contractor backlogs, and then it was remodel people put in place are stuck in their homes. In a scenario where you don't see a decline in interest rates, how do you think that that will play out for Resi Repaint? Is this a new higher base where you don't see the downside risk? Or would you see some catch-up there? Just curious on your thinking there? Thanks.\nHeidi Petz: I will tell you that we don't see a downside here and the level of -- again, if we didn't have access to, we talk about leading indicators, the data that helps us to really understand our contractors. And I'll give you a little bit of color here without going too far is what they're buying, what they're not buying, what their projects are, current and their future pipeline, where they're looking to travel as they're looking to grow and expand in the different territories. And so we're able to then, Josh, take our data, sit down with our reps and our sales managers and make sure that they are armed to truly help bring value to these contractors in a way that a competitor that doesn't have a specialty paint store just doesn't have those levers to pull. So I don't see a downside in this environment.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from John Roberts with Mizuho.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Heidi, I think when on John's first earnings call as CEO, he used the [indiscernible] meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Is that still on the playlist at Sherwin-Williams? Or you do think you came up through a different career path than John. So do you bring a different perspective to the role?\nHeidi Petz: I do. And I also think, I really find your question very interesting, because I think there is a commonality of, certainly, first and foremost, the belief that our strategy is working. I think John has contributed, we say his fingerprints are all over this company, and they absolutely are. So I have the fortune of inheriting an incredibly rock-solid foundation on which to build. And when we talk about just getting started, I couldn't agree more that we are just getting started. I think in terms of having a different background and bringing perspective into the business, I think it's important to share that my values and John's values are spot-on in terms of culture, customer focus, desire to grow, determination to win. And so bringing a perspective from outside of only a paint category, I think, only helps to continue to put our foot on the gas on what's working. And I would characterize it more maybe as a healthy challenge on where we might have opportunity to strengthen our model and just continue to grow.\nJames Jaye: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I guess I had a couple of questions around Paint Stores Group. So first off, is there any way that you could help us understand the magnitude of share gains? It would seem that given the strong growth in Resi Repaint that you've enjoyed share gains for a little while. So is there any mechanism to keep those going? Or maybe you can just help us understand how much share you've gained over the last couple of years. And then furthermore, on the sales guidance, low-to-mid single digits, usually PSG is at the upper end of that. So is that still your expectation for '24? And would you expect that to improve as you go through the year, i.e., maybe second and third quarter at the upper end of that mid-single digit range or even above? Thanks.\nHeidi Petz: Yes. Hi, Arun, I'll start with your first question, and then I'll kick it over to Al for your second one. You mentioned Res Repaint, so I won't touch that. But in terms of -- I won't get into the numbers, but you asked about the magnitude of share gains. And I would point to, candidly, the rest of the segment. So New Residential here is where we're obviously playing a long game, but we're continuing to take share by expanding the number of agreements that we've secured. Even in these very challenging times, we've been able to secure incremental agreements. And we're doing that at a time when there's a lot of pressure on starts. And so as you fast forward and play this out and as the cycle plays out, and it will, our position here is going to be even more significant as these new agreements begin to really pay off with the acceleration of housing starts. Property management, we hit on that a bit -- I hit on that a bit earlier. But I would say that it's very similar in terms of our ability in this environment to demonstrate our value and secure some of these incremental agreements, again, in property management, that will be true, certainly at the national, regional, and the local level. Our teams have been able to really penetrate based on a lot of the data that we've got access to there. Certainly, a lot of benefit Commercial, Protective & Marine, two segments that I would say are largely focused on product technology, specifications, and really great distribution. These businesses are both strong, and we're working very hard every day to put distance between ourselves and our competition. And I would go maybe a step further on commercial, where we're confident is we're well positioned in every subsegment within commercial. So when Al mentioned, we've got stronger view in the first half, it might look more soft in the second half. We're prepared to meet our -- these contractors where they are as they're looking to shift and transition within subsegments. So I'm confident that even despite where the market goes, we're going to intercept them.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. So Arun, with our consolidated forecast being up low-to-mid, that would tell you on a consolidated basis, we expect volume to be flat to up low-single digits. And to your point, Res Repaint certainly would be above the high, be up low to mid. But where we think the second half will play out and could we be above that range is really what Heidi just said on New Residential, the timing of that recovery and the timing of projects on Commercial through our first half into our second half. And that will dictate how our second half outlook will be determined.\nJames Jaye: Thanks, Arun.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs.\nDuffy Fischer: Yes, good morning. A question on SG&A. So historically, you guys have had positive leverage on growth in SG&A growth that changed last year. It still seems like it's going to be negative in the first half of this year, maybe going to neutral in the back half. Structurally, has something changed in the market or with your model? Or will that revert back to positive leverage in '25 and '26, and what this will be is just kind of a short-term bump maybe to kind of push through the high pricing that you've put through on raw materials? But just structurally, SG&A versus sales longer term, do we get back to a positive leverage there?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Duffy. I think what you've heard us talk about in the past and going forward is our focus at driving operating margin leverage, and that's either going to come through gross margin expansion or SG&A leverage. And you're right, as we see a stronger top line, stronger gross margin expansion than we were planning, we are going to take the opportunity because of our confidence in our strategy to add incremental investments or accelerate investments in our long-term growth strategies, because we know based on our history from our data, from our metrics that we're going to get a return for those investments. And ad nauseam, you've heard me talk about 2008 and '09 a continued investments through that cycle in the high-single, low-double digit 10-year compounded average growth rates. And we believe we're in a very similar environment. So there are years where we are going to get SG&A leverage. And I believe you're right, we're going to annualize the investments, the strong investments we made in the second half and maybe have some deleveraging in our first half. But as we get back to the more normal cadence of investments, we'll see deleveraging. And then as the market normalizes and demand normalizes and we take an outsized share of that demand, we'll see leverage on our SG&A going out.\nJames Jaye: Thanks, Duffy.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes, thank you and good morning. About two weeks ago, the trade press reported that one of your competitors Kelly-Moore, is essentially going out of business as I understand it. And so my question would be, does that open the door for Sherwin to gain a little bit more share than you otherwise would perhaps on the West Coast? And if so, are you allocating resources any differently? Or might anything change operationally to take advantage of that void before your competitors act to do so?\nHeidi Petz: Well, Kevin, I would tell you that that void is absolutely our opportunity. And I won't get into details here, but I can share with you that you should expect us to be very competitive with that announcement.\nJames Jaye: Yes. I think a very aggressive approach, as Heidi says. We've been making the investments. And I would tell you, Kevin, Kelly-Moore, amongst all of our competitors, we're competing with all of them all of the time. And so they've certainly been on our radar, certainly been aggressively going after them for many years. We're going to continue to accelerate here and see that as a great opportunity. Thank you, Kevin.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks. Just a clarification question for me. It sounds like you have the Paint Stores price increasing your guidance in advance of the Feb 1st implementation date. Just hoping you could confirm that. And then maybe just speak to the pacing of gross margin expansion as the year unfolds?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Garik. We absolutely have the price increase for Paint Stores as well as targeted price increases across each of the other segments in our full-year guidance. The -- when you look at our gross margin and the expansion, we expect it's probably going to be a little heavier in our first half with, like I talked about, the stronger raw material deflation that we're going to see in our first half plus the pricing in our first half. And so we'll see a little bit more expansion in our first half. And then although we do expect our second half to continue with the expansion, it just won't be as much year-over-year. Plus we're going against a tougher comp on our second half when it comes to our gross margin.\nJames Jaye: Thanks, Garik.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just on the new res market, can you maybe remind us what the typical lag between a start and when the paint sale gets made? And I guess, beyond that, have you at least been seeing the declines in that market for you guys to moderate as you move through the back half and into the first half of next year?\nHeidi Petz: Yes, Adam. The lag that we've traditionally described would have traditionally been about four months. And I think that's elongated a bit, probably in another two months, largely due to labor shortages and some other factors that are weighing in there. In terms of the other piece, Al, I'll hand it over to you. You can make some comments on that.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Adam. I think what our expectation is as new single-family starts, it continued to improve. Our first half will be -- one, just to be clear, if you look at 2023, the new single-family up starts were down significantly. As Heidi talked in the opening, we were down only slightly, which tells you we're taking share in that market, and we expect to continue to take share in that market. Our national account team, along with the field of Paint Stores Group field organization, do a terrific job at servicing those customers and adding tremendous value to those large national, regional builders and even local custom builders. So that being said, we are going to go up against a tougher comparison in our first quarter. So we do expect to be not as strong in our first half. But then as we see these completion -- starts coming to completion where painting is at the end of that project or that house, we expect to see a stronger second half.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard: On the price increase, I appreciate the headline. Al, you're pretty clear on the price increases in the guidance for Paint Stores and then the other segments. I'm just curious in terms of implementation of this, Heidi, as you get started and take a price increase to market. The feedback on that, and I'm also curious related to that, I know over the cycle that the mix gets better. But I'm curious if you have any observation of a different mix experience in any of the areas now in the current environment?\nHeidi Petz: Yes. I would say the conversations, as we mentioned in the earlier prepared remarks, we do this with our customers. And so as we took this out towards the end of last year, it was making sure that they understand why we're going out with this, but also making sure that they're prepared to pass this along and make sure that they're not absorbing that. I think the conversation here quickly becomes making sure that there's a greater outcome here for a focus on the premium products. And that's what we're going to continue to focus on.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Eric, I think to your point on the mix, I mean, we can point to across each of the segments and the opportunity that each of our painting contractors have. As you know, paint is a small portion of a painting project, and that goes for -- when you think about the cost of painting a new house or cost of painting a commercial job. So it's like really a small portion of the overall cost. But if you -- as you elevate to the higher qualities, they get such a great efficiency improvement. They can get on and off jobs faster. And over the last three or four years that we've been talking about labor shortages, it really is a big driver of that mix shift. So again, opportunities across all of the segments. And our painting contractors are understanding, boy, I can get more top line and bottom line growth with the same number of workers by moving to a higher quality product.\nHeidi Petz: The other piece I would mention on that is we talk about value and that we're out demonstrating our value to these contractors every day. And so when we bring a price to them, Eric, it's -- we're not having a price conversation. We're making sure they understand holistically. Again, I'll go back to my earlier comments in terms of access to the rep, the store-to-store consistency and our ability to help with them with leads, help them with bidding activity. So it's a very different discussion than I think many others in our industry are having.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, Eric.\nOperator: You final question for today is coming from Patrick Cunningham with Citi.\nEric Zhang: Hi, this is Eric Zhang on for Patrick. Can you provide an update on contractor backlogs and repair and remodel activity for the quarter? And where do you see levels for both in 2024 relative to 2023? Thank you.\nHeidi Petz: I would say they're normalizing. I don't have a lot of color. I think as you look at some of the visibility into backlog, it's not as long as we have with other segments such as commercial. So to Al's earlier comment, we'll -- like everybody else, we'll know more in the next quarter or two. But at this point, it's pretty limited in terms of future visibility. So the base characteristic would be that it's normalized at the current state.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, Patrick. Eric, I'm sorry.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'll now turn the call over to Jim Jaye for closing remarks.\nJames Jaye: Well, thank you again, everybody, for joining us today. I hope you heard today that we're very confident in our strategy, and we're going to deliver an increased sales and earnings this year even as an environment continues to be choppy. So as always, we'll be available to answer your questions over the next few days, and thanks for joining us today. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Heidi Petz",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, where sales increased 2.3% against a mid-teens comparison. Volume drove the increase as our previous price increase annualized in September. Segment margin improved 210 basis points to 19.3%. Protective & Marine, commercial and residential repaint drove the growth. Strength in these markets was partially offset by decreases in New Residential and property management. From a product perspective, exterior and interior paint sales both increased by low-single digit percentages. Exterior sales grew faster but were a smaller part of the mix. We opened 35 new paint stores in Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter and a total of 76 new stores in 2023. We also announced a 5% price increase to our customers in the quarter effective February 1. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased by 7.1% in the quarter, which was better than our guidance. Sales increased mid-teens percentage in Europe and Latin America. Sales decreased in North America by a low-double-digit percentage as customers managed their inventories lower due to soft paint demand, partially offset by an increase in the pro paint sales. Adjusted segment margin, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and impairment charge related to trademarks in Europe and the negative impact from the significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso in December was 10.8%. The decrease from last year's fourth quarter was driven by lower volume and higher nonoperating costs. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased slightly with continued choppiness across each of our businesses and regions. Acquisitions and favorable FX were offset by lower volume. Adjusted segment margin, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the Argentine devaluation impact, improved to 17.3%. This is the fourth straight quarter this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement. This performance reflects execution of our strategy, moderating raw material costs and the ongoing value we are providing customers. Industrial wood led the growth, including the impact of recent acquisitions. Coil and Automotive Refinish also delivered solid growth. Packaging was down as expected. General industrial was impacted by lower demand in all regions. PCG sales varied significantly by region with growth in Europe and Latin America and decreases in North America and Asia-Pacific. From a full-year perspective, I'll provide just a few highlights before turning to our 2024 outlook. At this time a year ago, you'll recall an environment of tremendous macro uncertainty with single-family housing starts down an average of more than 20% for seven consecutive months, existing home sales down a similar percentage, soft PMI manufacturing indices in all regions and most economists predicting a hard recession. Against that backdrop, we provided guidance that we believed was appropriate. We also said that if conditions improved, our performance would be better than our initial guidance, and that is exactly what happened. I could not be more proud or thankful for the efforts of our 64,000 employees throughout 2023. On a consolidated basis, our team delivered record full-year sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted net income per share and net operating cash. We returned a total of $2.1 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks in 2023. We delivered these results while reinvesting in the business by design and at an accelerated rate to drive continued above-market growth and enhanced profitability. In terms of CapEx, we invested $590 million, including approximately $205 million for building our future R&D lab projects. We expect to begin occupying these facilities by the end of 2024. We ended the year with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3x. Looking at our reportable segment on a full-year basis. Paint Stores grew sales by a high-single digit percentage and expanded its margin. Sales increased in all end markets except New Residential, which was down less than 1%. This New Residential performance was remarkable given the state of the market and reflects our share gains. Performance Coatings also grew its top line while further integrating recent acquisitions and achieving a high teens adjusted segment margin. The full-year adjusted margin performance is the best since the Valspar acquisition in 2017. Consumer Brands had a challenging year on the top line with lower sales resulting from soft DIY demand, but adjusted segment margin expanded. We're confident our aggressive portfolio adjustments completed during the year, including the divestiture of noncore aerosol product lines and the China architectural business, should result in improved future profitability. I am confident that we further separated ourselves from our competitors in 2023, and that's exactly what we intend to do again in 2024. Our success in 2023 stemmed from executing on our strategy, which remains unchanged. We provide differentiated solutions that enable our customers to increase their productivity and profitability and for which they are willing to pay and stay. These solutions center on industry and application expertise, innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution. We also have momentum in the enterprise strategic priorities that are illustrated in our slide deck and I first described at our Investor Day last August. I am confident the continued execution of our strategy and our enterprise priorities will spur the next era of profitable growth for Sherwin-Williams. So turning to our outlook. We entered 2024 with confidence, energy and a commitment to seize profitable growth opportunities in our targeted end-market segments. We expect to outperform the market just as we have in the past. And while the macro environment feels better today than it did a year ago, it still contains a number of uncertainties. On the architectural side, U.S. New Residential sentiment has improved. Single-family starts have been up year-over-year for six consecutive months. Mortgage rates are expected to begin moderating but will remain well above historic levels. In residential repaint, existing home sales drove a portion of our sales and have declined year-over-year for 28 straight months. The trajectory of recovery is not clear here, and the LIRA index is forecasting negative remodeling spend in 2024. However, there are numerous other drivers for repaint, and our investments and our model give us confidence that we will continue to grow share. In new commercial, starts slowed considerably in 2023, which we expect will impact completions starting midway through 2024. Commercial lending standards have also tightened, and the Architectural Billing Index has been negative for five consecutive months. On the DIY side, we'll remain in share gain mode as we do not currently see a macroeconomic catalyst driving meaningful improvement in consumer demand, though any improvement in existing home sales could be a tailwind. On the industrial side, the PMI numbers for manufacturing in the U.S., Europe and Brazil have largely been negative for multiple months with China being slightly better recently. We expect Automotive Refinish to be our most resilient business in this environment, and we expect to see ongoing benefit from recent share gains. Industrial wood is likely to benefit from recovery in New Residential given the furniture, flooring and cabinetry end markets it serves. We expect Coil will grow driven by significant new account wins over the past year. Protective & Marine should continue to have momentum but will face challenging comps. We expect general industrial demand to remain choppy. In packaging, we expect industry volume for food and beverage cans to be flat to down in 2024. We will also see a negative short-term impact related to temporary volume shifts, which occurred as a result of our Garland production plant incident last August. We fully expect to recover this volume in stages in 2024 and 2025 while also winning new business. Longer term, we remain bullish on our packaging business and our differentiated non-BPA solutions. Our Garland plant is fully back online, and we are bringing on additional capacity in other locations during the first half of the year. We continue to have excellent new account and share-of-wallet opportunities in every business and in every region. The continued growth investments we have made over the past year give us tremendous confidence in pursuing these opportunities and gaining share. Moving to the cost environment. Our outlook assumes our raw material costs will be down by a low-single digit percentage in 2024 compared to 2023. We expect to see the largest benefit occurring in the first half of the year as comparisons become more challenging in the back half, where the entire basket decreased low-double-digits. While raw materials will likely be a benefit for us, other costs, including wages, health care, energy and transportation are expected to be up in the mid- to high-single digit range in 2024. I will remind you that these categories also inflated in 2023. Working with our customers, we delayed additional Paint Stores price increases last year given the pricing actions that we took in 2021 and 2022. We cannot however ignore these escalating costs indefinitely. As I mentioned earlier, Paint Stores Group is implementing a 5% price increase effective February 1st. The Performance Coatings and the Consumer Brands Group are also likely to have some targeted pricing activity in 2024 though at a more modest level than Paint Stores. As for our specific outlook, the slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the first quarter of 2024. The deck also includes our expectations for the full-year, where consolidated sales are expected to be up a low to mid-single-digit percentage and diluted net income per share is expected to be in the range of $10.05 to $10.55 per share. Excluding acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.80 per share, adjusted diluted net income per share is expected in the range of $10.85 to $11.35, an increase of over 7% at the midpoint compared to 2023's adjusted diluted net income per share of $10.35. We've provided a GAAP reconciliation in Reg G table within our press release. Let me provide some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Given incremental 2024 pricing, raw material deflation and Paint Stores Group, our largest and highest gross margin segment, growing sales faster than the other two segments, we would expect full-year gross margin expansion. We expect SG&A dollars to increase by a more typical level and increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2024, a moderation from the low-double-digit percentage increase we reported in 2023. We expect the investments we made last year and those we plan to make this year will enable us to grow at a multiple of the market. We plan to control costs tightly in noncustomer-facing functions. And we have a variety of SG&A levers we can pull, depending on a material change to our outlook up or down. We expect to open 80 to 100 new stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2024. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity, system improvements and product innovation. Next month, at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 18.2% to $2.86 per share, up from $2.42 last year. If approved, this will mark the 46th consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. We have a manageable $1.1 billion of long-term debt due in 2024 and expect to refinance the debt at higher rates. We expect to be within our current long-term target debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x. In addition, I will refer you to the slide deck issued with our press release this morning, which provides guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. Our team is operating with great confidence as we begin 2024. We are extremely well positioned to continue delivering shareholder value. And I want to thank John Morikis for the incredibly strong foundation he leaves with us as he moves into his role as Executive Chair. I'm also grateful for the outstanding executive leadership team surrounding me. Given that there is still a considerable amount of uncertainty in the global economy, we believe our initial 2024 outlook is an appropriate one. Should the demand environment prove to be stronger than we are currently assuming, we would expect to do better than the guidance we are laying out today. Our first quarter is a seasonally smaller one. For that reason, we will not be making any updates to full-year guidance until our second quarter is completed and we have a better view of how the painting season is unfolding. Our strategy is clear, our priorities are focused, and our people are ready. We will continue to win by providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and more profitable. We expect to deliver meaningful earnings growth in 2024. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Well, I'll tell you right now -- I'll start this off, and then I'll hand it over to Al to give some color commentary as well. I would start by, you said this beautifully. As you look at kind of the drivers of what's making us effective in the investments that we're laying in, we'll talk to this in a minute, but we've made some very significant choices relative to some of these segments. And I'll start with Residential Repaint. We talked about despite some of the choppiness out there, we are continuing rather to take share based on some of these investments that we laid in. It's interesting, in this environment, there's a lot of people that are out there talking about market share gains. And I would say that no one's really posting the mid-single-digit gallon gains that we're seeing versus our mid-teen comparison last year. So not everyone will be able to grow share. I'm confident that we are. And I would also say, given some of these investments, no one is better positioned in the market than we are to help these contractors. Specific to residential repaint and some of these investments, we're really able to demonstrate our model. We're interacting with these contractors that are looking to move beyond just painting but becoming business owners. So if you can imagine some of the investments that are allowing our teams, our reps to help them in real time in terms of marketing, customer acquisition, even as they look to expand into different substrates. We launched our Gallery Series last year, helping these contractors move from just walls into other surfaces in the home while they're there, kitchen cabinets being a great example. And all of these areas are really our sweet spot. So in this environment, while we're laying these investments in and we're clearly posting results, I'd also say and characterize this as the residential repaint contractor has never been more receptive to all that we can bring them in terms of our consistent store-to-store experience as they're traveling and growing, access to our highly trained reps that are helping them not just plan work, but helping them in real time to troubleshoot. So the accessibility, that's really important. So there's a list of items here that are really paying off. I'm going to hand it over to Al to give a little bit of specific color on the numbers. John, one thing I would add to that, too, I think when you've got significant points of differentiation and you believe in your strategy, you're going to invest in them. So while we're growing faster than the market, then we're confident, as Al pointed out, on the return we're going to get here. Our heads are not in the sand. We absolutely know that it's an expense, and we expect to get a return. There's no doubt about that. But we do see this also as an investment to make sure that we continue to outpace the market. So just to clarify, the mid-single-digit reference was relative to '23. So I think, yes, we would expect it to be flat. Now having said that, I'll go back to my earlier comments that the investments that we placed in, we're not waiting for the market and we don't think the market is going to help us this year. So the team was very diligent. We were very clear on putting those investments in long enough ago last year so that we were in a position to take advantage of this. So in this environment, while I would characterize the demand as flat, you can absolutely count on our ability to take share. We've got the right positioning in the market. We've got a model that allows us to absolutely understand largely not just through our stores and our reps, through our data, our ability to follow these customers to partner with these customers and helping them not just to get by with their current projects, helping them travel, helping them grow and really helping partner with them as they're looking to grow their business. So the characterization would be flat, but I would expect us absolutely to outpace the market there. Yes, property management right now, I would characterize this similar to how we look at New Residential. So this is going to be a segment, that's going to be extremely exciting to watch. We're growing share through some additional agreements with customers that at all sizes, all the way through. So it's been I think clear out in the market there's been some incremental capacity that's been entering the market, which we benefit from during construction. And then these turns become an annuity for us which is a significant part of our business. So we're looking at this on both sides. There's another piece of this. And I think if you look at the dynamics between what's happening with kind of new commercial property management, we're also benefiting from the upgrading of properties that are competing with these new units and investing in keeping their properties current and fresh. So our teams are touching certainly both the CapEx projects and maintenance as well as color and design support, trying to make our customers successful. So we're going to catch them on either side. They're -- people are going to live somewhere. So we're going to make sure that we're meeting our customers where they're at regardless of what's going on with the economy. And you can expect that we'll take share in this current environment. Yes, Mike. Normal is exactly how I would characterize that. And I think as we've all come through the last few years, I would also say that the alignment and the partnership has never been at a better place. Yes. Chuck, it's certainly an interesting environment right now. I'll start with our stores. I know you want to get to the consumer piece. As you know, in our stores, it's a small part of the business, and we are catering to a unique, I would call it a subsegment, which is a higher end customer that really values more of that high touch that we can provide. And candidly, this time of year, it's even smaller. And we'll need to see how the consumer is going to react to the macro conditions during the paint season. So I would say that it's early, and we're certainly watching that. But you talk about the Consumer Brands Group, which is obviously our focus on circling the market from every angle. So you've got more price points certainly within that environment. And Al mentioned the Pros Who Paint already. But in terms of the DIY, it certainly is -- it's a choppy market right now. We're trying to stay really close to it and being in lockstep with our retail partners to look for opportunities to continue to build strength in that end segment. Yes. Well, first and foremost, it's volume. I'll go back to Al's comments earlier. We certainly are looking at the margin expansion and ultimately operating margin, but volume is no doubt the key focus. Al, I know -- Al and I are both sitting here wanting to jump at this answer. So I'll share this with him. Well, Steve, I'll start. And I would say that there's absolutely opportunity to drive some improvement here in terms of mix shift. And if you look at this through our view, it's very much segment driven. And I'll go back to my earlier comments on the Res Repaint. That is such a -- and Al said this just a few moments ago. We have opportunity to gain share in every one of our targeted segments, and Residential Repaint in particular. So as you think about the opportunity for us to help this contractor, we talk a lot about helping them be more productive and more profitable. But your point is spot on here that it is our best interest to help partner with them to make them as productive as possible. So the role of premium products, making sure that they understand that the time saving, the labor cost saving that correlates to the use of some of those products is a great -- it's a win-win for them and for us. That's a great example given where the macro is right now. So we absolutely expect mix to be a significant part of that. Having said that, as we watch New Residential come back, the teams are working hard on our simplification efforts there to ensure that we continue to put the right products in the hands of the right contractors on those jobs as well. So I would expect across the board, a focus on those premium products is a critical part of our strategy. I will tell you that we don't see a downside here and the level of -- again, if we didn't have access to, we talk about leading indicators, the data that helps us to really understand our contractors. And I'll give you a little bit of color here without going too far is what they're buying, what they're not buying, what their projects are, current and their future pipeline, where they're looking to travel as they're looking to grow and expand in the different territories. And so we're able to then, Josh, take our data, sit down with our reps and our sales managers and make sure that they are armed to truly help bring value to these contractors in a way that a competitor that doesn't have a specialty paint store just doesn't have those levers to pull. So I don't see a downside in this environment. I do. And I also think, I really find your question very interesting, because I think there is a commonality of, certainly, first and foremost, the belief that our strategy is working. I think John has contributed, we say his fingerprints are all over this company, and they absolutely are. So I have the fortune of inheriting an incredibly rock-solid foundation on which to build. And when we talk about just getting started, I couldn't agree more that we are just getting started. I think in terms of having a different background and bringing perspective into the business, I think it's important to share that my values and John's values are spot-on in terms of culture, customer focus, desire to grow, determination to win. And so bringing a perspective from outside of only a paint category, I think, only helps to continue to put our foot on the gas on what's working. And I would characterize it more maybe as a healthy challenge on where we might have opportunity to strengthen our model and just continue to grow. Yes. Hi, Arun, I'll start with your first question, and then I'll kick it over to Al for your second one. You mentioned Res Repaint, so I won't touch that. But in terms of -- I won't get into the numbers, but you asked about the magnitude of share gains. And I would point to, candidly, the rest of the segment. So New Residential here is where we're obviously playing a long game, but we're continuing to take share by expanding the number of agreements that we've secured. Even in these very challenging times, we've been able to secure incremental agreements. And we're doing that at a time when there's a lot of pressure on starts. And so as you fast forward and play this out and as the cycle plays out, and it will, our position here is going to be even more significant as these new agreements begin to really pay off with the acceleration of housing starts. Property management, we hit on that a bit -- I hit on that a bit earlier. But I would say that it's very similar in terms of our ability in this environment to demonstrate our value and secure some of these incremental agreements, again, in property management, that will be true, certainly at the national, regional, and the local level. Our teams have been able to really penetrate based on a lot of the data that we've got access to there. Certainly, a lot of benefit Commercial, Protective & Marine, two segments that I would say are largely focused on product technology, specifications, and really great distribution. These businesses are both strong, and we're working very hard every day to put distance between ourselves and our competition. And I would go maybe a step further on commercial, where we're confident is we're well positioned in every subsegment within commercial. So when Al mentioned, we've got stronger view in the first half, it might look more soft in the second half. We're prepared to meet our -- these contractors where they are as they're looking to shift and transition within subsegments. So I'm confident that even despite where the market goes, we're going to intercept them. Well, Kevin, I would tell you that that void is absolutely our opportunity. And I won't get into details here, but I can share with you that you should expect us to be very competitive with that announcement. Yes, Adam. The lag that we've traditionally described would have traditionally been about four months. And I think that's elongated a bit, probably in another two months, largely due to labor shortages and some other factors that are weighing in there. In terms of the other piece, Al, I'll hand it over to you. You can make some comments on that. Yes. I would say the conversations, as we mentioned in the earlier prepared remarks, we do this with our customers. And so as we took this out towards the end of last year, it was making sure that they understand why we're going out with this, but also making sure that they're prepared to pass this along and make sure that they're not absorbing that. I think the conversation here quickly becomes making sure that there's a greater outcome here for a focus on the premium products. And that's what we're going to continue to focus on. The other piece I would mention on that is we talk about value and that we're out demonstrating our value to these contractors every day. And so when we bring a price to them, Eric, it's -- we're not having a price conversation. We're making sure they understand holistically. Again, I'll go back to my earlier comments in terms of access to the rep, the store-to-store consistency and our ability to help with them with leads, help them with bidding activity. So it's a very different discussion than I think many others in our industry are having. I would say they're normalizing. I don't have a lot of color. I think as you look at some of the visibility into backlog, it's not as long as we have with other segments such as commercial. So to Al's earlier comment, we'll -- like everybody else, we'll know more in the next quarter or two. But at this point, it's pretty limited in terms of future visibility. So the base characteristic would be that it's normalized at the current state."

            "name": "Allen Mistysyn",
            "content": "Yes, Vincent. This is Al Mistysyn. Yes, when you look at the 2024 volume number, up low-single digits. If you go back to -- coming out of the second quarter of 2023 and looking at the indicators that we were, we were talking about our volumes really being flat. And as John and Heidi like to say, we got to influence the numbers. So with our line of sight being better than -- or better, the investments we made in Res Repaint and what you'll see is we expect Res Repaint to be at the high end or above the high end of that range. In the fourth quarter, you saw a low-single digit volume growth. And again, our Res Repaint volumes were up mid-single digits. So even in the short term, we're seeing the benefits of those investments, and we fully expect to realize those benefits in 2024 to accelerate our volume growth in Res Repaint. Yes. John, if you look at the adjusted -- I'll use the adjusted increase in SG&A. Almost 70% of that is attributed to our operating segments with the majority of that being in Paint Stores Group. And as Heidi mentioned in her opening remarks, we added 35 new stores in the quarter, 76 new stores for the year as well as additional reps, which with the additional investments that we've made in the second half, our rep count is up a multiple of that. The remaining increase is evenly split between our Consumer Brands and the Pro Paint reps increases and also with our Performance Coatings Group sales and tech service reps. And John, I believe the teams have done a really good job at driving the metrics and monitoring the metrics to make sure we're going to get a return for those. And then as you mentioned, the remaining portion of the increase is really related to the admin segment and primarily compensation, including stock-based comp, which as you know is typically heavier in our fourth quarter. It's really driven by the stock price. We had some deferred comp and wage inflation. But I'd say those are the primary drivers of the SG&A. And I'd just add one more comment to that. Those will annualize in our first half next year. But we do expect, as Heidi mentioned in the opening, to be back to more typical investments and SG&A investments in 2024. So we'll see a bigger increase in our first half and at or below the range in our second half to get to that mid-single-digit range for 2024. Yes, Jeff. The way we have the raw material benefit rolling out in 2024, about 85% of that benefit is in our first half. And the assumption we're making is that we're not going to see another material drop as the year goes on. So essentially, we're annualizing the benefits that we saw through the second half of 2023. That being said, the market is driven by supply and demand, and the raw material costs are driven by supply and demand. And as we see how demand unfolds, certainly, there's plenty availability of supply in the market. That may change. But that's based -- our low-single digit outlook is based on the indicators we see today. Yes. Mike, the only thing I would add to that is, you talk about indicators that might help drive the market, existing home turnover would be one of those. As interest rates moderate, and we do expect that to happen as we progress through the year, existing home turnover does have an impact; as well as home price appreciation, which is still up; the aging housing stock in the U.S.; baby boomers staying in place. All of those are driving Res Repaint. But your comment about the market being flat, we believe that could be true. But if existing home turnover would pick up, that would be a tailwind for us and likely second half view of that. Yes, Ghansham. The 5% effective February 1, I do think there is a lay-in that will be similar to past price increases. I do expect to get to a similar effectiveness. Mind you, at a consolidated basis, we talk about price being up low-single digits. There's some headwind for customers that are on contracts with index pricing, small amount but a headwind. And I do expect our -- and Heidi mentioned this, the raw basket is down low-single digits. Still highly elevated over the three year period that we're looking at. We didn't go out with a price increase in 2023. And if you look at wage inflation, the health care, energy, transportation cost on that two-year stack is mid- to high-single digits. So to continue to offer the services and -- that we do and the convenience and the differentiated solutions, we need to recover some of -- recoup some of these costs. Hey, Mike. Yes, Mike. The biggest variability is on volume. And we talked about the choppiness in demand across different segments, different businesses, and different regions. And if you -- an example of paint -- well, I'll use Paint Stores Group and you look at what volume assumptions we kind of have embedded in our guidance. And I mentioned, I think Res Repaint, the market being flat with the investments we make being at the high end of our low single-digit volumes, so low-single to mid-single digits. You'll get New Residential. You've seen the positive new single-family starts for the last six months. That takes time to get through the market. And our expectation is going up against a really strong first quarter last year, our first half will be softer, and then improving in our second half. And that will be timing more than anything. Conversely, commercial, we expect to be exactly the opposite of that, where we have a line of sight to a stronger first half and then softening in the second half based on the dynamics and the indicators that we see. We just talked about property maintenance and the CapEx side being softer than we have. And as interest rates improve and lending standards get a little more open, we'd expect that to continue to improve. And P&M, we expect growth to continue. When you get into industrial, we feel very good about Auto Refinish, Coil, Industrial Wood returning with new res. But there is choppiness across each of those and including GI, and we talked about packaging in the opening. So I think, as I've mentioned in the past, volume is the single biggest driver of operating margin and leverage. If the volume is better than what we have in our guidance today, we would expect to do better than that EPS. Yes, David. I would say that we saw the bigger impact of that through the first three quarters of 2023. Our expectation is we're going to see a headwind in the fourth quarter. And even though we had volume down low-single digit, I think the team did a really nice job of controlling their costs. And we actually saw a little bit of a tailwind in our fourth quarter, which allowed us to be a little bit stronger in gross margin in our fourth quarter. For 2024, my expectation is that because we're getting back to what I would call a more normalized bell curve when you look at inventories and how we build inventory coming into the spring selling season will drop inventory in our second and third quarters, and then build inventory again in our fourth quarter. It really allows -- and I'll talk specifically about our architectural plants. It really allows us to schedule those plants more efficiently plan our staffing the right way. And I do expect to see an improved performance from our global supply chain and our supply chain in general in 2024. We're not going to talk specifics on dollars in that, but we certainly expect a better performance as we get into '24. Mike, can I just add one thing about that that we're talking specifically DIY. On the Pros Who Paint side of that, I know it's not a huge portion of that business. But I think the team has invested in that, working closely with our partners. And we have been taking share and growing faster than the market, and we expect that to continue going into 2024. Yes. Chuck, the only thing I would add is we beat guidance in the fourth quarter. And I would say that a couple of things that drove that is less destocking than what we expected. As you typically see in the fourth quarter architecture, the seasonality, you see some destocking in the fourth quarter. But also, I give our Latin America and Europe teams, they grew low teens in the quarter, which was better than our expectations. So a little bit of positivity there. Yes. No. And Greg, in 2024 price will be a little heavier than raw materials. As we talked about, raw materials will be down low-single digits, certainly nowhere near where it was in 2023. But I think Heidi said it, volume and specifically our pro architectural volume in our Paint Stores Group is what's going to drive that gross margin. It's our highest margin segment. It's growing the fastest and has the biggest opportunity. Don't get me wrong, all our segments have great opportunity in the targeted segments they play in. But certainly, Res Repaint, as we've talked in the past, largest segment, fastest growing, biggest opportunity. And like we've talked about in the past, we -- historically, we challenged the teams pretty hard. We set a tough goal for them. And as they have consistency achieving or above that goal, we'll raise the target. And we've done that in the past, and I need to get some comfort and consistency. But yes, we'll take the target up when appropriate. Yes. Steve, the other part of your question, we typically do not see contractors go down in quality in an inflationary environment. Typically, in an inflationary environment, and we've talked about this in the past. We tend to do better on converting contractors to a higher quality product with the idea they're going to pay more for the product anyway. So try this better quality product. And to Heidi's point, it's going to make you more efficient and effective, and you'll get on and off jobs faster. Yes. So Arun, with our consolidated forecast being up low-to-mid, that would tell you on a consolidated basis, we expect volume to be flat to up low-single digits. And to your point, Res Repaint certainly would be above the high, be up low to mid. But where we think the second half will play out and could we be above that range is really what Heidi just said on New Residential, the timing of that recovery and the timing of projects on Commercial through our first half into our second half. And that will dictate how our second half outlook will be determined. Yes, Duffy. I think what you've heard us talk about in the past and going forward is our focus at driving operating margin leverage, and that's either going to come through gross margin expansion or SG&A leverage. And you're right, as we see a stronger top line, stronger gross margin expansion than we were planning, we are going to take the opportunity because of our confidence in our strategy to add incremental investments or accelerate investments in our long-term growth strategies, because we know based on our history from our data, from our metrics that we're going to get a return for those investments. And ad nauseam, you've heard me talk about 2008 and '09 a continued investments through that cycle in the high-single, low-double digit 10-year compounded average growth rates. And we believe we're in a very similar environment. So there are years where we are going to get SG&A leverage. And I believe you're right, we're going to annualize the investments, the strong investments we made in the second half and maybe have some deleveraging in our first half. But as we get back to the more normal cadence of investments, we'll see deleveraging. And then as the market normalizes and demand normalizes and we take an outsized share of that demand, we'll see leverage on our SG&A going out. Yes, Garik. We absolutely have the price increase for Paint Stores as well as targeted price increases across each of the other segments in our full-year guidance. The -- when you look at our gross margin and the expansion, we expect it's probably going to be a little heavier in our first half with, like I talked about, the stronger raw material deflation that we're going to see in our first half plus the pricing in our first half. And so we'll see a little bit more expansion in our first half. And then although we do expect our second half to continue with the expansion, it just won't be as much year-over-year. Plus we're going against a tougher comp on our second half when it comes to our gross margin. Yes, Adam. I think what our expectation is as new single-family starts, it continued to improve. Our first half will be -- one, just to be clear, if you look at 2023, the new single-family up starts were down significantly. As Heidi talked in the opening, we were down only slightly, which tells you we're taking share in that market, and we expect to continue to take share in that market. Our national account team, along with the field of Paint Stores Group field organization, do a terrific job at servicing those customers and adding tremendous value to those large national, regional builders and even local custom builders. So that being said, we are going to go up against a tougher comparison in our first quarter. So we do expect to be not as strong in our first half. But then as we see these completion -- starts coming to completion where painting is at the end of that project or that house, we expect to see a stronger second half. Yes. Eric, I think to your point on the mix, I mean, we can point to across each of the segments and the opportunity that each of our painting contractors have. As you know, paint is a small portion of a painting project, and that goes for -- when you think about the cost of painting a new house or cost of painting a commercial job. So it's like really a small portion of the overall cost. But if you -- as you elevate to the higher qualities, they get such a great efficiency improvement. They can get on and off jobs faster. And over the last three or four years that we've been talking about labor shortages, it really is a big driver of that mix shift. So again, opportunities across all of the segments. And our painting contractors are understanding, boy, I can get more top line and bottom line growth with the same number of workers by moving to a higher quality product."

This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com beginning approximately 2 hours after this conference call concludes.  This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.  I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Joining me on the call today are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; Heidi Petz, President and Chief Operating Officer; Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; and Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President of Enterprise Finance.  Sherwin-Williams delivered excellent third quarter results compared to the same period a year ago. These results follow our strong first half, and we are again increasing our full year guidance, which John will talk about in just a few minutes. But first, let me touch on a few third quarter highlights.  Consolidated net sales were within our guidance range. Consolidated gross margin expanded significantly sequentially and year-over-year driven by pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs.  To reiterate our commentary from last quarter, we are committed to investing in and profitably growing the business at the same time. The high single-digit increase in SG&A over the prior year third quarter reflects those investments, which are deliberately being made at a higher level to take advantage of current market uncertainty and are aimed at driving the success of our customers and growth across all businesses.  Operating margin expanded year-over-year and adjusted diluted net income per share grew by a double-digit percentage. EBITDA also grew by a double-digit percentage with adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.7% near the high end of our current 19% to 21% target range.  In addition, we returned $566 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.  Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our third quarter results by segment. John will follow Heidi with comments on our outlook before we move on to your questions.\nHeidi Petz: Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group. Third quarter Paint Stores Group sales increased 3.6% against the challenging 21.5% comp. The increase was driven by continued effective pricing and higher Pro architectural volume, excluding New Residential. Segment margin improved sequentially and year-over-year to 25.9%, driven by pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs.  Protective & Marine was the fastest growing in the quarter, driven by strong volume as sales increased by a double-digit percentage against the mid-teens comparison. Industrial flooring, infrastructure and oil and gas applications remain key drivers. In our Pro architectural end markets commercial sales were strongest, increasing by a high single-digit percentage versus a high teens comparison.  Residential repaint sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage amid continued softness in existing home sales and against a 20% comparison. While this is a solid performance in the current environment, we are not satisfied, and res repaint continues to be our largest opportunity for growth. Property maintenance sales grew by a low single-digit percentage against a mid-20s comparison.  New Residential sales were down mid-single digits with volume down high single digits against the mid-20s comparison. As we've previously noted, we anticipated New Residential would be challenging near term, given prior softness in single-family starts. We expect our continued share gains and new account wins to become more and more apparent as starts improve. Our DIY business was down low single digits against a very difficult low 30s comparison.  From a product perspective, interior paint sales were up low single digits and exterior paint sales were flat, both against double-digit comparisons in last year's third quarter. Sales in our Consumer Brands Group decreased by 4% in the quarter, primarily due to the divestiture of the China architectural business and softer DIY demand in North America, which was partially offset by selling price increases.  Sales in North America, our largest region, decreased by a mid-single-digit percentage against a double-digit comparison. The Pros Who Paint category continued to grow, while DIY demand remained muted by inflationary pressures on consumers. We continue to invest here with our strategic retail partners for growth.  In other regions, sales were up high single digits in Latin America and low double digits in Europe. Sales in China were down high double digits as we completed divestiture of the business on August 1.  Adjusted segment margin was 13.8%, which was lower than a year ago, primarily due to lower sales volume and lower fixed cost absorption due to lower production volumes.  Sales in the Performance Coatings Group decreased 1% against a low teens comparison. Volume decreased by a high single-digit percentage, but was partially offset by positive low single-digit contribution from pricing, FX and acquisitions. Adjusted segment margin increased to 19.1% of sales, primarily due to pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs.  Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. Sales were strongest in Europe and increased by a mid-teens percentage. Latin America sales increased by low single digits against a mid-teens comp. North America sales decreased mid-single digits against a 20% comp. Demand in Asia remained weak, with sales down double digits against high single-digit growth a year ago.  From a division perspective, growth was strongest in our Industrial Wood business, which was up by a low double-digit percentage against a mid-single-digit comparison. This growth reflects our ICA acquisition, share gains and a potential bottoming of New Residential construction. We expect to gain further momentum in this business. As we closed October 1st on the previously announced acquisition of Germany-based specialized industrial coatings holding comprised of the Oskar Nolte and Klumpp Coatings businesses.  We are gaining share and seeing steady demand in Auto Refinish, where sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage against a high single-digit comparison. Sales in Coil and General Industrial both decreased by low single-digit percentages against challenging comparisons and vary widely by region.  Packaging sales were down by a mid-teens percentage against the high single-digit comparison. We anticipated this decline given the near-term destocking by brand owners that we described earlier this year. Packaging sales in the quarter were also slightly impacted by the fire at our Garland, Texas plant. Our business continuity team is executing our contingency plans to minimize customer impacts from this event near term. Longer term, we continue to feel very good about our position and growth prospects in this end market, and we expect to bring additional capacity online at our , France plant by early 2024.  With that, let me turn it to John for his comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the year.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Heidi. Our team delivered another strong quarter in an environment characterized by ongoing uncertainty. My thanks go to our 64,000 employees for continuing to focus on our mission and for executing on our strategy. Their energy in serving our customers and providing them with solutions remains a true differentiator.  On our July call, we described the anticipated second half demand backdrop across our businesses. The third quarter played out much as we expected, and we believe the environment remains largely unchanged in the fourth quarter. Paint Stores Group will face another strong year-over-year comparison. Demand in commercial, property maintenance, residential repaint and Protective & Marine remains stable with New Residential remaining soft as we expected. We have now annualized prior price increases.  In Consumer Brands, North America DIY demand remained soft. Europe demand has stabilized and Latin America markets remain mixed. Performance Coatings demand remains highly variable by end market and by region. We know we cannot defy gravity in terms of the macro environment. What we can do is aggressively pursue new account and share of wallet opportunities to drive market share gains, we are aggressively focused on doing just that.  Moving to the cost side. We're narrowing our full year raw material outlook. We expect cost to be down by a high single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect other costs, including wages and other input costs to be up in the mid- to high single-digit range. We also continue to see the current market uncertainty as an opportunity to press our advantages through greater investment in solutions for our customers that will drive their success and ours. Our SG&A spend in the fourth quarter will reflect these investments, leading full year SG&A to increase in the high single-digit to low double-digit range compared to last year. This approach has served us well many times in the past. We are highly confident and will again now resulting in continued above-market growth and strong returns.  Now moving on to our specific guidance. We anticipate our fourth quarter 2023 consolidated net sales will be up or down a low single-digit percentage compared to a high single-digit increase in the fourth quarter of 2022, with volume flat to down slightly. As a reminder, we've largely annualized previous price increases across the business.  For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be up a low single-digit percentage with volume down a low single-digit percentage. Our sales expectations by segment for the fourth quarter and the full year are included in the slide deck issued with our press release this morning. We are increasing our full year 2023 diluted net income per share to be in the range of $9.21 to $9.41 per share. We believe this increased range accurately reflects our strong third quarter performance, continued pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs while also acknowledging the ongoing uncertainty in our seasonally smaller fourth quarter. This guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.80 per share and restructuring related net expense of $0.09 per share.  On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $10.10 to $10.30. This is an increase of 16.8% at the midpoint compared to last year's $8.73 adjusted earnings per share. We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. Our slide deck includes additional information on our assumptions for the year.  As we begin the fourth quarter, we continue to expect choppiness by region and end market. More importantly, we continue to see opportunity amid uncertainty, and we are extremely confident in how well our various businesses are positioned. Our strategy is clear. It's working, and it's not changing. We'll continue to provide our customers with differentiated solutions that drive their productivity and their profitability.  Our capabilities, products and services are unique. We remain on offense, growing new accounts and share of wallet in the right markets with the right customers. We also remain focused on developing and retaining talent and improving and simplifying our operations. We expect to finish the year with momentum that will carry us into 2024.  I have the utmost confidence in Heidi, Al, our leadership team and our people. Together, we expect to continue outperforming our competitors and the market.  This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from John McNulty from BMO.\nJohn McNulty: And first, John, congratulations on a great tenure in the CEO slot. And Heidi best of luck to you as you take on that role at the end of the year.  So I guess the first thing I wanted to just touch on was the strength of the contractor market. Can you give us a little bit of color as to what you're seeing, especially in the residential repaint area. It looks like it's been maybe a little bit stronger than what we would have expected. So just curious your take on how to think about that continuing going forward.\nHeidi Petz: Yes. I think you make a great point here. I want to take a minute before I jump right into res repaint, which I absolutely will and just put this a bit in perspective.  You heard from some of our prepared remarks that when we look at our performance in general, and we're posting some stronger results up against really aggressive comps last year. I think that's an important piece that we anchor in as I get into the res repaints. repaint certainly New Res being up against over 20% comps here and still in this environment, continuing to post. So we're really proud of the team to be able to overcome some of that.  So I think if I just jump right into Res repaint, I'll let you know that yes, we are gaining share in this market. Demand does vary depending on a few variables. I think if you look at this and separate a bit, those contractors that are more established and well-known and are more experienced in marketing their business, they've got the scale and they're confident in their backlog. I would say that's more so true for them than those that have less experience being able to put that type of focus on in marketing their business.  So I'd say there's a bit of a variance there. But we look at this importantly. The adversity that these contractors are facing in this choppiness is also an opportunity where I believe that it makes our stores and our reps even more valuable as we're helping them navigate through a lot of this uncertainty and helping to intercept what it is that they're trying to accomplish in their business, whether it's leads or making sure that we're helping them finding ways to be more efficient in their process.  So I think if we've seen this movie before, we're ready for what's ahead. We're putting investments in. John referenced earlier in the SG&A that you see, and I'll take you back. We saw this coming in 2008 and 2009. And making sure that what came out of that was our desire to be well positioned and New Residential does recover, that we've got all the investments in place here to continue to drive res repaint. So this is an opportunity where, where and I would say when, our model stands out and when we're able to gain a lot of share.\nJohn McNulty: Got it. Fair enough. And I guess the second question is just around cost versus price. It looks like raws are coming down, but you've highlighted in the remarks that other costs are definitely still pushing higher and you're also still investing in the business. So can you help us to think about the need for further pricing? I know you've taken a little bit of a pause recently as you normally do in the paint season. But I guess, how should we be thinking about the need for further pricing as you're pushing into 2024?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, John, this is Al Mistysyn. And we're in that part of the year where we're going through our operating plans. We're reviewing really demand outlook with our suppliers. I know we've gotten a lot of questions about oil ticking up, and that has to be up for a period of time before we see that flow through our raw material basket.  I think what you will see is the other cost input items increasing, I think merit increases will get back to a more normal level, but you've got health care, freight, some of the things going on with LTL carriers that are driving our overall costs up. So as we typically do, we push back and look for offsets as much as we can.  And then when we can't -- don't feel like we have an offset and we need to go out with price, we'll tell this to our customers first and, then we'll talk to the Street. So we're going through that process, and we need a little more time to figure that out, and we'll let our customers know and then we'll come back and let the street know.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Wondering if I could just dig into the SG&A a bit more. Understand completely and appreciate what you're doing this year. But how do we think about that into '24, both in terms of what level of increase is realistic for next year, presumably SG&A is not going to go down, but should it grow a lot less than normal just given the big step up this year?  And then how do we think about from the outside over the next couple of years measuring the return on that? Is it simply going to come through the volume line in Paint Stores Group, or do you think it's going to be about margin or both? As we -- we're here 2 years from now, and we do a look back, what do you want us to see specifically in the P&L?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Vincent, let me start with that last piece because I think it's really important. And again, I want to reiterate the confidence that we have in our strategy and the fact that we've seen this movie before. The investments that we're making, you will see in the P&L, and you will see in market share growth. Our teams are invested in executing on these areas. But I think another important area that's crucial that you won't be able to measure on our P&L is the success that we'll bring with our customers as well.  So if you go back to the strategy that we employ, it's focused on driving the success of our customers. And these investments that we're making will clearly help our customers in achieving what it is that their trying to do. And so I think as you look forward, the expectation should be increased market share and outpacing the market in volume and profitability as well.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Vincent, I would say certainly, as we annualize costs or the investments in our long-term growth initiatives, you're going to see that in the first part of the year. But I'd highlight, if you look at our SG&A sequentially second quarter to third quarter, even though we kept investing in Paint Stores Group and reps, Performance Coatings Group sales and tech service reps and you have investments in the Pros Who Paints. We saw those offset by reductions in our G&A costs or admin SG&A so that we're trying to figure out ways to continue to drive G&A down to offset the incremental cost of those investments.  And yes, we will absolutely measure the return. But as we get into 2024, we're going through our budgeting plan. We're going through key initiatives across each of our functional areas, and we'll keep driving both those costs lower to help pay for the incremental investments.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: I know that the year-over-year price comparisons are less positive than they've been. But when you look at sequential pricing from the second to the third quarter, were your prices down sequentially in any important product area?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Jeff, if you look at our pricing because you annualize pricing throughout each of the segments as we've gone. I know we've talked about Performance Coatings through basically, at some point, through on a 90-day cycle. So price was still up in the quarter, in the third quarter, up low single digit. But if you look at that compared to our second quarter, price would have added a mid single-digit percentage in the second quarter. So -- and as you get into our fourth quarter, you'd be at a lower single-digit impact on our fourth quarter. So that's just annualizing the price increases we've taken throughout '22. But I would argue and say, we have not given that price back. And you can see that in our gross margin performance in the second quarter, up -- 440 up in the third -- third quarter of 490 basis points, and we expect to be up again in our fourth quarter, along with the moderating raw material cost sequentially.\nHeidi Petz: Jeff, I would add to that as well. I think our effectiveness is at a record high, and I give the team a lot of credit because it's not just about holding it, it's about demonstrating that value every single day with our contractors.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Okay, great. And your raw materials were down high single digits. I would imagine they would be down low double digits in the fourth quarter, if you're going to be down high single digits for the year. And maybe the fourth quarter is sort of the bottoming of raw materials for the industry in general. Is that fair?\nAllen Mistysyn: Jeff, I don't know I'd go that far. As I mentioned earlier, I think we have to look at the -- market is still demand, supply driven. We're working with our suppliers to develop what does industry demand look like across each of the regions. And I think that's going to be a bigger driver of raw material pricing as we get into 2024. I think as we mentioned on our second quarter call, we expected our third quarter to be our biggest year-over-year change in raw material costs, but certainly, they're going to be down in our fourth quarter as well.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.\nGregory Melich: I had a couple of questions. One is, how much did the volume decline year-on-year hurt gross margins in the quarter?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. I think Greg, the -- when you look at the volume decline being overall down low single digit, certainly, as I've talked about, that's always typically the biggest driver of operating margin leverage.  When you look at how that mix changes in the quarter, so we talked about Paint Stores Group being flat and then the other 2 segments being down more than that. So it was less of an impact than if Paint Stores was down similar, if that makes sense to you, because Paint Stores Group has a higher gross margin profile.\nGregory Melich: So it may have hurt, but not as much as you think, given the mix of where the volume decline was?\nAllen Mistysyn: Correct.\nGregory Melich: Okay. And then I guess my follow-up question is more specifically on architectural. Could you give us some update on what the backlog that you're hearing about or what it sounds like from the PROs, particularly in resi repaint, you mentioned how new residentials weak, but I'd love to hear more on the new res -- I'm sorry, the resi repaint side.\nHeidi Petz: Yes, Greg, I think on the res repaint side, it's similar to what I mentioned earlier. I think you look at -- traditionally, you're going to see somewhere between 13, 15 weeks out, I would say that, that backlog has come down by 2 or 3 weeks, so a bit more limited in terms of visibility. But outside of that, again, I would look at it in terms of the size of the contractor, the level of experience, again, ability to market themselves. They've got further out site line into '24 versus some of the other smaller contractors that are still trying to find ways to kind of build those backlog.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.\nGhansham Panjabi: I guess with the reversal high on interest rates since you last reported and just sort of building on the last question, how do you think this dynamic will play out for your 6 verticals within PSG relative to what you saw with the first iteration of interest rate increases because it seems like some of that was just dampened -- some of the impact was dampened by the fact that the backlogs were actually very strong coming into this year.\nJohn Morikis: Well, I think I'd describe it this way, that there's some uncertainty given the challenges and interest rate can have on our market. And I think Heidi and the team are really focused on one very clear mission. We're going to outpace the market. And we've got confidence in the approach that we're taking, the services that we bring to the products that we are introducing. And quite frankly, we're also taking advantage of other opportunities within the market. We've got competitors that are changing models as an example.  And our simplified approach of dealing with 1 Sherwin-Williams stores as it relates to the painting contractor, we believe adds value. So the investments that we're making will enhance that on top of the organic growth that we expect from our stores. And so we're taking advantage of market conditions where Heidi just mentioned some res repaint customers that may not have had experience going through a cycle yet. They are now turning to our people for guidance and support on how do you begin advertising.  In the past, they just park their truck in front of a car -- I'm sorry, a truck in front of a house in the neighborhood and all the neighbors would flock in. They need help right now. And so they're turning to our people, and our people are playing an important role. And so when we look at what's happening with interest rates, there's some choppiness, but we also believe it creates opportunity. And we talked openly about adversity creates opportunity at Sherwin, and we're capitalizing on that.\nHeidi Petz: The piece I would add to that. I think New Residential specifically relative to interest rates, while the single-family completions have been flat or negative year-over-year for 8 straight months. We are starting to see the starts are positive year-over-year for 3 straight months.  So we're watching interest rates very closely, it may also signal that we're past the bottom. So knowing that this is a choppy environment. Another point that I think is important here, while others are talking, the market are talking about preparing for the slowdown, it's really important that our teams are laser-focused on preparing for taking disproportionate shares.  So we went into COVID with a large majority of exclusive arrangements, with multi -- with the national homebuilders, and we've come out building momentum in a number of exclusive contracts that we have with some of these builders. I think that's a testament to the team's ability to demonstrate our value in this environment.  And I'm going to take it a step further here, and this goes back to some of the discussion on working capital. We talk about managing our working capital really closely. And -- but as we're having these partnerships and trying to demonstrate more of Sherwin's value proposition, especially in the New Residential space and in this environment, helping to get in front of -- helping them to streamline and standardize what it is that they're doing in terms of the product that they're bringing to market so they can be as aggressive as possible, helping them look at ways to reduce cycle time, and this all in an effort to, of course, help them drive increased profitability and productivity, but also to be as effective as they can be with their working capital again in this environment with a lot of volatility in the interest rate.\nGhansham Panjabi: Got it. And then in terms of free cash flow allocation, I guess, going back to the fact that interest rates are much higher. It looks like you have about a little over $2 billion of debt due for refinancing between '24 and '25. How are you thinking about the terminal sort of balance sheet leverage for Sherwin-Williams at this point, given the changed interest rate environment?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Ghansham. I think you remember, coming into the year, I said, I thought we'd keep our total debt flat with year-end 2022. But as you saw at the end of the third quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.2x versus 3.1%, and that was a combination of a strong -- you'll get a trailing 12-month EBITDA growth of over almost -- a little over 28%. But we also reduced our total debt by almost $600 million. I would expect as we kind of forecast the end of the year, would keep that total debt lower year-over-year by about $600 million and will be firmly in that 2 to 2.5x range.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC.\nArun Viswanathan: I guess, I just had to maybe get your thoughts on Protective and the other markets within Industrial. What are you seeing maybe if you can just run through some of those verticals? Apologies if I missed that earlier, but it seemed like wood was unusually strong. We're expecting some weakness there, but that was actually better Protective & Marine, obviously, strong; Refinish, I would imagine there's still strong; Packaging, weak. Could you just reiterate what you're seeing in those markets?\nHeidi Petz: Yes. I think, first and foremost, I think it's indicative that our strategy is working. And when we look at this business and this portfolio, it's really important. I'll share with you what we talk about internally, which is we're not trying to be all things to all people. And so when you look across these businesses, making sure that the discipline and how we're thinking about investment, the discipline and when we're investing is certainly a key part of this.  So maybe just a little bit of across some of these divisions on the -- John, rather jump in as well. You start with -- you mentioned Industrial Wood. There's been a lot of wins here against some regional competitors. And while we mentioned earlier, U.S. housing is continuing to soften. We think this is an opportunity for us just coming out of completing some key acquisitions that we mentioned in our prepared remarks, with Oskar Nolte and Klumpp. It feels like we're in a really good position here to continue to drive increased value and return of value to our shareholders.  Our gallons per day appeared to have bottomed out in all regions, again, so as the New Residential swings back, we expect Industrial Wood to absolutely come along for the ride there.  I'll comment briefly on Automotive Refinish. I think importantly, we've had some really good share gain here. Year-to-date installs in North America have been up strong double digits, and our core users are growing. We talked a bit about our Collision Core technology and business. That momentum and adoption is continuing. And this is a suite of digital tools and solutions that truly is helping to benefit our business here.  And I would also add along with our North America footprint. Similar think of our Paint Stores Group similar to that footprint. We're really able to have a better opportunity to control a more consistent customer experience beginning to end here with our Auto Refinish, which we think is an incredible differentiator for us.  We talked a bit about General Industrial, heavy equipment market is rolling up, especially in Ag, and we continue to -- we expect to see that continue. Building products, general finishing is soft, but we've expected that the team is laser focused on pivoting and adapting to the market.  In the Coil side, North America is holding up better than the other regions, still soft, but the team is working really hard against some new business wins. And then nearshoring in Mexico continues to create demand for us. So we're managing that across the regions very carefully. One comment on Coil as well. I would say that most of the China coaters are running at about 50% capacity. So we expect there to be some forward opportunity there as well.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Arun, I think you mentioned on your question about P&M. I think the team there is doing a terrific job of really staying focused on the value proposition as we bring into high-value projects. So EV battery plants as an example, semiconductor plants, Heidi, and I were just recently out at one of the largest plants I've ever been on. And our floor coating teams are all over these businesses.  I think the offshore wind and other alternative energy investments as well as water infrastructure. I mean, these are all areas that we're focused on. And I'll remind you, it wasn't long ago, we were talking about our Protective & Marine business at a time when it was under pressure. We reminded our investment -- investors that we take this long-term approach.  And I believe these are terrific examples of our continuing to invest, even when times were a little tough, knowing that these projects can be delayed, but they can't be canceled. Oftentimes, you'll find highly corrosive areas that needed to be coated. You might get an extra year or a year or 2 out of those. But they needed to be coated.  And it's those types of high-value projects that are almost kind of a return repeat businesses as you maintain those that add to the attractiveness of these coatings. So we're really proud of Karl Jorgenrud, the entire leadership team within our PCG business for what they're delivering. And importantly, if you -- I'll remind you of the operating margin goals that we had set for this team at 19%. It's come in at 19%. Our goal of getting up into the high teens, low 20s. So they're doing it, and they're doing it by bringing value to our customers and to us.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the M&A side. Given what you said in those different verticals, do you see the need to add capacity inorganically in any of those areas and similarly divesting businesses or what would you share on that side?\nHeidi Petz: Well, we've said certainly in our investor call recently and we say this consistently, but we don't need M&A to grow. There's a lot of confidence in every segment that we have for us to continue to take share organically. And so from a capacity standpoint, we've continued to be very strategic about where we are laying that capacity in. And I'll go back to Al's point, all of that is by design. As we look at our 10-year CapEx plans, our 10-year demand plans, certainly, we don't want to put anything that's net new to the system if it's not needed. But where we need that capacity, we're going to do that.\nJohn Morikis: The one point I do want to add, I don't know if Heidi mentioned, Packaging or not, but that's an area that we continue to invest. It's not so much needed through acquisition or M&A, Arun. It's more through our investment of a very unique technology, so the packaging business, particularly our V70 product is a very unique technology. And as quickly as we can bring capacity onboard, it's sold out. So I think that's an area that we will continue to invest in.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: On your gross margins, they were near your long-term target in the quarter. And it sounds like it will be above that target in Q4. So given that, how high can it go this cycle? Can they approach or even exceed 50%?\nAllen Mistysyn: David, one caveat to that, that I would make. When you look at our quarter gross margin because you typically see an -- seasonal architectural slowdown in volumes and sales. The fourth quarter margin may or may not be sequentially improving. It's our smallest quarter. You have year-end adjustments and other year-end adjustments that have -- could have a material impact on the gross margin.  Also, just reiterate that price increases aren't going to be as big of a tailwind in our fourth quarter than what we saw in our third quarter. And the other side of that Paint Stores Group is going to grow faster in our fourth quarter that will help drive gross margin.  As we talked about at our Investor Day, we are at a current range of 45% to 48%. We set aggressive goals for our teams. And as we consistently achieve that current range, we'll adjust the range. I don't think we're ready to sit here today and make a change to any range or talk about 2024 at this point. But we're going to be consistent in our approach going forward.\nHeidi Petz: David, I would just add, very simply, there is no ceiling.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good. And Heidi and John, just looking at past DIY cycle weaknesses, what does it take or what do you need to see, to think to see a reversal of the current DIY cycle weakness here?\nJohn Morikis: Well, clearly, the consumer is feeling some pressure from an inflation perspective. And there'll be some normalization, if it's in wages increases -- have wage increasing or the spending patterns of consumers that will take effect.  But the fact is this, that I'll remind you that paint is a relatively inexpensive, yet highly impactful opportunity for people that are interested in their home, staying in their homes to make a difference. And if people decide they're not going to sell the home, they're going to stay in place, it's a very viable option.  I'll remind you the average home age now is over 40 years old. So there's more and more investment in the structures, people aging in place is impacting as well. And additionally, I would say, not only does it help the DIY, but as the population is aging, that generally will turn into more of a res repaint opportunity, which helps our position in that space as well.  We don't want 70-year-old people out there scraping their gutters and eaves of their homes. But inside, yes, DIY is going to be an important part. There's a cycle, and we're playing the long game here, whichever way the table tilts we'll be there.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS.\nJoshua Spector: I guess two ones, more for macro around the stores group. I guess, first, when I look at U.S. completion data for New Res, it looked like that was kind of flat, you guys reported down mid-single digits. I assume you get some pricing. I don't know if that's a regional divergence or something else you'd call out? Maybe I'll stop with that one first.\nJohn Morikis: Well, I think what you're experiencing right now is the delay between housing starts and the -- whatever, 90 days or so, after maybe a little bit longer, after a start before homes are painted. So our view, and Heidi mentioned this. When you look at -- and I think where your question is going is around the share -- our share of New Residential.  Our position here is very strong and getting stronger every day. Heidi mentioned the exclusive arrangements that continue to grow in count. Our relationship with the New Residential builder and our commitment to helping their profitability and success is helping us grow those customers.  It's delayed right now because the more agreements that we are signing right now and with the pressure on the starts, we're not seeing that. But I can tell you with great confidence that, as the new homes continue to rise, and they will. I mean everyone would agree there's a higher demand than there is supply right now.  Family formation continues. There's a hole right now that exists in housing availability. When that comes back, we're going to be there coil spring that we've been in the past, and it's exciting actually to see our teams winning at the rate that they're winning, and it will show up on the scoreboard.\nJoshua Spector: Okay. I appreciate that. And just on the other side of it, when you think about the resi repaint side, not just Sherwin, but maybe the industry. So I mean we still have turnover down about 1/3 from the peak a couple of years ago. Has the industry fully digested that. So if contractor backlogs reflect that, have orders reflected that. And just -- I mean, how are you thinking that plays out into next year? Is there another leg down in the industry to normalize to that, if we don't have a step up, or have we already reflected that in the current run rate?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. I think it's been reflected. If you take a few quarters back here, we were talking about res repaint contractors that, in many cases, weren't even returning phone calls. There were many people who were saying that they'd come out and give you a quote in 6 to 9 months. And then it would be about a year before they could get to the project.  So there has been a more normalized reality, if you will, as it relates to the residential repaint contractor. Again, I'll reiterate that this adversity creates opportunity for Sherwin-Williams. You should bet, right now, as we are here, in this moment, that our customers are getting visited with Sherwin-William's representatives. You should also bet that our competitors' customers are getting visited as well. So we're not playing nice here. We're going after some pretty aggressive market share gains, and we expect to win aggressively.\nHeidi Petz: And I would add to that, too, Josh, I think there's a lot of confusion in the marketplace right now. And our opportunity, John mentioned, adversity is our friend. And I couldn't agree more with that.  Our strategy is working here, and I'll take you to -- we talk about our control distribution platform. We owned the stores, we own the reps, the store manager owns that P&L. The store manager owns staffing, owns the culture of that store. And I think it's really important because when we talk about that relationship and the consistent experience we can offer these res repaint contractors, it's critical that they know exactly what they can get from the experience they can have at Sherwin-Williams.  And so as they're coming in, as they are traveling, as they're trying to grow and take on more, our teams are prepared, trained and ready to get any tools that they need in front of them, to help them to become as productive and profitable as possible. So I'm really confident in how we are prepared to differentiate as we add value to this contractor.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners.\nMichael Harrison: You have opened 36 new paint store locations so far this year. Is the target still 82/100? And are you seeing any delays in either the permitting process or the construction process?\nHeidi Petz: Mike, yes, we expect to build as we said it. And no, we do not expect any delays. I think this is really important. When we look at our commitment to the team, to the Street, we're opening the new store every 3 days, and there's puts and takes in terms of timing. You can imagine our strategy is reflecting our desire to chase the density and the volume. And some of those markets, there's unique nuances where we're timing getting into a certain market in a certain area. But our commitment to getting to those stores is critical because we still continue to see a return on those stores at a rapid clip, and we think there's a lot of opportunities to chase for future density there.\nMichael Harrison: All right. And then within the consumer business, one of your competitors suggested that sell-in to the big-box retailers have been weaker than sell-out. It suggests that maybe there's been some inventory work down this year. Do you have any thoughts on how point of sale with some of your key customers as compared to your volumes into those customers? And I guess whether big box inventories at this point in the year are below where you would expect them to be.\nHeidi Petz: Well. First of all, we wouldn't comment on anything specific to our customers. So -- but what I can share with you with our approach that we're taking partners. And again, we do talk openly about making sure that success is our customer success. So when we're looking at making sure that they are at the right inventory levels, helping them thinking through how to manage to optimize our working capital. You can rest assured that those conversations are happening on a daily basis. So we'll let them speak to their specific strategy here.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. And I think that's really important. I'd like the way that Heidi frame that, that we gauge our success by how successful our customers are. And so we're actually working with our customers, encouraging them to manage their working capital so that they can put their cash to work and be more successful. And Al, maybe you want to talk a little bit about what the impact of that might be because we're trying to drive reasonable or acceptable working capital, not only for us but for our customers.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. I'd start with, Mike, that as we typically do, we saw our inventory gallons decreased sequentially as we -- we're getting back to a more typical bell curve. We grow inventory into the summer selling season. We see incremental decreases as we go through the second half, and then we'll build inventory in our fourth quarter. That consistency allows our customers to also manage their inventories better because you're back to a more normal environment.  To that point, I would say, we expect our working capital trend towards 11% to 11.5%. We were at 12% coming out of the third quarter. So we're well on track for that. And what it's allowing us to do is drive significant cash flow, and you saw that in our third quarter and that's a combination of strong net income results and working capital management. And we expect to flow that through into our fourth quarter and have a really strong cash year that's allowed us to be very flexible. Ghansham talked about, our ability to pay down debt, but it also allowed us to return cash to our shareholders in dividends and buybacks, and we've returned over $1.4 billion to our shareholders over that time. So in this high interest rate environment, we get back to our more normal operating cadence with inventory, and you'll see us manage our working capital down which then allows that consistency to allow our customers to manage their working capital down.\nHeidi Petz: And one piece I would add to that as well, I go back to Al's point here. We put by design very intentional capacity to work here so that as we're partnering closely to manage and optimize working capital and inventory with our partners that we've got the confidence that we can have the capacity to build the inventory in time for the season ahead.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs.\nPatrick Fischer: John, you've often talked about things like sprayers being a good leading indicator what you're seeing in your stores with like a 1- to 2-quarter lag. What is that equipment sale telling you today about what the next couple of quarters holds for the store sales?\nJohn Morikis: Well, Duffy, I'd say that, what it's telling me now is that we're ending a season. So I'd say, while we talk about that, typically, the greatest correlation between those types of sales and confidence is usually as we go into the season. As we're coming out of the season, we are continuing to see spray parts right now move.  And I'd say right now, as we've talked, there's a choppiness in the market, but we have confidence in our position in the market, and we'll see how this unfolds next year as we go into the paint season. Coming out of it, though, it's typically not the best tool to use to gain a level of confidence of contractors.\nHeidi Petz: But what we are seeing there too, despite the sprayers is the backlog of projects for our commercial contractors continues to be solid, well through the midpoint of next year. So getting back to more of that normal cycle. So good indicator of some growth there.\nPatrick Fischer: Fair. And then Heidi, I think you made a comment that your gallons per day had bottomed in your view. I didn't understand -- was that for the company as a whole or was that for Paint Stores Group and that's even inclusive of kind of the seasonal weakness that we generally see in Q4.\nHeidi Petz: That was just in Wood.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes, I was wondering if you could comment on your administrative costs. It looks like they jumped up a bit in the third quarter. And in reading the commentary you called out 2 items, namely environmental expense and asset disposals. So a few questions would be, what are the nature and magnitude of those items? And would you expect that line item to come back down in the fourth quarter and beyond?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Kevin. The year-over-year increase, I would say, environmental was a little less than half of that increase year-over-year. And then costs related to our Garland plant fire is a little less than half. And we also are going up against a sale, which benefited our -- gain on sale of assets last year that benefited our third quarter last year.  I would say, I'm glad you asked that question because I think, I want to give a little color around our fourth quarter guidance, even though we don't get EPS guidance, it's implied and it's backwards. But I think a better way to look at that is our guidance at the operating margin line, and we're expecting our fourth quarter operating margin to be flattish at the midpoint year-over-year compared to a strong fourth quarter last year with operating profit up to over 60%, and our operating margin was up 450 basis points.  So we're not -- we are expecting gross margin expansion in our fourth quarter, not as much as we saw in our third quarter. We see raw material moderation. We're not going to get as big of a price tailwind that we got in our third quarter. And I do expect higher SG&A year-over-year because of the long-term investments. So then that gets us to these nonoperating costs. And we have approximately a $60 million increase in our nonoperating costs that will be predominantly in our admin segment. And it's due to the credits that we realized last year in environmental and other income in the fourth quarter that we don't expect to repeat and really get environmental and these other expense lines to a more normal level.\nKevin McCarthy: Okay. And then as a second question, if your raw material costs were to trend flat from here, would it be reasonable to estimate that you could see relief in 2024, perhaps in the negative low single to mid-single-digit percentage range, or how would you frame that outlook for next year as it relates to raw material costs, specifically?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Kevin, I think with the current environment and the volatility we're seeing both in oil, in the choppy demand environment. I know historically, we've given run rates, a preliminary run rate on raw materials. I think that's probably a little too soon for that in the sense that we also have to take a look at the other cost factors in the total input costs.  I talked about the merit increases, getting back to more normal levels. But health care is growing significantly. We have freight costs and there's some things going on in the LTL freight side of the market that are driving our overall cost up. So I think it's a little premature to give that level of guidance. I'd rather wait until we get more line of sight or a better line of sight and give you an update in January.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov: Al, I wanted to follow up on your comments regarding fourth quarter EPS. I guess, historically, it's hard to find -- in Q4 where sequential EPS fell by more than $1. You're looking at somewhere around $1.50, $1.55, based on your guidance. Is there anything else going on sequentially besides the year-over-year things that you just pointed out?\nAllen Mistysyn: No. I think that's going to be -- when you -- the bigger driver sequentially you have is the decrease in sales on the seasonality of that. I think what's hard Aleksey is, you look at our last 4 years, it has been choppy, really choppy quarter-to-quarter, including third quarter to fourth quarter.  So I think you got to go back pretty far to find a more normal year. I think the -- like I said, the gross margin, I do expect to be higher year-over-year, but sequentially lower because of less of the tailwind in price. I think SG&A growth is probably higher in this year's fourth quarter sequentially than it has in past years because of the things Heidi talked about, about leaning in harder on, investments in our paint stores. And long-term growth initiatives within PCG and CBG. So that probably is driving some of it. And it is our smallest quarter. So some of these year-end adjustments have a bigger impact on our fourth quarter than they would on our third quarter.\nAleksey Yefremov: And then quick follow up on your stores. Of course, you have a large competitor who is shifting strategy. But besides that, are there any players who are either slowing investments or outright closing stores kind of in response to you gaining share?\nHeidi Petz: So I'll take that. It's a great question. I think you're spot on. And I would say that there is -- go back to my comment earlier, great amount of confusion out in the marketplace, and this is an opportunity where our consistent strategy, I think, is on full display.  And I have a lot of confidence in Justin Binns and his organization and the depth of leadership that we have there. This team is well prepared to not only execute our strategy, but to adapt to market conditions around us, and I think we've got a competitive advantage in doing that. And I suppose if we didn't own 5,000 stores and 4,000 reps and have strong customer relationships and data that can help our customers be more successful. I think we too might try to stitch together a strategy that helps to get products placed on the shelf.  But this is really an opportunity for us to do what we do well and to demonstrate to our customers, a very consistent experience with Sherwin-Williams. We're working with them closely to help fight through a lot of the complexity out there and make sure that they're coming out winning. So I do think where we're seeing competitors make different choices on store closings or channels, we think, again, this uncertainty is our opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: Within Pro architectural, you called out strength in commercial. I'm just wondering what drove that. It sounds a little contrary to some of the commercial data points that emerged over the course of the quarter. So just curious as to the outperformance there.\nHeidi Petz: Well, I think the way to characterize that would be more back to a normal cycle where you're seeing kind of strong backlog front half. And then it would obviously look to soften a bit in the back half. So I would characterize it more as a normal cycle. But I do think that this is an opportunity. We talk about the strength and position in commercial for us is amongst the highest of our segments.  So we're going to be hard at work focusing on share gains, making the right decisions, making the right investments, and our people and our resources are aligned and ready to help these customers to respond through the duration of these projects. I think, regardless of the demand outlook, we will take share in this environment. And part of our differentiation is, we are with these contractors at every step of these projects. And so as they're navigating uncertainty and/or changes that come up in every single project. Our team is right there side by side to make sure that they're getting those completed on time.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. I think if you look at the commercial piece, that's where we have the longest visibility and the longest lead time. So we feel pretty comfortable about what we're seeing in terms of completions into first half of '24, as Heidi said. I think you might be referencing things like the Architectural Billing Index, which are choppier now. That's why we're saying the back half of '24, we might start to see a little softness, but feel very comfortable again about our ability, if that was to occur, our ability to fill those gaps with perhaps, New Res is starting to come back. We'll put our foot on the gas with the res repaint, property maintenance, et cetera.\nGarik Shmois: Great. That's helpful. I wanted to follow up on Consumer Brands, just the sequential weakness in margins third quarter versus second quarter? Was it really just the decline in volumes quarter-over-quarter. Is there something else that drove the change in the margins?\nAllen Mistysyn: No, Garik, it's primarily -- well, it's primarily 2 things. The sequential decline in volume. But also as we have talked about -- and I mentioned on our working capital, we're targeting a year and inventory level so that when we come out into 2024, our inventory is in great shape, which means we tweak our production volumes to make sure we stay in line with that targeted inventory levels. So with production gallons being down sequentially a low single-digit number, that does have -- is a headwind for us in this segment.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten: Just one for me. Just thinking about Europe, it seems like it was a bit better year-over-year across multiple segments. Just curious if that's just comps or maybe you're seeing some kind of bottoming or even improvement in demand on the ground there?\nHeidi Petz: Well, I'll start, and I'm sure Al will jump in here. I'll go back to -- especially on the PCG side, where we're not trying to be all things to all people I think is a really important point. And we are laser-focused on driving increased operating margins. To your point, proud of the work that the team has done in delivering a 19% margin in Q3.  We'll get some benefit from recent acquisitions. But I'll point to 4 of our 6 businesses are up against very strong comps last year. And the team is doing all the right things to ensure that we are taking a very disciplined approach to decision making, investments pacing, et cetera, as we're watching the market closely and making sure that our investments are pacing with the demand in the market.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. I think 4 of the 6 to your point, had some strong comps. But 4 of the 6 had double-digit sales gains in Europe in Q3. And I think putting a bow on what Heidi just said, we're doing it the right way. We're focused on the right segments where we can bring value and that our customers appreciate that value and are willing to pay for it. We're not in this for practice.  And so we're growing and bringing value to our customers, and we're open about the fact that while we bring value to them, our shareholders need to be rewarded as well. That's why we work as hard as we do. So it's a good performance in Europe, and it's driving both the sales and bottom line as a result.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.\nStephen Byrne: What fraction of your resi repaint volumes would you say the Sherwin-Williams paint was selected by the contractor versus selected by the homeowner. And clearly, you've highlighted a multipronged approach going after that contractor for loyalty. What would you say you can, perhaps do more of to drive loyalty with the homeowner selecting Sherwin that could help you also drive share gains.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Steve, we focus on the residential repaint contractor as the applicator. And that's a very big influencer in the decision tree. Other decision influencers would include color specification, which we've been working very hard at and the homeowner.  But typically, what we see is that the homeowner turns to the professional contractor as the expert. And while in some markets with some homeowners, they don't have a specific brand in mind. But the hard work that our teams do on a daily basis in building relationships with that residential repaint contractor is the largest driver. And it's exactly why we believe we'll continue to grow share at an outpaced rate going forward.  I'll finish with this, that we've had terrific success with the residential repaint contractor. We've had 7 years of double-digit growth. We're just getting started here. And there's a long opportunity and a big opportunity, and that's why we believe investing in Sherwin-Williams is the right approach.\nStephen Byrne: And how would you rank the resi repaint end market in Paint Stores as an opportunity to share -- to gain share as compared to new commercial property managements and new home construction. How would you rank those in terms of potential share gains?\nJohn Morikis: We don't. They're all opportunities for us, Steve. And the teams that are focused on residential repaint has the greatest opportunity. Then when they get to the property management, they have the greatest opportunity. Then you will get to the commercial, they have.  We need to deliver on each of those segments as that's how we feed our families. Each one of them offer terrific opportunities. So when you look at share gains, we've talked openly about residential repaint offering the greatest amount of share opportunity and our position in these other segments are a little bit stronger, but there's terrific opportunities there.  But our approach, I want to be very clear. If we were boxers, and we're in the center of the ring, we're not looking for -- to get to the end of the bout and stand up waiting for our hands to be raised. We want a decisive knockout as it relates to these segments. And so we're pursuing aggressively each one of these. So I'm not going to parse out which offers great opportunities they all do, and we're very determined to get after them.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard: In terms of the investments in '23 to grow share, I'm curious what the current thinking is about '24. And I guess, specifically, I'm trying to figure out do you sustain incremental investments, or does SG&A growth go back to normal trend or perhaps below normal trend? How do you think about that?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Eric, here's how I would think. Here's how we think about it. And as you know, we manage operating margin, not specific to SG&A. And as this year showed, our volumes held up better than what we had planned coming into the year. Our gross margin performance and gross margin expansion was a little bit better than what we had coming into this year. So it allowed us the opportunity to lean in and put more investments in than we normally would. We are certainly going to have growth in investments next year. I would say, back to a more normal level. And then as we see the year unfold with volumes and gross margin and what we see happening going into 2025, that will dictate how much more investments we put into each of those segments.\nHeidi Petz: Eric, I would add to that. I think going hand in hand, you asked a question about SG&A, and we talk a lot about managing operating margin. I think just talking about how we're thinking about a different approach to working capital is an important element here. That's a very intentional focus on end-to-end supply chain, but also a broad simplification effort that goes across every business unit to make sure we're as tight as possible.  And we talk about our value proposition goes far beyond what's in the can, and we're looking at this through the lens of our customers. And our value proposition can't include idle assets or excessive working capital, and our customers are simply aren't willing to pay for that. So I think it's obviously always going to be room for improvement here, but as we're looking to manage that closely. Allen and I, are locked -- relative to SG&A and working capital to drive those operating margins.\nEric Bosshard: Helpful. And then, Al, if I could follow up. In terms of managing the operating margin, is it fair to say as you solve for '24, you're managing these different levers for some degree of operating margin expansion. Again, I'm not asking you to comment on '24. I'm just curious how that thinking can play out.\nAllen Mistysyn: Absolutely, Eric. I think just color around 2024. I mean we believe the macro environment is still going to be difficult. We're going to see choppy performance on different parts of our business, different segments, different regions, but we absolutely believe that we're going to drive operating margin growth through that whatever environment that we see unfold in 2024.\nJohn Morikis: We'll outperform the market.\nAllen Mistysyn: That's right.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Abigail on for Mike. I just wanted to press further into the raw material basket. Can you speak to which materials you've seen the most deflation in and where pricing might be holding up more?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Abigail, Happy to do that. So as we said, the third quarter was likely the biggest benefit for us from a year-over-year perspective. I would say, as we've commented, the petrochemical side of the basket is where we've seen some relief. TiO2 have been a little bit stickier. But I think Al said it well earlier, as you think about going forward, oil is moving around. And while it hasn't necessarily made its way into those commodities yet, I think it's to be determined of where that heads into next year.  So right now, it's again, petrochemical side has been probably the greatest relief. TiO2 a little bit stickier. We feel very good about our ability to hold on to the pricing that we've put in the marketplace given the solutions we're providing our customers. And we'll have a better update on where it goes as we get into January.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then a quick question about your packaging destocking that you were referencing. Is that still persistent? Or has that started to tail off a little bit?\nHeidi Petz: Well, it's -- I would say this as similar to what we talked about before. We won't get into very specific details here. But I think it really is important that we're in lockstep with the demand environment, making sure that -- John mentioned this earlier, that as our customers are working through some choppiness right now that we've got capacity continuing to come online through our brand site. And as soon as we have that capacity, we're confident not just in our ability to have the capacity to satisfy that demand. But what's behind that are the technology that the market is looking for. So we're very confident that we're going to have that online here shortly.\nJohn Morikis: I think there is some destocking. Our customers have spoken about some areas of excessive inventory that they're driving down. And to Heidi's point, as our additional capacity comes back online, we get through the repairs down in Garland. We're going to take this wonderful technology and bring solutions to our customers that allow them to run their plants more efficiently.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Patrick Cunningham from Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Eric on for Patrick. Given the DIY consumers under pressure, have you seen any relative share gains or losses within PSG or CBG?\nJohn Morikis: Well, we're clearly seeing improvement in share gain in our PSG, our stores business. Heidi mentioned the comparisons to last year in the quarter, we're all very strong, nearly 20% comparisons, and we've continued to perform very well even against that backdrop.  And the investments that we're making are easy to point to as key drivers for future share, but I drive it back to the core business that we have and the expectations we have for organic growth. Heidi mentioned quickly in one of the M&A questions about that we don't need acquisitions. And in stores, when you look at our business, you could arguably say that this core business in itself is going to be a fantastic show to watch, and it will be.  But our expectations are to accelerate growth even faster. So the investments that we're making will allow us to capture that even quicker. As it relates to our consumer business, we've got wonderful partners. We're committed to their growth. Heidi mentioned things like capacity and helping them to drive down their inventory with the reassurance that we have the ability to respond to them.  So from the back side, we're clearly trying to help position them financially. But more importantly, we're introducing new products. We're bringing innovation. We're adding people in our team -- on our team to help train their team members. And we do believe there is a continued opportunity to convert people that might be in our customers' stores as shoppers, we can help turn them into buyers of products in our category. So we're excited. This is a type of market that most don't hope for, I would say, arguably, we don't hope for this type of market. But we know what to do, and we're going to turn it into advantage to our shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Aron Ceccarelli from Berenberg.\nAron Ceccarelli: I have one on product simplification. You have been doing quite a lot of simplification inside and outside the can, reducing formulation and also rightsizing the number of SKUs. Maybe can you help me understand a little bit better where are we in this process? And if you can quantify what has been done, and where can we go from here?\nHeidi Petz: Yes, Aron, I would say we're early innings. Really confident that there's aggressive road map ahead here. And the way I would characterize this is thinking through this is truly an end-to-end effort across the enterprise. So you mentioned whether it's SKU rationalization, formula rationalization that's really starting with raw materials and understanding the basket all the way through to what it is that we're setting up to our customers.  But I think an important point here is it's a mindset that we have adopted going forward. And so it's part of how we, John mentioned innovation as part of our new product development process. I mean, we're going to make sure that we're always looking at opportunities to take complexity out of the business. And I take it a step further, if you look at our Performance Coatings Group, we still have a lot of opportunity as we think about even rationalization of footprint. So the team is hard at work. This isn't going to be something that we land in the next 12 or 24 months, but I think we're going to be constantly looking at going forward.\nJohn Morikis: And I think Heidi's strength here is, and she's a humble person, she won't say this. But I will say this, I am a front row to this show. You've got a leader that is driving the opportunity to the bottom line. She's got a very respectful approach to our traditions and to our norms. Our 157-year-old company, there's a lot of things that we do and have done, and many of them are right.  And we've got an opportunity, I think, to take a look at those traditions and norms and ask if there's a better way to do that. And this simplification effort is a great example of that. I think our company is going to come out much stronger, much more efficient, better responsiveness to our customers, and an opportunity to pursue business in new ways.  We didn't really get into our digital approach, and the approach that Heidi is leading there to our team to better use the data that we have available in ways that we just haven't in the past. We've scratched around the surface but there are some terrific opportunities that she's leading that I think will further differentiate Sherwin-Williams.\nAron Ceccarelli: And I have a follow-up on PSG. You touched earlier on the commercial vertical. Maybe can you provide some color on property management because also this vertical has been incredibly strong this year. And again, Q3 very strong against very tough comps. So would like to understand how you think about the momentum in terms of volume growth going into next year, please?\nHeidi Petz: Yes. The underlying demand is solid. I think we've seen some delayed CapEx and a lot of deferred maintenance that is now being addressed and we'll continue to see that coming into next year. I would say relative to apartment turns are improving, a bit influenced by the return to travel of the school driving some of that demand. But much like our momentum in New Residential, we're demonstrating our unique ability here to really serve the property management segment with a consistent experience that I believe only Sherwin-Williams can deliver.  And regardless of the size or the location of these contractors, our goal is consistently the same. It's -- we want to make it as convenient as possible to leverage our stores, our reps and our segment-specific tools and solutions here. So we're taking share. We're increasing our number of sole preferred or exclusive contracts, if you will. And we're confident that we're going to continue with our foot on the gas going forward.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to President and Chief Operating Officer, Heidi Petz, for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nHeidi Petz: Great. Thank you. So I expect to close out this year with momentum. I think you've heard that loud and clear here. We believe that we're growing share and -- we are -- our humility takes us to the point where we're saying, we recognize that there is no finish line. So we're determined to move forward here. Going forward, as we look at 2024, here's what I can tell you, I have clear line of reality. There is going to be some choppiness that we talked about ahead. But we have seen this movie before. And my confidence is in this team, our ability to execute on our strategy that we know is working, our confidence that our key investments that we know will deliver shareholder value. And those combined together is what gives me confidence that we're going to outperform the market.  Any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to Jim and Eric. And we'll conclude with just looking forward to talking with all of you in January about our outlook and our plans and have a wonderful holiday.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Heidi Petz",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group. Third quarter Paint Stores Group sales increased 3.6% against the challenging 21.5% comp. The increase was driven by continued effective pricing and higher Pro architectural volume, excluding New Residential. Segment margin improved sequentially and year-over-year to 25.9%, driven by pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs.  Protective & Marine was the fastest growing in the quarter, driven by strong volume as sales increased by a double-digit percentage against the mid-teens comparison. Industrial flooring, infrastructure and oil and gas applications remain key drivers. In our Pro architectural end markets commercial sales were strongest, increasing by a high single-digit percentage versus a high teens comparison.  Residential repaint sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage amid continued softness in existing home sales and against a 20% comparison. While this is a solid performance in the current environment, we are not satisfied, and res repaint continues to be our largest opportunity for growth. Property maintenance sales grew by a low single-digit percentage against a mid-20s comparison.  New Residential sales were down mid-single digits with volume down high single digits against the mid-20s comparison. As we've previously noted, we anticipated New Residential would be challenging near term, given prior softness in single-family starts. We expect our continued share gains and new account wins to become more and more apparent as starts improve. Our DIY business was down low single digits against a very difficult low 30s comparison.  From a product perspective, interior paint sales were up low single digits and exterior paint sales were flat, both against double-digit comparisons in last year's third quarter. Sales in our Consumer Brands Group decreased by 4% in the quarter, primarily due to the divestiture of the China architectural business and softer DIY demand in North America, which was partially offset by selling price increases.  Sales in North America, our largest region, decreased by a mid-single-digit percentage against a double-digit comparison. The Pros Who Paint category continued to grow, while DIY demand remained muted by inflationary pressures on consumers. We continue to invest here with our strategic retail partners for growth.  In other regions, sales were up high single digits in Latin America and low double digits in Europe. Sales in China were down high double digits as we completed divestiture of the business on August 1.  Adjusted segment margin was 13.8%, which was lower than a year ago, primarily due to lower sales volume and lower fixed cost absorption due to lower production volumes.  Sales in the Performance Coatings Group decreased 1% against a low teens comparison. Volume decreased by a high single-digit percentage, but was partially offset by positive low single-digit contribution from pricing, FX and acquisitions. Adjusted segment margin increased to 19.1% of sales, primarily due to pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs.  Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. Sales were strongest in Europe and increased by a mid-teens percentage. Latin America sales increased by low single digits against a mid-teens comp. North America sales decreased mid-single digits against a 20% comp. Demand in Asia remained weak, with sales down double digits against high single-digit growth a year ago.  From a division perspective, growth was strongest in our Industrial Wood business, which was up by a low double-digit percentage against a mid-single-digit comparison. This growth reflects our ICA acquisition, share gains and a potential bottoming of New Residential construction. We expect to gain further momentum in this business. As we closed October 1st on the previously announced acquisition of Germany-based specialized industrial coatings holding comprised of the Oskar Nolte and Klumpp Coatings businesses.  We are gaining share and seeing steady demand in Auto Refinish, where sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage against a high single-digit comparison. Sales in Coil and General Industrial both decreased by low single-digit percentages against challenging comparisons and vary widely by region.  Packaging sales were down by a mid-teens percentage against the high single-digit comparison. We anticipated this decline given the near-term destocking by brand owners that we described earlier this year. Packaging sales in the quarter were also slightly impacted by the fire at our Garland, Texas plant. Our business continuity team is executing our contingency plans to minimize customer impacts from this event near term. Longer term, we continue to feel very good about our position and growth prospects in this end market, and we expect to bring additional capacity online at our , France plant by early 2024.  With that, let me turn it to John for his comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the year. Yes. I think you make a great point here. I want to take a minute before I jump right into res repaint, which I absolutely will and just put this a bit in perspective.  You heard from some of our prepared remarks that when we look at our performance in general, and we're posting some stronger results up against really aggressive comps last year. I think that's an important piece that we anchor in as I get into the res repaints. repaint certainly New Res being up against over 20% comps here and still in this environment, continuing to post. So we're really proud of the team to be able to overcome some of that.  So I think if I just jump right into Res repaint, I'll let you know that yes, we are gaining share in this market. Demand does vary depending on a few variables. I think if you look at this and separate a bit, those contractors that are more established and well-known and are more experienced in marketing their business, they've got the scale and they're confident in their backlog. I would say that's more so true for them than those that have less experience being able to put that type of focus on in marketing their business.  So I'd say there's a bit of a variance there. But we look at this importantly. The adversity that these contractors are facing in this choppiness is also an opportunity where I believe that it makes our stores and our reps even more valuable as we're helping them navigate through a lot of this uncertainty and helping to intercept what it is that they're trying to accomplish in their business, whether it's leads or making sure that we're helping them finding ways to be more efficient in their process.  So I think if we've seen this movie before, we're ready for what's ahead. We're putting investments in. John referenced earlier in the SG&A that you see, and I'll take you back. We saw this coming in 2008 and 2009. And making sure that what came out of that was our desire to be well positioned and New Residential does recover, that we've got all the investments in place here to continue to drive res repaint. So this is an opportunity where, where and I would say when, our model stands out and when we're able to gain a lot of share. Jeff, I would add to that as well. I think our effectiveness is at a record high, and I give the team a lot of credit because it's not just about holding it, it's about demonstrating that value every single day with our contractors. Yes, Greg, I think on the res repaint side, it's similar to what I mentioned earlier. I think you look at -- traditionally, you're going to see somewhere between 13, 15 weeks out, I would say that, that backlog has come down by 2 or 3 weeks, so a bit more limited in terms of visibility. But outside of that, again, I would look at it in terms of the size of the contractor, the level of experience, again, ability to market themselves. They've got further out site line into '24 versus some of the other smaller contractors that are still trying to find ways to kind of build those backlog. The piece I would add to that. I think New Residential specifically relative to interest rates, while the single-family completions have been flat or negative year-over-year for 8 straight months. We are starting to see the starts are positive year-over-year for 3 straight months.  So we're watching interest rates very closely, it may also signal that we're past the bottom. So knowing that this is a choppy environment. Another point that I think is important here, while others are talking, the market are talking about preparing for the slowdown, it's really important that our teams are laser-focused on preparing for taking disproportionate shares.  So we went into COVID with a large majority of exclusive arrangements, with multi -- with the national homebuilders, and we've come out building momentum in a number of exclusive contracts that we have with some of these builders. I think that's a testament to the team's ability to demonstrate our value in this environment.  And I'm going to take it a step further here, and this goes back to some of the discussion on working capital. We talk about managing our working capital really closely. And -- but as we're having these partnerships and trying to demonstrate more of Sherwin's value proposition, especially in the New Residential space and in this environment, helping to get in front of -- helping them to streamline and standardize what it is that they're doing in terms of the product that they're bringing to market so they can be as aggressive as possible, helping them look at ways to reduce cycle time, and this all in an effort to, of course, help them drive increased profitability and productivity, but also to be as effective as they can be with their working capital again in this environment with a lot of volatility in the interest rate. Yes. I think, first and foremost, I think it's indicative that our strategy is working. And when we look at this business and this portfolio, it's really important. I'll share with you what we talk about internally, which is we're not trying to be all things to all people. And so when you look across these businesses, making sure that the discipline and how we're thinking about investment, the discipline and when we're investing is certainly a key part of this.  So maybe just a little bit of across some of these divisions on the -- John, rather jump in as well. You start with -- you mentioned Industrial Wood. There's been a lot of wins here against some regional competitors. And while we mentioned earlier, U.S. housing is continuing to soften. We think this is an opportunity for us just coming out of completing some key acquisitions that we mentioned in our prepared remarks, with Oskar Nolte and Klumpp. It feels like we're in a really good position here to continue to drive increased value and return of value to our shareholders.  Our gallons per day appeared to have bottomed out in all regions, again, so as the New Residential swings back, we expect Industrial Wood to absolutely come along for the ride there.  I'll comment briefly on Automotive Refinish. I think importantly, we've had some really good share gain here. Year-to-date installs in North America have been up strong double digits, and our core users are growing. We talked a bit about our Collision Core technology and business. That momentum and adoption is continuing. And this is a suite of digital tools and solutions that truly is helping to benefit our business here.  And I would also add along with our North America footprint. Similar think of our Paint Stores Group similar to that footprint. We're really able to have a better opportunity to control a more consistent customer experience beginning to end here with our Auto Refinish, which we think is an incredible differentiator for us.  We talked a bit about General Industrial, heavy equipment market is rolling up, especially in Ag, and we continue to -- we expect to see that continue. Building products, general finishing is soft, but we've expected that the team is laser focused on pivoting and adapting to the market.  In the Coil side, North America is holding up better than the other regions, still soft, but the team is working really hard against some new business wins. And then nearshoring in Mexico continues to create demand for us. So we're managing that across the regions very carefully. One comment on Coil as well. I would say that most of the China coaters are running at about 50% capacity. So we expect there to be some forward opportunity there as well. Well, we've said certainly in our investor call recently and we say this consistently, but we don't need M&A to grow. There's a lot of confidence in every segment that we have for us to continue to take share organically. And so from a capacity standpoint, we've continued to be very strategic about where we are laying that capacity in. And I'll go back to Al's point, all of that is by design. As we look at our 10-year CapEx plans, our 10-year demand plans, certainly, we don't want to put anything that's net new to the system if it's not needed. But where we need that capacity, we're going to do that. David, I would just add, very simply, there is no ceiling. And I would add to that, too, Josh, I think there's a lot of confusion in the marketplace right now. And our opportunity, John mentioned, adversity is our friend. And I couldn't agree more with that.  Our strategy is working here, and I'll take you to -- we talk about our control distribution platform. We owned the stores, we own the reps, the store manager owns that P&L. The store manager owns staffing, owns the culture of that store. And I think it's really important because when we talk about that relationship and the consistent experience we can offer these res repaint contractors, it's critical that they know exactly what they can get from the experience they can have at Sherwin-Williams.  And so as they're coming in, as they are traveling, as they're trying to grow and take on more, our teams are prepared, trained and ready to get any tools that they need in front of them, to help them to become as productive and profitable as possible. So I'm really confident in how we are prepared to differentiate as we add value to this contractor. Mike, yes, we expect to build as we said it. And no, we do not expect any delays. I think this is really important. When we look at our commitment to the team, to the Street, we're opening the new store every 3 days, and there's puts and takes in terms of timing. You can imagine our strategy is reflecting our desire to chase the density and the volume. And some of those markets, there's unique nuances where we're timing getting into a certain market in a certain area. But our commitment to getting to those stores is critical because we still continue to see a return on those stores at a rapid clip, and we think there's a lot of opportunities to chase for future density there. Well. First of all, we wouldn't comment on anything specific to our customers. So -- but what I can share with you with our approach that we're taking partners. And again, we do talk openly about making sure that success is our customer success. So when we're looking at making sure that they are at the right inventory levels, helping them thinking through how to manage to optimize our working capital. You can rest assured that those conversations are happening on a daily basis. So we'll let them speak to their specific strategy here. And one piece I would add to that as well, I go back to Al's point here. We put by design very intentional capacity to work here so that as we're partnering closely to manage and optimize working capital and inventory with our partners that we've got the confidence that we can have the capacity to build the inventory in time for the season ahead. But what we are seeing there too, despite the sprayers is the backlog of projects for our commercial contractors continues to be solid, well through the midpoint of next year. So getting back to more of that normal cycle. So good indicator of some growth there. That was just in Wood. So I'll take that. It's a great question. I think you're spot on. And I would say that there is -- go back to my comment earlier, great amount of confusion out in the marketplace, and this is an opportunity where our consistent strategy, I think, is on full display.  And I have a lot of confidence in Justin Binns and his organization and the depth of leadership that we have there. This team is well prepared to not only execute our strategy, but to adapt to market conditions around us, and I think we've got a competitive advantage in doing that. And I suppose if we didn't own 5,000 stores and 4,000 reps and have strong customer relationships and data that can help our customers be more successful. I think we too might try to stitch together a strategy that helps to get products placed on the shelf.  But this is really an opportunity for us to do what we do well and to demonstrate to our customers, a very consistent experience with Sherwin-Williams. We're working with them closely to help fight through a lot of the complexity out there and make sure that they're coming out winning. So I do think where we're seeing competitors make different choices on store closings or channels, we think, again, this uncertainty is our opportunity. Well, I think the way to characterize that would be more back to a normal cycle where you're seeing kind of strong backlog front half. And then it would obviously look to soften a bit in the back half. So I would characterize it more as a normal cycle. But I do think that this is an opportunity. We talk about the strength and position in commercial for us is amongst the highest of our segments.  So we're going to be hard at work focusing on share gains, making the right decisions, making the right investments, and our people and our resources are aligned and ready to help these customers to respond through the duration of these projects. I think, regardless of the demand outlook, we will take share in this environment. And part of our differentiation is, we are with these contractors at every step of these projects. And so as they're navigating uncertainty and/or changes that come up in every single project. Our team is right there side by side to make sure that they're getting those completed on time. Well, I'll start, and I'm sure Al will jump in here. I'll go back to -- especially on the PCG side, where we're not trying to be all things to all people I think is a really important point. And we are laser-focused on driving increased operating margins. To your point, proud of the work that the team has done in delivering a 19% margin in Q3.  We'll get some benefit from recent acquisitions. But I'll point to 4 of our 6 businesses are up against very strong comps last year. And the team is doing all the right things to ensure that we are taking a very disciplined approach to decision making, investments pacing, et cetera, as we're watching the market closely and making sure that our investments are pacing with the demand in the market. Eric, I would add to that. I think going hand in hand, you asked a question about SG&A, and we talk a lot about managing operating margin. I think just talking about how we're thinking about a different approach to working capital is an important element here. That's a very intentional focus on end-to-end supply chain, but also a broad simplification effort that goes across every business unit to make sure we're as tight as possible.  And we talk about our value proposition goes far beyond what's in the can, and we're looking at this through the lens of our customers. And our value proposition can't include idle assets or excessive working capital, and our customers are simply aren't willing to pay for that. So I think it's obviously always going to be room for improvement here, but as we're looking to manage that closely. Allen and I, are locked -- relative to SG&A and working capital to drive those operating margins. Well, it's -- I would say this as similar to what we talked about before. We won't get into very specific details here. But I think it really is important that we're in lockstep with the demand environment, making sure that -- John mentioned this earlier, that as our customers are working through some choppiness right now that we've got capacity continuing to come online through our brand site. And as soon as we have that capacity, we're confident not just in our ability to have the capacity to satisfy that demand. But what's behind that are the technology that the market is looking for. So we're very confident that we're going to have that online here shortly. Yes, Aron, I would say we're early innings. Really confident that there's aggressive road map ahead here. And the way I would characterize this is thinking through this is truly an end-to-end effort across the enterprise. So you mentioned whether it's SKU rationalization, formula rationalization that's really starting with raw materials and understanding the basket all the way through to what it is that we're setting up to our customers.  But I think an important point here is it's a mindset that we have adopted going forward. And so it's part of how we, John mentioned innovation as part of our new product development process. I mean, we're going to make sure that we're always looking at opportunities to take complexity out of the business. And I take it a step further, if you look at our Performance Coatings Group, we still have a lot of opportunity as we think about even rationalization of footprint. So the team is hard at work. This isn't going to be something that we land in the next 12 or 24 months, but I think we're going to be constantly looking at going forward. Yes. The underlying demand is solid. I think we've seen some delayed CapEx and a lot of deferred maintenance that is now being addressed and we'll continue to see that coming into next year. I would say relative to apartment turns are improving, a bit influenced by the return to travel of the school driving some of that demand. But much like our momentum in New Residential, we're demonstrating our unique ability here to really serve the property management segment with a consistent experience that I believe only Sherwin-Williams can deliver.  And regardless of the size or the location of these contractors, our goal is consistently the same. It's -- we want to make it as convenient as possible to leverage our stores, our reps and our segment-specific tools and solutions here. So we're taking share. We're increasing our number of sole preferred or exclusive contracts, if you will. And we're confident that we're going to continue with our foot on the gas going forward. Great. Thank you. So I expect to close out this year with momentum. I think you've heard that loud and clear here. We believe that we're growing share and -- we are -- our humility takes us to the point where we're saying, we recognize that there is no finish line. So we're determined to move forward here. Going forward, as we look at 2024, here's what I can tell you, I have clear line of reality. There is going to be some choppiness that we talked about ahead. But we have seen this movie before. And my confidence is in this team, our ability to execute on our strategy that we know is working, our confidence that our key investments that we know will deliver shareholder value. And those combined together is what gives me confidence that we're going to outperform the market.  Any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to Jim and Eric. And we'll conclude with just looking forward to talking with all of you in January about our outlook and our plans and have a wonderful holiday."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Allen Mistysyn",
            "content": "Yes, John, this is Al Mistysyn. And we're in that part of the year where we're going through our operating plans. We're reviewing really demand outlook with our suppliers. I know we've gotten a lot of questions about oil ticking up, and that has to be up for a period of time before we see that flow through our raw material basket.  I think what you will see is the other cost input items increasing, I think merit increases will get back to a more normal level, but you've got health care, freight, some of the things going on with LTL carriers that are driving our overall costs up. So as we typically do, we push back and look for offsets as much as we can.  And then when we can't -- don't feel like we have an offset and we need to go out with price, we'll tell this to our customers first and, then we'll talk to the Street. So we're going through that process, and we need a little more time to figure that out, and we'll let our customers know and then we'll come back and let the street know. Yes, Vincent, I would say certainly, as we annualize costs or the investments in our long-term growth initiatives, you're going to see that in the first part of the year. But I'd highlight, if you look at our SG&A sequentially second quarter to third quarter, even though we kept investing in Paint Stores Group and reps, Performance Coatings Group sales and tech service reps and you have investments in the Pros Who Paints. We saw those offset by reductions in our G&A costs or admin SG&A so that we're trying to figure out ways to continue to drive G&A down to offset the incremental cost of those investments.  And yes, we will absolutely measure the return. But as we get into 2024, we're going through our budgeting plan. We're going through key initiatives across each of our functional areas, and we'll keep driving both those costs lower to help pay for the incremental investments. Yes, Jeff, if you look at our pricing because you annualize pricing throughout each of the segments as we've gone. I know we've talked about Performance Coatings through basically, at some point, through on a 90-day cycle. So price was still up in the quarter, in the third quarter, up low single digit. But if you look at that compared to our second quarter, price would have added a mid single-digit percentage in the second quarter. So -- and as you get into our fourth quarter, you'd be at a lower single-digit impact on our fourth quarter. So that's just annualizing the price increases we've taken throughout '22. But I would argue and say, we have not given that price back. And you can see that in our gross margin performance in the second quarter, up -- 440 up in the third -- third quarter of 490 basis points, and we expect to be up again in our fourth quarter, along with the moderating raw material cost sequentially. Jeff, I don't know I'd go that far. As I mentioned earlier, I think we have to look at the -- market is still demand, supply driven. We're working with our suppliers to develop what does industry demand look like across each of the regions. And I think that's going to be a bigger driver of raw material pricing as we get into 2024. I think as we mentioned on our second quarter call, we expected our third quarter to be our biggest year-over-year change in raw material costs, but certainly, they're going to be down in our fourth quarter as well. Yes. I think Greg, the -- when you look at the volume decline being overall down low single digit, certainly, as I've talked about, that's always typically the biggest driver of operating margin leverage.  When you look at how that mix changes in the quarter, so we talked about Paint Stores Group being flat and then the other 2 segments being down more than that. So it was less of an impact than if Paint Stores was down similar, if that makes sense to you, because Paint Stores Group has a higher gross margin profile. Correct. Yes, Ghansham. I think you remember, coming into the year, I said, I thought we'd keep our total debt flat with year-end 2022. But as you saw at the end of the third quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.2x versus 3.1%, and that was a combination of a strong -- you'll get a trailing 12-month EBITDA growth of over almost -- a little over 28%. But we also reduced our total debt by almost $600 million. I would expect as we kind of forecast the end of the year, would keep that total debt lower year-over-year by about $600 million and will be firmly in that 2 to 2.5x range. David, one caveat to that, that I would make. When you look at our quarter gross margin because you typically see an -- seasonal architectural slowdown in volumes and sales. The fourth quarter margin may or may not be sequentially improving. It's our smallest quarter. You have year-end adjustments and other year-end adjustments that have -- could have a material impact on the gross margin.  Also, just reiterate that price increases aren't going to be as big of a tailwind in our fourth quarter than what we saw in our third quarter. And the other side of that Paint Stores Group is going to grow faster in our fourth quarter that will help drive gross margin.  As we talked about at our Investor Day, we are at a current range of 45% to 48%. We set aggressive goals for our teams. And as we consistently achieve that current range, we'll adjust the range. I don't think we're ready to sit here today and make a change to any range or talk about 2024 at this point. But we're going to be consistent in our approach going forward. Yes. I'd start with, Mike, that as we typically do, we saw our inventory gallons decreased sequentially as we -- we're getting back to a more typical bell curve. We grow inventory into the summer selling season. We see incremental decreases as we go through the second half, and then we'll build inventory in our fourth quarter. That consistency allows our customers to also manage their inventories better because you're back to a more normal environment.  To that point, I would say, we expect our working capital trend towards 11% to 11.5%. We were at 12% coming out of the third quarter. So we're well on track for that. And what it's allowing us to do is drive significant cash flow, and you saw that in our third quarter and that's a combination of strong net income results and working capital management. And we expect to flow that through into our fourth quarter and have a really strong cash year that's allowed us to be very flexible. Ghansham talked about, our ability to pay down debt, but it also allowed us to return cash to our shareholders in dividends and buybacks, and we've returned over $1.4 billion to our shareholders over that time. So in this high interest rate environment, we get back to our more normal operating cadence with inventory, and you'll see us manage our working capital down which then allows that consistency to allow our customers to manage their working capital down. Yes, Kevin. The year-over-year increase, I would say, environmental was a little less than half of that increase year-over-year. And then costs related to our Garland plant fire is a little less than half. And we also are going up against a sale, which benefited our -- gain on sale of assets last year that benefited our third quarter last year.  I would say, I'm glad you asked that question because I think, I want to give a little color around our fourth quarter guidance, even though we don't get EPS guidance, it's implied and it's backwards. But I think a better way to look at that is our guidance at the operating margin line, and we're expecting our fourth quarter operating margin to be flattish at the midpoint year-over-year compared to a strong fourth quarter last year with operating profit up to over 60%, and our operating margin was up 450 basis points.  So we're not -- we are expecting gross margin expansion in our fourth quarter, not as much as we saw in our third quarter. We see raw material moderation. We're not going to get as big of a price tailwind that we got in our third quarter. And I do expect higher SG&A year-over-year because of the long-term investments. So then that gets us to these nonoperating costs. And we have approximately a $60 million increase in our nonoperating costs that will be predominantly in our admin segment. And it's due to the credits that we realized last year in environmental and other income in the fourth quarter that we don't expect to repeat and really get environmental and these other expense lines to a more normal level. Yes, Kevin, I think with the current environment and the volatility we're seeing both in oil, in the choppy demand environment. I know historically, we've given run rates, a preliminary run rate on raw materials. I think that's probably a little too soon for that in the sense that we also have to take a look at the other cost factors in the total input costs.  I talked about the merit increases, getting back to more normal levels. But health care is growing significantly. We have freight costs and there's some things going on in the LTL freight side of the market that are driving our overall cost up. So I think it's a little premature to give that level of guidance. I'd rather wait until we get more line of sight or a better line of sight and give you an update in January. No. I think that's going to be -- when you -- the bigger driver sequentially you have is the decrease in sales on the seasonality of that. I think what's hard Aleksey is, you look at our last 4 years, it has been choppy, really choppy quarter-to-quarter, including third quarter to fourth quarter.  So I think you got to go back pretty far to find a more normal year. I think the -- like I said, the gross margin, I do expect to be higher year-over-year, but sequentially lower because of less of the tailwind in price. I think SG&A growth is probably higher in this year's fourth quarter sequentially than it has in past years because of the things Heidi talked about, about leaning in harder on, investments in our paint stores. And long-term growth initiatives within PCG and CBG. So that probably is driving some of it. And it is our smallest quarter. So some of these year-end adjustments have a bigger impact on our fourth quarter than they would on our third quarter. No, Garik, it's primarily -- well, it's primarily 2 things. The sequential decline in volume. But also as we have talked about -- and I mentioned on our working capital, we're targeting a year and inventory level so that when we come out into 2024, our inventory is in great shape, which means we tweak our production volumes to make sure we stay in line with that targeted inventory levels. So with production gallons being down sequentially a low single-digit number, that does have -- is a headwind for us in this segment. Yes. I think 4 of the 6 to your point, had some strong comps. But 4 of the 6 had double-digit sales gains in Europe in Q3. And I think putting a bow on what Heidi just said, we're doing it the right way. We're focused on the right segments where we can bring value and that our customers appreciate that value and are willing to pay for it. We're not in this for practice.  And so we're growing and bringing value to our customers, and we're open about the fact that while we bring value to them, our shareholders need to be rewarded as well. That's why we work as hard as we do. So it's a good performance in Europe, and it's driving both the sales and bottom line as a result. Yes, Eric, here's how I would think. Here's how we think about it. And as you know, we manage operating margin, not specific to SG&A. And as this year showed, our volumes held up better than what we had planned coming into the year. Our gross margin performance and gross margin expansion was a little bit better than what we had coming into this year. So it allowed us the opportunity to lean in and put more investments in than we normally would. We are certainly going to have growth in investments next year. I would say, back to a more normal level. And then as we see the year unfold with volumes and gross margin and what we see happening going into 2025, that will dictate how much more investments we put into each of those segments. Absolutely, Eric. I think just color around 2024. I mean we believe the macro environment is still going to be difficult. We're going to see choppy performance on different parts of our business, different segments, different regions, but we absolutely believe that we're going to drive operating margin growth through that whatever environment that we see unfold in 2024. That's right."

            "content": "Thank you, Heidi. Our team delivered another strong quarter in an environment characterized by ongoing uncertainty. My thanks go to our 64,000 employees for continuing to focus on our mission and for executing on our strategy. Their energy in serving our customers and providing them with solutions remains a true differentiator.  On our July call, we described the anticipated second half demand backdrop across our businesses. The third quarter played out much as we expected, and we believe the environment remains largely unchanged in the fourth quarter. Paint Stores Group will face another strong year-over-year comparison. Demand in commercial, property maintenance, residential repaint and Protective & Marine remains stable with New Residential remaining soft as we expected. We have now annualized prior price increases.  In Consumer Brands, North America DIY demand remained soft. Europe demand has stabilized and Latin America markets remain mixed. Performance Coatings demand remains highly variable by end market and by region. We know we cannot defy gravity in terms of the macro environment. What we can do is aggressively pursue new account and share of wallet opportunities to drive market share gains, we are aggressively focused on doing just that.  Moving to the cost side. We're narrowing our full year raw material outlook. We expect cost to be down by a high single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect other costs, including wages and other input costs to be up in the mid- to high single-digit range. We also continue to see the current market uncertainty as an opportunity to press our advantages through greater investment in solutions for our customers that will drive their success and ours. Our SG&A spend in the fourth quarter will reflect these investments, leading full year SG&A to increase in the high single-digit to low double-digit range compared to last year. This approach has served us well many times in the past. We are highly confident and will again now resulting in continued above-market growth and strong returns.  Now moving on to our specific guidance. We anticipate our fourth quarter 2023 consolidated net sales will be up or down a low single-digit percentage compared to a high single-digit increase in the fourth quarter of 2022, with volume flat to down slightly. As a reminder, we've largely annualized previous price increases across the business.  For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be up a low single-digit percentage with volume down a low single-digit percentage. Our sales expectations by segment for the fourth quarter and the full year are included in the slide deck issued with our press release this morning. We are increasing our full year 2023 diluted net income per share to be in the range of $9.21 to $9.41 per share. We believe this increased range accurately reflects our strong third quarter performance, continued pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs while also acknowledging the ongoing uncertainty in our seasonally smaller fourth quarter. This guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.80 per share and restructuring related net expense of $0.09 per share.  On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $10.10 to $10.30. This is an increase of 16.8% at the midpoint compared to last year's $8.73 adjusted earnings per share. We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. Our slide deck includes additional information on our assumptions for the year.  As we begin the fourth quarter, we continue to expect choppiness by region and end market. More importantly, we continue to see opportunity amid uncertainty, and we are extremely confident in how well our various businesses are positioned. Our strategy is clear. It's working, and it's not changing. We'll continue to provide our customers with differentiated solutions that drive their productivity and their profitability.  Our capabilities, products and services are unique. We remain on offense, growing new accounts and share of wallet in the right markets with the right customers. We also remain focused on developing and retaining talent and improving and simplifying our operations. We expect to finish the year with momentum that will carry us into 2024.  I have the utmost confidence in Heidi, Al, our leadership team and our people. Together, we expect to continue outperforming our competitors and the market.  This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Yes, Vincent, let me start with that last piece because I think it's really important. And again, I want to reiterate the confidence that we have in our strategy and the fact that we've seen this movie before. The investments that we're making, you will see in the P&L, and you will see in market share growth. Our teams are invested in executing on these areas. But I think another important area that's crucial that you won't be able to measure on our P&L is the success that we'll bring with our customers as well.  So if you go back to the strategy that we employ, it's focused on driving the success of our customers. And these investments that we're making will clearly help our customers in achieving what it is that their trying to do. And so I think as you look forward, the expectation should be increased market share and outpacing the market in volume and profitability as well. Well, I think I'd describe it this way, that there's some uncertainty given the challenges and interest rate can have on our market. And I think Heidi and the team are really focused on one very clear mission. We're going to outpace the market. And we've got confidence in the approach that we're taking, the services that we bring to the products that we are introducing. And quite frankly, we're also taking advantage of other opportunities within the market. We've got competitors that are changing models as an example.  And our simplified approach of dealing with 1 Sherwin-Williams stores as it relates to the painting contractor, we believe adds value. So the investments that we're making will enhance that on top of the organic growth that we expect from our stores. And so we're taking advantage of market conditions where Heidi just mentioned some res repaint customers that may not have had experience going through a cycle yet. They are now turning to our people for guidance and support on how do you begin advertising.  In the past, they just park their truck in front of a car -- I'm sorry, a truck in front of a house in the neighborhood and all the neighbors would flock in. They need help right now. And so they're turning to our people, and our people are playing an important role. And so when we look at what's happening with interest rates, there's some choppiness, but we also believe it creates opportunity. And we talked openly about adversity creates opportunity at Sherwin, and we're capitalizing on that. Yes, Arun, I think you mentioned on your question about P&M. I think the team there is doing a terrific job of really staying focused on the value proposition as we bring into high-value projects. So EV battery plants as an example, semiconductor plants, Heidi, and I were just recently out at one of the largest plants I've ever been on. And our floor coating teams are all over these businesses.  I think the offshore wind and other alternative energy investments as well as water infrastructure. I mean, these are all areas that we're focused on. And I'll remind you, it wasn't long ago, we were talking about our Protective & Marine business at a time when it was under pressure. We reminded our investment -- investors that we take this long-term approach.  And I believe these are terrific examples of our continuing to invest, even when times were a little tough, knowing that these projects can be delayed, but they can't be canceled. Oftentimes, you'll find highly corrosive areas that needed to be coated. You might get an extra year or a year or 2 out of those. But they needed to be coated.  And it's those types of high-value projects that are almost kind of a return repeat businesses as you maintain those that add to the attractiveness of these coatings. So we're really proud of Karl Jorgenrud, the entire leadership team within our PCG business for what they're delivering. And importantly, if you -- I'll remind you of the operating margin goals that we had set for this team at 19%. It's come in at 19%. Our goal of getting up into the high teens, low 20s. So they're doing it, and they're doing it by bringing value to our customers and to us. The one point I do want to add, I don't know if Heidi mentioned, Packaging or not, but that's an area that we continue to invest. It's not so much needed through acquisition or M&A, Arun. It's more through our investment of a very unique technology, so the packaging business, particularly our V70 product is a very unique technology. And as quickly as we can bring capacity onboard, it's sold out. So I think that's an area that we will continue to invest in. Well, clearly, the consumer is feeling some pressure from an inflation perspective. And there'll be some normalization, if it's in wages increases -- have wage increasing or the spending patterns of consumers that will take effect.  But the fact is this, that I'll remind you that paint is a relatively inexpensive, yet highly impactful opportunity for people that are interested in their home, staying in their homes to make a difference. And if people decide they're not going to sell the home, they're going to stay in place, it's a very viable option.  I'll remind you the average home age now is over 40 years old. So there's more and more investment in the structures, people aging in place is impacting as well. And additionally, I would say, not only does it help the DIY, but as the population is aging, that generally will turn into more of a res repaint opportunity, which helps our position in that space as well.  We don't want 70-year-old people out there scraping their gutters and eaves of their homes. But inside, yes, DIY is going to be an important part. There's a cycle, and we're playing the long game here, whichever way the table tilts we'll be there. Well, I think what you're experiencing right now is the delay between housing starts and the -- whatever, 90 days or so, after maybe a little bit longer, after a start before homes are painted. So our view, and Heidi mentioned this. When you look at -- and I think where your question is going is around the share -- our share of New Residential.  Our position here is very strong and getting stronger every day. Heidi mentioned the exclusive arrangements that continue to grow in count. Our relationship with the New Residential builder and our commitment to helping their profitability and success is helping us grow those customers.  It's delayed right now because the more agreements that we are signing right now and with the pressure on the starts, we're not seeing that. But I can tell you with great confidence that, as the new homes continue to rise, and they will. I mean everyone would agree there's a higher demand than there is supply right now.  Family formation continues. There's a hole right now that exists in housing availability. When that comes back, we're going to be there coil spring that we've been in the past, and it's exciting actually to see our teams winning at the rate that they're winning, and it will show up on the scoreboard. Yes. I think it's been reflected. If you take a few quarters back here, we were talking about res repaint contractors that, in many cases, weren't even returning phone calls. There were many people who were saying that they'd come out and give you a quote in 6 to 9 months. And then it would be about a year before they could get to the project.  So there has been a more normalized reality, if you will, as it relates to the residential repaint contractor. Again, I'll reiterate that this adversity creates opportunity for Sherwin-Williams. You should bet, right now, as we are here, in this moment, that our customers are getting visited with Sherwin-William's representatives. You should also bet that our competitors' customers are getting visited as well. So we're not playing nice here. We're going after some pretty aggressive market share gains, and we expect to win aggressively. Yes. And I think that's really important. I'd like the way that Heidi frame that, that we gauge our success by how successful our customers are. And so we're actually working with our customers, encouraging them to manage their working capital so that they can put their cash to work and be more successful. And Al, maybe you want to talk a little bit about what the impact of that might be because we're trying to drive reasonable or acceptable working capital, not only for us but for our customers. Well, Duffy, I'd say that, what it's telling me now is that we're ending a season. So I'd say, while we talk about that, typically, the greatest correlation between those types of sales and confidence is usually as we go into the season. As we're coming out of the season, we are continuing to see spray parts right now move.  And I'd say right now, as we've talked, there's a choppiness in the market, but we have confidence in our position in the market, and we'll see how this unfolds next year as we go into the paint season. Coming out of it, though, it's typically not the best tool to use to gain a level of confidence of contractors. Yes. I think if you look at the commercial piece, that's where we have the longest visibility and the longest lead time. So we feel pretty comfortable about what we're seeing in terms of completions into first half of '24, as Heidi said. I think you might be referencing things like the Architectural Billing Index, which are choppier now. That's why we're saying the back half of '24, we might start to see a little softness, but feel very comfortable again about our ability, if that was to occur, our ability to fill those gaps with perhaps, New Res is starting to come back. We'll put our foot on the gas with the res repaint, property maintenance, et cetera. Yes, Steve, we focus on the residential repaint contractor as the applicator. And that's a very big influencer in the decision tree. Other decision influencers would include color specification, which we've been working very hard at and the homeowner.  But typically, what we see is that the homeowner turns to the professional contractor as the expert. And while in some markets with some homeowners, they don't have a specific brand in mind. But the hard work that our teams do on a daily basis in building relationships with that residential repaint contractor is the largest driver. And it's exactly why we believe we'll continue to grow share at an outpaced rate going forward.  I'll finish with this, that we've had terrific success with the residential repaint contractor. We've had 7 years of double-digit growth. We're just getting started here. And there's a long opportunity and a big opportunity, and that's why we believe investing in Sherwin-Williams is the right approach. We don't. They're all opportunities for us, Steve. And the teams that are focused on residential repaint has the greatest opportunity. Then when they get to the property management, they have the greatest opportunity. Then you will get to the commercial, they have.  We need to deliver on each of those segments as that's how we feed our families. Each one of them offer terrific opportunities. So when you look at share gains, we've talked openly about residential repaint offering the greatest amount of share opportunity and our position in these other segments are a little bit stronger, but there's terrific opportunities there.  But our approach, I want to be very clear. If we were boxers, and we're in the center of the ring, we're not looking for -- to get to the end of the bout and stand up waiting for our hands to be raised. We want a decisive knockout as it relates to these segments. And so we're pursuing aggressively each one of these. So I'm not going to parse out which offers great opportunities they all do, and we're very determined to get after them. We'll outperform the market. Yes, Abigail, Happy to do that. So as we said, the third quarter was likely the biggest benefit for us from a year-over-year perspective. I would say, as we've commented, the petrochemical side of the basket is where we've seen some relief. TiO2 have been a little bit stickier. But I think Al said it well earlier, as you think about going forward, oil is moving around. And while it hasn't necessarily made its way into those commodities yet, I think it's to be determined of where that heads into next year.  So right now, it's again, petrochemical side has been probably the greatest relief. TiO2 a little bit stickier. We feel very good about our ability to hold on to the pricing that we've put in the marketplace given the solutions we're providing our customers. And we'll have a better update on where it goes as we get into January. I think there is some destocking. Our customers have spoken about some areas of excessive inventory that they're driving down. And to Heidi's point, as our additional capacity comes back online, we get through the repairs down in Garland. We're going to take this wonderful technology and bring solutions to our customers that allow them to run their plants more efficiently. Well, we're clearly seeing improvement in share gain in our PSG, our stores business. Heidi mentioned the comparisons to last year in the quarter, we're all very strong, nearly 20% comparisons, and we've continued to perform very well even against that backdrop.  And the investments that we're making are easy to point to as key drivers for future share, but I drive it back to the core business that we have and the expectations we have for organic growth. Heidi mentioned quickly in one of the M&A questions about that we don't need acquisitions. And in stores, when you look at our business, you could arguably say that this core business in itself is going to be a fantastic show to watch, and it will be.  But our expectations are to accelerate growth even faster. So the investments that we're making will allow us to capture that even quicker. As it relates to our consumer business, we've got wonderful partners. We're committed to their growth. Heidi mentioned things like capacity and helping them to drive down their inventory with the reassurance that we have the ability to respond to them.  So from the back side, we're clearly trying to help position them financially. But more importantly, we're introducing new products. We're bringing innovation. We're adding people in our team -- on our team to help train their team members. And we do believe there is a continued opportunity to convert people that might be in our customers' stores as shoppers, we can help turn them into buyers of products in our category. So we're excited. This is a type of market that most don't hope for, I would say, arguably, we don't hope for this type of market. But we know what to do, and we're going to turn it into advantage to our shareholders. And I think Heidi's strength here is, and she's a humble person, she won't say this. But I will say this, I am a front row to this show. You've got a leader that is driving the opportunity to the bottom line. She's got a very respectful approach to our traditions and to our norms. Our 157-year-old company, there's a lot of things that we do and have done, and many of them are right.  And we've got an opportunity, I think, to take a look at those traditions and norms and ask if there's a better way to do that. And this simplification effort is a great example of that. I think our company is going to come out much stronger, much more efficient, better responsiveness to our customers, and an opportunity to pursue business in new ways.  We didn't really get into our digital approach, and the approach that Heidi is leading there to our team to better use the data that we have available in ways that we just haven't in the past. We've scratched around the surface but there are some terrific opportunities that she's leading that I think will further differentiate Sherwin-Williams."

This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company\u2019s earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications.\nJim Jaye: Thank you and good morning to everyone. Joining me on the call today are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; and Heidi Petz, President and Chief Operating Officer; Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; and Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President of Enterprise Finance. Sherwin-Williams delivered excellent second quarter results compared to the same period a year ago. These results, coupled with a similar strong performance in the first quarter led to an excellent first half that exceeded the expectations we laid out back in January. Given the strong first half and current visibility into our second half, we are significantly increasing our full year guidance, which John will talk about in just a few minutes. But first, let me touch on a few second quarter highlights. Consolidated net sales in the quarter exceeded our expectations and grew by a mid-single-digit percentage. Sales in all 3 reportable segments came in above our guided range. Gross margin significantly improved sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strong volume in the Paint Stores Group and moderating raw material costs. Pricing discipline remains strong. SG&A expense increased over the prior year quarter, though the year-over-year percentage increase was lower than that of our first quarter. Excluding the impact of incremental acquisition and restructuring costs SG&A increased 8% year-over-year. Approximately 85% of that second quarter increase was related to investments in Paint Store Group long-term growth initiatives with the remainder driven by increases in compensation and benefits. We are highly confident these growth investments will deliver strong returns and benefit our customers. And while we recognize SG&A expense was higher year-over-year in the quarter, we ultimately manage the business to drive operating profit and margin, both of which expanded meaningfully in the quarter. We are committed to investing in and profitably growing the business at the same time. Segment margin in all three reportable segments expanded sequentially and year-over-year. We also delivered strong double-digit growth in adjusted diluted net income per share and EBITDA with adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.9% near the high end of our current long-term 19% to 21% target range. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our second quarter results by segment. John will follow Heidi with comments on our outlook before we move on to your questions.\nHeidi Petz: Thank you, Jim. I\u2019ll begin with the Paint Stores Group. Second quarter Paint Stores Group sales were ahead of our expectations and increased 10%, driven by mid-single-digit volume growth and continued effective pricing. Segment margin improved 280 basis points to 24.3%. Growth was led by our protective & marine business, which was up strong double digits and was driven by industrial flooring infrastructure and oil and gas applications. In our pro-architectural end markets, the strongest performers were commercial and property maintenance, both of which increased by double-digit percentages. Residential repaint was close behind with sales up by a high single-digit percentage. Demand in this market is being somewhat tempered by the extended period of weak existing home sales. New residential sales were flat against a double-digit comparison, reflecting the softer start that we saw at the end of last year, which have continued into this year. As we\u2019ve previously noted, we anticipated new residential would be challenging in 2023, though we are performing better than the market as we continue to focus on new accounts and share gains. Our DIY business was up strong double digits, albeit against a softer comparison where sales were impacted by supply chain challenges. From a product perspective, interior and exterior paint sales were both up high single digits, with interior sales growing faster and representing a larger part of the mix. Sales in our Consumer Brands Group also exceeded our guidance and increased by 5.1% in the quarter, primarily driven by mid-single-digit pricing. Sales in North America, our largest region, increased by a low single-digit percentage. We continue to invest here with our strategic retail partners for growth. In other regions, sales were up strong double digits in Latin America and Europe. Sales in China were down double digits, and we expect the previously announced divestiture of the China business to be completed in the third quarter. Adjusted segment margin was 15.7%, up 470 basis points year-over-year. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased less than 1% against a strong 15.2% comparison. Volume decreased low single digits but was offset by mid-single-digit increases in price. Adjusted segment margin increased 420 basis points to 18% of sales, which is within the range we have been targeting for this business. Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased low single digits against a nearly 30% comp. Sales in Europe were up mid-single digits. Latin America sales were down less than 1%, also against a strong comp of over 20%. Demand in Asia remained weak with sales down double digits against a soft period a year ago. From a division perspective, growth was strongest in Auto Refinish, which is up by a high single-digit percentage followed by General Industrial, which was up mid-single digits. Industrial wood sales were up less than 1% as softness in new residential continued to impact demand for furniture, capetry and flooring. Coil sales were down mid-single digits driven mainly by Europe, which was impacted by last year\u2019s Russia exit and against the nearly 40% comparison. Packaging sales were also down low double digits against a 20%-plus comp. We anticipated this decline given the near-term destocking by brand owners that we described on our last call. We continue to feel very good about our position and growth prospects in this end market. With that, let me turn it to John for his comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Heidi. As we said in January, we expected to have a strong first half of the year. Our team exceeded those expectations, and I want to thank all 64,000 of our employees for their relentless focus on serving our customers and for driving continuous improvement across the organization. We also understand that a good first half does not make a good year. We know we have work to do, and that\u2019s exactly where we are focused. On our April call, we said we would have a much better idea of how the year might unfold as we got deeper into the painting season. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing as we begin the second half along with our plans for seizing the opportunities in front of us. In Paint Stores Group, we\u2019re facing a strong comparison to the second half a year ago, where sales were up 19%. We see customer backlogs as being solid in commercial, property maintenance and protective & marine throughout the second half, and we expect to deliver very solid strong growth in these end markets. Residential repaint should also be good for us as based on contractor feedback, though visibility here is only about 6 to 8 weeks and existing home sales are likely to remain weak. There\u2019s some recent optimism from new residential homebuilders regarding starts, but it won\u2019t be enough to move the needle meaningfully for us in 2023. We are more tied to completions, which are slowing. While we are confident we are growing share, we expect new residential volume will be challenging for us in the second half, though the year will likely come in closer to down high single digits compared to the down 10% to 20% full year range we provided in January. In DIY, double-digit growth in the first half was aided by softer comparisons to the prior year, where supply chain headwinds impacted our sales. We do not expect this pace of growth to continue as comparisons become much more difficult in the second half of the year. In Consumer Brands, North America DIY demand remained soft. Europe demand has stabilized and Latin America markets remain mixed. In Performance Coatings, many of our customers continue to report a high level of uncertainty regarding demand. Auto Refinish demand remains an exception and is solid in most regions with shortages in parts and technicians increasing CHOP backlogs. Installations of our systems in North America are up strong double digits year-to-date. This continues to bode well for future sales in this business. General industrial end markets are choppy with North American customers reporting mixed demand by end markets served. Industrial wood demand remains soft, though some positive signs in new residential construction indicate we may have reached the bottom. In Coil, demand is holding up better in the Americas versus Europe and Asia. And finally, in packaging, customers are returning to just in time versus just in case supply chain management, resulting in destocking that we expect will continue in the second half. The longer-term view here is still very robust with customers already committed to fill the additional capacity we\u2019re bringing on this year. Let me be very clear on our expectations here. We do not accept the excuse that markets are soft, and therefore, our opportunities are limited. Our job is not to report conditions, but to influence results. We know we cannot defy gravity in terms of the macro environment. But in every business, we are aggressively pursuing new accounts and share of wallet opportunities to drive market share gains. Moving to the cost side. We are revising our raw material outlook. We now expect costs to be down by mid- to high single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect to see decreases across several commodity categories, though the ranges likely will vary widely. We expect other costs, including wages and other input costs to be up in the mid- to high single-digit range. Compared to the guidance we laid out in January, full year sales growth and raw material costs are trending better than we anticipated. With this first half outperformance we expect considerable year-over-year operating margin expansion and earnings growth for the year. At the same time, these dynamics also afford us the opportunity to accelerate growth and service investments at a higher level than anticipated at the beginning of the year. As a result of these disciplined and enterprise-wide investments, which will drive our customers\u2019 continued success. We now expect the year-over-year increase in SG&A to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range for the full year. As in the past, we are highly confident in our ability to drive future above-market growth, and our returns will justify the actions we are taking now. Now moving on to our specific guidance. We anticipate our third quarter 2023 consolidated net sales will be up or down a low single-digit percentage compared to the third quarter of 2022, with volume down low to mid-single digits. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be up a low single-digit percentage with a volume down a low single-digit percentage. Our sales expectations by segment for the third quarter and the full year are included in the slide deck issued with our press release this morning. We are increasing our full year 2023 diluted net income per share to be in the range of $8.46 to $8.86 per share. We believe this increased range accurately reflects our first half outperformance, continued pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs while also acknowledging the ongoing uncertainty in the second half demand environment. This guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.81 per share. It also includes net expense related to our previously announced targeted restructuring actions of $0.03 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $9.30 to $9.70. This is an increase of 14.5% at the midpoint compared to our prior adjusted guidance of $7.95 to $8.65 per share. We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. Our slide deck includes additional information on our updated assumptions for the year, along with guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. We\u2019ve also provided an update on our previously announced restructuring efforts. Onetime costs will be lower than previously anticipated. The estimated annual savings from our actions are unchanged. As we begin the second half, we\u2019ll remain focused on what we can control. Across the business, this means growing new accounts and share of wallet. It also means developing and retaining talent, improving and simplifying our operations and managing price cost dynamics. We remain confident in our differentiated strategy, our capabilities in our product and service solutions. Should the demand environment prove to be better than we are currently assuming, we would expect to deliver better results. What we can\u2019t control is the market. We\u2019re not interested in trying to time the economic recovery. What we are interested in is taking full advantage of it when it eventually arrives. This means investing in our growth now ahead of the curve. This approach has served our customers and our shareholders well over multiple past cycles. I have every confidence that it will do so once again. Above all, I have the utmost confidence in our leadership team and our people. They are the true differentiators. Together, we expect to continue outperforming our competitors and the market. This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks and congrats guys on a great quarter. I\u2019d love to go a little bit into that, the deceleration that you still expect into the third quarter. I think it sounds like volume total sales are kind of flattish, that we would expect volume to be down kind of low to mid-singles? And maybe give us a little more color on why you expect that deceleration in what you\u2019re seeing?\nHeidi Petz: Yes, hi, Greg, I think it\u2019s a great question. I think if you look across our entire enterprise right now, I would just qualify this or characterize this as choppy. I think that\u2019s true both by division, by region. When you break it down, our volume is down low to mid-single digits. If you look at Paint Stores Group alone down low single-digits, I would say that\u2019s primarily due to the new residential slowdown but confident in the increasing starts that we\u2019re seeing. Remember, that\u2019s against a really tough comp of 19%. That\u2019s a bit offset by some of the heavy impact that we\u2019re seeing with both PCG and CBG, but I\u2019m confident in our ability to drive above market growth here.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And I guess my second question is on getting back to those that margin range, the 46% gross margin. Could you remind us of the range you were targeting? And is there a potential to be above that in the cycle, given that it sounds like at least the pricing environment is remaining quite rational?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Greg, this is Al Mistysyn. And we\u2019re really pleased with the performance of our gross margin. As a reminder, our target is midterm, 45% to 48%. As we have talked about in the past, we \u2013 in our raw material inflationary environment, we put price in to offset those dollars. And then as raw materials moderate, we start seeing the benefit of that pricing to increase our gross margin and helps us cover the continued investments we make to help our customers drive value in their business. So I\u2019d expect the sequential gross margin to be similar to what I saw in this \u2013 what we saw in the second quarter. Price, as you know, we\u2019ll start annualizing the price increases in our third quarter, specifically the September 10% in Paint Stores Group plus the other items, other segments that have put pricing in. So for the full year, I think our gross margin, depending on where Paint Stores Group volume is could be in that 45% to 46% range. And then as you know, we\u2019ll evaluate that 45% to 48% range over time. And as we get consistency in that range, look to raise the bar and move that target up.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. So I\u2019d say we refer to that as our current range. And I\u2019d say in addition to every point that Al just made, the additional steps that we\u2019re taking on a regular basis and reviewing the programs that we have, the investments that we\u2019re making, the mix of our products, everything that we\u2019re doing goes into driving that margin. It\u2019s not simply just a price. There\u2019s a lot of activity on the operations side to drive inefficiency. We talked last year about some of the inefficiencies as we serve our customers we were shipping product from 1 point in the country into the other. And so as we continue to optimize our supply chain we expect to continue to drive that as well.\nGreg Melich: And it sounds like even with the lower raw material expectation for this year, your pricing expectations are unchanged. Is that fair?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, that\u2019s correct. As we continue to invest in our business and bring more value to our customers, we\u2019ll invest into that and drive their profitability. And naturally, we\u2019d expect that our shareholders participate in that as well.\nGreg Melich: That\u2019s great. Good luck.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you. I got two questions on SG&A. I guess, first, if you could just help us understand \u2013 I know we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but the incremental spending for this year, what details can you give us in terms of what it targets? And then secondly, should the back half of the year play out better than you forecast? Do you have more SG&A activities that you could get into in the back half of the year than you\u2019re already guiding to or is this SG&A guidance done for the year?\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Vincent, let me kick it off kind of my thinking on it and then I\u2019ll ask Al to get into some of the details. First, we are going to adjust our investments to market conditions. And these are things that we monitor closely. We reminded the trends in the market, as you just mentioned, activities and opportunities, cost, even the activities of our competitors. And we\u2019ve seen this before. We\u2019ll capitalize on the market opportunities, the competitive shifts and missteps that our competitors make, these are all opportunities. So to your point, as we see raw material trends and these are part of our data set, all roll into what you should expect to see from Sherwin-Williams. We\u2019re going to be aggressive. We\u2019re going to drive market share and invest in our businesses. And I think it comes down to when you have confidence in your strategy and confidence in your leadership team like we do, you can invest. And while others are adjusting their strategies, we\u2019re going to take advantage of any shifts. We will be on the attack.\nAl Mistysyn: As you know, we\u2019re all about managing operating margin growth and operating margin growth over the long term. So your comment about will we be done with SG&A commentary as the second half goes on. I would say, no. I think as we see how the demand environment and volumes unfold and as they\u2019re at or above our expectations, we\u2019ll look at that. We\u2019ll look at gross margin performance in the second half. And the beautiful thing about our model is we can be very agile across each of the segments, both field sales and tech service reps with the Pro Paint within the Consumer Brands Group. So if we see a path of a higher gross margin than what we have in our current outlook, we\u2019ll look to put more investments in our long-term growth initiatives to drive higher share as the market returns.\nVincent Andrews: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Vincent.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO. Your line is live.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So in the Paint Stores Group, you had been looking for kind of a flattish guide. Now you are looking for up mid to high single-digits. When you look at the major sub-segments of that group, I guess where are you surprised the most, where are things kind of working out better than you expected?\nJohn Morikis: So let me start with New Residential, because I think that\u2019s an important piece. And maybe what we will do here, John, is I\u2019ll start with New Residential, maybe talk about Commercial and then I\u2019ll ask Heidi to talk about some additional segments because to be truthful with you, we\u2019re very pleased with the execution of our team. We talk a lot about our secret weapon. And we talked about the recruitment and retention of this team. They are truly executing. We couldn\u2019t be any more proud. In New Residential, I think it\u2019s clear to all of us, there\u2019s pressure in the new residential space. Our flat sales in this quarter, I believe, are indicative of the share gains we\u2019re executing. We talked about penetrating that top 100 builders for the last couple of quarters. And quite honestly, we\u2019re working on that, and we\u2019re experiencing terrific success, in fact, even deeper into some of the more custom homebuilders as well. It\u2019s growing, and we expect to continue to grow there. We continue to execute on our strategy of bringing solutions to these builders to make them more successful. And I think that\u2019s the key and core behind everything we do. So in the builders area, the efficiency that we\u2019re bringing in our supply chain to help them in innovation, quality, consistency, even as they\u2019re adapting into different substrates to help defray costs. We are working with them to ensure that we have the right coatings for them. Importantly, I just talked about our people. I think our stores and our reps in this area \u2013 they\u2019re doing a fantastic job of staying close and in contact with not only our builders, but their applicators, which is very unique. And we\u2019ve got a distribution platform that wherever our builders are building, whatever developments they\u2019re pursuing, our stores are where they are building and where they might want to build. So we\u2019re not out there promising if you will invest here, we\u2019ll invest with you. Our people are there and our assets are there, and we\u2019re capitalizing on that. So we\u2019re growing share. We have not experienced the depth of decline, as you mentioned, we originally projected. Although I would say we do expect to see softness in the second half. You talked about our strategy here and our commitment to favorably position the company and we think this segment absolutely demonstrates that. In the commercial side, I\u2019d say we\u2019re experiencing very good performance. And again, I think it highlights the advantages of our controlled distribution. We expect the balance of 2023 to be strong. We\u2019re really focused on the sub-segments inside commercial going forward. So again, really leveraging the value of this controlled distribution model. Our reps and our specification teams are really dialing into those areas that provide opportunity. And even within those areas that might be strong now that could dry up even in those areas. We know that there will be opportunities could be in tenant build-out or wherever in commercial, it might shift we\u2019re going to be there. So again, our focus on applicators, the specifiers and the owners, we believe, will pay off for us. Res repaint is another area that I think is really important to talk about. Let me turn it over to Heidi.\nHeidi Petz: Yes. And as you know, we\u2019ve had 7 years of double-digit growth here in this segment, and we\u2019re confident in our execution. But it\u2019s important to know that we\u2019re never complacent and doing what we know how to do, we believe we\u2019ll take share, especially in this environment. While it\u2019s currently positive, we know a slowdown is coming, and it\u2019s also being tempered by, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, by the extended period of week existing homes. So having said that, even in that challenging environment, paint will continue to outperform other categories since it is an inexpensive and highly impactful category. There\u2019s been a lot of speculation about next year, and I will tell you that the bidding activity has somewhat normalized. And believe it or not, these are actually very good times for Sherwin-Williams, where we believe that adversity brings about opportunity for us. In a large part, our controlled model, as many of us talked about previously, this allows us to dig deeper and not just trying to sell our contractors product, but really taking the time to intersect them where they are in their business and helping them to focus on growth and profitability. We have a lot of data that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, but I think, and we won\u2019t get into specifics or details here. But it\u2019s important that as the team is working hard, John mentioned the talent in the frontline here, mining this data for opportunity and getting very surgical in addition to the data leveraging our rep force so that we can be very thoughtful as we approach these contractors and making sure that we are taking advantage of the talent that we\u2019ve got out there. So we are currently focused on building these relationships and confident that we will continue to see some aggressive share gains here. I\u2019ll hit briefly on the DIY relative to stores. And I think, John, your question was specific to stores. Sales were up double digits in Q2 against a fairly soft comp. We don\u2019t expect this to continue at this pace, but we will note that there is been some very positive foot traffic in our stores relative to the segment. And with that, maybe just a brief touch on P&L.\nJohn Morikis: Well, property maintenance, I think, is another area that performed a little bit better than we expected. And we have a lot of confidence here. A lot of the delayed maintenance we believe now is being addressed. Apartment turnovers are strong and bodes well for us. And again, I think even the idea of return to travel, office and school all help. And as we leverage a national platform of just up stores and reps to be able to really capture that business as well. So it\u2019s a good business for us and one that performed better as well. Protective & marine was another area that in our stores that performed stronger than I would say we expected. I\u2019ll say that here, not to our team. We expect more from our team would be the answer I\u2019d give them. Our core business was very strong, double-digit growth. But we\u2019ve been investing in this business, and our expectations are high of this team. We\u2019ve got terrific leaders in this area, and we\u2019ve been making investments in areas. We\u2019ve announced a number of acquisitions, for example, in flooring. That\u2019s helped us get into some really key opportunities in food and beverage, pharma, even airport hangers, all have been very strong. Energy has been very strong for us. It\u2019s another great example where we focus on everything from extraction to processing as well as alternative energy. Government activity here is trying to stimulate has been good for us as well. We see business in the area of mega plants for chips that have been good for us. as well as I mentioned, alternative energy, where we really have done a very nice job of bringing technology from all aspects. We\u2019re taking into wind farms, for example, there is one that\u2019s been promoted in the Northeast. It\u2019s going to be a terrific opportunity to bring our marine coatings as well as our heavy-duty petrochem technology to bear in a very unique way. So we\u2019re bringing technology. We\u2019re bringing a strength of a distribution platform, specifications and it\u2019s driving business that the business is very strong.\nHeidi Petz: And just one piece I would add to that, John mentioned recent acquisition in flooring. I think that really is a great illustration of how we\u2019re looking at this as a broader portfolio of both technologies and services that we\u2019re bringing together in terms of our value proposition. But if I look specifically at something like the battery plants for semiconductors, we\u2019re not just excited for those projects, but candidly, for the infrastructure that will eventually surround those projects as well. So we feel we\u2019re very uniquely positioned to take advantage of that wave.\nJohn McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the detailed color. Appreciate it.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Your line is live.\nChristopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on your longer-term thoughts on PC margins, just given the competitive dynamics in each of their respective end markets, obviously, ongoing price cost. I mean I think it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s significantly better than we thought, at least for the quarter. But going to that kind of unofficial 20% marker. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re feeling pretty good about that. But if you could just give an update on the longer-term thoughts there would be very helpful. Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: Yes, Chris, thanks for your question. I\u2019ll start and kick it to Al. You\u2019re right. We do feel very good, very proud of Karl Jorgenrud and his entire team. That leadership team is really focused on doing this the right way. So the solutions that we\u2019re bringing to our customers and the focus and discipline that we\u2019re bringing is part of the strategy we keep repeating. And as we do that, we bring value to our customers and we\u2019ve been successful. The discipline in that is that if not every gallon is necessarily a good gallon for us as a result. We\u2019re focused on key segments, key customers. We\u2019re trying to introduce technology and services that help them to make more money. And again, as a result, we believe that our shareholders should participate in that. But the push is to make our customers successful and have discipline doing that. And that\u2019s exactly what the PCG team is doing.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Chris, I think the takeaway that I\u2019d leave you with is, as we\u2019ve progressed through 2022 and into 2023, you start seeing consistency in that segment operating margin in either at the bottom of the range or in the range and a couple of additional points. One, they have got the discipline to get price. And when you look at the last 2 years, \u201821 and \u201822, they took the front of the 40% increase in raw material costs, and they were able to get price while still driving volume and when we look at the acquisitions that were made last year, and the integration activities and the synergies that the team is working on. We feel very good about coming out of this year with the operating margins of those acquisitions being accretive to PCG. And then they are also focused on a number of other initiatives, whether it\u2019s SKU rationalization, simplification to make operations more efficient that can better serve their customer at a higher level. So I think you put those things together, and that team is on a strong trajectory to hit that 20% target. And then we will ask for more from there.\nChristopher Parkinson: Got it. And just a very quick follow-up, and also, quite frankly, a corollary of what you just said. I don\u2019t get to have myself with the next remark, but it seems things are generally progressing a little bit better than expected. Obviously, that\u2019s reflected in the guidance range and so on and so forth. When we take a step back and you look at your portfolio, obviously, you\u2019ve taken a few extra actions of the last 12 to 18 months in both divesting as well as acquiring. Can you just give kind of a very quick update on where you stand with that thought process? Are there any technologies which you still feel you\u2019re focusing on? Are there still assets which you would consider divesting? Just given the actions over the last, quite frankly, 5 years plus? Any update there would be very helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Chris, we\u2019ve done 20 transactions since announcing Valspar, 16 were acquisitions and six were divestitures. What we\u2019re focused on is and where we want to grow our those areas that we can bring value, that we would be rewarded for bringing solutions to our customers. And we take a hard and disciplined look in other areas. So we\u2019ve divested \u2013 the Valspar wood divestiture was required by the FTC. We divested Guardsman, which came with Valspar, Wade in Australia, which came with Valspar. We\u2019ve announced the Huarun in China came with Valspar in the specialty aerosol plant that we\u2019ve recently announced also came with Valspar. One legacy Sherwin business was the thermoplastic road marking business. Here at Sherwin, we\u2019re focused on high-value products and areas. So that didn\u2019t fit our portfolio. But we\u2019ve done a lot of really good deals that we believe that can help drive value for our shareholders while bringing solutions to our customers. And with that discipline, to your question on will we continue that discipline continues every day here. We\u2019re having discussions every day about programs, the hard discussions about customers, the geographies. We don\u2019t want to just put flags on a map. We\u2019re here to create value for our shareholders. And it\u2019s sometimes hard to make those decisions. But quite frankly, we look at all of these businesses as part of our capital allocation. When we put our money in to buy Valspar and we inherited a lot of these businesses that was capital that was allocated. And if it doesn\u2019t meet the threshold for our shareholder return, then we make those difficult decisions. And that\u2019s part of who we are. And when we\u2019re out looking for acquisitions, it\u2019s not just what\u2019s for sale. We take a very disciplined approach. We\u2019ve got a team led by Bryan Young here and our team that does a wonderful job in helping to identify what would be fit if it\u2019s for sale or not. And if it\u2019s not for sale, we go try to have those honest discussions with the owners about why it might be a better fit with Sherwin. So it\u2019s a disciplined approach that we take. We\u2019re proud of it. We\u2019re not out just trying to buy volume or sales or book of business. It has to fit strategically or we\u2019re not interested.\nChristopher Parkinson: Thank you for your thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from R.W. Baird & Company. Your line is live.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. John, as you kind of think about 2023 specific to Paint Stores Group, what do you think the common theme is as it relates to the volume outperformance across your various categories? I\u2019m just curious, is the customer backlogs that were a bit stronger than relative to what you initially thought or market share gains or something else? And then on residential repaint, do you think that vertical could be directionally less sensitive to existing home sales on a go-forward basis relative to the historical baseline?\nJohn Morikis: Well, how about if I take the first piece, and I\u2019ll throw it to Heidi on the resale because she\u2019s working very closely on that. I think there is a number of areas, Ghansham. I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time on this because I did just hit this, but I think the foundation of our strategy and our focus really comes down to the people that I just mentioned. We talked about this management training program that we\u2019ve had for over 40 years. We recruit 1,500 college graduates every year. So we\u2019re recruiting and we\u2019re training and developing the best talent, we believe. And yes, we\u2019ve made some compensation adjustments that appeared in our SG&A to retain this talent. And we think that was a great investment, and we\u2019d make it every day because we\u2019re going to win or lose by our people. And so when you ask about what\u2019s happening in the market, I think, quite honestly, our people are executing. It\u2019s a very choppy market out there right now. There were times when you would talk with customers, and they would say they have not advertised in 5 years and some of our customers had never advertised at all. They were spin-off of working for someone else and the market has been so hot, that they just put a sign up in the first house they painted and then it started to roll. Now with the adversity in the market, we look that much more attractive to painting contractors that are looking for assistance and looking for help. And we welcome that. It\u2019s the reason we have over 3,000 sales reps and nearly 5,000 stores in the market. We don\u2019t look at our position nationally. We look at our business market by market, customer by customer, and we\u2019re trying to address their needs. And so I don\u2019t think that there is a lot of wind in the sales of a lot of people on the architectural side, there is good a good book of backlog business, as Heidi mentioned, but there is some uncertainty and there is some choppiness. And our people are there to paraphrase this almost to hold the hands of these important customers and help them through that. And as a result, we get rewarded. So we\u2019re executing really well in a choppy market. That\u2019s how it would respond how we\u2019re performing in the market. Regarding res repaint specifically, Heidi, maybe I\u2019ll have you answer that.\nHeidi Petz: Yes, Ghansham, I think the good question. In terms of the reliance on resale, I think that the inverse is true as well, which is that those that are staying in place, making sure that they are aware that this is really about the opportunity to raise the value of their home if they choose to stay. We mentioned earlier the inexpensive and highly impactful project. I mentioned the data earlier. I\u2019d like to go back to that. I think it\u2019s a great example of how we\u2019re able to penetrate and not be reliant on the resale market. In terms of our ability to go back \u2013 I\u2019ll give you an example, again, without getting into too much detail, mining for the data for those customers that haven\u2019t bought paint in a while for customers based on a certain demographic that we know are more likely or a certain region that are more likely to reengage in the category. Mentioned earlier, our team, something that really differentiates us in this space is we\u2019ve got 1,500 graduates every year that really own the P&L in their store, and they are hunting for this exact customer. So a lot of respect for the people out that are building these relationships and making sure that whether it\u2019s a homeowner or a contractor making sure that we\u2019re being very surgical in terms of how we approach these really important customers.\nJim Jaye: And I\u2019d add one thing to that as well, Ghansham, what you\u2019re seeing with the softness in existing home sales as an extended period what we\u2019re seeing is people can\u2019t wait. So that\u2019s driving them to new res. And I think that\u2019s also supporting some of the new res business. And as we\u2019ve spoken many times about our business as a table, whichever way the market may tilt. I think it\u2019s a great example as John walked through new res, telling you how well prepared and how much value we bring in that area as these folks simply can\u2019t find a home to move into because the inventory is so low, we\u2019re going to go new build, and we\u2019re right there.\nGhansham Panjabi: Got it. And then for my second question, on PCG, several categories seem to have been impacted by destocking across the various regions. Where are we in that process, do you think? You give some comments on packaging? What about the other major verticals? Thanks.\nJohn Morikis: Well, I would like to talk about packaging because if there is one, Ghansham, that fits your description there, it would be packaging. We\u2019ve got customers working through softer demand and overstock. And as we see that continue. It\u2019s likely going to continue through Q3, perhaps even Q4. But we feel really confident. This is a strong team with a growing position with great technology. We talked about this V70 unique technology that is really fantastic, and we hear it from our customers. It\u2019s a plug and play. It\u2019s really highly efficient is superior in its ability to keep flavor protection of the product, next-gen non-BPA. It\u2019s just a fantastic product, and it\u2019s been very well received by our customers. So we\u2019ve got confidence in this business. It\u2019s just going to be bumpy. And while we have high expectations, we often push hard. We also have to be realistic with our team. So we\u2019re feeling good there. When you look at the rest of the businesses inside our PCG business, we mentioned it\u2019s bumpy. We\u2019ve got some that might be more resilient as others. We talked about auto refinish. This is a team that\u2019s really hitting on all cylinders, unintended that is really leveraging the technology combination from Valspar and Sherwin together, along with the platform of stores. Many people think about stores through our architectural Paint Stores Group, but we bring the same value through our automotive stores direct to customer, and we are really growing business there as well. Our general industrial business is one that is kind of a mixed bag. If you look at areas such as large ag and construction is doing well, where building products and general finishing is soft. So when you look at this business, and you look around wherever you are right now, the office, every sub-state that you see likely is one of two businesses, general industrial or industrial wood and our businesses there offer a terrific opportunity, but they are going to be a little bit bumpy. In Coil, I would say we had a decrease in Coil, largely driven by Europe and Asia. North America is holding up a little bit better than other regions. But again, it\u2019s a team that\u2019s bringing a unique responsiveness to customers\u2019 needs in a way that help us grow market share even in a down market.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Ghansham.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan Securities. Your line is live.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Is it fair to say that in the first half, raw materials were down by a low to mid-single-digit rate? And in the second half as a base case they should be down by a high single-digit rate.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Jeff, I would say you are correct, maybe not quite high single digit on the second half, but close to it. Yes.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay.\nAl Mistysyn: Third quarter, actually, it will be up our high \u2013 it will be the best improvement year-over-year. \nJeff Zekauskas: Would be the highest, yes. And as a base case, for 2024, when you look across your businesses, do you expect your general level of prices to be higher or lower or flat?\nAl Mistysyn: Sitting here today, Jeff. We continue to talk about our pricing and our ability to maintain pricing as the raw materials moderate because of the solutions that we drive. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to talk about incremental pricing for 2024. We have \u2013 we look at the total input cost basket to determine if we need a price or don\u2019t need a price. And as you know, any price discussions we have we\u2019d have them with our customers first then talk to the Street. So we have time to talk about 2024 over the next quarter and half quarters.\nJeff Zekauskas: Okay. Great. Thank you, so much. \nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. John, Al, how should we think about second half earnings in terms of the cadence between Q3 and Q4?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. David, I mean, when you look at the earnings, as John and Heidi talked about, our visibility and demand, which is going to drive our performance through the second half is limited. So we have a better line of sight in our third quarter than our second quarter. We\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t give EPS or fourth quarter. We don\u2019t give EPS guidance, but a couple of other things I would note, I do expect to see a seasonal slowdown in architectural in our fourth quarter, which will impact our gross margin as it historically has done. So I believe this is a year that is the second half more what I would say, typical than some of the last 3 years. But our third quarter is typically a stronger quarter, and I\u2019d expect that to continue.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good. And John, one of your competitors announced a couple of homebuilder wins over the last few months. Why do you think they won that business and you may have lost that business? And overall, how is the competitive landscape in that portion of the business? Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Thanks for that. I\u2019d start with every single customer is important to us, everyone. I also think it\u2019s important that you understand how we think to us, we play every day in the world series. And we want to sweep the series. We want to win every single game. But we\u2019re also realist. We\u2019re not going to expect every one of our pictures to throw a perfect game were to win every game is a shut out. But I\u2019ll tell you this, I believe we have the best team, the best resources and great momentum. So even if our competitors score an occasional run or if our pictures throw up occasional ball here or there, we\u2019re not going to panic. We\u2019ve got, we believe, the right team will sweep the series. And we\u2019re out there right now. We believe if you look at that top 100 builders and the penetration that we have, we\u2019re growing it and growing it aggressively, and we expect that to continue. And we\u2019re doing that at all our competitors\u2019 expense. We just don\u2019t choose to talk about it.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you very much.\nJohn Morikis: You bet.\nHeidi Petz: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is live.\nMike Sison: Hi, guys. Nice quarter. With the third quarter volumes potentially being down, do you think things are bottoming as I think about the fourth quarter volumes look like they could be flattish to maybe even up? And then \u2013 and how do you think about 24% volume growth next year? Do you think it\u2019s \u2013 we could be in a position to start growing again?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Mike, take one more run at that question here, maybe I missed.\nMike Sison: Yes, I guess for quarter. I guess I\u2019m trying to understand if you think things are bottoming here in the third and then potential for volume growth for the total entity maybe into the fourth quarter and into 2024?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. I think that\u2019s a challenge answer. I\u2019d say if you look at new residential, we\u2019re suggesting that we\u2019ve outperformed, for example, in new residential and that we expect the balance of the year to be a little bumpier. Housing starts are starting to come back, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, but even homes that are they break ground today, it\u2019s likely going to be for the future likely next year before we start painting those. And so I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019d say we\u2019re probably bouncing around here a little bit. We will see what happens. But our approach has been right now that as the market is soft, our goal is to outperform it. And going forward between Q3 and Q4 gallons, I\u2019d say it\u2019s likely going to trend about where we are.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. I think on if you look at we said projected to be flat to low single digits. But when you look at the dollars, sequentially, they are pretty close. And that\u2019s with new res declining more in our third quarter than we expected in our fourth quarter, which tells you we have some strength in our other segments that John and Heidi talked about, and it\u2019s going up against the 21.5% comp last year. So when you think about the second half, Paint Stores Group has a tough comp, I\u2019d say the other segments, as we talked about, are choppy, and it\u2019s by business, by region. I think some businesses in certain regions have bottomed out. I think there is still challenges that we see in Asia Pacific. But as an example, Europe in our second half, we expect to do better than what we did in the first half. 2024, that\u2019s a whole different discussion that we will have as we get into January on our year-end call.\nHeidi Petz: One piece I would add to that, I think, is just an indicator of the strength of the backlog. I think if you look at stronger and more solid backlogs across commercial property maintenance and PNM. And I would also say it\u2019s not just the backlog, it\u2019s the way in which we\u2019re interacting with these customers. We\u2019re close to these customers than we\u2019ve ever been before, which is a large part based on our controlled distribution model, but it\u2019s also based on coming out of the last few years of a lot of challenges. I think we\u2019ve all essentially become better planners together. So those backlogs our component, but also our closeness to the customer, gives me a lot of confidence in the outlook.\nMike Sison: Got it. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to follow-up on that last point as far as backlog. Could you potentially provide us with some backlogs across maybe some of the different market segments that you\u2019re seeing in PSG? I know when you started out the year, you noted that there was quite a few jobs still in the backlog on the new side through the first half, but then it really kind of limited after that. So how would you characterize the backlog now, if you can provide a little bit more granularity on that? Thanks. \nJohn Morikis: Yes, Arun, I\u2019d say I\u2019ll jump in here. I think if you look at the points that Heidi is making, I think there is two points. You\u2019re asking one very good question, but there is another element here that I want to tie to this. One is if you look across the various segments and say, okay, commercial, we see strong residential repaint, a little bit choppier with resales, but we can see out 6 to 8 months property maintenance strong. DIY has been strong, but it\u2019s on a softer comps, so we don\u2019t expect that to continue. I think all of those are opportunities for us to continue to grow market share, and we will. The other point, though, that I think she\u2019s talking \u2013 that she spoke to that I think is important is coming through COVID and in the shortage we\u2019ve worked much closer with our customers in ways that, quite honestly, I wish I would have had that opportunity when I was in a store. We\u2019re now working collaboratively with what projects are taking place now, what\u2019s next, even to the point where if it rains, my fallback is this position. And the fact that we\u2019ve got our reps and our stores out there, close to the backlog and close with our customers closer than ever before is a terrific advantage that we\u2019re trying to leverage. So by segment, I would say, yes, we see new residential likely to slow down a little bit as the slowdown works its way to the painting phase of the homes that weren\u2019t started 8 months ago. Property maintenance, we\u2019re really leveraging the fact that their CapEx money is freeing up. Our national agreements are opportunities for us and the others, as I described. So it\u2019s a good market for us because there is a lot of diversity in the market, and that\u2019s what we thrive on.\nArun Viswanathan: That\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up on the raw material side. Could you just maybe provide us with some idea of what you\u2019ve been procuring at in the second quarter? I would imagine it\u2019s maybe down mid to high single digits. And does that flow through, I guess, in the second half? And have you seen any declines in TiO2 as well? Or do you expect any of those? Thanks.\nJim Jaye: Yes, Arun. So our raw material basket in the second quarter was down in that high single-digit range. And what was really driving that deflation for us, as you might expect, is the petrochemical side of the basket, resins, in solvents, even plastic packaging, the decline in some of the key feedstocks such as propylene, it\u2019s now flowing through into the things that we\u2019re buying, and we expect that to continue \u2013 this is a cycle that we\u2019ve seen many times over the years. With regard to TiO2, your question there, those costs are still a little bit elevated for us, but we expect to see them starting to trend in a more positive direction as the year goes on. Some of the key input costs on TiO2 are elevated right now, chlorine being one of the main ones. And I\u2019d also say some suppliers are also trying to manage their capacity a little bit more tightly. But with demand soft here, you\u2019re going to see or we believe we\u2019re going to see and expect to see some decreases in the TiO2 pricing.\nArun Viswanathan: Thanks.\nJim Jaye: You bet.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks, Arun.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.\nDuffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. I was hoping you could help us just triangulate a little bit. When you look at the midpoint of your guide, what it implies is the back half versus the first half this year is going to be down 22% on EPS. But when you look at the last 7 years, the average is for that to be up 6%, and it\u2019s been up 5 of the 7 years. So when you add to that the raw materials should be better in the second half versus the first. I just have a hard time triangulating that new resi will be a big enough negative to take the earnings down on a sequential basis, first half to second half. So, could you just talk through what else might be negative first half to second half?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Duffy, I mean it starts with that sales outlook down mid-single digit from \u2013 for second half versus first half. Less price would be in that, so we have got a nice tailwind in the first half for price that helped drive our operating \u2013 our gross margin. And so you also see a lower volume, specifically in consumer and in our Performance Coatings Group. So I think as you would expect, you are going to get lower gross profit dollars. I do still expect gross margin expansion in our second half, not quite as good as year-over-year anyway that we saw in our first half because of our comps. And then you do get some help on the raw material reduction, but that is partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption in our second half due to lower production volumes. I think SG&A, even we talked about SG&A in the opening and being more aggressive at adding investments for our long-term growth strategy, both in stores, reps, field tech service reps. And the final piece these non-operating costs that I would call out that were \u2013 are probably going to be an incremental $60 million to $70 million headwind versus our first half because some of the gains that we had on sale of assets and marketable securities. So, I think those are the things that are driving that sequential movement.\nDuffy Fischer: Okay. And then just, again, if we ever get back to normal, whatever that is, do you still believe that your structural footprint is the second half earnings profile is better than the first half earnings profile for the company?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Duffy, I will try to go back to a normal year, 2019. So, to your point, I am not sure what normal is. But I think as we continue to see growth in our Performance Coatings Group, that\u2019s less seasonal. You might not see as big of an increase in our second half versus our first half as we move forward. But if we get back to the way Paint Stores Group brand, our consumer business brands and yes, you should typically see that.\nJohn Morikis: Okay. I guess I would just add on to the investment strategy that Al mentioned. We are a 157-year-old company. We are not trying to run the company for a perfect quarter here. We have got confidence in our strategy. It\u2019s a proven strategy with proven leadership team, through a proven and growing asset base in stores and in the facilities that we are running. So, to Al\u2019s point, we are going to invest into that. And we played a long game here. We know what we are doing. And quite frankly, we are going to do more of it.\nDuffy Fischer: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Duffy.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman & Associates. Your line is live.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey. Good afternoon guys. Just curious if you could give an update on the Pros Who Paint business and how that\u2019s been trending?\nHeidi Petz: Yes, good question, Adam. I think there is a lot of growing \u2013 certainly growing interest here as it relates to how we are partnering with our strategic retail partners and certainly the investment that\u2019s following that with a lot of confidence and growth to be gained there. And I won\u2019t get into a lot of the details because I think those are certainly for our retailer partners to share. But I can tell you that the level of collaboration an alignment from the planning standpoint, certainly understanding how the calendar lays out, laying in key events throughout the year, making sure that the data is aligned, that the reps are aligned, that the structures are aligned. It\u2019s \u2013 we are just getting started to hear and we have got a lot of confidence in where this can go.\nAdam Baumgarten: Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just if you could discuss some of the simplification efforts you are making across the enterprise and kind of the timeline there and the impacts you ultimately expect that to have on the business?\nHeidi Petz: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I will tell you that, that\u2019s going to be a journey onto itself. So, when you think about it, how we are kind of broadly defining this is truly looking end to end. Al mentioned this earlier, where we are looking to bring some efficiencies, certainly with our global supply chain team. Al mentioned the Performance Coatings Group, I would say true for all groups and for our supply chain as well, really understanding all the way from the raw materials you asked \u2013 the question was asked earlier, Jim mentioned how we are thinking about procurement in general. The conversations that we are having are I would say a lot more detailed relative to the sub-supplier level and making sure that when we step back and look at our supplier strategy, there is a distinction between strategic suppliers and transactional suppliers. So, we are having those very important conversations at the front end. And then if I take you all the way through, Al mentioned our rationalization efforts that are underway. But as you can imagine, as we simplify the basket, and continue the rationalization efforts from a customer-facing standpoint, it puts us in a much more optimized and efficient standpoint from an operational manufacturing logistics. And so there is a lot of milestones that the team is setting forward here. This will be a multiyear journey, as I mentioned, but I would expect that we will see some customer-facing updates as it relates to how we can compete with a more aggressive portfolio of products here in the short run. And then you will see that continue to show up to the bottom line as we move faster and faster towards automation and the like.\nAl Mistysyn: The only thing I would add to that, Adam, is we talk about efficiencies, but we also are focused on these efforts to increase our capacity so that we are not having to put capital back into capacity and then also looking at opportunities for working capital reduction. So, John talked about the divestitures and part of our capital allocation philosophy, it\u2019s really a strong and focus on delivering cash generation back to our targets that we laid out and also how we utilize our \u2013 best utilize our assets.\nAdam Baumgarten: Thanks. Best of luck.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is live.\nJosh Spector: Yes. Hi. So, just a follow-up on working capital and specifically inventory. So, I mean your inventory stepped down a few million \u2013 a few hundred million sequentially. Just curious if you would say you have your volumes of inventory at the right level for what you are expecting in terms of second half volumes or if you are continuing to destock that inventory through the year, and really what that means for your expectations for working capital for 2023? Thanks.\nAl Mistysyn: Sure, Josh. As typically is the case as we get into the summer selling season, we will see a sequential decrease in our inventory gains, as you mentioned. I think you will see a sequential decrease in our third quarter, which is also typical. And then we will build inventory back in our fourth quarter to our targeted numbers that are similar to prior \u2013 similar to last year, but to more historic levels. So, I feel very good about where our inventories are at today. That being said, we will adjust production through the second half to maintain that targeted year-end inventory. I don\u2019t want to get us too far ahead going into next year. So, we will monitor demand trends closely and adjust production schedules accordingly. We will try to push that working capital back towards our target by year-end of 11.5%. I think that\u2019s going to be a little difficult considering accounts payables because of the lower production is what\u2019s driving our increase over that 13%. But we will get that working capital back towards the target of 11%, 11.5% going forward.\nJosh Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is live.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. This 10%, roughly increase in SG&A that you are expecting for the year. Can you talk a little bit about what exactly is driving that? Is that underlying wages? Is it variable comp to incentivize aggressive effort in sales? Is that headcount? Is it something else? Is it a digital app? What would you say is driving that? What are the primary buckets driving a 10% increase in SG&A?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Steve, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in our best interest to lay out exactly where our investments are to be truthful with you. I would say that we have a proven leadership team. We have been at this for a long time. We see opportunities, and we invest. And many of the topics that you brought up are areas of investment. So, yes, we are going to invest in securing our people, the retention of our people, the training of our people. We are going to add reps through our stores and through other channels that are important to us. We are investing in innovation and digital. We are not going to get into any specifics deeper than that. But we believe \u2013 and quite frankly, we are very proud that when we make an investment that our shareholders can count on a return, and we have demonstrated the discipline to be able to do that.\nSteve Byrne: And then on your cost structure, Al, if I heard you right, I think you have indicated low-single digit deflation in raw material costs. And I believe that was not current purchases, but what flowed through COGS in the second quarter, is there something else that was a meaningful change year-over-year in cost structure like freight or logistics or something because your gross profit increased year-over-year, significantly more than revenue. There seems to be maybe something else in there other than just low single-digit raws.\nAl Mistysyn: Let me ask Steve, if we had better than those, low-single digit raw in the second quarter. If that\u2019s what I said, that wasn\u2019t correct. We had more like high-single digit reduction in raw material costs. And what I said is the offset \u2013 partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption because we had lower production volumes in the second quarter, mainly because we had to rebuild inventories last year, and we didn\u2019t have to redo that. So, we are at a more typical production schedule this year than last year. So, that\u2019s maybe what the little bit of a headwind would have been in the quarter versus raw material benefits.\nJohn Morikis: With a more optimized supply chain this year versus last year, Steve, last year, literally, we were taking raws wherever we could make them or get them manufacturing paint and sending it to customers wherever they needed it. And we absorbed that into our margin. But I think again, it speaks to the commitment we make to our customers and why they can count on us.\nSteve Byrne: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Patrick Cunningham from Citi. Your line is live.\nPatrick Cunningham: Great. Thank you. You talked about the fixed cost drag from lower production volumes. How much lower are utilization rates versus historical levels? And if the recent uptrend maybe in housing starts or commercial and property hangs in there, do you expect to bump up to historic high utilization rates in 2024 and perhaps even pre-build more additional inventory in 4Q? Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Patrick, we don\u2019t talk about capacity utilization. I will tell you this that we have added some capacity. So, we have got the ability to be more responsive to our customers\u2019 needs. When we talked about taking working capital down, Al\u2019s comments about getting down in that 11.5% range, we have confidence in our ability to do that. While improving service to our customers as we go through the simplification efforts that Heidi is leading to the company on the operational side as well as the capacity that we have.\nPatrick Cunningham: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Patrick.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc. Your line is live.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks. I just had one question. On DIY, you have easy comps in the first half, getting to harder comps in the second half. What is the underlying trend here for your business and the market overall? Is it sequentially still decelerating, improving or stable?\nHeidi Petz: I will start with that. I think if you look at DIY and our Paint Stores Group, I give you a slightly different response versus what we are seeing in the rest of our business and largely based on the premise that there is a slightly different segment and a customer that\u2019s looking for more service that want more of that specialty paint store experience. So, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing traffic up in our stores. I think the challenge on the softness and you will see this on the consumer brand side as well. We have gotten back into a strong position of inventory. You will see some more promotional activity that\u2019s been happening in an effort to drive traffic. But still continue to see some of that softness coming in the current state, at least through the balance of the year.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks a lot.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is live.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes, good afternoon. In your consumer business, can you speak to the outlook for repair and remodeling activity. And given that backdrop, do you expect your market share among Pros Who Paint to rise or fall or stay about the same over the next year or so?\nJohn Morikis: We expect our market share to grow. And if you look at what\u2019s happening from a Lyra standpoint, predictions on what\u2019s going to happen right now, I would say, there is a slowing in the remodel business, but the truth be told is that this is an opportunity for us. In our business, there are a lot of people that talk about percentages and might most large percentage increases on a relatively small business. And quite frankly, this is a new and growing opportunity for us. So, the dollars are not where we believe they can be percentage-wise, we have significant increases, and we expect those increases to continue as we partner with our customers who are interested in growing this. And importantly, I think to understand the strategy here, there are customers, particularly those that paint as a part of their project that prefer a home center model. Some of those customers might find their way into our stores. And a natural question is the concern about cannibalization. We are not concerned with that. We will gladly put that share of business up, knowing that there is a significant opportunity for us to grow with our partners to pursue the remodeler, if you will, who is using paint on a project. So, yes, it\u2019s going to grow. We are focused on it with our customers, and we are determines\u2019 group combined. So, we expect positive growth.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Thank you for that John. And secondly, if I may, perhaps for Al, it appears as though your 2023 CapEx outlook declined by $100 million to $700 million. Why is that, is that a function of timing or any meaningful changes to the project roster?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Kevin, it\u2019s all related to timing. We are still moving forward with the Statesville expansion that we had talked about earlier this year. We are still moving forward with the warehouse automation projects that we had talked about and continued driving the packaging capacity expansions that we talked about. So, it\u2019s just timing and with a better line of sight to the second half we thought we would update that number.\nKevin McCarthy: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global. Your line is live.\nMike Harrison: Hi. Good afternoon. You have completed a handful of acquisitions and you are integrating those in the Performance Coatings business. Can you just give us an update on how you are seeing those operating and commercial synergies progressing on some of the key deals that you have completed?\nHeidi Petz: Yes. Mike, it\u2019s a great question. I think there is a whole host of acquisitions John mentioned earlier. And I would say the team is laser focused on, first and foremost, making sure that these integrations are seamless to the customer. We are very focused on the integration at the team level. I think when you look at some of our \u2013 the acquisitions that have been around technologies, and our ability to quickly \u2013 the tech transfer has been an area of focus so that we are able to get those products outside of one necessary region and in some cases, moving across the country or moving them across globally. So, we are really focused on making sure we are getting the value capture out of some of these and the synergies that we know are there. But there is a lot of great work being done by the teams to make sure that we are keeping our customers focused on a fuller assortment in a fuller portfolio of choices based on these acquisitions.\nMike Harrison: Alright. And then you mentioned in the consumer business that you were seeing some stabilization in Europe. I was hoping that you could maybe provide a little more detail on what you are seeing there and maybe what your expectations look like for the second half in Europe, both in terms of demand and as you think about the price/cost front?\nJohn Morikis: You are talking about on the consumer side in Europe?\nMike Harrison: Consumer in Europe, yes.\nJohn Morikis: Yes. So first, to capture this, it\u2019s a relatively small percentage of our overall business. It\u2019s \u2013 we are proud of our relationship there. We play a kind of a niche role, if you will, in intended paint through the Valspar brand this came to us with our acquisition. We have got a terrific relationship that we are interested in growing. And I would say the momentum that we have is good, and we are excited about it.\nHeidi Petz: One of that too, just based on some of the economic recovery, the stability that we are seeing coming in, and I think it\u2019s playing to our favor based on this tented program that\u2019s unique in a lot of these countries.\nMike Harrison: Thanks very much.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Your line is live.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Could you just remind us how big U.S. new resi is as a percent of total sales? And even though your paint doesn\u2019t get applied until completion, I think you bid it closer to the start. So, what\u2019s the \u2013 can you quantify at all what the bidding activity has been or the backlog?\nJohn Morikis: John, new residential is a mid-teens percentage of our Paint Stores Group. And we don\u2019t bid house, John. We quote our customers on a regular basis, and those are fluid discussions that we have with our customers. So, it varies by customer, the timing of any agreements that we have, and we just work closely with our customers to ensure that they have as much lead time to any adjustments to pricing as possible.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. Even the largest homebuilders?\nJohn Morikis: Even the largest.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks John.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your line is live.\nEric Bosshard: Clarity on two things if you could, first of all, on raws. The 5 to 9 full year, what was the first half of raw material?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. The first half, I would say our second half is going to be better than our first half, Eric. In the first quarter, it was a pretty modest. If you remember, we said it was a pretty modest deflation. It got better. I mentioned sort of high-single digit range in the second quarter. It will be better in the second half with probably the third quarter, probably the peak year-over-year benefit.\nEric Bosshard: And then secondly, relative to the original guidance, is the increase relative to what you thought the year would look like, is that even between the first half and second half, or is that more first half loaded?\nJohn Morikis: Yes. Eric, I would say it\u2019s more first half loaded. And as we talked about, we expected a strong first half and demand, as we again talked about was stronger in our first half. So, it\u2019s more first half loaded.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. And then is there anything different that makes it more first half loaded, or is there \u2013 I understand the comparisons, the comparisons existed and there were comparisons in the first half as well. I mean is there something that makes \u2013 creates more benefit in the first half than the second half?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. The comparisons are better. We get more price tailwind in our first half and even with that within admin, we had some gains on sale assets and stuff like that, that maybe helped us $0.05 in the second quarter. But yes, the comps are going to get steeper. And then it\u2019s the outlook on the choppy demand environment. And I would say that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see a bigger tailwind in our second half plus the investments we are making for future growth.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.\nJohn Morikis: Thank you, Eric.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Your line is live.\nGarik Shmois: Hi. Thank you. Just want to follow-up on the strength you are seeing in commercial within Paint Stores Group. It runs a little bit contrary to some of the macro that\u2019s been a bit choppier on commercial. So, I am just wondering how much of that is maybe share gains versus a particular vertical that you have been over exposing yourselves to?\nJohn Morikis: We do believe we are gaining share there. It\u2019s a great opportunity again to highlight this controlled distribution. The approach that we take has been grounded in the focus on the applicator on the specifier and the owner through a distribution platform that is first class. And so our reps are working hand-in-hand with our customers. I would say that many of our customers would see our reps almost as part of their team. And the more challenging the market, the more valuable that sales rep is and the facilities that we build to service those needs. So, yes, I think we are growing share. I think there is a good \u2013 really good momentum through the balance of the year, rolling into next year. From there, as I mentioned earlier, while we are not waiting for the business that \u2013 to finish up, we are very focused on those sub-segments that I mentioned earlier that are a bit more resilient that we are focused on to continue the momentum.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Thanks. And I wanted to follow-up on resi repaint, you talked about contractor visibility and backlog several times. I just wonder if you could put that in context, is the visibility in backlog that you are hearing from your contractor customers. Are these back to more normalized levels at this point, or are we still running below normal given some of the headwinds over the last several quarters?\nHeidi Petz: I would say they are back to more normalized levels. I think you will see, depending on the size of the resi repaint contractor, some that are willing to take on more and have the labor and the support and the resources to do that and some that are smaller in size and that might be more governed by shortage in labor. We are really trying to intercept them at that point and help them focus on how they can be as productive as possible. So, everything from our product assortment to our tools to our reps and how we are engaging these contractors, making sure that when they are on the job site, they are as productive as possible, how they bid, how they quote, how they get paid. So, really trying to help them from an entire business standpoint, regardless of the maturity of their size.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. Thanks again.\nJohn Morikis: Thanks Garik.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nJim Jaye: I want to thank everybody again for joining our call today. I hope you heard come through loud and clear. Our team is aligned and committed to growing our business profitably, but we are also going to invest in growth and customer-facing initiatives. That\u2019s going to drive our success and our customer success over the long-term. I will remind you that our annual Financial Community Presentation is going to be held here in Cleveland on August 24th. In addition to John, Heidi and Al, you are going to hear directly from our group presidents at the event, and they are looking forward to sharing their plans in each of those operating groups. And you will hear how they are planning to execute and drive those businesses forward as we described on much of the call today. You can register for that event on our website, and we look forward to seeing you at that event. So, thank you again for your interest in Sherwin. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you everyone. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

Second quarter Paint Stores Group sales were ahead of our expectations and increased 10%, driven by mid-single-digit volume growth and continued effective pricing. Segment margin improved 280 basis points to 24.3%. Growth was led by our protective & marine business, which was up strong double digits and was driven by industrial flooring infrastructure and oil and gas applications. In our pro-architectural end markets, the strongest performers were commercial and property maintenance, both of which increased by double-digit percentages. Residential repaint was close behind with sales up by a high single-digit percentage. Demand in this market is being somewhat tempered by the extended period of weak existing home sales. New residential sales were flat against a double-digit comparison, reflecting the softer start that we saw at the end of last year, which have continued into this year. As we've previously noted, we anticipated new residential would be challenging in 2023, though we are performing better than the market as we continue to focus on new accounts and share gains. Our DIY business was up strong double digits, albeit against a softer comparison where sales were impacted by supply chain challenges. From a product perspective, interior and exterior paint sales were both up high single digits, with interior sales growing faster and representing a larger part of the mix. Sales in our Consumer Brands Group also exceeded our guidance and increased by 5.1% in the quarter, primarily driven by mid-single-digit pricing. Sales in North America, our largest region, increased by a low single-digit percentage. We continue to invest here with our strategic retail partners for growth. In other regions, sales were up strong double digits in Latin America and Europe. Sales in China were down double digits, and we expect the previously announced divestiture of the China business to be completed in the third quarter. Adjusted segment margin was 15.7%, up 470 basis points year-over-year. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased less than 1% against a strong 15.2% comparison. Volume decreased low single digits but was offset by mid-single-digit increases in price. Adjusted segment margin increased 420 basis points to 18% of sales, which is within the range we have been targeting for this business. Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased low single digits against a nearly 30% comp. Sales in Europe were up mid-single digits. Latin America sales were down less than 1%, also against a strong comp of over 20%. Demand in Asia remained weak with sales down double digits against a soft period a year ago. From a division perspective, growth was strongest in Auto Refinish, which is up by a high single-digit percentage followed by General Industrial, which was up mid-single digits. Industrial wood sales were up less than 1% as softness in new residential continued to impact demand for furniture, capetry and flooring. Coil sales were down mid-single digits driven mainly by Europe, which was impacted by last year's Russia exit and against the nearly 40% comparison. Packaging sales were also down low double digits against a 20%-plus comp. We anticipated this decline given the near-term destocking by brand owners that we described on our last call. We continue to feel very good about our position and growth prospects in this end market. With that, let me turn it to John for his comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. Yes, hi, Greg, I think it's a great question. I think if you look across our entire enterprise right now, I would just qualify this or characterize this as choppy. I think that's true both by division, by region. When you break it down, our volume is down low to mid-single digits. If you look at Paint Stores Group alone down low single-digits, I would say that's primarily due to the new residential slowdown but confident in the increasing starts that we're seeing. Remember, that's against a really tough comp of 19%. That's a bit offset by some of the heavy impact that we're seeing with both PCG and CBG, but I'm confident in our ability to drive above market growth here. Yes. And as you know, we've had 7 years of double-digit growth here in this segment, and we're confident in our execution. But it's important to know that we're never complacent and doing what we know how to do, we believe we'll take share, especially in this environment. While it's currently positive, we know a slowdown is coming, and it's also being tempered by, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, by the extended period of week existing homes. So having said that, even in that challenging environment, paint will continue to outperform other categories since it is an inexpensive and highly impactful category. There's been a lot of speculation about next year, and I will tell you that the bidding activity has somewhat normalized. And believe it or not, these are actually very good times for Sherwin-Williams, where we believe that adversity brings about opportunity for us. In a large part, our controlled model, as many of us talked about previously, this allows us to dig deeper and not just trying to sell our contractors product, but really taking the time to intersect them where they are in their business and helping them to focus on growth and profitability. We have a lot of data that we've talked about in the past, but I think, and we won't get into specifics or details here. But it's important that as the team is working hard, John mentioned the talent in the frontline here, mining this data for opportunity and getting very surgical in addition to the data leveraging our rep force so that we can be very thoughtful as we approach these contractors and making sure that we are taking advantage of the talent that we've got out there. So we are currently focused on building these relationships and confident that we will continue to see some aggressive share gains here. I'll hit briefly on the DIY relative to stores. And I think, John, your question was specific to stores. Sales were up double digits in Q2 against a fairly soft comp. We don't expect this to continue at this pace, but we will note that there is been some very positive foot traffic in our stores relative to the segment. And with that, maybe just a brief touch on P&L. And just one piece I would add to that, John mentioned recent acquisition in flooring. I think that really is a great illustration of how we're looking at this as a broader portfolio of both technologies and services that we're bringing together in terms of our value proposition. But if I look specifically at something like the battery plants for semiconductors, we're not just excited for those projects, but candidly, for the infrastructure that will eventually surround those projects as well. So we feel we're very uniquely positioned to take advantage of that wave. Yes, Ghansham, I think the good question. In terms of the reliance on resale, I think that the inverse is true as well, which is that those that are staying in place, making sure that they are aware that this is really about the opportunity to raise the value of their home if they choose to stay. We mentioned earlier the inexpensive and highly impactful project. I mentioned the data earlier. I'd like to go back to that. I think it's a great example of how we're able to penetrate and not be reliant on the resale market. In terms of our ability to go back \u2013 I'll give you an example, again, without getting into too much detail, mining for the data for those customers that haven't bought paint in a while for customers based on a certain demographic that we know are more likely or a certain region that are more likely to reengage in the category. Mentioned earlier, our team, something that really differentiates us in this space is we've got 1,500 graduates every year that really own the P&L in their store, and they are hunting for this exact customer. So a lot of respect for the people out that are building these relationships and making sure that whether it's a homeowner or a contractor making sure that we're being very surgical in terms of how we approach these really important customers. Thanks, David. One piece I would add to that, I think, is just an indicator of the strength of the backlog. I think if you look at stronger and more solid backlogs across commercial property maintenance and PNM. And I would also say it's not just the backlog, it's the way in which we're interacting with these customers. We're close to these customers than we've ever been before, which is a large part based on our controlled distribution model, but it's also based on coming out of the last few years of a lot of challenges. I think we've all essentially become better planners together. So those backlogs our component, but also our closeness to the customer, gives me a lot of confidence in the outlook. Yes, good question, Adam. I think there is a lot of growing \u2013 certainly growing interest here as it relates to how we are partnering with our strategic retail partners and certainly the investment that's following that with a lot of confidence and growth to be gained there. And I won't get into a lot of the details because I think those are certainly for our retailer partners to share. But I can tell you that the level of collaboration an alignment from the planning standpoint, certainly understanding how the calendar lays out, laying in key events throughout the year, making sure that the data is aligned, that the reps are aligned, that the structures are aligned. It's \u2013 we are just getting started to hear and we have got a lot of confidence in where this can go. Yes, it's a great question. I will tell you that, that's going to be a journey onto itself. So, when you think about it, how we are kind of broadly defining this is truly looking end to end. Al mentioned this earlier, where we are looking to bring some efficiencies, certainly with our global supply chain team. Al mentioned the Performance Coatings Group, I would say true for all groups and for our supply chain as well, really understanding all the way from the raw materials you asked \u2013 the question was asked earlier, Jim mentioned how we are thinking about procurement in general. The conversations that we are having are I would say a lot more detailed relative to the sub-supplier level and making sure that when we step back and look at our supplier strategy, there is a distinction between strategic suppliers and transactional suppliers. So, we are having those very important conversations at the front end. And then if I take you all the way through, Al mentioned our rationalization efforts that are underway. But as you can imagine, as we simplify the basket, and continue the rationalization efforts from a customer-facing standpoint, it puts us in a much more optimized and efficient standpoint from an operational manufacturing logistics. And so there is a lot of milestones that the team is setting forward here. This will be a multiyear journey, as I mentioned, but I would expect that we will see some customer-facing updates as it relates to how we can compete with a more aggressive portfolio of products here in the short run. And then you will see that continue to show up to the bottom line as we move faster and faster towards automation and the like. I will start with that. I think if you look at DIY and our Paint Stores Group, I give you a slightly different response versus what we are seeing in the rest of our business and largely based on the premise that there is a slightly different segment and a customer that's looking for more service that want more of that specialty paint store experience. So, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing traffic up in our stores. I think the challenge on the softness and you will see this on the consumer brand side as well. We have gotten back into a strong position of inventory. You will see some more promotional activity that's been happening in an effort to drive traffic. But still continue to see some of that softness coming in the current state, at least through the balance of the year. Yes. Mike, it's a great question. I think there is a whole host of acquisitions John mentioned earlier. And I would say the team is laser focused on, first and foremost, making sure that these integrations are seamless to the customer. We are very focused on the integration at the team level. I think when you look at some of our \u2013 the acquisitions that have been around technologies, and our ability to quickly \u2013 the tech transfer has been an area of focus so that we are able to get those products outside of one necessary region and in some cases, moving across the country or moving them across globally. So, we are really focused on making sure we are getting the value capture out of some of these and the synergies that we know are there. But there is a lot of great work being done by the teams to make sure that we are keeping our customers focused on a fuller assortment in a fuller portfolio of choices based on these acquisitions. One of that too, just based on some of the economic recovery, the stability that we are seeing coming in, and I think it's playing to our favor based on this tented program that's unique in a lot of these countries. I would say they are back to more normalized levels. I think you will see, depending on the size of the resi repaint contractor, some that are willing to take on more and have the labor and the support and the resources to do that and some that are smaller in size and that might be more governed by shortage in labor. We are really trying to intercept them at that point and help them focus on how they can be as productive as possible. So, everything from our product assortment to our tools to our reps and how we are engaging these contractors, making sure that when they are on the job site, they are as productive as possible, how they bid, how they quote, how they get paid. So, really trying to help them from an entire business standpoint, regardless of the maturity of their size."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Heidi. As we said in January, we expected to have a strong first half of the year. Our team exceeded those expectations, and I want to thank all 64,000 of our employees for their relentless focus on serving our customers and for driving continuous improvement across the organization. We also understand that a good first half does not make a good year. We know we have work to do, and that's exactly where we are focused. On our April call, we said we would have a much better idea of how the year might unfold as we got deeper into the painting season. Here's what we're seeing as we begin the second half along with our plans for seizing the opportunities in front of us. In Paint Stores Group, we're facing a strong comparison to the second half a year ago, where sales were up 19%. We see customer backlogs as being solid in commercial, property maintenance and protective & marine throughout the second half, and we expect to deliver very solid strong growth in these end markets. Residential repaint should also be good for us as based on contractor feedback, though visibility here is only about 6 to 8 weeks and existing home sales are likely to remain weak. There's some recent optimism from new residential homebuilders regarding starts, but it won't be enough to move the needle meaningfully for us in 2023. We are more tied to completions, which are slowing. While we are confident we are growing share, we expect new residential volume will be challenging for us in the second half, though the year will likely come in closer to down high single digits compared to the down 10% to 20% full year range we provided in January. In DIY, double-digit growth in the first half was aided by softer comparisons to the prior year, where supply chain headwinds impacted our sales. We do not expect this pace of growth to continue as comparisons become much more difficult in the second half of the year. In Consumer Brands, North America DIY demand remained soft. Europe demand has stabilized and Latin America markets remain mixed. In Performance Coatings, many of our customers continue to report a high level of uncertainty regarding demand. Auto Refinish demand remains an exception and is solid in most regions with shortages in parts and technicians increasing CHOP backlogs. Installations of our systems in North America are up strong double digits year-to-date. This continues to bode well for future sales in this business. General industrial end markets are choppy with North American customers reporting mixed demand by end markets served. Industrial wood demand remains soft, though some positive signs in new residential construction indicate we may have reached the bottom. In Coil, demand is holding up better in the Americas versus Europe and Asia. And finally, in packaging, customers are returning to just in time versus just in case supply chain management, resulting in destocking that we expect will continue in the second half. The longer-term view here is still very robust with customers already committed to fill the additional capacity we're bringing on this year. Let me be very clear on our expectations here. We do not accept the excuse that markets are soft, and therefore, our opportunities are limited. Our job is not to report conditions, but to influence results. We know we cannot defy gravity in terms of the macro environment. But in every business, we are aggressively pursuing new accounts and share of wallet opportunities to drive market share gains. Moving to the cost side. We are revising our raw material outlook. We now expect costs to be down by mid- to high single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect to see decreases across several commodity categories, though the ranges likely will vary widely. We expect other costs, including wages and other input costs to be up in the mid- to high single-digit range. Compared to the guidance we laid out in January, full year sales growth and raw material costs are trending better than we anticipated. With this first half outperformance we expect considerable year-over-year operating margin expansion and earnings growth for the year. At the same time, these dynamics also afford us the opportunity to accelerate growth and service investments at a higher level than anticipated at the beginning of the year. As a result of these disciplined and enterprise-wide investments, which will drive our customers' continued success. We now expect the year-over-year increase in SG&A to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range for the full year. As in the past, we are highly confident in our ability to drive future above-market growth, and our returns will justify the actions we are taking now. Now moving on to our specific guidance. We anticipate our third quarter 2023 consolidated net sales will be up or down a low single-digit percentage compared to the third quarter of 2022, with volume down low to mid-single digits. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be up a low single-digit percentage with a volume down a low single-digit percentage. Our sales expectations by segment for the third quarter and the full year are included in the slide deck issued with our press release this morning. We are increasing our full year 2023 diluted net income per share to be in the range of $8.46 to $8.86 per share. We believe this increased range accurately reflects our first half outperformance, continued pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs while also acknowledging the ongoing uncertainty in the second half demand environment. This guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.81 per share. It also includes net expense related to our previously announced targeted restructuring actions of $0.03 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $9.30 to $9.70. This is an increase of 14.5% at the midpoint compared to our prior adjusted guidance of $7.95 to $8.65 per share. We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. Our slide deck includes additional information on our updated assumptions for the year, along with guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. We've also provided an update on our previously announced restructuring efforts. Onetime costs will be lower than previously anticipated. The estimated annual savings from our actions are unchanged. As we begin the second half, we'll remain focused on what we can control. Across the business, this means growing new accounts and share of wallet. It also means developing and retaining talent, improving and simplifying our operations and managing price cost dynamics. We remain confident in our differentiated strategy, our capabilities in our product and service solutions. Should the demand environment prove to be better than we are currently assuming, we would expect to deliver better results. What we can't control is the market. We're not interested in trying to time the economic recovery. What we are interested in is taking full advantage of it when it eventually arrives. This means investing in our growth now ahead of the curve. This approach has served our customers and our shareholders well over multiple past cycles. I have every confidence that it will do so once again. Above all, I have the utmost confidence in our leadership team and our people. They are the true differentiators. Together, we expect to continue outperforming our competitors and the market. This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Yes. So I'd say we refer to that as our current range. And I'd say in addition to every point that Al just made, the additional steps that we're taking on a regular basis and reviewing the programs that we have, the investments that we're making, the mix of our products, everything that we're doing goes into driving that margin. It's not simply just a price. There's a lot of activity on the operations side to drive inefficiency. We talked last year about some of the inefficiencies as we serve our customers we were shipping product from 1 point in the country into the other. And so as we continue to optimize our supply chain we expect to continue to drive that as well. Yes, that's correct. As we continue to invest in our business and bring more value to our customers, we'll invest into that and drive their profitability. And naturally, we'd expect that our shareholders participate in that as well. Thank you, Greg. Yes, Vincent, let me kick it off kind of my thinking on it and then I'll ask Al to get into some of the details. First, we are going to adjust our investments to market conditions. And these are things that we monitor closely. We reminded the trends in the market, as you just mentioned, activities and opportunities, cost, even the activities of our competitors. And we've seen this before. We'll capitalize on the market opportunities, the competitive shifts and missteps that our competitors make, these are all opportunities. So to your point, as we see raw material trends and these are part of our data set, all roll into what you should expect to see from Sherwin-Williams. We're going to be aggressive. We're going to drive market share and invest in our businesses. And I think it comes down to when you have confidence in your strategy and confidence in your leadership team like we do, you can invest. And while others are adjusting their strategies, we're going to take advantage of any shifts. We will be on the attack. Thank you, Vincent. So let me start with New Residential, because I think that's an important piece. And maybe what we will do here, John, is I'll start with New Residential, maybe talk about Commercial and then I'll ask Heidi to talk about some additional segments because to be truthful with you, we're very pleased with the execution of our team. We talk a lot about our secret weapon. And we talked about the recruitment and retention of this team. They are truly executing. We couldn't be any more proud. In New Residential, I think it's clear to all of us, there's pressure in the new residential space. Our flat sales in this quarter, I believe, are indicative of the share gains we're executing. We talked about penetrating that top 100 builders for the last couple of quarters. And quite honestly, we're working on that, and we're experiencing terrific success, in fact, even deeper into some of the more custom homebuilders as well. It's growing, and we expect to continue to grow there. We continue to execute on our strategy of bringing solutions to these builders to make them more successful. And I think that's the key and core behind everything we do. So in the builders area, the efficiency that we're bringing in our supply chain to help them in innovation, quality, consistency, even as they're adapting into different substrates to help defray costs. We are working with them to ensure that we have the right coatings for them. Importantly, I just talked about our people. I think our stores and our reps in this area \u2013 they're doing a fantastic job of staying close and in contact with not only our builders, but their applicators, which is very unique. And we've got a distribution platform that wherever our builders are building, whatever developments they're pursuing, our stores are where they are building and where they might want to build. So we're not out there promising if you will invest here, we'll invest with you. Our people are there and our assets are there, and we're capitalizing on that. So we're growing share. We have not experienced the depth of decline, as you mentioned, we originally projected. Although I would say we do expect to see softness in the second half. You talked about our strategy here and our commitment to favorably position the company and we think this segment absolutely demonstrates that. In the commercial side, I'd say we're experiencing very good performance. And again, I think it highlights the advantages of our controlled distribution. We expect the balance of 2023 to be strong. We're really focused on the sub-segments inside commercial going forward. So again, really leveraging the value of this controlled distribution model. Our reps and our specification teams are really dialing into those areas that provide opportunity. And even within those areas that might be strong now that could dry up even in those areas. We know that there will be opportunities could be in tenant build-out or wherever in commercial, it might shift we're going to be there. So again, our focus on applicators, the specifiers and the owners, we believe, will pay off for us. Res repaint is another area that I think is really important to talk about. Let me turn it over to Heidi. Well, property maintenance, I think, is another area that performed a little bit better than we expected. And we have a lot of confidence here. A lot of the delayed maintenance we believe now is being addressed. Apartment turnovers are strong and bodes well for us. And again, I think even the idea of return to travel, office and school all help. And as we leverage a national platform of just up stores and reps to be able to really capture that business as well. So it's a good business for us and one that performed better as well. Protective & marine was another area that in our stores that performed stronger than I would say we expected. I'll say that here, not to our team. We expect more from our team would be the answer I'd give them. Our core business was very strong, double-digit growth. But we've been investing in this business, and our expectations are high of this team. We've got terrific leaders in this area, and we've been making investments in areas. We've announced a number of acquisitions, for example, in flooring. That's helped us get into some really key opportunities in food and beverage, pharma, even airport hangers, all have been very strong. Energy has been very strong for us. It's another great example where we focus on everything from extraction to processing as well as alternative energy. Government activity here is trying to stimulate has been good for us as well. We see business in the area of mega plants for chips that have been good for us. as well as I mentioned, alternative energy, where we really have done a very nice job of bringing technology from all aspects. We're taking into wind farms, for example, there is one that's been promoted in the Northeast. It's going to be a terrific opportunity to bring our marine coatings as well as our heavy-duty petrochem technology to bear in a very unique way. So we're bringing technology. We're bringing a strength of a distribution platform, specifications and it's driving business that the business is very strong. Thanks, John. Yes, Chris, thanks for your question. I'll start and kick it to Al. You're right. We do feel very good, very proud of Karl Jorgenrud and his entire team. That leadership team is really focused on doing this the right way. So the solutions that we're bringing to our customers and the focus and discipline that we're bringing is part of the strategy we keep repeating. And as we do that, we bring value to our customers and we've been successful. The discipline in that is that if not every gallon is necessarily a good gallon for us as a result. We're focused on key segments, key customers. We're trying to introduce technology and services that help them to make more money. And again, as a result, we believe that our shareholders should participate in that. But the push is to make our customers successful and have discipline doing that. And that's exactly what the PCG team is doing. Chris, we've done 20 transactions since announcing Valspar, 16 were acquisitions and six were divestitures. What we're focused on is and where we want to grow our those areas that we can bring value, that we would be rewarded for bringing solutions to our customers. And we take a hard and disciplined look in other areas. So we've divested \u2013 the Valspar wood divestiture was required by the FTC. We divested Guardsman, which came with Valspar, Wade in Australia, which came with Valspar. We've announced the Huarun in China came with Valspar in the specialty aerosol plant that we've recently announced also came with Valspar. One legacy Sherwin business was the thermoplastic road marking business. Here at Sherwin, we're focused on high-value products and areas. So that didn't fit our portfolio. But we've done a lot of really good deals that we believe that can help drive value for our shareholders while bringing solutions to our customers. And with that discipline, to your question on will we continue that discipline continues every day here. We're having discussions every day about programs, the hard discussions about customers, the geographies. We don't want to just put flags on a map. We're here to create value for our shareholders. And it's sometimes hard to make those decisions. But quite frankly, we look at all of these businesses as part of our capital allocation. When we put our money in to buy Valspar and we inherited a lot of these businesses that was capital that was allocated. And if it doesn't meet the threshold for our shareholder return, then we make those difficult decisions. And that's part of who we are. And when we're out looking for acquisitions, it's not just what's for sale. We take a very disciplined approach. We've got a team led by Bryan Young here and our team that does a wonderful job in helping to identify what would be fit if it's for sale or not. And if it's not for sale, we go try to have those honest discussions with the owners about why it might be a better fit with Sherwin. So it's a disciplined approach that we take. We're proud of it. We're not out just trying to buy volume or sales or book of business. It has to fit strategically or we're not interested. Well, how about if I take the first piece, and I'll throw it to Heidi on the resale because she's working very closely on that. I think there is a number of areas, Ghansham. I don't want to spend a lot of time on this because I did just hit this, but I think the foundation of our strategy and our focus really comes down to the people that I just mentioned. We talked about this management training program that we've had for over 40 years. We recruit 1,500 college graduates every year. So we're recruiting and we're training and developing the best talent, we believe. And yes, we've made some compensation adjustments that appeared in our SG&A to retain this talent. And we think that was a great investment, and we'd make it every day because we're going to win or lose by our people. And so when you ask about what's happening in the market, I think, quite honestly, our people are executing. It's a very choppy market out there right now. There were times when you would talk with customers, and they would say they have not advertised in 5 years and some of our customers had never advertised at all. They were spin-off of working for someone else and the market has been so hot, that they just put a sign up in the first house they painted and then it started to roll. Now with the adversity in the market, we look that much more attractive to painting contractors that are looking for assistance and looking for help. And we welcome that. It's the reason we have over 3,000 sales reps and nearly 5,000 stores in the market. We don't look at our position nationally. We look at our business market by market, customer by customer, and we're trying to address their needs. And so I don't think that there is a lot of wind in the sales of a lot of people on the architectural side, there is good a good book of backlog business, as Heidi mentioned, but there is some uncertainty and there is some choppiness. And our people are there to paraphrase this almost to hold the hands of these important customers and help them through that. And as a result, we get rewarded. So we're executing really well in a choppy market. That's how it would respond how we're performing in the market. Regarding res repaint specifically, Heidi, maybe I'll have you answer that. Well, I would like to talk about packaging because if there is one, Ghansham, that fits your description there, it would be packaging. We've got customers working through softer demand and overstock. And as we see that continue. It's likely going to continue through Q3, perhaps even Q4. But we feel really confident. This is a strong team with a growing position with great technology. We talked about this V70 unique technology that is really fantastic, and we hear it from our customers. It's a plug and play. It's really highly efficient is superior in its ability to keep flavor protection of the product, next-gen non-BPA. It's just a fantastic product, and it's been very well received by our customers. So we've got confidence in this business. It's just going to be bumpy. And while we have high expectations, we often push hard. We also have to be realistic with our team. So we're feeling good there. When you look at the rest of the businesses inside our PCG business, we mentioned it's bumpy. We've got some that might be more resilient as others. We talked about auto refinish. This is a team that's really hitting on all cylinders, unintended that is really leveraging the technology combination from Valspar and Sherwin together, along with the platform of stores. Many people think about stores through our architectural Paint Stores Group, but we bring the same value through our automotive stores direct to customer, and we are really growing business there as well. Our general industrial business is one that is kind of a mixed bag. If you look at areas such as large ag and construction is doing well, where building products and general finishing is soft. So when you look at this business, and you look around wherever you are right now, the office, every sub-state that you see likely is one of two businesses, general industrial or industrial wood and our businesses there offer a terrific opportunity, but they are going to be a little bit bumpy. In Coil, I would say we had a decrease in Coil, largely driven by Europe and Asia. North America is holding up a little bit better than other regions. But again, it's a team that's bringing a unique responsiveness to customers' needs in a way that help us grow market share even in a down market. Thank you, Ghansham. Thank you, Jeff. Yes. Thanks for that. I'd start with every single customer is important to us, everyone. I also think it's important that you understand how we think to us, we play every day in the world series. And we want to sweep the series. We want to win every single game. But we're also realist. We're not going to expect every one of our pictures to throw a perfect game were to win every game is a shut out. But I'll tell you this, I believe we have the best team, the best resources and great momentum. So even if our competitors score an occasional run or if our pictures throw up occasional ball here or there, we're not going to panic. We've got, we believe, the right team will sweep the series. And we're out there right now. We believe if you look at that top 100 builders and the penetration that we have, we're growing it and growing it aggressively, and we expect that to continue. And we're doing that at all our competitors' expense. We just don't choose to talk about it. You bet. Yes. Mike, take one more run at that question here, maybe I missed. Yes. I think that's a challenge answer. I'd say if you look at new residential, we're suggesting that we've outperformed, for example, in new residential and that we expect the balance of the year to be a little bumpier. Housing starts are starting to come back, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, but even homes that are they break ground today, it's likely going to be for the future likely next year before we start painting those. And so I don't \u2013 I'd say we're probably bouncing around here a little bit. We will see what happens. But our approach has been right now that as the market is soft, our goal is to outperform it. And going forward between Q3 and Q4 gallons, I'd say it's likely going to trend about where we are. Thanks, Mike. Yes, Arun, I'd say I'll jump in here. I think if you look at the points that Heidi is making, I think there is two points. You're asking one very good question, but there is another element here that I want to tie to this. One is if you look across the various segments and say, okay, commercial, we see strong residential repaint, a little bit choppier with resales, but we can see out 6 to 8 months property maintenance strong. DIY has been strong, but it's on a softer comps, so we don't expect that to continue. I think all of those are opportunities for us to continue to grow market share, and we will. The other point, though, that I think she's talking \u2013 that she spoke to that I think is important is coming through COVID and in the shortage we've worked much closer with our customers in ways that, quite honestly, I wish I would have had that opportunity when I was in a store. We're now working collaboratively with what projects are taking place now, what's next, even to the point where if it rains, my fallback is this position. And the fact that we've got our reps and our stores out there, close to the backlog and close with our customers closer than ever before is a terrific advantage that we're trying to leverage. So by segment, I would say, yes, we see new residential likely to slow down a little bit as the slowdown works its way to the painting phase of the homes that weren't started 8 months ago. Property maintenance, we're really leveraging the fact that their CapEx money is freeing up. Our national agreements are opportunities for us and the others, as I described. So it's a good market for us because there is a lot of diversity in the market, and that's what we thrive on. Thanks, Arun. Okay. I guess I would just add on to the investment strategy that Al mentioned. We are a 157-year-old company. We are not trying to run the company for a perfect quarter here. We have got confidence in our strategy. It's a proven strategy with proven leadership team, through a proven and growing asset base in stores and in the facilities that we are running. So, to Al's point, we are going to invest into that. And we played a long game here. We know what we are doing. And quite frankly, we are going to do more of it. Thank you, Duffy. Thank you, Adam. Thanks Josh. Yes. Steve, I don't think it's in our best interest to lay out exactly where our investments are to be truthful with you. I would say that we have a proven leadership team. We have been at this for a long time. We see opportunities, and we invest. And many of the topics that you brought up are areas of investment. So, yes, we are going to invest in securing our people, the retention of our people, the training of our people. We are going to add reps through our stores and through other channels that are important to us. We are investing in innovation and digital. We are not going to get into any specifics deeper than that. But we believe \u2013 and quite frankly, we are very proud that when we make an investment that our shareholders can count on a return, and we have demonstrated the discipline to be able to do that. With a more optimized supply chain this year versus last year, Steve, last year, literally, we were taking raws wherever we could make them or get them manufacturing paint and sending it to customers wherever they needed it. And we absorbed that into our margin. But I think again, it speaks to the commitment we make to our customers and why they can count on us. Thanks Steve. Patrick, we don't talk about capacity utilization. I will tell you this that we have added some capacity. So, we have got the ability to be more responsive to our customers' needs. When we talked about taking working capital down, Al's comments about getting down in that 11.5% range, we have confidence in our ability to do that. While improving service to our customers as we go through the simplification efforts that Heidi is leading to the company on the operational side as well as the capacity that we have. Thanks Patrick. Thank you. We expect our market share to grow. And if you look at what's happening from a Lyra standpoint, predictions on what's going to happen right now, I would say, there is a slowing in the remodel business, but the truth be told is that this is an opportunity for us. In our business, there are a lot of people that talk about percentages and might most large percentage increases on a relatively small business. And quite frankly, this is a new and growing opportunity for us. So, the dollars are not where we believe they can be percentage-wise, we have significant increases, and we expect those increases to continue as we partner with our customers who are interested in growing this. And importantly, I think to understand the strategy here, there are customers, particularly those that paint as a part of their project that prefer a home center model. Some of those customers might find their way into our stores. And a natural question is the concern about cannibalization. We are not concerned with that. We will gladly put that share of business up, knowing that there is a significant opportunity for us to grow with our partners to pursue the remodeler, if you will, who is using paint on a project. So, yes, it's going to grow. We are focused on it with our customers, and we are determines' group combined. So, we expect positive growth. Thanks Kevin. You are talking about on the consumer side in Europe? Yes. So first, to capture this, it's a relatively small percentage of our overall business. It's \u2013 we are proud of our relationship there. We play a kind of a niche role, if you will, in intended paint through the Valspar brand this came to us with our acquisition. We have got a terrific relationship that we are interested in growing. And I would say the momentum that we have is good, and we are excited about it. Thanks Mike. John, new residential is a mid-teens percentage of our Paint Stores Group. And we don't bid house, John. We quote our customers on a regular basis, and those are fluid discussions that we have with our customers. So, it varies by customer, the timing of any agreements that we have, and we just work closely with our customers to ensure that they have as much lead time to any adjustments to pricing as possible. Even the largest. Thanks John. Yes. The first half, I would say our second half is going to be better than our first half, Eric. In the first quarter, it was a pretty modest. If you remember, we said it was a pretty modest deflation. It got better. I mentioned sort of high-single digit range in the second quarter. It will be better in the second half with probably the third quarter, probably the peak year-over-year benefit. Yes. Eric, I would say it's more first half loaded. And as we talked about, we expected a strong first half and demand, as we again talked about was stronger in our first half. So, it's more first half loaded. Thank you, Eric. We do believe we are gaining share there. It's a great opportunity again to highlight this controlled distribution. The approach that we take has been grounded in the focus on the applicator on the specifier and the owner through a distribution platform that is first class. And so our reps are working hand-in-hand with our customers. I would say that many of our customers would see our reps almost as part of their team. And the more challenging the market, the more valuable that sales rep is and the facilities that we build to service those needs. So, yes, I think we are growing share. I think there is a good \u2013 really good momentum through the balance of the year, rolling into next year. From there, as I mentioned earlier, while we are not waiting for the business that \u2013 to finish up, we are very focused on those sub-segments that I mentioned earlier that are a bit more resilient that we are focused on to continue the momentum. Thanks Garik."

            "name": "Al Mistysyn",
            "content": "Yes, Greg, this is Al Mistysyn. And we're really pleased with the performance of our gross margin. As a reminder, our target is midterm, 45% to 48%. As we have talked about in the past, we \u2013 in our raw material inflationary environment, we put price in to offset those dollars. And then as raw materials moderate, we start seeing the benefit of that pricing to increase our gross margin and helps us cover the continued investments we make to help our customers drive value in their business. So I'd expect the sequential gross margin to be similar to what I saw in this \u2013 what we saw in the second quarter. Price, as you know, we'll start annualizing the price increases in our third quarter, specifically the September 10% in Paint Stores Group plus the other items, other segments that have put pricing in. So for the full year, I think our gross margin, depending on where Paint Stores Group volume is could be in that 45% to 46% range. And then as you know, we'll evaluate that 45% to 48% range over time. And as we get consistency in that range, look to raise the bar and move that target up. As you know, we're all about managing operating margin growth and operating margin growth over the long term. So your comment about will we be done with SG&A commentary as the second half goes on. I would say, no. I think as we see how the demand environment and volumes unfold and as they're at or above our expectations, we'll look at that. We'll look at gross margin performance in the second half. And the beautiful thing about our model is we can be very agile across each of the segments, both field sales and tech service reps with the Pro Paint within the Consumer Brands Group. So if we see a path of a higher gross margin than what we have in our current outlook, we'll look to put more investments in our long-term growth initiatives to drive higher share as the market returns. Yes, Chris, I think the takeaway that I'd leave you with is, as we've progressed through 2022 and into 2023, you start seeing consistency in that segment operating margin in either at the bottom of the range or in the range and a couple of additional points. One, they have got the discipline to get price. And when you look at the last 2 years, \u201821 and \u201822, they took the front of the 40% increase in raw material costs, and they were able to get price while still driving volume and when we look at the acquisitions that were made last year, and the integration activities and the synergies that the team is working on. We feel very good about coming out of this year with the operating margins of those acquisitions being accretive to PCG. And then they are also focused on a number of other initiatives, whether it's SKU rationalization, simplification to make operations more efficient that can better serve their customer at a higher level. So I think you put those things together, and that team is on a strong trajectory to hit that 20% target. And then we will ask for more from there. Yes, Jeff, I would say you are correct, maybe not quite high single digit on the second half, but close to it. Yes. Third quarter, actually, it will be up our high \u2013 it will be the best improvement year-over-year. Sitting here today, Jeff. We continue to talk about our pricing and our ability to maintain pricing as the raw materials moderate because of the solutions that we drive. I don't think we're ready to talk about incremental pricing for 2024. We have \u2013 we look at the total input cost basket to determine if we need a price or don't need a price. And as you know, any price discussions we have we'd have them with our customers first then talk to the Street. So we have time to talk about 2024 over the next quarter and half quarters. Yes. David, I mean, when you look at the earnings, as John and Heidi talked about, our visibility and demand, which is going to drive our performance through the second half is limited. So we have a better line of sight in our third quarter than our second quarter. We're not \u2013 we don't give EPS or fourth quarter. We don't give EPS guidance, but a couple of other things I would note, I do expect to see a seasonal slowdown in architectural in our fourth quarter, which will impact our gross margin as it historically has done. So I believe this is a year that is the second half more what I would say, typical than some of the last 3 years. But our third quarter is typically a stronger quarter, and I'd expect that to continue. Yes. I think on if you look at we said projected to be flat to low single digits. But when you look at the dollars, sequentially, they are pretty close. And that's with new res declining more in our third quarter than we expected in our fourth quarter, which tells you we have some strength in our other segments that John and Heidi talked about, and it's going up against the 21.5% comp last year. So when you think about the second half, Paint Stores Group has a tough comp, I'd say the other segments, as we talked about, are choppy, and it's by business, by region. I think some businesses in certain regions have bottomed out. I think there is still challenges that we see in Asia Pacific. But as an example, Europe in our second half, we expect to do better than what we did in the first half. 2024, that's a whole different discussion that we will have as we get into January on our year-end call. Yes. Duffy, I mean it starts with that sales outlook down mid-single digit from \u2013 for second half versus first half. Less price would be in that, so we have got a nice tailwind in the first half for price that helped drive our operating \u2013 our gross margin. And so you also see a lower volume, specifically in consumer and in our Performance Coatings Group. So I think as you would expect, you are going to get lower gross profit dollars. I do still expect gross margin expansion in our second half, not quite as good as year-over-year anyway that we saw in our first half because of our comps. And then you do get some help on the raw material reduction, but that is partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption in our second half due to lower production volumes. I think SG&A, even we talked about SG&A in the opening and being more aggressive at adding investments for our long-term growth strategy, both in stores, reps, field tech service reps. And the final piece these non-operating costs that I would call out that were \u2013 are probably going to be an incremental $60 million to $70 million headwind versus our first half because some of the gains that we had on sale of assets and marketable securities. So, I think those are the things that are driving that sequential movement. Yes, Duffy, I will try to go back to a normal year, 2019. So, to your point, I am not sure what normal is. But I think as we continue to see growth in our Performance Coatings Group, that's less seasonal. You might not see as big of an increase in our second half versus our first half as we move forward. But if we get back to the way Paint Stores Group brand, our consumer business brands and yes, you should typically see that. The only thing I would add to that, Adam, is we talk about efficiencies, but we also are focused on these efforts to increase our capacity so that we are not having to put capital back into capacity and then also looking at opportunities for working capital reduction. So, John talked about the divestitures and part of our capital allocation philosophy, it's really a strong and focus on delivering cash generation back to our targets that we laid out and also how we utilize our \u2013 best utilize our assets. Sure, Josh. As typically is the case as we get into the summer selling season, we will see a sequential decrease in our inventory gains, as you mentioned. I think you will see a sequential decrease in our third quarter, which is also typical. And then we will build inventory back in our fourth quarter to our targeted numbers that are similar to prior \u2013 similar to last year, but to more historic levels. So, I feel very good about where our inventories are at today. That being said, we will adjust production through the second half to maintain that targeted year-end inventory. I don't want to get us too far ahead going into next year. So, we will monitor demand trends closely and adjust production schedules accordingly. We will try to push that working capital back towards our target by year-end of 11.5%. I think that's going to be a little difficult considering accounts payables because of the lower production is what's driving our increase over that 13%. But we will get that working capital back towards the target of 11%, 11.5% going forward. Let me ask Steve, if we had better than those, low-single digit raw in the second quarter. If that's what I said, that wasn't correct. We had more like high-single digit reduction in raw material costs. And what I said is the offset \u2013 partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption because we had lower production volumes in the second quarter, mainly because we had to rebuild inventories last year, and we didn't have to redo that. So, we are at a more typical production schedule this year than last year. So, that's maybe what the little bit of a headwind would have been in the quarter versus raw material benefits. Yes. Kevin, it's all related to timing. We are still moving forward with the Statesville expansion that we had talked about earlier this year. We are still moving forward with the warehouse automation projects that we had talked about and continued driving the packaging capacity expansions that we talked about. So, it's just timing and with a better line of sight to the second half we thought we would update that number. Yes. The comparisons are better. We get more price tailwind in our first half and even with that within admin, we had some gains on sale assets and stuff like that, that maybe helped us $0.05 in the second quarter. But yes, the comps are going to get steeper. And then it's the outlook on the choppy demand environment. And I would say that's why you don't see a bigger tailwind in our second half plus the investments we are making for future growth."

With us on today's call are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; Al Mistysyn, CFO; Heidi Petz, President and COO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Finance; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com.

A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up the session to questions.  I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered excellent first quarter results compared to the same period a year ago. Consolidated net sales grew by a high single-digit percentage, ahead of our expectations and were led by a mid-teens percentage increase in our professional architectural end markets. On the Industrial side of the business, sales increased in all regions except Asia Pacific. Gross margin significantly improved sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strong volume in the Paint Stores Group and effective pricing. Cost of goods sold includes higher inflation in wages and other employee-related categories, which were partially offset by a slight decrease in year-over-year raw material costs. We expect to hold the majority of the pricing we have put into the market, given the ongoing investments we have made to drive innovation, enhance services and secure the talent that provides differentiated solutions to help our customers reach their goals and drive their success. Segment margin in all three reportable segments expanded sequentially and year-over-year. We also delivered strong double-digit growth in diluted net income per share and EBITDA. Additionally, we continue to execute on the portfolio realignment actions we announced late last year, including the divestiture of a noncore aerosol business, which closed on April 1, and our recently announced agreement to divest our China architectural business. I'd like to highlight just a few of our consolidated first quarter numbers. Comparisons in my comments are to the prior year period unless stated otherwise.  Starting with the top line. First quarter 2023 consolidated net sales increased 8.9% to $5.44 billion. Consolidated gross margin increased to 44.5%, an improvement of 340 basis points. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 31.1%, an increase of 140 basis points, driven by investments in the Paint Stores Group's long-term growth initiatives and investments in our people across the company through year-over-year increases in compensation and other employee-related benefits. Our people remain our key differentiator in the marketplace.  Consolidated profit before tax increased $153.7 million or 33.3%. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $1.84 per share versus $1.41 per share a year ago. Excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense and costs related to previously announced restructuring actions, first quarter adjusted diluted net income per share increased 26.7% to $2.04 per share versus $1.61 per share a year ago. EBITDA in the quarter increased $185 million or 26.7% and was 16.1% as a percent of sales.  Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our first quarter results by segment. John will follow Heidi with comments on our outlook before we move on to your questions.\nHeidi Petz : Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, previously known as The Americas Group. We described this change on our last call and in this morning's press release. There is no impact to prior year consolidated results related to this change. Current and prior year segment results have been restated to reflect this change. First quarter Paint Stores Group sales were ahead of our expectations and increased 14.8%, driven by high single-digit volume growth and continued effective pricing. Segment profit increased by $97.9 million and segment margin improved 120 basis points to 18.4%. Our Pro architectural sales grew by a mid-teens percentage in the quarter. All Pro market segments increased by double digits, led by property management and followed by commercial, residential repaint and new residential, respectively. Sales in protective & marine and DIY also increased by double-digit percentages. From a product perspective, interior and exterior paint sales were both strong, with interior sales growing faster and representing a larger part of the mix. Moving on to results in our Consumer Brands Group, which again now reflects the addition of a Latin America architectural business in the current quarter and prior year. Sales were well ahead of our guidance and increased by 2.4% in the quarter. Performance was better than expected in North America, where sales were down less than 1%; and in Europe, where sales were down low single digits. In other regions, sales were up strong double digits in Latin America and down double digits in Asia. Effective pricing led by Latin America was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in volume and low single-digit FX headwinds. The tightness in alkyd resins impacting our ability to produce stains and aerosols, improved significantly during the quarter, and we expect this issue to be behind us by the end of the second quarter. Adjusted segment margin was 13%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, we divested a noncore aerosol business at the beginning of this month, and we also entered into an agreement to divest our China architectural business. We expect these actions will benefit segment margin over time as we drive a return to our high teens, low 20s adjusted margin target. Onetime restructuring costs in the quarter were immaterial.  Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 3.4% against a 20.4% comparison. The increase was driven by low teens pricing and mid-single-digit sales from acquisitions, partially offset by a low teens decrease in volume, which included the impact from discontinued operations in Russia and a low single-digit unfavorable FX impact. Adjusted segment margin increased 390 basis points to 15.7% of sales. This is the fourth straight quarter this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement, driven by execution of our strategy, including effective pricing.  Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased high single digits against a nearly 30% comp. Latin America sales increased by double digits, also against a strong comp. Sales in Europe were up mid-single digits, while sales in Asia were down double digits. From a division perspective, growth was strongest in Auto Refinish, which was up by a mid-teens percentage, followed by Coil and General Industrial, which were both up mid-single digits. All three of these divisions grew against double-digit comparisons. Industrial Wood sales were down mid-single digits as expected due to slowing in furniture, cabinetry and flooring related to new residential softness. Packaging sales also were down mid-single digits against a 30-plus comp with volume down about 1 point in the remainder due to our exit of Russia and unfavorable FX. We continue to feel very good about our position and growth prospects in this end market.  With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on our outlook for the second quarter and the full year.\nJohn Morikis : Thank you, Heidi. I want to thank our teams for working hard to deliver a strong start to the year, especially the margin recovery we are seeing following the relentless cost inflation we've experienced the last two years. As we said in January, we expected to have a strong first quarter, and that's exactly what our team delivered. We also indicated that we would not be updating guidance after the first quarter. We know we have work to do, and we're under no illusions about the macro headwinds we're likely to face as the year progresses. We'll have a much better idea of how the year might unfold as we get deeper into the painting season over the next few months. As we enter the second quarter, we'll remain focused on what we can control. This includes leveraging our recession-resilient markets, growing new accounts and share of wallet, continuing appropriate growth investments in stores and sales representatives and managing price cost dynamics. We remain confident in our differentiated strategy, capabilities and product and service solutions, and we continue to expect to outperform the market. For the second quarter of 2023, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will be up or down by a low single-digit percentage compared to the second quarter of 2022, inclusive of a high single-digit price increase. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be flat to down mid-single digits, inclusive of a mid-single-digit price carryover from 2022. Our sales expectations by segment for the second quarter and the full year are included in our slide deck and reflect the move of the Latin American architectural business from Paint Stores Group to Consumer Brands Group. There is no impact on our sales guidance in the quarter or the year from the divestiture of the China architectural business at this time as the transaction has not yet closed. On the cost side, there is no change in our raw material outlook where we continue to expect costs to be down by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect to see the largest benefit occurring in the second and third quarters. We expect to see decreases across many commodity categories, though the ranges likely will vary widely. We expect other costs, including wages and energy, to be up in the mid- to high single-digit range. The first quarter is typically our smallest, and we need to see second quarter trends and performance to better understand potential impacts on our second half outlook. We expect to provide an update on our full year sales and EPS guidance following our second quarter. As a result, there is no change at this time to our guidance for full year 2023 diluted net income per share, which we expect to be in the range of $6.79 to $7.59 per share. Full year 2023 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.81 per share and includes expense related to our previously announced targeted restructuring actions of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $7.95 to $8.65.  We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. There are also no updates to the additional data points and capital allocation priorities we provided on our January call. I'll also refer you to the slide deck issued with our press release this morning, which provides guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. All of these remain unchanged from our January call as well. Given the many variables at play, limited visibility beyond the first half, and the high level of uncertainty in the global economy, we continue to believe our current outlook is a realistic one. As we get through our second quarter and we see more information, the assumption we laid out in January could change. If those assumptions change for the better, we would expect to deliver stronger results. We've transformed our business in many ways since the last significant downturn, and we're now a stronger and a more resilient company. I'm highly confident in our leadership team, which is deep and experienced and has been through many previous business cycles. We anticipate that 2023 would be challenging. We planned accordingly. We have and will continue taking appropriate actions. We expect strong momentum coming out of this period of uncertainty, similar to prior downturns. That momentum will stem from our strategy of providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and more profitable. In challenging environments, like the current one, we can become an even more valuable partner to our customers, while we're also earning new ones. The bottom line is we expect to outperform the market and our competitors in 2023 and for years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks.  With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews : Could I ask in TAG in the quarter, just was looking at the incremental margins, obviously, you had a very strong sales performance. And I know there was about 5% carryover pricing in there. So it seems like the volume was quite strong. So was there just a lot of investment spend in the quarter ahead of store openings or just some of your initiatives and that if you could sort of bridge as to what the underlying total company SG&A expense was in the quarter and whether that is a good number to run with as we move through the balance of the year?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. And let me start with consolidated SG&A was up 14%. Paint Stores Group was just over 2/3 of that increase, and excluding acquisitions, was approximately 80% of the increase year-over-year. And this is due to the increase in new stores and additional sales reps, which probably represented about 2/3 of the increase. And then in addition, employee-related costs were higher year-over-year due to multiple merit increases beginning in the second half of last year and into the first quarter of this year.\nJohn Morikis : Yes. Let me just jump in here before you carry on there on the investments of our employees, I think it's absolutely critical to understand in a controlled distribution model, particularly, we see the value of the retention of our employees as a key element of our strategy. We want to build relationships with our customers. We want to make sure we have the right talent that they're trained, that they're developed and that we retain them. And so the investments that we've made beginning actually about midyear last year, we are clearly seeing the benefits of that. Now there's some benefit in the market as the economy has taken its course. And clearly, that's had an impact on some employees and employers. But our relationship with our customers -- our employees has improved dramatically. And I would point to our retention. We've often boasted about our turnover rate down in the 7% to 9% range. And we're proud to say that we're back in that range of employee turnover. So our retention is back to a historic low. We think that's an important element and an important investment that we make because we want to make sure that those employees are there when our customers are walking into our stores. So let me turn that back over to you.\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. The only thing I'd add to that is, Vincent, as we discussed in January, we're going to continue to manage our G&A expenses tightly and adjust other discretionary marketing and other spending as we get a better outlook on demand in the second half. I would say I would expect a smaller year-over-year increase in our second quarter as we annualize the merit increase from last year. We start realizing more cost reductions from the restructuring activities. . Typically, we see a slight uptick in SG&A in our Paint Stores Group as it ramps up staffing and service to increase seasonal architectural demand uptick. Acquisitions will be slightly less than what we saw in our first quarter, which is a low single-digit impact. And then we'd expect those to annualize and not see much in our second half. So as the year goes on, my second quarter, I'd expect a lower percent of sales because of the seasonally higher architectural sales, but then the year-over-year change gets tighter as the year goes on as we annualize some of these things.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan.\nJeffrey Zekauskas : The SG&A increase of 14%, I understand that it should moderate from that level. But this year, with everything you're considering, are we going to be up more than 10% as a base case year-over-year?\nAllen Mistysyn : No, Jeff, I'd expect -- if you look at how Paint Stores Group, in particular, SG&A rolled out as the year went on last year, it ramps up as we get into our second half because we added more stores, but the merit increases happen in our second half. So the comp gets higher, so the percent change gets lower as we go through the year. I would say the other groups have done a really nice job of managing their SG&A. Consumer, Paints, PCG would have a similar impact with the merit increases, but they've been managing their SG&A very tightly. And then in admin, we'll continue to invest in system upgrades and things like that, but we're going to manage it tightly. So I would not expect that high of a percentage increase for the year.\nJeffrey Zekauskas : Okay. And then secondly, your new residential business seems to have held up reasonably well, given market conditions. When we get to the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year, as a base case, what do you think those volumes are like year-over-year in new residential in the Paint Stores Group?\nJohn Morikis : So Jeff, we've said that the single-family housing starts are expected to be down year-over-year in the range of 20% to 35%. And our expectation would be that in our business, we'd be better than the market. So our expectations would be that it would be down in the 10% to 20% range. And we've also talked openly about the fact that we expect some of our more recession-resilient segments to pull heavier during that period of time. So as we saw the quarter unfold, we saw exactly the sequential trend that we -- that you just described. So year-over-year, January, we saw high teens percentage increase; in February, low double-digit increase; and then mid-single digits in March. So we expect that type of a trend to continue through the balance of the year. If you look back 90 days, 120 days and you see the number of starts in comparison to previous quarters, you can see the downturn and then the impact on our new res sales as it unfolds.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Christopher Parkinson at Mizuho. \nChristopher Parkinson : John, can you sit on a little bit more on what you're hearing from your customers and contractors in terms of backlog, specifically in the resi repaint market, property maintenance and then perhaps just hit a little bit on what you're seeing in protective? It would be greatly appreciated.\nJohn Morikis : Yes, Chris, I'd start with the fact that our Paint Stores Group is our largest business, as you know. It's a $12 billion portion of the company. 90% of our Paint Stores Group is made up of professional sales. And as Heidi mentioned, PRO sales in total grew by a mid-teens percentage with every one of our professional segments growing double digits. So these are large segments growing double digits. So we're growing real market share in absolute dollars. And I'll give Justin Binns and his team a lot of credit for the new account and share of wallet initiatives that are clearly working. To your question specifically on residential repaint, we probably best would describe the bidding activity as having returned to a more normalized bidding market, where in the past 12 to 18, maybe 24 months, it was difficult to get a painter to even come out and give you a bid because they were so busy and so backlogged. I would say that it's likely best described as a more level or more normalized bidding activity. If you look at the LIRA or the NAHB remodel index, both are positive, but clearly some deceleration in what they're projecting. Our double-digit quarter this year was on top of a mid-single-digit performance last year. So I'd say that we have confidence in what we're doing. We have confidence in our ability to continue to grow and grow at our competitors' expense. We have product back in our store. We just talked briefly about the people in our stores. We think that's a very important element in what it is that we do. So the retention of our people, we believe, has a direct correlation to the retention of our customers. And we continue to introduce new products. We can get into some of those details, perhaps later, if we like. But we're introducing new products to help keep that residential repaint customer not only successful in what they're doing, but also growing in new segments as well. Talk a little bit about new res there a moment ago after Jeff's question, but I will say that our ability to work with our builders and help to drive their business and their efficiency, we believe, has been an important element in our ability to retain the relationships that we have, and in fact, grow those relationships. We're introducing in the face of an adverse market here in the diversity of new residential, we're introducing new products that will help our customers high build products that will help hide imperfections and improved durability, and that's helping us to grow our new residential business, and we expect that to continue to grow. We expect to come out of this time here of some challenges in the market with absolute new and greater market share. On the Commercial side, you asked about this was one of the markets that clearly came in with stronger-than-expected results for the quarter. Our position in this segment is very good, strong and growing. We've been long investing in reps, products, specifications and the fact that we have local stores and local reps is an important element in growing this segment. Again, we've introduced a number of innovative products here as well. When you think about labor, we often talk about that labor represents, on average, about 85% to 90% of the cost of goods for a painting contractor. The cost for a commercial contractor is likely higher than the average, perhaps in the 90% to 95% as many of the commercial contractors are either union or applying paint in the metro markets, which are higher cost. Our model, therefore, is even a greater value to these customers. Our ability to collaborate with the architects, work with the designers, work with these contractors is absolutely paying dividend. And we're excited about this business. The commercial side, there's a lot of work that's still coming out of the ground, and we expect to continue to grow with this market and at the expense of our competitors. Property maintenance, you asked about as well, is another segment that grew stronger than expected. Occupancy and rents are returning to more normal rates, and growth here is driven by not only our continued share gains but capital improvement projects as well as an increase in turns. So the Pro side by segment is really going well, and we're going to continue to put fuel in this tank and feel really good that while we're growing share, the only expectation we have for our team is to grow it even faster.\nChristopher Parkinson : Understood. And just as a quick follow-up on the raw material basket, just to keep this simple, you've got a few things that are sticky, but broadly, it seems like we're moving in the right direction. Can you just hit on the two most pleasant surprises in terms of the basket and perhaps the two most frustrating substrates as we are if you're saying here today?\nJames Jaye : Yes, Chris, I would say that raw materials are really trending as we expected. And not sure that I'd say there's a lot of surprises there. They were down slightly in the first quarter. The moderation was led by monomers, solvents and resins. To your point, TiO2 and pigments may be a little stickier near term, but we expect to see some moderation there as the year goes on. I would remind everyone, as a reminder, our cost of goods also includes higher inflation in wages and other employee-related costs. For the second quarter, we're expecting to see some further moderation as we move towards our guide for the full year, which, as we said in our opening, is unchanged. Raws down low to mid-single digits.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison at Seaport Research Partners.\nMichael Harrison : Was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the additional architectural capacity that you brought on probably a little over a year ago? As you look at these housing challenges that seem to be ahead, is that additional capacity is something that we should think about as weighing on utilization or fixed cost absorption as we're going forward? And I guess in hindsight, should you maybe have pulled back or wait a little bit longer to expand some of that capacity? \nJohn Morikis : Absolutely not. We expect and are filling that capacity, Mike. And when you believe like we do and what's happening in the market and where we're going, if you were sitting in my chair, you would have invested exactly as we did. I would not have pulled back one penny of it.\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. Mike, I'd just add to that. As you remember on the January call, I talked about a potential headwind with just lower architectural volume because everybody in the industry had to build architectural inventory back up. So that's short term.  Long term, we have a lot of confidence in the growth across each of the segments, Architectural Pro segments that John talked about, and we'll fill up that capacity very quickly. So even though it might be a short-term headwind, as we've lived through some of these cycles before, the bounce back and the strong growth, I'll go back to 2008 and '09, and we grew high single digit for the 3-, 5- and 10-year compounded average growth rate, and we're a much bigger architectural business today than we were back then, we'll fill that capacity. So -- and I would argue or add to that, we're going forward on Statesville because of the confidence we have in the future outlook and the growth in architectural.\nMichael Harrison : All right. Great. And then on the Performance Coatings business, it was a little bit surprising to me that Asia was the weakest region for you. Can you comment on how you expect demand to play out in the rest of the year across the different regions? And I guess with particular emphasis on, are you going to be seeing some recovery in China and in that Asia business?\nJohn Morikis : Well, Mike, we're positioned well to do just that. It's yet to be seen as the market or the the market tries to kind of resume back to some normalcy in Asia. We're positioned very well. Our technology, our assets, our people, I think a lot of that has to do with what happens in the market and our expectations as in any situation is to grow faster than the market. I think we're in a very good position from a technology, but also a relationship perspective. So yes, I'd say that there is some uncertainty with the market in general as it opens up, and our customers are back producing product, we expect to capitalize more than our share there.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty : Can you -- it sounded like in the Consumer Brand side, business was maybe a little bit better than you expected. Can you speak to the stocking patterns that are going on there? Are we seeing kind of a normal stock? It seems like the expectation was it was going to be a little bit below normal, but again, you're kind of coming in better than you thought. So maybe a little bit of color there would be helpful.\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, John, I would say that you're absolutely right. We have obviously saw a better performance in North America and in Europe. And if you remember on our January call, I said we had not seen the destocking in our fourth quarter that maybe some had seen. So we anticipate it may be a slower build in inventory at the retail channel. We actually saw a slight increase in the retail channel inventory. And I think -- thinking back, if I look at across the chain from the retail channel back through our DSCs, we're back to more I would call, historic levels of inventory. So we're well positioned to service the spring and summer selling season that's coming up. And I'd just highlight also, Latin America was a mid-single-digit tailwind in the quarter. Latin America had a very strong double-digit quarter and that helped when you brought them into the Consumer Brands Group.\nJohn McNulty : Got it. Okay. Okay. And then when you -- I know you guys don't tend to do much around the weather or blame a lot or take much credit for things on the weather front. But was a much wetter start to the season, particularly in regions where you can't paint in the first quarter out West and what have you and it looks like the Midwest also maybe started a little bit more slowly. Do you have pent-up demand? Is that why maybe some of the -- it looks like some of the data that we've at least been seeing from the contractors is maybe a little better than expected? I guess, how would you characterize that?\nJohn Morikis : I'd characterize it as we don't like to talk about weather, you're right. I think there are areas that are going to be under pressure with whether, John, and there are going to be other areas that are a little better in weather and does it have some impact in some of those areas, sure. But short of significant impact on our businesses, we try to stay away from that. Our expectations from our team includes the opportunity to go out and grow business. And so appreciate the question, but we're not going to follow the weather as a means for what's driving our results right now. We're proud of what we've accomplished. We're determined to accomplish more, and we're not going to let weather stand in our way.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi at Baird.\nGhansham Panjabi : John, you've given us parameters as to how to think about new residential for 2023, which was a reiteration of your previous view three months ago. Has your view changed on Commercial for the year in context of the credit issues that the U.S. banking system and also Europe went through starting in March? Or is it still pretty consistent with before?\nJohn Morikis : Ghansham, I'd say this year, we see a pretty solid year. These buildings are reaching the painting stage now. They started 12 to 18 months ago. So we'll have to see if there is, in fact, an impact on Construction and Commercial 12 to 18 months from now. But the long line of sight that we have in this space, we are growing share, and there's a lot of projects coming on, which we expect to paint.\nGhansham Panjabi : Got you. And then in terms of packaging, I know very tough comps for the first quarter, but how are you thinking about the rest of the year for that specific business?\nJohn Morikis : That's an interesting one because I think when you look at Packaging, we never accept from any of our businesses softness. But this is a very unique situation with our Packaging business on top of the 30% comps. This team is continuing to expand the commercialization of what we consider a very unique technology. So we continue to see the lines that our product is on. They grow. They're growing. We're growing share. What's happened right now is there's a level of destocking that's taking place within many brands impacting our customers as they work through high inventory levels. It's not often that I'm accepting to a team that's brought in softness. But in this case, given the line of sight that we have and the share that we're gaining and the incremental production lines that were going on every day, we're giving them a break. So I think the first quarter was a little tough. We'll probably have a little choppiness here in the second quarter. And as the year progresses, our expectations will resume for this team to continue to grow or to be able to demonstrate the share that they're growing. It's a short-term issue for this team. We've got a lot of confidence in the technology, the team and what we're doing. We'll be fine here.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Sison at Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison : Nice start to the year. John, I know you mentioned that you need to see how trends for 2Q on the folds to have a better idea for the second half. So just curious if unfold as you expect today, and I think it means -- I think your outlook suggests that PSG volumes are going to flatten out versus a pretty strong first quarter. What does that mean for your second half outlook? And if 2Q comes in better or worse, what does that sort of mean?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, I would say, as John talked about, I mean, our first quarter is the smallest quarter. We expected a strong quarter. We delivered on that. We're closely monitoring the demand trends and expect, as you mentioned, and we said it on our year-end call that new residential demand would start slowing in our mid-second quarter. We've experienced a lot of market uncertainty before. I just look at the last three years, I think it's better to get a better view of demand after our seasonally higher second quarter. This gives us the best opportunity and more certainty for our second half. And we'll continue to manage our SG&A, particularly G&A tightly, continued investments in other discretionary items will be managed with the demand outlook. I think we believe these long-term growth investments allow us to grow market share in any environment and especially as we come out of this slower macro environment. But that is how we're going to manage the company going forward. I mean, we believe our second half outlook is realistic. But we also believe we'll outperform the market. And if the market demand is better than our expectations, we'll perform better than what we currently have here. And we'll all those variables together and give you our best outlook after the second quarter for the year.\nMichael Sison : And as a quick follow-up, given your new capacity, better cost structure and such, if you do get your volumes back to where they were prior to this downturn, where do you think earnings or margins should be at this going forward?\nJohn Morikis : Well, we've talked about our -- speaking to the margin -- gross margin, we expect we'll be in the range of the 45% to 48%. We've I think demonstrated the incremental sequential margins in this quarter, getting close to that bottom level of the range, and we expect to poke through that. And the reason we do expect that is, is that we believe we're focused on the right customers with the right solutions. Our focus is really simple. I mean we want to help them make more money, help them to be successful. And as a result, we are in a position to be able to build that combined success. And as a result, we expect to be able to provide margins for both our customers and our shareholders. And the combination of the right customers with the right solutions, we believe will lead us to that.\nAllen Mistysyn : The only thing I'd add to that, Mike, is when thinking about it by segment, we have a lot of confidence in our Performance Coatings Group to drive operating margins to that high teens, low 20s. The first quarter, excluding acquisitions, we were at 16.4. Again, if you remember, we hit that mark in the third quarter. It's an all-time high since we've owned Valspar. And we're confident in driving Consumer Brands Group back up to that high teens and low 20s. So we get our cost structure right, that will be a tailwind. We hold on the price. But as we come out of this, we drive strong architectural gallon growth, market share growth in our Performance Coatings business, and that's what's going to drive those operating margins back up to the high watermarks we experience in different occasions on the different businesses.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne at Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne : What fraction of your Consumer business is the Pros the Paint category versus what was it back when you first got that exclusivity with Lowe's? What would you say is driving that growth? For example, is it the product offering? Or I know Lowe's has at least in some stores offering free delivery to the job site? Can you comment on how extensive that is? Is that meaningful? And are you involved in that?\nHeidi Petz : Yes -- well, go ahead, John.\nJohn Morikis : No, I was just going to say I want to start and then kick it to you, Heidi. I'd say, first of all, as there's a commitment by both companies to grow this, that terrific leaders inside our organization and they're working with terrific leaders inside the Lowe's organization, an outstanding partner. And I think we're combined looking at the right elements of the business. And so we're not going to disclose the percentage on that, Steve. But Heidi, I would like for you to maybe could talk a little bit about the Pros Who Paint, but also on a broader view, the importance of this relationship and in the Consumer Brands portfolio as well as the initiatives that we have to grow.\nHeidi Petz : Steve, this is Heidi Petz. John covered a good bit of this. I think, at the end of the day, we want to make sure that we are demonstrating that we're the very best partner. In fact, we want to be their #1 partner. So we think of some of the engagements here and how we're activating, certainly, there's a lot of support as they're working through their promotional calendars, making sure that we're investing in the right areas, not only to drive traffic, but to make sure that we're converting those shoppers in the aisle certainly. And we've got a lot of great brands. We've got some launches that are taking place right now. We won't get into too much detail here, but we want to make sure that we're a lockstep with them in terms of driving those conversions. John mentioned this, but the leadership team, certainly all the way through the organization, I would say our partnership has never been better than it is right now in terms of making sure we've got the alignment across the organization, both with their Pros Who Paint and the DIY segments. So when you think of the structures, we've got to make sure that those are mirrored and that the metrics are aligned there. So I feel really confident in the way that we're moving forward and got big plans for the year. So we're going to keep moving.\nJohn Morikis : On the Pros Who Paint, specifically, Steve, to your point, there are customers that prefer a home center platform. They can purchase everything from dry wall to every other element that they might use on a project. And -- so to get to your question about who supplies delivery or sales calls or anything, there's a team effort that goes along with that. And while we don't disclose the details of those for strategic and competitive reasons, I think hit at best. The collaboration and focus has never been stronger.\nSteve Byrne : And maybe one more for you, Heidi, and that's the Huarun brand over in China that is an old Valspar brand. I recall a few years back when the merger the company was going to drill into that those Huarun stores in China and see if that could be driven into a paint stores type of model like is in the U.S. was the conclusion of that effort? Is it really didn't have that potential? And thus, you're not the best owner for that brand?\nHeidi Petz : Steve, I think you answered it perfectly. Yes, there was -- there's a better model here. I think the divestiture certainly it does align with our strategy And as we've done a lot of work in that group to optimize the portfolio of the brands, certainly making sure that we're driving a focus on where we can get a return for our shareholders. And I think you said it -- sometimes they're just assets that are more valuable to others and this is an example of just that. We had -- the business was about $100 million in revenue with 300 employees -- and frankly, it was acquired as part of the Valspar acquisition, you remember, in 2017. So as we move down the next quarter here, we'd expect to close on this second half of 2023.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Gregory Melich at Evercore ISI.\nGregory Melich : Thanks for the helpful volume trends through the quarter in architectural. Is it fair to say, given the deceleration in top line that you expect that April is running negative volume year-over-year now? Or is it -- has the deceleration been less dramatic than that?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Greg, I would just say that April is trending as we would have expected it to trend, not any better or worse.\nGregory Melich : All right. Well, I have to try. But how about this? In the first quarter, could you break down the sales growth, the 8.9% into -- I think volume was down slightly and just sort of what was price and FX in that to sort of help us frame the sales going to flat in the second quarter. How much of it is from volume deceleration? How much of it is from price staying where it is?\nAllen Mistysyn : Sure, Greg. I would say price is up high single digits. And with that being a little bit higher, acquisitions added a low single-digit percentage, which was mostly offset by FX headwinds. And you're right, the volume was flattish. If you look at that in our second quarter, effective price is going to be slightly lower year-over-year in the second quarter compared to the first quarter as we annualize the Paint Stores Group 12% price increase February 1 and some of the other price increases. As you know, the other divisions and groups were out with significant price increases as well. So they're just not as uniform as Paint Stores Group, but they will annualize as we get through our first -- as we've gotten through our first quarter and into our second quarter. The main difference is lower volumes, primarily due to lower new residential that we talked about, some softening in North America Performance Coatings Group. And then FX headwinds will mostly offset acquisitions in both quarters.\nGregory Melich : And is it fair to say that -- or maybe you could help by breaking down the gross margin expansion in the first quarter. Was that primarily getting price on top of raws? Or the fact that volume sort of held in there, were you able to get some margin expansion from volume not being down so much?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. I'd say most of the impact were price increases. But the benefit -- we did see a nice benefit of the increased volumes in Paint Stores Group. As a reminder, that is our highest gross margin segment and plus the slightly moderating raw materials that John talked about. And we are getting on top of the raw material costs. As you know, as we get into significant raw material inflation, we see that short-term contraction. As pricing starts catching up, we moderate our gross margins flatten out, and then we see growth as raw materials moderate and we hang on to most of the price. And it's because of the investments we continue to make. And...\nJohn Morikis : Yes. I think it's an important element. We continue to invest not in the products, but the services and technologies as well as the other assets. Additionally, I'd say the obvious and important investment in talent that we just talked about, the retention of talent and as well as new talent. So it's more than what's in the can. We're investing in the success of our customers with every rep, every tech rep, every store, even the trucks we're adding to our fleet, all designed to improve the profitability of our customers. So there's more to it than the cost of what's in the can, and we're trying to drive the success of our customers with the investments that we're making.\nGregory Melich : And with that, John, maybe I'll jump on that. Given those investments you're making in wage pressure and other costs besides raws, is this a year where you actually could have a price increase, even if raws are slightly down?\nJohn Morikis : Greg, we've talked for many years together about our approach, and it's not -- it doesn't change. Every 30 days, we sit down, Al, Heidi, myself with the entire leadership team, and we have a discussion. And the discussion isn't just on raw materials, to your point, it's on every cost that we have. And we do everything we can to try to drive more and more efficiency into the operations that we have. We try to use our leverage with purchasing. We try to drive efficiencies in the plant, everything so that we don't have to go out with price increases. So that's our first choice. But there are times when we find ourselves, as you've described, in situations where it may not be the lever on raw materials that drives it, it might be some of the others. Energy, transportation, whatever it might be. So on a monthly basis, we evaluate that, we make that decision, we take it to our customers, and then we talk to our investors. At this point, we're not in a position to talk about any increases because we're not out with those on a broad scale inside our stores. I will say that with some customers in different parts of our businesses, where we've been working to put pricing in, we're still putting pricing in. So there's no finish line in this area.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Leithead at Barclays.\nMichael Leithead : Just one on my end. I wanted to dig in on the Performance Coatings outlook. I guess revenue was up, call it, 3.5% in 1Q. You're guiding 2Q down low single digits, so call it flattish for the first half and the full year guide is down about 10% or so, which is seems to imply some pretty steep second half decline. So can you maybe just unpack that a little bit?\nAllen Mistysyn : Sure, Mike. Let me start and then I'll let Heidi jump in. We do expect continued strength in Auto Refinish and positive sales in General Industrial in the second quarter, may be a little bit slower than what we saw in our first quarter. We expect the continued softness in Industrial Wood. And then we expect Coil and Packaging to be down low single digit, primarily due to the strong double-digit comps in the second quarter. I think if you look at it by region, North America, our largest region, is expected be up or down low single digits compared to a high single-digit first quarter, both against strong double-digit comps, and we're not expecting a ton of improvement in Europe or Asia Pacific and even Latin America will moderate a little bit.\nHeidi Petz : Yes. And I would just hit a few highlights here on the segments. I think, obviously, a lot of this is based on our strategy of differentiation. I'll hit on some of the regions. So just a couple of highlights. If you look at where we've said based on being recession resilient, Automotive Refinish is a great example where we were up mid-teen percent. We do see strong demand in most regions, and I would also comment on the really good price realization for the value that we're able to create and demonstrate for our customers. We've been a number of calls here in the last few quarters, we've been talking more about our installations, and we're now seeing the momentum really building here. We would expect to continue to build up momentum and think you could expect to see us taking some meaningful share here. A few challenges. We're still working through. You'll probably hear a consistent theme across Performance Coatings Group and some of these segments where we've largely recovered our raw material challenges, but it is now a race to convert to finished goods as soon as possible. So you can imagine the Automotive Refinish space that is absolutely a priority and also working closely with our customers where labor does continue to be a challenge for these customers. The shop technicians, parts shortages are impacting some of these customers that are working through backlogs rather the Automotive Refinish. I'd highlight quickly here, too, Mike, is the Protective and Marine where as you know, we're servicing this segment through our Paint Stores in North America and very strong double-digit sales in the quarter and still a strong -- aggressively strong outlook, I would say, through 2023. Demand is strong in North America and Latin America through most of the segments in protective & marine. Europe, Asia, we've talked about these, certainly seeing some pressure there, which is leading to some project delays. And as I mentioned, we're on the path here making sure that we're taking every ounce of the resin as it continues to improve to raise the conversion here. So we'd expect to see growth and incremental share gains there as well. I'll comment just briefly on General Industrial. You mentioned that think this, I would categorize as more of a mixed bag across the segments and the regions. However, globally, heavy equipment remains our strongest. And then you've got some areas that are showing early signs of slowing. Appliances will be a good example of that, just adjusting to inventory levels. So we're going to continue to ramp up production there. Briefly on Coil and I'll hit Industrial Wood and certainly come back to any additional comments. Coil, North America is remaining strong with very consistent demand. Our metal buildings business is performing better than expected and seeing some softness in areas like the aluminum trim business. Latin America continues to be very strong with good performance that is built on new business and new accounts. The teams been laser focused there, but we're still seeing pressure across EMEA and Asia in Coil. And I'll briefly hit on Industrial Wood. We've talked about this segment where we feel the most pressure. And I would say within the actual segment, the most pressure as it is coming from furniture. The other segments like kitchen cabinets and flooring, we mentioned in our prepared remarks that are tied to new residential continue to be a challenge. So we're seeing the continued pressure there. But importantly, what the leadership team there is working on is expanding aggressively through market share gains, while our competition, in some cases, it's reacting to the market softness differently. So we're working on getting these gains with a focus on introducing new technology. And I'll give you a quick example here. The example in our furniture category, this technology is going to allow our customers greater service, quicker turnaround and ultimately, smaller batches, which brings benefit to the customer with less working capital, less waste and less obsolescence. So I'm bringing this to you just as another example of beyond what's in the can, how we partner with our customers to bring them solutions that are meaningful to their business goals. So quick overall around those segments, but just a little bit of color.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson at Wolfe Research.\nTruman Patterson : Just following up on one of Greg's questions just for a little clarity. Pricing trends during the quarter in each of the segments, were you actually able to realize or capture incremental pricing in each of the three segments? Or was it really just kind of carryover from what was already in place in the fourth quarter?\nAllen Mistysyn : Well, Truman, for Paint Stores Group, it's mostly carryover for consumer. There's pockets where maybe we didn't have product that now we're able to better service the customer with improving alkyd resin situation. But in Performance Coatings group, for sure, there was some incremental pricing across specific businesses and specific regions that John even talked about where maybe we haven't been as effective as we needed to be in the past or there's other inputs that are causing our cost to go up. I use energy in Europe as one example where we've had to be out to offset some of those higher costs. So maybe some incremental, the mass majority of it, though, is the carryover pricing from 2022.\nTruman Patterson : Perfect. And then in Performance Coatings, op margin was up like 400 bps year-over-year to 15.7%. That's highest first quarter in like 8 years, even though volumes were down like low teens. Normally, you see a sequential ramp in those margins in 2Q and 3Q. Were there any onetime items in the first quarter that we shouldn't think margins will follow normal seasonality in 2Q or 3Q? Or is that kind of a good cadence to think about?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, I would say it's probably a good cadence. There wasn't anything onetime that jumps out, Truman, as you can imagine, across a global business, there's puts and takes every quarter. But nothing that drove the over increase in our gross -- in our operating margin.\nJohn Morikis : Truman, I'd give a lot of credit to our leader there, Karl Jorgenrud and his lieutenants that are out driving every day. To your point, we see the sequential improvement. There's a lot of hard work. The identification of the right customers, the right segments, the right technologies and really demonstrating the ability to help our customers to improve their profitability. And we've said for a long time that we expect this to be in the high teens, low 20s. And Karl was in the room right now. I look him in the eye and tell them I'm expecting them to get there very quickly. So -- and he would probably respond that he's going to. So we've got a lot of confidence in that team, a lot of expectations, high expectations, and we are going to deliver.\nAllen Mistysyn : Truman, the other -- the only other thing I would add to that is acquisitions were slightly dilutive in the quarter as we continue to integrate those acquisitions realized synergies as the year goes on, my expectation that, that will improve as the year progresses and help drive better operating margin in this segment.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter : John, just on Q2, historically, you see about, say, $0.75 increase sequentially from Q1. Would you expect a similar increase this year or perhaps a little bit less, given the demand weakness that you've been talking about here?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, David, we're not going to give guidance on our second quarter EPS. I understand the question. What I think you can expect to see in our second quarter is, gross margin, we expect sequential and year-over-year improvement We talked about the price increases and a sequential carrying over and a sequential improvement in raw material costs will have a positive impact, partially offset by higher wages within manufacturing and distribution. I would say with SG&A, I do expect a smaller year-over-year increase in our second quarter as we annualize that merit increase from last year and we start realizing more of the cost reductions from restructuring activity. So we typically see an increase in SG&A, as I talked about, with Paint Stores ramping up to service the increased sales. But as a percent of sales, I would expect our SG&A as a percent to be lower in our second quarter because of that seasonally higher architectural sales. So you do expect a lift in our second quarter because of the improvement in Paint Stores Group quarter-to-quarter architectural sales, but we're not going to\nJohn Morikis : We expect to have a good second quarter, and we're going to update you at the end of the quarter. But what we see right now, we expect a good quarter.\nDavid Begleiter : Understood. And John, just on the Paint Stores Group, are you giving -- are you seeing any price erosion or givebacks in that business?\nJohn Morikis : No. Actually, David, normally, what we see is a small percentage, large, perhaps what we might call, marquee jobs that get a lot of attention, and we're all proud and some of us have egos. We met that that we want to see our pain on specific projects. But for the most part, what you see is a pretty disciplined industry because we all understand that it is competitive and the ability to continue to keep your company healthy and invest in those drivers that will help your customers to be successful requires that health. And so it's competitive for sure. But for the most part, it's race to demonstrate the value that you can bring. And we believe that in that race Sherwin-Williams wins.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Josh Spector at UBS.\nJoshua Spector : I wanted to follow up on the Pro contractor side of things. I think last call, John, you made some comments that to some of your customers, you need to almost educate them about the fact that there are going to be market declines, and they weren't really seeing declining in backlogs or anything to that extent. Has that changed? Is that conversation changed? And from what you guys have visibility on the backlogs now, has that changed much versus a few months ago?\nJohn Morikis : Yes. I should be careful in making general statements like that because to characterize an entire industry like that can be challenging to say the least. But yes, I would say that many customers that have in the past not been able to even return phone calls on bids. Bid requests are now either returning those calls or looking for some of those bid requests. There's an understanding that there's an opportunity to continue to grow. If you look at the homes in the U.S., they are aging. The residents of those homes are aging. And while many of those people may choose to move into a new home, many are choosing to stay in those homes and paint remains relatively inexpensive, yet highly impactful project, and those painting contractors are pursuing those. So again, I mentioned earlier, I would describe it as a more normalized market. Contractors are looking and doing a lot of work, and they are also probably a little more aware that having a marketing aspect to what they're doing is an important part of their future success, and we're helping them with that. It's an element that most people don't recognize. And when I say it's not just what's in the can, we've been at this for over 150 years, obviously, and our ability to align with our customers, help them to understand not only that they should be looking around the corner, but how to prepare for that. They might have been great painters. Now they own a paint company. And when they started the business, they put a sign on a project and every person in the neighborhood came to them. We're helping them to understand how to reach out and grow their business, how to, in some cases, specify products, in some cases, even how to interview potential painters. So we're lockstep with these firms, helping them to grow their business in ways that most people wouldn't understand\nJoshua Spector : And I guess if I ask about the repaint demand side of things, just we've been in this downturn now for the last six, nine months or at least when starts come down and some of the housing turnover softened. Given the higher DIY demand during COVID and where interest rates are and more people staying put, I guess how do you square all those to say, is repaying that 75%, which is more defensive, is that staying defensive? Is that less defensive, more defensive now? Any way to characterize how you're thinking about that based on what you're seeing today?\nJohn Morikis : I'm not sure I quite understand your question, but I might say that we see this residential repaint business and have seen it as an important element to offset some of the softness in the market coming out of the last downturn. Al, myself and many of the leaders that are currently running the company sat and reviewed during a slowdown like we had experienced then, what would we like to have going forward. And it was a larger, more meaningful residential repaint business, and we've been successful in doing that. We were successful in growing new residential, our position there. We love our position there. And we've over-indexed now given the success that we've had. And so the offset to that has been the residential repaint, the property management and on the Industrial side, businesses like our Automotive Refinish and some other even sub-segments within some of our areas. So we manage this business with a long-term view, and we're always looking at the war game of if this happens, then what? And residential repaint right now is an important element. If you look at our DIY business, our DIY business was up double digits, but it's because the comparisons were so small. Last year, we made the decision to deemphasize We weren't making our DIY product. And the reason we did that is that we were allocating that to our DIY retail customers that are important. We want to maintain that long-term relationship. We took a hit there in last year's sales in DIY to help our large and important customers grow. As a result, our DIY comps look good now, but it's on a small base. The residential repaint business is an important element that we expect to continue to grow. DIY, we'll take that business, but our focus is on the 90% of the professional through our stores.\nHeidi Petz : Josh, one more thing I would add to that on the residential repaint side. I think if you look at -- back to your question on the backlogs and how we think about this business offsetting some of the other softening demand, we're introducing new products. So if you think about these contractors going in, largely focused on the walls, we've introduced a new professional cabinet coating. It's essentially a one component that performs much like a 2-component epoxy. So excellent chemical and moisture resistance and allowing these contractors to go in and essentially help to complete an entire kitchen from the walls to the cabinet. So really trying to arm them with the ability to take advantage of while they're in the home, where else they can generate revenue.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Alex Yefremov at KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov : I have two questions on the cost side. One is on the labor cost. What are you seeing in terms of trends? Any signs of inflation leveling out there? And the second part is on the real estate. As you sign new leases or renew existing leases, are you seeing any cost moderation there?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. Let me -- I'll take the first one on our labor costs. We talked about mid-, high single-digit labor costs through our nonfactory distribution facilities. We do expect that to level out, especially as we get into our second half in our factories and distribution centers. I would say the rate of increase has been higher to attract and retain those individuals and our sites. I would say on that side, Alex, we're going to continue to do specific market studies to make sure we don't get out of bed, if you will, or outside of the market in any given area. I think what I would admit to as we maybe got a little behind. Previously, we're not going to let that happen. So I believe it's leveled out as we see more unemployment rates tick up, it will put less pressure on wage inflation going forward. But I think we've got to be diligent in the manufacturing distribution areas to -- each market is a little different. Each one is going to be more specific to what's happening in that market, and we'll be more diligent there. But I do expect them to level out.\nJohn Morikis : And on the rent side, I would tell you that for the most part, I'd say, rents seem to be relatively flat. We make a very good tenant. We try to use that and leverage that. The fact that as the predominant or premium brand here, we like to talk about what it is that we bring. We talk about our financial strength and the fact that we're investing in our industry, while others are closing stores, we think, plays well to those tenants that are looking for a long-term tenant that can pay their bills, and we fit that bill.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Arun Viswanathan at RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan : So first question, I guess, was you guys have obviously many, many businesses. If you were to characterize maybe the top 2 or 3 that are performing better than expected or have the capabilities of performing better than expected, what would those be? Would that be maybe Commercial and maybe new home -- new resi potentially not being as bad as you initially thought? Or how should we think about that?\nJohn Morikis : Well, I would say that Commercial certainly has performed better. Our property maintenance has performed better. Our protective & marine has performed better. I think that our residential repaint is, we had high expectations of that going in. So we -- I think -- I would never say they're meeting our expectations. When they meet our expectations, we raised our expectations. On the Industrial side, I think our Automotive business is really doing very well. And I'd say that -- there are some others that -- it's hard to answer this question, Arun, because in each of our businesses, there are opportunities. So in our business, the way we look at it, it's not a 1 or a zero. When our teams come in and talk about -- if you're looking at our Paint Stores Group, you can come in and talk about new residential being under pressure, but then the focus is on where are the opportunities. And so even within new residential, we know there are opportunities there for growth. And so there's -- I often say there's no finish line. In each of these businesses, there are opportunities. And the role of our leadership teams that have been through many of these in the past is to find those opportunities and they exist in every single business. Even Industrial Wood, where there's a lot of pressure, there are opportunities for growth, and we expect the team to find those opportunities, grow in those segments while improving their position within the segments -- the sub-segments that we play in now so that when the market does return that we are that coiled spring and we take advantage of it. But we expected them all to grow faster than the market.\nArun Viswanathan : Okay. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the EPS outlook here a little bit. So prior to your last earnings report, I think several of us rightly or wrongly were in the $9.50 to $10 range for '23. Yourselves and us have rebased our expectations to $8.35 or so at the midpoint. So does that $1.50 or so that we had to remove from our outlook, what would it take for that to come back in '24? Is it mainly lower -- a better affordability environment driving higher housing turnover? I know there are several things that you can probably mention, John. But similar -- maybe a couple of the top drivers that we get you back into that near $10 range on EPS?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Arun, the first and always the biggest is volume growth. I mean there's been a lot of macro headwinds. There's a lot of uncertainty and some of the mortgage rates are higher. Existing home turnover is lower. New family -- single-family starts are lower. As we keep investing in new stores, in new reps and some of the other long-term growth opportunities, reps across each of the businesses as the market improves because of the added investments we've put in over time, we expect to grow much faster than that market. So instead of a headwind with the macro environment becomes a tailwind, and then we grow. I keep going back to '08 and '09 because I believe it's a similar environment and the similar dynamics. So we expect to grow not 1x to 2x the market, but 2x to 2.5x to 3x the market. And that's how we're going to drive that operating margin back to where we expect it to be.\nJohn Morikis : Yes, it's capitalizing. I mean mentioned in the last response, that in every one of these segments, I agree, volume is the key and growing share is important. And even we talk a lot about new residential, and we point to single-family frequently when we're having that discussion. But the fact that multifamily starts have been more robust since last summer. It's a terrific opportunity. And our ability to shift resources and attention to those opportunities is what differentiates us and why we believe that we'll get there. And the opportunity to really see that expansion we're not just waiting for the market to come back. We're working every day to take that volume and be in a better position to capitalize on it once the markets improve.\nArun Viswanathan : And just one last quick one. I know you guys have moved the FCP to August. Was that mainly just you had a little bit more visibility into the year? Or I guess, usually, it's some in May or June. So just if there was anything to that, I just wanted to understand that move.\nJohn Morikis : We wanted to bring you to Cleveland in August. It's a beautiful time to be here. It's...\nArun Viswanathan : Great. \nJohn Morikis : Yes. I mean to bring you in and be able to talk a little bit more about our line of sight in August is going to be much better. And quite frankly, we're proud to put our teams in front of you, and we think we're going to have a lot of really good things to talk about. So we're looking forward to hosting you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from John Roberts at Credit Suisse.\nJohn Roberts : Your Auto Refinish business has been consistently strong for a long time right now. During the pandemic, I thought it was Dupli-Color, but now we're out of the pandemic and it's still strong. Is it controlled distribution? Is it new products? What's driving that above-market performance?\nJohn Morikis : Yes. It's controlled distribution. It's technology. We talked about the combination of the technology system between some technology combining Sherwin and Valspar technology. We have wonderful leadership. We have great products, great distribution that's controlled. And we've been talking, to your point, John, about our position here for some time and expected it to grow. And we think the numbers are proving exactly what we said was going to happen is, in fact, happening.\nJohn Roberts : Okay. And then you've got over 300 stores in Latin America. Now that they're in the Consumer segment, do you run them differently? Are you going to be repositioning those stores?\nJohn Morikis : No. All along, we've been sharing talent as well as best practices amongst the Consumer brands and our Paint Stores Group. There is a realization that more and more of that business represents or mirrors business that might most likely be found in our Consumer Brands Group. We've got talent in our Consumer Brands Group. Todd Rea and the team has really done a wonderful job, and we think bringing their expertise to that market where we can leverage their experiences will be terrific. And quite frankly, it will work both ways. We have terrific leaders in Latin America as well, and we expect to learn from what it is that they do down there and bring some of that back to North America. So it's a win-win for both businesses and certainly for customers on both sides.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Kevin McCarthy at Vertical Research Partners.\nKevin McCarthy : With regard to your Performance Coatings Group, is it your sense that customer destocking is done as we sit here in April? Or is it still playing out among certain businesses within the segment?\nJohn Morikis : I would say it's likely played out, although I would say there might be some differences in region by region, Kevin. But if you look at what's happening in Europe as an example, there's a lot of concern in the market. So we might have some customers that might still be in unique position. But for the most part, particularly here in North America, I don't think there's a great deal of inventory in the segments that we play in.\nKevin McCarthy : Good to hear. And then secondly, if I may, what percentage of your Performance Coatings Group sales are linked to contracts that would feature some sort of indexed pricing mechanism as it relates to raw materials?\nJohn Morikis : A very small percentage. \nKevin McCarthy : Okay. So when you say in your prepared remarks, John, that you hang on to the majority of your price increases, it sounds like that would be a vast majority indeed, if index pricing is quite small.\nJohn Morikis : That's correct.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Duffy Fischer at Goldman Sachs.\nDuffy Fischer : Just first question on structural raw materials. A year ago, you guys were shorted and couldn't supply your customers what you wanted. Obviously, now things are slacked in the system. We're seeing prices roll over. If we get back to a normal demand level, let's say, next year, are raw materials structurally short again? Or have you guys taken steps and what steps have you taken to increase the availability of raw materials if we get back to a normal demand level?\nJames Jaye : Duffy, I would say they will not be structurally short. The availability has recovered very nicely for us. We've taken a number of steps over the past couple of years in response to what we've seen. One of those was certainly our purchase of specialty polymers, which has increased our internal resin production. We work closely with many of our suppliers. We've simplified the portfolio as well. So there are maybe not as many raw materials that we would have to procure as we would have in the past. I don't know...\nJohn Morikis : I'd say from an assurance of supply, it's very important to understand, Duffy, we're not trying to return to a supply chain of the past. Our goal has been to improve our position and our ability to supply our customers, and we've taken appropriate steps. For competitive reasons, we're not going to lay out what those steps are, but Heidi and her team -- Heidi is leaning on the edge of receipt, wanting to answer this question. We're not going to get into those details right here right now. I would tell you that we have been very forward-thinking in how we're going to work through future issues, and we learned a lot during this process. And I'd say we're coming out better and smarter as a result.\nDuffy Fischer : Fair. And then a decade ago, the Glidden brand bumped you guys out of Walmart once before. And I think if my notes are right, it was like a $250 million opportunity back then. This time, does it move the needle? It's no longer Dutch Boy, but it's Valspar, but does it move the needle for you guys or that's kind of a non-event in what we'll see in your printed numbers?\nHeidi Petz : Yes. We don't think this will really have any impact to be really candid with you. And I think if you look at the business in general, Walmart is still a very important customer to us. We sell them a lot of our key brands such as Minwax, Thompson's, Krylon. And while we have, to your point, enjoyed the private label in the past, I think this is an exciting opportunity for us as we move forward because we're going to continue to service the existing brands that we have, and we will look forward to an opportunity in the future. If there comes to be something where we can both create value on both sides or both companies will absolutely be interested in looking at that.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Adam Baumgarten at Zelman & Associates. \nAdam Baumgarten : Just one for me. Are there any other businesses at this point in the portfolio that are under strategic review? Or are you kind of through that process?\nJohn Morikis : Adam, we look at every business, every brand, every program, everything constantly. We have that discipline.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky at Northcoast Research.\nCharles Cerankosky : When you look at the Paint Stores Group, DIY was up double digits in the quarter. And I think you touched on some of that. But in the Consumer Group in North America, DIY was soft. Was there more to talk about there than just short supplies a year ago at Paint Stores? \nJohn Morikis : Not really, Chuck. I'd say we have really deemphasized DIY last year to serve our customers. And so we now have a product to sell. And -- so it's on a smaller base because of last year. And again, I think it's important to mention that our focus and our success is going to largely be determined by the professional sales that we have, representing about 90% of what goes through our stores. So we'll take the DIY business. We're there. It helps us, but the focus is on our PRO business.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois at Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois : I wanted to follow up just on the inventory field that you saw in Consumer Brands. Was that across both DIY and Pro? And do you expect any of that to bleed into the second quarter?\nAllen Mistysyn : No. Typically, what we see in our mid spring and summer selling months are, you'd start seeing the declines in inventory as we come out of the season. So I wouldn't expect to see inventory builds like we saw in our first quarter. So I think you'll see a more typical seasonal inventory pattern this year. Raw materials are in a good place. Like I said, we're through the total supply chain Inventories are in a good place. So just to put it in perspective, we're back to servicing our customers at the level that we expect to service them at, and they expect to be serviced at. So I would expect that management of inventory will happen similar to the flow of past cycles.\nGarik Shmois : Got it. I just wanted to follow up. It doesn't sound like it, but I just wanted to confirm if you're seeing any trade down or any change in mix at all, be it in paint Stores or in Consumer Brands?\nJohn Morikis : No, the opposite. It's a positive mix shift. Customers that have labor as a percent of sales continue to learn that a higher-quality product might cost them a little bit more per gallon, but that they actually make more on a project. So our mix is positive in our stores.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard at Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard : A follow-up for you, Al, I guess. On gross margin, the upside performance in the first quarter or strong performance, however you characterize it, I'm assuming there was some benefit from strength in volume. What I'm trying to figure out is the volume behaves differently in the coming quarters as you've talked. Do you build from the 1Q gross margin? Is that having an impact on the gross margin? How should we think about the linkage between volume and gross margin as we move through the balance of the year?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. It certainly because Paint Stores Group had a better -- had increased volume, and it's our highest gross margin segment and certainly improves our gross margin going in the first quarter for sure. I think as we're moderating some volumes, but still Paint Stores is still going to be our best performing segment in our second quarter. And we do also expect to hang on to the price and see that sequential raw material moderation. So I think the volumes help for sure. And when a Paint Stores Group is stronger than the other segments, because of that mix dynamic, it will help our gross margin. But I do expect to see sequential and year-over-year improvement in gross margin in our second quarter. And then we'll give you an update, Eric, on the rest of second half after the second quarter.\nOperator: Your final question for today is coming from Jaideep Panaya at On Field Research.\nJaideep Pandya : The question really is on Industrial Wood. Could you tell us when did the destocking actually start? And is there any signs of really destocking or weaker demand coming towards? And then the second question really is on the multifamily homes. One of your competitors was sort of alluding that there is a decent backlog this year, but there could be some air pocket next year as the projects sort of finish. So do you expect weakness in the multifamily homes or for that matter in commercial/property management in 2024? Or it's not something you worry about?\nJohn Morikis : Well, on the Industrial Wood and multifamily, I'd say -- let me start with the multifamily work backwards. I'd say our line of sight right now on both commercial and multifamily is strong for the balance of this year and certainly going into next year, we'll see what happens as we move forward. But right now, our confidence is high and the pipeline is full. We're bidding a good amount of activity with the contractors in this space. So I'd say our future looks pretty positively on that. In the industrial Wood, timing, it's been under pressure likely along with housing. So if you want to look at housing starts is a good precursor for this business. It's not exact, but we'll give you some insight as to how that business has behaved. And again, our expectation is that there are opportunities in this business to outpaced the market in both -- in all the segments you talked about, multifamily as well as Industrial Wood. We have teams that are out there focused on growth every day.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye for closing remarks.\nJames Jaye : Yes. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I did want to remind you that please save the date for our annual financial community presentation that will be in Cleveland, as John said, on August 24. The event will also be webcast. Registration details on that will be available soon, and we look forward to seeing many of you here to close out the call here, you heard today that we're off to a very good start to the year with today's results. And at that same time, our team knows we still have work to do, and we're prepared to do that. We know there's going to be macro headwinds as the year progresses, but we'll deliver strongly in those conditions. And we're going to remain focused on what we can control. So thank you for attending today. And as always, I will be available along with Eric Swanson for your follow-up phone calls. Thanks for your interest in Sherwin. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, previously known as The Americas Group. We described this change on our last call and in this morning's press release. There is no impact to prior year consolidated results related to this change. Current and prior year segment results have been restated to reflect this change. First quarter Paint Stores Group sales were ahead of our expectations and increased 14.8%, driven by high single-digit volume growth and continued effective pricing. Segment profit increased by $97.9 million and segment margin improved 120 basis points to 18.4%. Our Pro architectural sales grew by a mid-teens percentage in the quarter. All Pro market segments increased by double digits, led by property management and followed by commercial, residential repaint and new residential, respectively. Sales in protective & marine and DIY also increased by double-digit percentages. From a product perspective, interior and exterior paint sales were both strong, with interior sales growing faster and representing a larger part of the mix. Moving on to results in our Consumer Brands Group, which again now reflects the addition of a Latin America architectural business in the current quarter and prior year. Sales were well ahead of our guidance and increased by 2.4% in the quarter. Performance was better than expected in North America, where sales were down less than 1%; and in Europe, where sales were down low single digits. In other regions, sales were up strong double digits in Latin America and down double digits in Asia. Effective pricing led by Latin America was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in volume and low single-digit FX headwinds. The tightness in alkyd resins impacting our ability to produce stains and aerosols, improved significantly during the quarter, and we expect this issue to be behind us by the end of the second quarter. Adjusted segment margin was 13%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, we divested a noncore aerosol business at the beginning of this month, and we also entered into an agreement to divest our China architectural business. We expect these actions will benefit segment margin over time as we drive a return to our high teens, low 20s adjusted margin target. Onetime restructuring costs in the quarter were immaterial.  Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 3.4% against a 20.4% comparison. The increase was driven by low teens pricing and mid-single-digit sales from acquisitions, partially offset by a low teens decrease in volume, which included the impact from discontinued operations in Russia and a low single-digit unfavorable FX impact. Adjusted segment margin increased 390 basis points to 15.7% of sales. This is the fourth straight quarter this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement, driven by execution of our strategy, including effective pricing.  Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased high single digits against a nearly 30% comp. Latin America sales increased by double digits, also against a strong comp. Sales in Europe were up mid-single digits, while sales in Asia were down double digits. From a division perspective, growth was strongest in Auto Refinish, which was up by a mid-teens percentage, followed by Coil and General Industrial, which were both up mid-single digits. All three of these divisions grew against double-digit comparisons. Industrial Wood sales were down mid-single digits as expected due to slowing in furniture, cabinetry and flooring related to new residential softness. Packaging sales also were down mid-single digits against a 30-plus comp with volume down about 1 point in the remainder due to our exit of Russia and unfavorable FX. We continue to feel very good about our position and growth prospects in this end market.  With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. Yes -- well, go ahead, John. Steve, this is Heidi Petz. John covered a good bit of this. I think, at the end of the day, we want to make sure that we are demonstrating that we're the very best partner. In fact, we want to be their #1 partner. So we think of some of the engagements here and how we're activating, certainly, there's a lot of support as they're working through their promotional calendars, making sure that we're investing in the right areas, not only to drive traffic, but to make sure that we're converting those shoppers in the aisle certainly. And we've got a lot of great brands. We've got some launches that are taking place right now. We won't get into too much detail here, but we want to make sure that we're a lockstep with them in terms of driving those conversions. John mentioned this, but the leadership team, certainly all the way through the organization, I would say our partnership has never been better than it is right now in terms of making sure we've got the alignment across the organization, both with their Pros Who Paint and the DIY segments. So when you think of the structures, we've got to make sure that those are mirrored and that the metrics are aligned there. So I feel really confident in the way that we're moving forward and got big plans for the year. So we're going to keep moving. Steve, I think you answered it perfectly. Yes, there was -- there's a better model here. I think the divestiture certainly it does align with our strategy And as we've done a lot of work in that group to optimize the portfolio of the brands, certainly making sure that we're driving a focus on where we can get a return for our shareholders. And I think you said it -- sometimes they're just assets that are more valuable to others and this is an example of just that. We had -- the business was about $100 million in revenue with 300 employees -- and frankly, it was acquired as part of the Valspar acquisition, you remember, in 2017. So as we move down the next quarter here, we'd expect to close on this second half of 2023. Yes. And I would just hit a few highlights here on the segments. I think, obviously, a lot of this is based on our strategy of differentiation. I'll hit on some of the regions. So just a couple of highlights. If you look at where we've said based on being recession resilient, Automotive Refinish is a great example where we were up mid-teen percent. We do see strong demand in most regions, and I would also comment on the really good price realization for the value that we're able to create and demonstrate for our customers. We've been a number of calls here in the last few quarters, we've been talking more about our installations, and we're now seeing the momentum really building here. We would expect to continue to build up momentum and think you could expect to see us taking some meaningful share here. A few challenges. We're still working through. You'll probably hear a consistent theme across Performance Coatings Group and some of these segments where we've largely recovered our raw material challenges, but it is now a race to convert to finished goods as soon as possible. So you can imagine the Automotive Refinish space that is absolutely a priority and also working closely with our customers where labor does continue to be a challenge for these customers. The shop technicians, parts shortages are impacting some of these customers that are working through backlogs rather the Automotive Refinish. I'd highlight quickly here, too, Mike, is the Protective and Marine where as you know, we're servicing this segment through our Paint Stores in North America and very strong double-digit sales in the quarter and still a strong -- aggressively strong outlook, I would say, through 2023. Demand is strong in North America and Latin America through most of the segments in protective & marine. Europe, Asia, we've talked about these, certainly seeing some pressure there, which is leading to some project delays. And as I mentioned, we're on the path here making sure that we're taking every ounce of the resin as it continues to improve to raise the conversion here. So we'd expect to see growth and incremental share gains there as well. I'll comment just briefly on General Industrial. You mentioned that think this, I would categorize as more of a mixed bag across the segments and the regions. However, globally, heavy equipment remains our strongest. And then you've got some areas that are showing early signs of slowing. Appliances will be a good example of that, just adjusting to inventory levels. So we're going to continue to ramp up production there. Briefly on Coil and I'll hit Industrial Wood and certainly come back to any additional comments. Coil, North America is remaining strong with very consistent demand. Our metal buildings business is performing better than expected and seeing some softness in areas like the aluminum trim business. Latin America continues to be very strong with good performance that is built on new business and new accounts. The teams been laser focused there, but we're still seeing pressure across EMEA and Asia in Coil. And I'll briefly hit on Industrial Wood. We've talked about this segment where we feel the most pressure. And I would say within the actual segment, the most pressure as it is coming from furniture. The other segments like kitchen cabinets and flooring, we mentioned in our prepared remarks that are tied to new residential continue to be a challenge. So we're seeing the continued pressure there. But importantly, what the leadership team there is working on is expanding aggressively through market share gains, while our competition, in some cases, it's reacting to the market softness differently. So we're working on getting these gains with a focus on introducing new technology. And I'll give you a quick example here. The example in our furniture category, this technology is going to allow our customers greater service, quicker turnaround and ultimately, smaller batches, which brings benefit to the customer with less working capital, less waste and less obsolescence. So I'm bringing this to you just as another example of beyond what's in the can, how we partner with our customers to bring them solutions that are meaningful to their business goals. So quick overall around those segments, but just a little bit of color. Josh, one more thing I would add to that on the residential repaint side. I think if you look at -- back to your question on the backlogs and how we think about this business offsetting some of the other softening demand, we're introducing new products. So if you think about these contractors going in, largely focused on the walls, we've introduced a new professional cabinet coating. It's essentially a one component that performs much like a 2-component epoxy. So excellent chemical and moisture resistance and allowing these contractors to go in and essentially help to complete an entire kitchen from the walls to the cabinet. So really trying to arm them with the ability to take advantage of while they're in the home, where else they can generate revenue. Yes. We don't think this will really have any impact to be really candid with you. And I think if you look at the business in general, Walmart is still a very important customer to us. We sell them a lot of our key brands such as Minwax, Thompson's, Krylon. And while we have, to your point, enjoyed the private label in the past, I think this is an exciting opportunity for us as we move forward because we're going to continue to service the existing brands that we have, and we will look forward to an opportunity in the future. If there comes to be something where we can both create value on both sides or both companies will absolutely be interested in looking at that."

            "name": "Allen Mistysyn",
            "content": "Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. And let me start with consolidated SG&A was up 14%. Paint Stores Group was just over 2/3 of that increase, and excluding acquisitions, was approximately 80% of the increase year-over-year. And this is due to the increase in new stores and additional sales reps, which probably represented about 2/3 of the increase. And then in addition, employee-related costs were higher year-over-year due to multiple merit increases beginning in the second half of last year and into the first quarter of this year. Yes. The only thing I'd add to that is, Vincent, as we discussed in January, we're going to continue to manage our G&A expenses tightly and adjust other discretionary marketing and other spending as we get a better outlook on demand in the second half. I would say I would expect a smaller year-over-year increase in our second quarter as we annualize the merit increase from last year. We start realizing more cost reductions from the restructuring activities. . Typically, we see a slight uptick in SG&A in our Paint Stores Group as it ramps up staffing and service to increase seasonal architectural demand uptick. Acquisitions will be slightly less than what we saw in our first quarter, which is a low single-digit impact. And then we'd expect those to annualize and not see much in our second half. So as the year goes on, my second quarter, I'd expect a lower percent of sales because of the seasonally higher architectural sales, but then the year-over-year change gets tighter as the year goes on as we annualize some of these things. No, Jeff, I'd expect -- if you look at how Paint Stores Group, in particular, SG&A rolled out as the year went on last year, it ramps up as we get into our second half because we added more stores, but the merit increases happen in our second half. So the comp gets higher, so the percent change gets lower as we go through the year. I would say the other groups have done a really nice job of managing their SG&A. Consumer, Paints, PCG would have a similar impact with the merit increases, but they've been managing their SG&A very tightly. And then in admin, we'll continue to invest in system upgrades and things like that, but we're going to manage it tightly. So I would not expect that high of a percentage increase for the year. Yes. Mike, I'd just add to that. As you remember on the January call, I talked about a potential headwind with just lower architectural volume because everybody in the industry had to build architectural inventory back up. So that's short term.  Long term, we have a lot of confidence in the growth across each of the segments, Architectural Pro segments that John talked about, and we'll fill up that capacity very quickly. So even though it might be a short-term headwind, as we've lived through some of these cycles before, the bounce back and the strong growth, I'll go back to 2008 and '09, and we grew high single digit for the 3-, 5- and 10-year compounded average growth rate, and we're a much bigger architectural business today than we were back then, we'll fill that capacity. So -- and I would argue or add to that, we're going forward on Statesville because of the confidence we have in the future outlook and the growth in architectural. Yes, John, I would say that you're absolutely right. We have obviously saw a better performance in North America and in Europe. And if you remember on our January call, I said we had not seen the destocking in our fourth quarter that maybe some had seen. So we anticipate it may be a slower build in inventory at the retail channel. We actually saw a slight increase in the retail channel inventory. And I think -- thinking back, if I look at across the chain from the retail channel back through our DSCs, we're back to more I would call, historic levels of inventory. So we're well positioned to service the spring and summer selling season that's coming up. And I'd just highlight also, Latin America was a mid-single-digit tailwind in the quarter. Latin America had a very strong double-digit quarter and that helped when you brought them into the Consumer Brands Group. Yes, Mike, I would say, as John talked about, I mean, our first quarter is the smallest quarter. We expected a strong quarter. We delivered on that. We're closely monitoring the demand trends and expect, as you mentioned, and we said it on our year-end call that new residential demand would start slowing in our mid-second quarter. We've experienced a lot of market uncertainty before. I just look at the last three years, I think it's better to get a better view of demand after our seasonally higher second quarter. This gives us the best opportunity and more certainty for our second half. And we'll continue to manage our SG&A, particularly G&A tightly, continued investments in other discretionary items will be managed with the demand outlook. I think we believe these long-term growth investments allow us to grow market share in any environment and especially as we come out of this slower macro environment. But that is how we're going to manage the company going forward. I mean, we believe our second half outlook is realistic. But we also believe we'll outperform the market. And if the market demand is better than our expectations, we'll perform better than what we currently have here. And we'll all those variables together and give you our best outlook after the second quarter for the year. The only thing I'd add to that, Mike, is when thinking about it by segment, we have a lot of confidence in our Performance Coatings Group to drive operating margins to that high teens, low 20s. The first quarter, excluding acquisitions, we were at 16.4. Again, if you remember, we hit that mark in the third quarter. It's an all-time high since we've owned Valspar. And we're confident in driving Consumer Brands Group back up to that high teens and low 20s. So we get our cost structure right, that will be a tailwind. We hold on the price. But as we come out of this, we drive strong architectural gallon growth, market share growth in our Performance Coatings business, and that's what's going to drive those operating margins back up to the high watermarks we experience in different occasions on the different businesses. Yes, Greg, I would just say that April is trending as we would have expected it to trend, not any better or worse. Sure, Greg. I would say price is up high single digits. And with that being a little bit higher, acquisitions added a low single-digit percentage, which was mostly offset by FX headwinds. And you're right, the volume was flattish. If you look at that in our second quarter, effective price is going to be slightly lower year-over-year in the second quarter compared to the first quarter as we annualize the Paint Stores Group 12% price increase February 1 and some of the other price increases. As you know, the other divisions and groups were out with significant price increases as well. So they're just not as uniform as Paint Stores Group, but they will annualize as we get through our first -- as we've gotten through our first quarter and into our second quarter. The main difference is lower volumes, primarily due to lower new residential that we talked about, some softening in North America Performance Coatings Group. And then FX headwinds will mostly offset acquisitions in both quarters. Yes. I'd say most of the impact were price increases. But the benefit -- we did see a nice benefit of the increased volumes in Paint Stores Group. As a reminder, that is our highest gross margin segment and plus the slightly moderating raw materials that John talked about. And we are getting on top of the raw material costs. As you know, as we get into significant raw material inflation, we see that short-term contraction. As pricing starts catching up, we moderate our gross margins flatten out, and then we see growth as raw materials moderate and we hang on to most of the price. And it's because of the investments we continue to make. And... Sure, Mike. Let me start and then I'll let Heidi jump in. We do expect continued strength in Auto Refinish and positive sales in General Industrial in the second quarter, may be a little bit slower than what we saw in our first quarter. We expect the continued softness in Industrial Wood. And then we expect Coil and Packaging to be down low single digit, primarily due to the strong double-digit comps in the second quarter. I think if you look at it by region, North America, our largest region, is expected be up or down low single digits compared to a high single-digit first quarter, both against strong double-digit comps, and we're not expecting a ton of improvement in Europe or Asia Pacific and even Latin America will moderate a little bit. Well, Truman, for Paint Stores Group, it's mostly carryover for consumer. There's pockets where maybe we didn't have product that now we're able to better service the customer with improving alkyd resin situation. But in Performance Coatings group, for sure, there was some incremental pricing across specific businesses and specific regions that John even talked about where maybe we haven't been as effective as we needed to be in the past or there's other inputs that are causing our cost to go up. I use energy in Europe as one example where we've had to be out to offset some of those higher costs. So maybe some incremental, the mass majority of it, though, is the carryover pricing from 2022. Yes, I would say it's probably a good cadence. There wasn't anything onetime that jumps out, Truman, as you can imagine, across a global business, there's puts and takes every quarter. But nothing that drove the over increase in our gross -- in our operating margin. Truman, the other -- the only other thing I would add to that is acquisitions were slightly dilutive in the quarter as we continue to integrate those acquisitions realized synergies as the year goes on, my expectation that, that will improve as the year progresses and help drive better operating margin in this segment. Yes, David, we're not going to give guidance on our second quarter EPS. I understand the question. What I think you can expect to see in our second quarter is, gross margin, we expect sequential and year-over-year improvement We talked about the price increases and a sequential carrying over and a sequential improvement in raw material costs will have a positive impact, partially offset by higher wages within manufacturing and distribution. I would say with SG&A, I do expect a smaller year-over-year increase in our second quarter as we annualize that merit increase from last year and we start realizing more of the cost reductions from restructuring activity. So we typically see an increase in SG&A, as I talked about, with Paint Stores ramping up to service the increased sales. But as a percent of sales, I would expect our SG&A as a percent to be lower in our second quarter because of that seasonally higher architectural sales. So you do expect a lift in our second quarter because of the improvement in Paint Stores Group quarter-to-quarter architectural sales, but we're not going to Yes. Let me -- I'll take the first one on our labor costs. We talked about mid-, high single-digit labor costs through our nonfactory distribution facilities. We do expect that to level out, especially as we get into our second half in our factories and distribution centers. I would say the rate of increase has been higher to attract and retain those individuals and our sites. I would say on that side, Alex, we're going to continue to do specific market studies to make sure we don't get out of bed, if you will, or outside of the market in any given area. I think what I would admit to as we maybe got a little behind. Previously, we're not going to let that happen. So I believe it's leveled out as we see more unemployment rates tick up, it will put less pressure on wage inflation going forward. But I think we've got to be diligent in the manufacturing distribution areas to -- each market is a little different. Each one is going to be more specific to what's happening in that market, and we'll be more diligent there. But I do expect them to level out. Yes, Arun, the first and always the biggest is volume growth. I mean there's been a lot of macro headwinds. There's a lot of uncertainty and some of the mortgage rates are higher. Existing home turnover is lower. New family -- single-family starts are lower. As we keep investing in new stores, in new reps and some of the other long-term growth opportunities, reps across each of the businesses as the market improves because of the added investments we've put in over time, we expect to grow much faster than that market. So instead of a headwind with the macro environment becomes a tailwind, and then we grow. I keep going back to '08 and '09 because I believe it's a similar environment and the similar dynamics. So we expect to grow not 1x to 2x the market, but 2x to 2.5x to 3x the market. And that's how we're going to drive that operating margin back to where we expect it to be. No. Typically, what we see in our mid spring and summer selling months are, you'd start seeing the declines in inventory as we come out of the season. So I wouldn't expect to see inventory builds like we saw in our first quarter. So I think you'll see a more typical seasonal inventory pattern this year. Raw materials are in a good place. Like I said, we're through the total supply chain Inventories are in a good place. So just to put it in perspective, we're back to servicing our customers at the level that we expect to service them at, and they expect to be serviced at. So I would expect that management of inventory will happen similar to the flow of past cycles. Yes. It certainly because Paint Stores Group had a better -- had increased volume, and it's our highest gross margin segment and certainly improves our gross margin going in the first quarter for sure. I think as we're moderating some volumes, but still Paint Stores is still going to be our best performing segment in our second quarter. And we do also expect to hang on to the price and see that sequential raw material moderation. So I think the volumes help for sure. And when a Paint Stores Group is stronger than the other segments, because of that mix dynamic, it will help our gross margin. But I do expect to see sequential and year-over-year improvement in gross margin in our second quarter. And then we'll give you an update, Eric, on the rest of second half after the second quarter."

            "name": "John Morikis",
            "content": "Thank you, Heidi. I want to thank our teams for working hard to deliver a strong start to the year, especially the margin recovery we are seeing following the relentless cost inflation we've experienced the last two years. As we said in January, we expected to have a strong first quarter, and that's exactly what our team delivered. We also indicated that we would not be updating guidance after the first quarter. We know we have work to do, and we're under no illusions about the macro headwinds we're likely to face as the year progresses. We'll have a much better idea of how the year might unfold as we get deeper into the painting season over the next few months. As we enter the second quarter, we'll remain focused on what we can control. This includes leveraging our recession-resilient markets, growing new accounts and share of wallet, continuing appropriate growth investments in stores and sales representatives and managing price cost dynamics. We remain confident in our differentiated strategy, capabilities and product and service solutions, and we continue to expect to outperform the market. For the second quarter of 2023, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will be up or down by a low single-digit percentage compared to the second quarter of 2022, inclusive of a high single-digit price increase. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be flat to down mid-single digits, inclusive of a mid-single-digit price carryover from 2022. Our sales expectations by segment for the second quarter and the full year are included in our slide deck and reflect the move of the Latin American architectural business from Paint Stores Group to Consumer Brands Group. There is no impact on our sales guidance in the quarter or the year from the divestiture of the China architectural business at this time as the transaction has not yet closed. On the cost side, there is no change in our raw material outlook where we continue to expect costs to be down by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect to see the largest benefit occurring in the second and third quarters. We expect to see decreases across many commodity categories, though the ranges likely will vary widely. We expect other costs, including wages and energy, to be up in the mid- to high single-digit range. The first quarter is typically our smallest, and we need to see second quarter trends and performance to better understand potential impacts on our second half outlook. We expect to provide an update on our full year sales and EPS guidance following our second quarter. As a result, there is no change at this time to our guidance for full year 2023 diluted net income per share, which we expect to be in the range of $6.79 to $7.59 per share. Full year 2023 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.81 per share and includes expense related to our previously announced targeted restructuring actions of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $7.95 to $8.65.  We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. There are also no updates to the additional data points and capital allocation priorities we provided on our January call. I'll also refer you to the slide deck issued with our press release this morning, which provides guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. All of these remain unchanged from our January call as well. Given the many variables at play, limited visibility beyond the first half, and the high level of uncertainty in the global economy, we continue to believe our current outlook is a realistic one. As we get through our second quarter and we see more information, the assumption we laid out in January could change. If those assumptions change for the better, we would expect to deliver stronger results. We've transformed our business in many ways since the last significant downturn, and we're now a stronger and a more resilient company. I'm highly confident in our leadership team, which is deep and experienced and has been through many previous business cycles. We anticipate that 2023 would be challenging. We planned accordingly. We have and will continue taking appropriate actions. We expect strong momentum coming out of this period of uncertainty, similar to prior downturns. That momentum will stem from our strategy of providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and more profitable. In challenging environments, like the current one, we can become an even more valuable partner to our customers, while we're also earning new ones. The bottom line is we expect to outperform the market and our competitors in 2023 and for years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks.  With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Yes. Let me just jump in here before you carry on there on the investments of our employees, I think it's absolutely critical to understand in a controlled distribution model, particularly, we see the value of the retention of our employees as a key element of our strategy. We want to build relationships with our customers. We want to make sure we have the right talent that they're trained, that they're developed and that we retain them. And so the investments that we've made beginning actually about midyear last year, we are clearly seeing the benefits of that. Now there's some benefit in the market as the economy has taken its course. And clearly, that's had an impact on some employees and employers. But our relationship with our customers -- our employees has improved dramatically. And I would point to our retention. We've often boasted about our turnover rate down in the 7% to 9% range. And we're proud to say that we're back in that range of employee turnover. So our retention is back to a historic low. We think that's an important element and an important investment that we make because we want to make sure that those employees are there when our customers are walking into our stores. So let me turn that back over to you. So Jeff, we've said that the single-family housing starts are expected to be down year-over-year in the range of 20% to 35%. And our expectation would be that in our business, we'd be better than the market. So our expectations would be that it would be down in the 10% to 20% range. And we've also talked openly about the fact that we expect some of our more recession-resilient segments to pull heavier during that period of time. So as we saw the quarter unfold, we saw exactly the sequential trend that we -- that you just described. So year-over-year, January, we saw high teens percentage increase; in February, low double-digit increase; and then mid-single digits in March. So we expect that type of a trend to continue through the balance of the year. If you look back 90 days, 120 days and you see the number of starts in comparison to previous quarters, you can see the downturn and then the impact on our new res sales as it unfolds. Yes, Chris, I'd start with the fact that our Paint Stores Group is our largest business, as you know. It's a $12 billion portion of the company. 90% of our Paint Stores Group is made up of professional sales. And as Heidi mentioned, PRO sales in total grew by a mid-teens percentage with every one of our professional segments growing double digits. So these are large segments growing double digits. So we're growing real market share in absolute dollars. And I'll give Justin Binns and his team a lot of credit for the new account and share of wallet initiatives that are clearly working. To your question specifically on residential repaint, we probably best would describe the bidding activity as having returned to a more normalized bidding market, where in the past 12 to 18, maybe 24 months, it was difficult to get a painter to even come out and give you a bid because they were so busy and so backlogged. I would say that it's likely best described as a more level or more normalized bidding activity. If you look at the LIRA or the NAHB remodel index, both are positive, but clearly some deceleration in what they're projecting. Our double-digit quarter this year was on top of a mid-single-digit performance last year. So I'd say that we have confidence in what we're doing. We have confidence in our ability to continue to grow and grow at our competitors' expense. We have product back in our store. We just talked briefly about the people in our stores. We think that's a very important element in what it is that we do. So the retention of our people, we believe, has a direct correlation to the retention of our customers. And we continue to introduce new products. We can get into some of those details, perhaps later, if we like. But we're introducing new products to help keep that residential repaint customer not only successful in what they're doing, but also growing in new segments as well. Talk a little bit about new res there a moment ago after Jeff's question, but I will say that our ability to work with our builders and help to drive their business and their efficiency, we believe, has been an important element in our ability to retain the relationships that we have, and in fact, grow those relationships. We're introducing in the face of an adverse market here in the diversity of new residential, we're introducing new products that will help our customers high build products that will help hide imperfections and improved durability, and that's helping us to grow our new residential business, and we expect that to continue to grow. We expect to come out of this time here of some challenges in the market with absolute new and greater market share. On the Commercial side, you asked about this was one of the markets that clearly came in with stronger-than-expected results for the quarter. Our position in this segment is very good, strong and growing. We've been long investing in reps, products, specifications and the fact that we have local stores and local reps is an important element in growing this segment. Again, we've introduced a number of innovative products here as well. When you think about labor, we often talk about that labor represents, on average, about 85% to 90% of the cost of goods for a painting contractor. The cost for a commercial contractor is likely higher than the average, perhaps in the 90% to 95% as many of the commercial contractors are either union or applying paint in the metro markets, which are higher cost. Our model, therefore, is even a greater value to these customers. Our ability to collaborate with the architects, work with the designers, work with these contractors is absolutely paying dividend. And we're excited about this business. The commercial side, there's a lot of work that's still coming out of the ground, and we expect to continue to grow with this market and at the expense of our competitors. Property maintenance, you asked about as well, is another segment that grew stronger than expected. Occupancy and rents are returning to more normal rates, and growth here is driven by not only our continued share gains but capital improvement projects as well as an increase in turns. So the Pro side by segment is really going well, and we're going to continue to put fuel in this tank and feel really good that while we're growing share, the only expectation we have for our team is to grow it even faster. Absolutely not. We expect and are filling that capacity, Mike. And when you believe like we do and what's happening in the market and where we're going, if you were sitting in my chair, you would have invested exactly as we did. I would not have pulled back one penny of it. Well, Mike, we're positioned well to do just that. It's yet to be seen as the market or the the market tries to kind of resume back to some normalcy in Asia. We're positioned very well. Our technology, our assets, our people, I think a lot of that has to do with what happens in the market and our expectations as in any situation is to grow faster than the market. I think we're in a very good position from a technology, but also a relationship perspective. So yes, I'd say that there is some uncertainty with the market in general as it opens up, and our customers are back producing product, we expect to capitalize more than our share there. I'd characterize it as we don't like to talk about weather, you're right. I think there are areas that are going to be under pressure with whether, John, and there are going to be other areas that are a little better in weather and does it have some impact in some of those areas, sure. But short of significant impact on our businesses, we try to stay away from that. Our expectations from our team includes the opportunity to go out and grow business. And so appreciate the question, but we're not going to follow the weather as a means for what's driving our results right now. We're proud of what we've accomplished. We're determined to accomplish more, and we're not going to let weather stand in our way. Ghansham, I'd say this year, we see a pretty solid year. These buildings are reaching the painting stage now. They started 12 to 18 months ago. So we'll have to see if there is, in fact, an impact on Construction and Commercial 12 to 18 months from now. But the long line of sight that we have in this space, we are growing share, and there's a lot of projects coming on, which we expect to paint. That's an interesting one because I think when you look at Packaging, we never accept from any of our businesses softness. But this is a very unique situation with our Packaging business on top of the 30% comps. This team is continuing to expand the commercialization of what we consider a very unique technology. So we continue to see the lines that our product is on. They grow. They're growing. We're growing share. What's happened right now is there's a level of destocking that's taking place within many brands impacting our customers as they work through high inventory levels. It's not often that I'm accepting to a team that's brought in softness. But in this case, given the line of sight that we have and the share that we're gaining and the incremental production lines that were going on every day, we're giving them a break. So I think the first quarter was a little tough. We'll probably have a little choppiness here in the second quarter. And as the year progresses, our expectations will resume for this team to continue to grow or to be able to demonstrate the share that they're growing. It's a short-term issue for this team. We've got a lot of confidence in the technology, the team and what we're doing. We'll be fine here. Well, we've talked about our -- speaking to the margin -- gross margin, we expect we'll be in the range of the 45% to 48%. We've I think demonstrated the incremental sequential margins in this quarter, getting close to that bottom level of the range, and we expect to poke through that. And the reason we do expect that is, is that we believe we're focused on the right customers with the right solutions. Our focus is really simple. I mean we want to help them make more money, help them to be successful. And as a result, we are in a position to be able to build that combined success. And as a result, we expect to be able to provide margins for both our customers and our shareholders. And the combination of the right customers with the right solutions, we believe will lead us to that. No, I was just going to say I want to start and then kick it to you, Heidi. I'd say, first of all, as there's a commitment by both companies to grow this, that terrific leaders inside our organization and they're working with terrific leaders inside the Lowe's organization, an outstanding partner. And I think we're combined looking at the right elements of the business. And so we're not going to disclose the percentage on that, Steve. But Heidi, I would like for you to maybe could talk a little bit about the Pros Who Paint, but also on a broader view, the importance of this relationship and in the Consumer Brands portfolio as well as the initiatives that we have to grow. On the Pros Who Paint, specifically, Steve, to your point, there are customers that prefer a home center platform. They can purchase everything from dry wall to every other element that they might use on a project. And -- so to get to your question about who supplies delivery or sales calls or anything, there's a team effort that goes along with that. And while we don't disclose the details of those for strategic and competitive reasons, I think hit at best. The collaboration and focus has never been stronger. Yes. I think it's an important element. We continue to invest not in the products, but the services and technologies as well as the other assets. Additionally, I'd say the obvious and important investment in talent that we just talked about, the retention of talent and as well as new talent. So it's more than what's in the can. We're investing in the success of our customers with every rep, every tech rep, every store, even the trucks we're adding to our fleet, all designed to improve the profitability of our customers. So there's more to it than the cost of what's in the can, and we're trying to drive the success of our customers with the investments that we're making. Greg, we've talked for many years together about our approach, and it's not -- it doesn't change. Every 30 days, we sit down, Al, Heidi, myself with the entire leadership team, and we have a discussion. And the discussion isn't just on raw materials, to your point, it's on every cost that we have. And we do everything we can to try to drive more and more efficiency into the operations that we have. We try to use our leverage with purchasing. We try to drive efficiencies in the plant, everything so that we don't have to go out with price increases. So that's our first choice. But there are times when we find ourselves, as you've described, in situations where it may not be the lever on raw materials that drives it, it might be some of the others. Energy, transportation, whatever it might be. So on a monthly basis, we evaluate that, we make that decision, we take it to our customers, and then we talk to our investors. At this point, we're not in a position to talk about any increases because we're not out with those on a broad scale inside our stores. I will say that with some customers in different parts of our businesses, where we've been working to put pricing in, we're still putting pricing in. So there's no finish line in this area. Truman, I'd give a lot of credit to our leader there, Karl Jorgenrud and his lieutenants that are out driving every day. To your point, we see the sequential improvement. There's a lot of hard work. The identification of the right customers, the right segments, the right technologies and really demonstrating the ability to help our customers to improve their profitability. And we've said for a long time that we expect this to be in the high teens, low 20s. And Karl was in the room right now. I look him in the eye and tell them I'm expecting them to get there very quickly. So -- and he would probably respond that he's going to. So we've got a lot of confidence in that team, a lot of expectations, high expectations, and we are going to deliver. We expect to have a good second quarter, and we're going to update you at the end of the quarter. But what we see right now, we expect a good quarter. No. Actually, David, normally, what we see is a small percentage, large, perhaps what we might call, marquee jobs that get a lot of attention, and we're all proud and some of us have egos. We met that that we want to see our pain on specific projects. But for the most part, what you see is a pretty disciplined industry because we all understand that it is competitive and the ability to continue to keep your company healthy and invest in those drivers that will help your customers to be successful requires that health. And so it's competitive for sure. But for the most part, it's race to demonstrate the value that you can bring. And we believe that in that race Sherwin-Williams wins. Yes. I should be careful in making general statements like that because to characterize an entire industry like that can be challenging to say the least. But yes, I would say that many customers that have in the past not been able to even return phone calls on bids. Bid requests are now either returning those calls or looking for some of those bid requests. There's an understanding that there's an opportunity to continue to grow. If you look at the homes in the U.S., they are aging. The residents of those homes are aging. And while many of those people may choose to move into a new home, many are choosing to stay in those homes and paint remains relatively inexpensive, yet highly impactful project, and those painting contractors are pursuing those. So again, I mentioned earlier, I would describe it as a more normalized market. Contractors are looking and doing a lot of work, and they are also probably a little more aware that having a marketing aspect to what they're doing is an important part of their future success, and we're helping them with that. It's an element that most people don't recognize. And when I say it's not just what's in the can, we've been at this for over 150 years, obviously, and our ability to align with our customers, help them to understand not only that they should be looking around the corner, but how to prepare for that. They might have been great painters. Now they own a paint company. And when they started the business, they put a sign on a project and every person in the neighborhood came to them. We're helping them to understand how to reach out and grow their business, how to, in some cases, specify products, in some cases, even how to interview potential painters. So we're lockstep with these firms, helping them to grow their business in ways that most people wouldn't understand I'm not sure I quite understand your question, but I might say that we see this residential repaint business and have seen it as an important element to offset some of the softness in the market coming out of the last downturn. Al, myself and many of the leaders that are currently running the company sat and reviewed during a slowdown like we had experienced then, what would we like to have going forward. And it was a larger, more meaningful residential repaint business, and we've been successful in doing that. We were successful in growing new residential, our position there. We love our position there. And we've over-indexed now given the success that we've had. And so the offset to that has been the residential repaint, the property management and on the Industrial side, businesses like our Automotive Refinish and some other even sub-segments within some of our areas. So we manage this business with a long-term view, and we're always looking at the war game of if this happens, then what? And residential repaint right now is an important element. If you look at our DIY business, our DIY business was up double digits, but it's because the comparisons were so small. Last year, we made the decision to deemphasize We weren't making our DIY product. And the reason we did that is that we were allocating that to our DIY retail customers that are important. We want to maintain that long-term relationship. We took a hit there in last year's sales in DIY to help our large and important customers grow. As a result, our DIY comps look good now, but it's on a small base. The residential repaint business is an important element that we expect to continue to grow. DIY, we'll take that business, but our focus is on the 90% of the professional through our stores. And on the rent side, I would tell you that for the most part, I'd say, rents seem to be relatively flat. We make a very good tenant. We try to use that and leverage that. The fact that as the predominant or premium brand here, we like to talk about what it is that we bring. We talk about our financial strength and the fact that we're investing in our industry, while others are closing stores, we think, plays well to those tenants that are looking for a long-term tenant that can pay their bills, and we fit that bill. Well, I would say that Commercial certainly has performed better. Our property maintenance has performed better. Our protective & marine has performed better. I think that our residential repaint is, we had high expectations of that going in. So we -- I think -- I would never say they're meeting our expectations. When they meet our expectations, we raised our expectations. On the Industrial side, I think our Automotive business is really doing very well. And I'd say that -- there are some others that -- it's hard to answer this question, Arun, because in each of our businesses, there are opportunities. So in our business, the way we look at it, it's not a 1 or a zero. When our teams come in and talk about -- if you're looking at our Paint Stores Group, you can come in and talk about new residential being under pressure, but then the focus is on where are the opportunities. And so even within new residential, we know there are opportunities there for growth. And so there's -- I often say there's no finish line. In each of these businesses, there are opportunities. And the role of our leadership teams that have been through many of these in the past is to find those opportunities and they exist in every single business. Even Industrial Wood, where there's a lot of pressure, there are opportunities for growth, and we expect the team to find those opportunities, grow in those segments while improving their position within the segments -- the sub-segments that we play in now so that when the market does return that we are that coiled spring and we take advantage of it. But we expected them all to grow faster than the market. Yes, it's capitalizing. I mean mentioned in the last response, that in every one of these segments, I agree, volume is the key and growing share is important. And even we talk a lot about new residential, and we point to single-family frequently when we're having that discussion. But the fact that multifamily starts have been more robust since last summer. It's a terrific opportunity. And our ability to shift resources and attention to those opportunities is what differentiates us and why we believe that we'll get there. And the opportunity to really see that expansion we're not just waiting for the market to come back. We're working every day to take that volume and be in a better position to capitalize on it once the markets improve. We wanted to bring you to Cleveland in August. It's a beautiful time to be here. It's... Yes. I mean to bring you in and be able to talk a little bit more about our line of sight in August is going to be much better. And quite frankly, we're proud to put our teams in front of you, and we think we're going to have a lot of really good things to talk about. So we're looking forward to hosting you. Yes. It's controlled distribution. It's technology. We talked about the combination of the technology system between some technology combining Sherwin and Valspar technology. We have wonderful leadership. We have great products, great distribution that's controlled. And we've been talking, to your point, John, about our position here for some time and expected it to grow. And we think the numbers are proving exactly what we said was going to happen is, in fact, happening. No. All along, we've been sharing talent as well as best practices amongst the Consumer brands and our Paint Stores Group. There is a realization that more and more of that business represents or mirrors business that might most likely be found in our Consumer Brands Group. We've got talent in our Consumer Brands Group. Todd Rea and the team has really done a wonderful job, and we think bringing their expertise to that market where we can leverage their experiences will be terrific. And quite frankly, it will work both ways. We have terrific leaders in Latin America as well, and we expect to learn from what it is that they do down there and bring some of that back to North America. So it's a win-win for both businesses and certainly for customers on both sides. I would say it's likely played out, although I would say there might be some differences in region by region, Kevin. But if you look at what's happening in Europe as an example, there's a lot of concern in the market. So we might have some customers that might still be in unique position. But for the most part, particularly here in North America, I don't think there's a great deal of inventory in the segments that we play in. A very small percentage. That's correct. I'd say from an assurance of supply, it's very important to understand, Duffy, we're not trying to return to a supply chain of the past. Our goal has been to improve our position and our ability to supply our customers, and we've taken appropriate steps. For competitive reasons, we're not going to lay out what those steps are, but Heidi and her team -- Heidi is leaning on the edge of receipt, wanting to answer this question. We're not going to get into those details right here right now. I would tell you that we have been very forward-thinking in how we're going to work through future issues, and we learned a lot during this process. And I'd say we're coming out better and smarter as a result. Adam, we look at every business, every brand, every program, everything constantly. We have that discipline. Not really, Chuck. I'd say we have really deemphasized DIY last year to serve our customers. And so we now have a product to sell. And -- so it's on a smaller base because of last year. And again, I think it's important to mention that our focus and our success is going to largely be determined by the professional sales that we have, representing about 90% of what goes through our stores. So we'll take the DIY business. We're there. It helps us, but the focus is on our PRO business. No, the opposite. It's a positive mix shift. Customers that have labor as a percent of sales continue to learn that a higher-quality product might cost them a little bit more per gallon, but that they actually make more on a project. So our mix is positive in our stores. Well, on the Industrial Wood and multifamily, I'd say -- let me start with the multifamily work backwards. I'd say our line of sight right now on both commercial and multifamily is strong for the balance of this year and certainly going into next year, we'll see what happens as we move forward. But right now, our confidence is high and the pipeline is full. We're bidding a good amount of activity with the contractors in this space. So I'd say our future looks pretty positively on that. In the industrial Wood, timing, it's been under pressure likely along with housing. So if you want to look at housing starts is a good precursor for this business. It's not exact, but we'll give you some insight as to how that business has behaved. And again, our expectation is that there are opportunities in this business to outpaced the market in both -- in all the segments you talked about, multifamily as well as Industrial Wood. We have teams that are out there focused on growth every day."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company Review of the Third Quarter 2024 Results and our Outlook for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2024. With us on today\u2019s call are Heidi Petz, President and CEO; Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Finance; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under US Federal Securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statements speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company\u2019s earnings release, transmitted earlier this morning. After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, and good morning. In our third quarter, characterized by ongoing choppy demand, Sherwin-Williams grew consolidated sales, expanded gross margin and grew diluted earnings per share and EBITDA. Sales in all three segments were within our guidance range. We also returned $631 million to our shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. We remain highly confident in our strategy and importantly, our team's ability to execute consistently. We continued to invest in the quarter to capitalize on what we see as unprecedented long-term share gain opportunity. We expect these continued near-term investments in stores, sales and technical reps, incremental services and digital capabilities to drive sustained and profitable above-market growth. We also expect the pace of investment to moderate in the fourth quarter resulting in second half SG&A growth in the more normalized low to mid-single-digit level we have previously described. As far as our outlook, we are maintaining our full year EPS guidance. We recognize the current range is wider than typical entering the fourth quarter. This range accounts for several variables that are hard to forecast precisely over the next two months, including timing of demand related to recovery from hurricanes Helene and Milton and the potential for extended holiday shutdowns among our industrial customers. Our team continues to navigate these and other near-term challenges while executing on multiple initiatives to drive our long-term success. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will comment on our third quarter results by segment before moving on to our outlook and your questions.\nHeidi Petz: Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Before I begin my comments on the quarter and our outlook, please know that thoughts and sympathies go out to all those that have been impacted by the recent hurricanes in the Southeast US. Our priority has been the safety of our employees, our customers and their families. We've been working hard to provide our people with appropriate support and I'm amazed at how our teams on the ground have come together to help each other. Approximately 200 of our stores were closed for some period in the third quarter following Hurricane Helene and nearly all were back online by the end of the quarter. Similarly, approximately 225 stores were closed for some period following Hurricane Milton at the start of the fourth quarter, and most of those stores are also now back online. The perseverance and resiliency of our people are inspiring. I could not be prouder of the personal and professional support they are providing our customers as recovery and rebuild efforts begin. At our recent financial community presentation, I described our success by design approach. We deliberately make the right choices and the right investments at the right time to drive sustained above-market growth and returns over the long term. It's an approach that has worked for us for decades and is exactly what we are doing right now. The current opportunity to gain market share is nearly unprecedented, and we will continue to take full advantage of it. While competitors are distracted or inconsistent in their execution, we offer consistency, stability and reliability. We are a predictable partner. We're doubling down on our strategy because we know it works. Our team is focused, determined and aggressive. We continue to provide our customers with solutions to make them more productive and profitable. We have great confidence in what we are doing, and we believe our results will continue to demonstrate outperformance over time. As far as specifics on the third quarter, we'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, where sales increased by low single digits. Volume and price were both up low single digits. Pro architectural pricing realization was in the range we anticipated but was partially offset by unfavorable mix. Segment margin decreased to 24.5% due primarily to higher investments in long-term growth opportunities and mix the quarter. Protective & Marine was up high single digits against a low double-digit comparison and has a solid pipeline of projects extending into next year. In Residential Repaint, our prior investments continued to pay off, as we delivered the fifth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit growth in a flat to down market. New Residential also grew at a mid-single-digit rate in a choppy but improving market. Commercial grew by low single digits against a high single-digit comparison. Property Management was flat with continued delays in CapEx projects. DIY remains soft. From a product perspective, interior paint sales grew faster than exterior paint sales where outdoor conditions caused delays in some of our largest regions. We have opened 45 net new stores year-to-date and expect to open 80 to 100 for the full year. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased by high single digits, inclusive of an approximate 4% impact from unfavorable FX. Sales in North America decreased by a high single-digit percentage, where weakness in existing home sales and inflation continue to pressure the DIY market. In Europe, sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage. In Latin America, volume and price were positive, but were more than offset by unfavorable FX. Adjusted segment margin expanded to 22.9%. This was primarily driven by higher fixed cost absorption in the manufacturing and distribution operations within the segment and effective cost control, partially offset by lower net sales. In the Performance Coatings Group, net sales were effectively flat as volume was offset by unfavorable FX. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 18%, primarily due to lower sales in North America and unfavorable FX. This high teens margin level demonstrates the continued strong performance that reflects our differentiated customer solutions and business optimization efforts. We continue to see choppy demand by division and region. Packaging delivered high single-digit growth with sales up in every region. Coil also delivered solid growth, driven by share gains. Industrial Wood grew low single digits, driven by an acquisition. New account wins in Auto Refinish have been masked by softness in our core business where consumer reluctance to pay deductibles is resulting in lower insurance claims. General Industrial continued to face headwinds in heavy equipment and transportation markets. Regionally, sales in the group were positive in all regions except North America, which decreased by a low single-digit percentage. Moving on to our guidance. The slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2024. The deck also includes our updated guidance for consolidated and segment sales for the full year 2024. Our full year diluted net income per share guidance is unchanged. Our adjusted diluted net income per share growth remains at 8.7% over the prior year at the midpoint of our guidance. We are absolutely focused on executing our plan in the fourth quarter and delivering full year EPS results in the range we provided July. I also recognize that many of you are beginning to formulate your views for 2025. While we're not providing any specific guidance until January, I can share some high-level commentary that may be useful as a preliminary framework. The single largest variable heading into next year is the timing and pacing of a true inflection in the demand environment. We stand by our FCP commentary, but it's only a question of when, not if. However, trying to peg this to a specific quarter, let alone a specific month or a week, it's not something we can do with precision. Our forecasting models incorporate a wide variety of indicators, including LIRA, existing home sales, housing starts, housing affordability, interest rates, consumer spending, and industrial production among many others. Direct input from our customers is a critical data point that also informs our outlook. While several signals are beginning to move from red to yellow and some from yellow to green, our initial view is that demand is likely to remain choppy in the first half of the year. What is certain is our strategy. We deliver differentiated solutions that make our customers more productive and more profitable. The good news is that in a macro and a competitive environment like the current one, approach becomes even more valuable to our current customers, while also attracting many new ones. We will continue being very aggressive in pursuit of new business and share of wallet gains. Sherwin-Williams is incredibly well-positioned in each of our targeted end markets. We are confident we will outperform the market in all environments and significantly so when demand becomes more robust. We are committed to driving success by design for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Certainly. Everyone at this time, we're conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning everyone. If I could just ask on the SG&A spend, it seems like there was a tactical decision made in the third quarter just based on the cadence of the spend that you anticipated for the back half. It seems like all of a sudden, you pulled more into 3Q than in 4Q. Could you talk about what precipitated that and exactly what you did? Just to give us a sense of what's going on there?\nHeidi Petz: Yes. Let me start. Vincent, appreciate the question. I'm going to hand it to Al here to talk a bit about cadence and timing. But a few things, I think, that that are really important playing out and as you heard in my prepared remarks, I would tell you we see this as the ideal time to invest in our long-term strategy, and candidly, an opportunity to widen the competitive moat. We're going to continue to capitalize on this, making sure that we are best positioned in areas where our competitors aren't even seeing some of these opportunities. So we're not waiting for the market to recover fully or to tell us it's time to invest. We're going to continue to keep our head down and make sure we're getting rewarded for these efforts. We will tell you amount in front of customers often and they're sharing with us that competitors are out-promising some of these investments and making all types of commitments to try mirror what we're doing at Sherwin-Williams. But because we are confident we've got the best assets at the absolute best people in industry and best technology, we're going to continue to lay in these investments now well ahead of the cycle, well ahead of what's coming into next year. And one more comment before I hand this over to Al, I would very much tell you that I would do this 10 out of 10 times. I think there's no doubt about it, we're confident in our strategy, but we are absolutely going to invest, we're going to win and we're going to continue to deliver for our customers.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. As we have typically done, we're managing growth and operating margin, and we expect a higher gross margin in the second half of the year than we forecasted coming into the quarter. So as we normally do and I reaffirm this at our Investor Day, we take some of that improvement invested in the long-term growth opportunities, particularly in Paint Stores Group that Heidi mentioned. And just to reaffirm what I said on our second quarter call, we are confident in our strategy. We have a consistent investment thesis, and I'm confident we'll get a return for those investments that we are making. And we can point to that like in res repaint up mid single digits over the last five quarters, showing the returns that we're getting for the investments we made in the second half, I think your comment is right. If I look at our second half forecast, it's in line, SG&A is in line with where I thought coming into the quarter. So there's a little bit of timing in that. So right in line with what we're expecting for the second half. And then the only other piece on that is the continued investments in our digital initiatives and our system modernizations that we've been undertaking.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\nChris Parkinson: Great. Good morning. Could you hit a little bit more on the pricing dynamics for 2024 and then 2025 on a preliminary basis in terms of how we're thinking about realizations, whether or not just the current sluggish environment, even though you're selling a lot of share is holding back from perhaps better realization 2024 and whether or not we could potentially see a bit of a constructive or positive pendulum in terms of those realizations as the market further improves in 2025? Thank you.\nAl Mistysyn: Yeah, Chris. As Jim talked about, we announced the 5% price increase in stores, effective January 6th. And the reason behind that is we're feeling pressure and increased feedstocks. We have wage inflation, which is more of a typical increase that we're expecting we're expecting in 2025, but also health care to be significantly higher year-over-year. And I think you're right. The price increase is about where we expect it to be. It's offset by mix and we talk about P&M being stronger, DIY being weaker, which weighs on that overall average selling price. I think when you look into 2025, I think we're going to get into this historical range of 50% to 60%, I'd say. And that's really driven by timing of a number of our national account contracts. We fully expect to get increases. But there's also a new competitive dynamics in the North America architectural market, and have to see how that plays out. But we're committed in this -- you know as we have discipline in getting price when we need it and our expectation is we need it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Roberts from Mizuho. Your line is live.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. In consumer, there was an interesting divergence between the sales change and the earnings change there. Did the change in inter-segment transfers was that significantly different than the change in the externally reported sales?\nAl Mistysyn: No, John, we did -- the allocation that I talked about in the first quarter and second quarter is the same. Global supply chain with a little bit better volume did perform better in the entire increase and our segment profit was due to that dynamic. If you look at -- on the commercial side, our North America business actually went backwards in PBT because of volume. And that's been a consistent theme over the last three quarters and even into last -- going back to last year. So no real change to the allocation. It's just they performed better. The team -- I give the team a lot of credit. They're managing their costs tightly and operating more efficiently in a more stable demand dynamic with inventory and production.\nHeidi Petz: And John, I would add to that as well. I give the team a lot of credit for a continued focus on refining that portfolio. I'll take you back to some of the key decisions that were made over the last few quarters and years relative to the China divestiture some non-strategic aerosol business. There's a handful of categories and businesses that the team absolutely was focused on where we can get strong organic core growth, and we walked away from some of those. So a new and improved baseline going forward. This business we talked about at our Analyst Day has really been by design built for speed and profit. So a leaner, meaner or fighting machine, if you will. So excited for the volume to come back so we can realize that [indiscernible].\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO. Your line is live.\nJohn McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, when you think about the competitive landscape and some of the changes that have taken place. I think, Kelly Moore and PPG are pretty well understood, I think, at this point, in terms of where the opportunities are. But it does look like there are other changes throughout the industry. I mean you've got BSF kind of unloading some assets and AXO [ph] potentially doing the same. So I guess, can you speak to the other competitive parts of your environment in terms the store's business -- or excuse me, in terms of the consumer business, and the PCG group and if you see opportunities there? And then I guess also maybe tied to that on the consumer side, can you speak to how that that customer landscape is looking right now in terms of destocking and where inventories may be at this point as well?\nHeidi Petz: Yes, good morning, John. I'll start with your first question relative to some of the competitive moves and then I'll hand this over to Al to talk about your question on PCG. I think you nailed it. And I think, first of all, let me be really clear there are always opportunities. There's certainly been a lot of shift. In fact, the way that we look at this and take you back to some of our focus on believing in our long-term strategy, our differentiation investing ahead of the curve, we do see this as a unique moment in our industry, where we are being laser focused on simply doing what we say we will do. It's amazing. I'm out with customers. The feedback I hear is you guys are consistent, reliable, dependable, it's amazing what a differentiator that is. So we're holding very firm there and making sure that in a down market in an environment where there is a moment in our industry, we're going to invest. It's a hallmark of Sherwin-Williams. I think you're seeing that playing out in real time. But we're always going to continue to look and assess. And if there are opportunities for us to strengthen or accelerate our strategy, we're always open to those reviews.\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, John, I think, in particular, the consumer, I think inventory levels have been pretty stable. We certainly do not or don't believe that the impact on our sales in the quarter for consumer was due to destocking. I think it's just been a soft -- continued soft DIY market. And I think you alluded to maybe some of the other opportunities -- if there's opportunities for M&A, we certainly take a disciplined approach to that as we always have, and we look at how different assets accelerate our strategy. And if they're in the right segments, in the right regions, then yes, we'll take a look at them.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Heidi, now on the PPG business, it's roughly $2 billion in sales in North America. How much of that business do you think is potentially up for grabs? Or are you targeting going forward?\nHeidi Petz: Well, I'll start with -- we're focused, first and foremost, on the quality sales there very consistent, as we've talked about relative to all of our portfolio. We're not interested in commodities. We want to simply focus on the premium segments at value what it is that we do and what we deliver every day. I will tell you maybe a better way -- I don't know if it's a better way or the way that we're framing that same question, David, would be Kelly-Moore, I would characterize as more of a short-term share grab opportunity. PPG, I would characterize as more of a long term where there was a lot of respect for that company and we've got to get out in front of these customers and earn every gallon every day and make sure that they understand when we bring them into Sherwin-Williams that we want to work hard to service them and build a lifelong customer. So in terms of quantifying the exact number, I can tell you it's more about making sure it's the quality sales that we want to earn and keep over time.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Your line is live.\nMike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. I was hoping that you could speak to your view on remodeling demand and how that could trend? I'm just curious with interest rates coming down and maybe more homeowners potentially tapping into that home equity that they have as we've seen home prices go up, do you see that as something that's going to be an important driver next year? What are your -- I guess, internal indicators suggesting about the remodeling side of the market? Thank you.\nJim Jaye: Yeah, good morning, Mike, this is Jim. Yeah, I think your question is very timely. I mean if you look just this morning in the Wall Street Journal, there was an article about America being primed for a home renovation resurgence. So I think that fits in with our longer-term view where that market is going. We've often talked about some of the indicators that we look at, Lira being one of them, and that's going to start to tick up sometime probably second, third quarter next year. I do think there is some pent-up demand on the existing home sales. Those numbers, as you know, have been down year-over-year for a long period of time. But as the economy improves, inflation wanes a little bit, people feeling good about the equity in their homes, I think there is a great opportunity for us. Al mentioned and Heidi mentioned the investments that we've laid in ahead of that, right? And you're already seeing it in our Res Repaint numbers being up mid-single digits in a period where the market is flat at best. So once we start to get some help there, we feel very good about where we're headed and expect our res repaint business to be very solid, and that will also help our DIY piece as well.\nHeidi Petz: Mike, I think this is a -- it's a great question. It's a really good example of -- of this idea success by design. I give Justin Binns and his organization, incredible credit here. I mean you've got a lot of changing in the landscape and the team has been head down at the right point, focused on our differentiation, focus on our -- the value that we can create here. So we're not waiting for the market. To Jim's point, when we do see more moderate recovery, we'll absolutely be best positioned to take advantage of that. But the team is not waiting and making sure that we're out solving some of these needs for these contractors and building loyalty with a lot of new contractors coming into this res repaint space, we're primed for a nice run up here to follow as the market does come back.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Patrick Cunningham from Citi. Your line is live.\nPatrick Cunningham: Hi. Good morning. You mentioned a couple of variables on the wider range for the guide implied for 4Q. I guess, first, can you help size the hurricane impact in 3Q and sensitivity for 4Q? And then on the holiday shutdowns in industrial, is this something customers are hinting at? And is it broader? Or is it more concentrated in equipment and transportation?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Patrick. If you look at -- I'll start with the third quarter impact because having two -- it's bad enough having one major hurricane, having two major hurricanes and one in the third quarter, one in the fourth quarter, really adds to the speed of the recovery, and that's what makes it a more uncertain outlook in our fourth quarter and why the higher range. And it's not necessarily just our stores being able to be open. It's the time it takes for customers to get back to work, to assess the damage, homeowners reviewing insurance claims, and the type of damage that will dictate the speed of recovery, if it's flooding versus really structural. And I'd say, historically, we've taken about four weeks before you start seeing your primers start to pick up, sundries start to pick up and then paint that follows, I just think in this environment with the small quarter that we have in our fourth quarter, and the dynamics that we're talking about with two major hurricanes, it's hard to predict the timing of it actually coming back online. The impact for Helene in our third quarter was a little less than 1 point. It's primarily stores. If you exclude the impact of that stores, it'd be pretty right in line with guidance. And then probably cost us about $0.05 in the quarter. We didn't call it out. I think we expect to get those sales back in our fourth quarter. It's just -- it's going to ramp up as the quarter progresses.\nHeidi Petz: And I'll touch briefly on the customer shutdown piece. The way that we're looking at this, and there have been a few examples of more of a temporary shutdown over the holidays and not a lot of noise outside of that. Could that extend potentially, but we're obviously seeing really close with our customers. Karl Jorgenrud and his organization are making sure to stay in lockstep relative to the true demand environment so that we can be the best partners on the other side.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. I want to circle back on two things. One is the price increase, the 5%. It sounds like you're getting what you expect, which I would imagine is probably, what, 3% in Paint Stores Group. And then should we think it's a little less not the mix? Is that a fair way to think about it?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. Greg, I think when you -- we look at price, we're getting the effectiveness. It's just because you have a lot of different segments and some are performing better than others, it could dilute that price mix because we look at it as price mix in one bucket. And so it's not going to be quite 3% in the quarter. But as we talked about, volume and price are both up low single digits in the third quarter. And as we roll out next year, as an example, as a new res starts to improve like we saw in our third quarter, that mix change versus Res Repaint and DIY is going to dilute some of that price impact.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Park Markets. Your line is live.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thank you. Good morning. Could you comment on the backlog trends for pro contractors, please?\nJim Jaye: Yes. Sure, Aleksey. I think if you look at the backlogs I'd say, beginning maybe with Res Repaint, a little bit choppy here because of what we've seen with the hurricanes coming in. But overall, I'd say fairly normalized. I mean they're seeing fabs out there. I think the bigger thing for us is the share gain opportunities that we're aggressively pursuing. You look at some of the other verticals that we're in new Res, we're cautiously optimistic, seeing some pick up there. Commercial would be the one where I would say we've hung in there pretty well this year despite there being extended period of slower starts, but our completions, that backlog is being worked through, and we're still up in our commercial business, but our expectation is that commercial, that backlog will start to start to diminish as we get into next year.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is live.\nMichael Sison: Hey good morning. For the fourth quarter -- yes, can you hear me?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes.\nMichael Sison: Yes. Sorry about that. Yes. So, for the fourth quarter, with the growth you're going to see in stores, you've done a nice job there this year. Will segment profit start to turn the corner and grow? And then for 2025, I know you don't want to give the specifics, but if you generate -- what type of, I guess, store growth do you need to sort of get back to positive segment profit growth? And any thoughts on SG&A next year? Or do you think you're done in terms of increases?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes, Mike, concerning the fourth quarter and we typically don't give detailed guidance, but I would say this, we expect all our operating segments to show margin improvement year-over-year. Obviously, we still expect to see a seasonal slowdown in in architectural sales the fourth quarter that we have historically seen. So, I don't expect to see operating margin expansion in our two architectural businesses. I think as you get into 2025, I think the plan will be very similar to other years. I realized this year because our first half had an outsized growth because of the investments we made in the second half of last year. I think we'll moderate SG&A without giving full guidance today, we'll give a better guidance in our first -- in January, but the expectations are going to be the same. If we believe volume in the second half of the year, and/or gross margin is going to be stronger in the second half of the year. We take advantage of those situations just like we did in the quarter, and we'll put more investments in to accelerate our growth when some of these headwinds that Jim and Heidi have talked about ease up, and we'll take more of a market share than a higher percent of market share as the market turns.\nHeidi Petz: And I just want to add one piece to that. Al said this really well as we think about more of a moderated SG&A profile next year. I also want to articulate and be very clear that no one's head is in the sand here. While we have had a heightened level by design, we absolutely want to get that return. We owe that to our shareholders, and we expect outsized volume growth. We're going to be relentless until we deliver that.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.\nDuffy Fischer: Yes, good morning guys. Just a question on raw materials. I think, Al, you mentioned that see increased cost for feedstocks. So I was wondering if you kind of break it into different buckets. So one, just being inorganics and pigments and the other kind of the oil derivatives? Oil is down 20% from the first half into the third quarter. Why aren't you seeing some relief actually on that front? And what is it that's driving the increased feedstock costs that you're seeing going forward?\nJim Jaye: Yeah, Duffy, I'll take that one. So let me just start maybe with what we saw in the third quarter where our raws were flattish year-over-year. We're also looking for them to be flattish year-over-year in the fourth quarter and will come in right around that down low singles that we talked about in our forecast. I think if you look at TiO2 going forward, supply is readily available in the market. And I'd say pricing right now is stable, not seeing a whole lot of impact from tariffs right now. But you also have producers who are evaluating their production levels, et cetera. Ultimately, what's going to drive TiO2 is demand, and we'll see how that plays out. On the oil derivatives, yes, we have seen oil come down here recently. But if you look at propylene, which I know, Duffy, that you know that's the key feedstock for us. If you look in the third quarter, propylene was up year-over-year, almost 50% in the third quarter, and that was really driven, I think, by a planned and unplanned outages. Epoxy resins were also up in the quarter, and there's some additional tariffs that might come in that might impact that. So we're looking at -- we haven't seen that propylene or epoxy necessarily impact our basket meaningfully yet. But we're watching it very closely, and we'll see where it goes as we get into the next year. You know we have maybe a quarter or two of visibility. So we're watching those things. That propylene move is meaningful. Ultimately, it's going to be demand though, which is the big driver. We'll give you our official view in January. We'll continue to watch it. And we look at the entire basket, as you know, not just our raws. We look at our other costs. Our health care continues to be a major headwind for us, et cetera. So that's kind of our view right now with more to come in January.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Leithead from Barclays. Your line is live.\nMichael Leithead: Thanks. Good morning guys. Actually, Al, I did want to follow-up or circle back on sort of the Paint Stores price increase. It seems like you said raws are, again, uncertain but readily available, demand is fairly choppy right now. So curious how you're positioning this price increase to your customers? And relatedly, I know a lot of the Paint Stores is tailored towards, say, the larger contractor national accounts. But just given some of the ongoing DIY weakness, retail promo activity, are you seeing any customer swing activity over to the big box or not really an impact that you've seen thus far?\nAl Mistysyn: Not an impact we've seen thus far. As we've talked about, we continue to invest in products and services that help our customers be more effective, grow their top line and grow their bottom line because of the efficiencies they gain by moving up in quality. And when I talk price, I typically include mix in that, and we're consistently working with our customers to provide better service, to provide supply chain resilience, so that we can be their supplier of choice, second supplier of choice on down. So there are other input costs that we're taking into account, as Jim just mentioned, on why we need the price increase and the discipline we have to go out with price when we need it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is live.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Heidi, just in terms of your engagement with major customers specific to PSG, how would you characterize sentiment at their level? It's just more optimism for 2025 as it relates to aggregate activity? I'm just asking because there's been so much noise on volatility with interest rates including the most recent increase in mortgage rates post the Fed cut. So, just curious as to where sentiment stands for 2025?\nHeidi Petz: Yes. Ghansham, I would say it definitely pertinent by segment. And Jim covered some of that just a few moments ago. I think if you look broadly across in aggregate, there is -- everyone is reading the same macros. Everyone's hoping that these rate cuts are going to have a faster, more material impact. But I think as everyone's pragmatic here and trying to plan for what the reality is into next year, broadly speaking, it is more of a modest back half potential, what I would say is the broad sentiment. You do cut that by segment and Jim alluded to this a bit earlier, where some of these other signals relative to their existing home sales and the like. We're obviously getting a lot more bullish as we have been on Res Repaint. And I would say the Commercial is probably -- the Commercial segment is probably the area where we know that we've got the biggest challenge even throughout the year as some of these projects based on all the reasons you said before, CapEx, labor constraints, kind of live on, I think that's a reality that we're all navigating and I would say, is reflective in our customer sentiment.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is live.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes, thank you and good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on the outlook for 2 businesses within the Performance Coatings Group, namely Refinish and Packaging. On the Refinish side, it looks like you've gained some share, but if I understood your commentary correctly, it sounds like that's being masked by lower insurance claims and diminished reluctance to pay deductibles. So, my question would be, do you view that as more a structural or transitory? And would you expect it to reverse at some point in 2025? And on the packaging side, it looks like you had nice acceleration there. Do you expect that to continue in coming quarters?\nHeidi Petz: Yes. Kevin, I'll start with the Refinish piece. And I think one of the reasons -- one of the big reasons that I wanted to highlight this at our recent financial community presentation is exactly what you said. I think some of that is mass. I love how we're positioned here in this business. If you look at Q3, our sales were impacted by negative low mid-single-digit FX and Latin America, we have more exposure there, just given our mix relative to some of our peers, so you would expect that weight to play out. But if we just take the big approach to your point, is it structural and more kind of transitional. We look at this business over time. You're going to see swings quarter-to-quarter, our sales year-to-date, they are down low single digit against a high single-digit comp. So if you exclude FX from that, our sales are flat which is in line with where our competitors are at in their recent calls. So I want to be really clear that we are not satisfied with this year-to-date number, but it is an environment where claims are down double digits in North America, again, which is our largest region. And having said that, as you look at what is working, and we do expect improving claims, share gains to be a tailwind in next year -- the team has done some fantastic work on our collision core program. We're gaining both momentum and adoption here. And I think it's really important that we continue to look at strengthening what we're doing here. out early November of this year with a high single-digit price increase for our direct customers, and we'll be out with others as necessary, but continue to get paid for what we're doing, but confidence that the team is laser-focused on new accounts and share gains, which I think is absolutely sustainable and systemic. If I go to your second question on Packaging, you mentioned the word acceleration. I think that is a perfect word. Again, this is a business I love how we're positioned. Our sales in our third quarter were up high single digits, all of which was volume. So we're positive in all regions, and our volume was actually up low double digits, which was a bit offset by some of our index pricing agreements. We've got some great momentum. The team has done a fantastic job. So while we're flat year-to-date, if you look at the balance of the year, I would expect to see very strong performance in the fourth quarter leading into next year. We've recaptured some of the temporary share loss that we saw from our Garland, Texas plant event, work is not done. The team's heads are down. They're out earning this business every single day, but strong -- when I say strong, very strong line of sight to additional recovery over the next 12 months and many of these customers have -- again I'm out spending time with they're eager to return back to Sherwin-Williams. And I would characterize that as just a better appreciation not only of our technology, but the service that we're providing to these customers is world class. We continue to invest. We believe in our model here. Some recent new wins across other regions, including North America, Latin America and APAC and was just over in our France plant a few weeks ago for ribbon-cutting ceremony and just couldn't be more pleased with the expansion here. This is going to be the backbone of serving our customers as EFSA, as there ban on BPA rolls over into Q2 of 2026 and there's already some customers that are looking at pacing to that beginning in 2025. So I think we're very well positioned where -- certainly where the category and the market is going here. And last, but not least, really excited that we've just added to our capacity. We just closed on our Henkel metal packaging business October 1. So, of course, we're very excited to welcome about 130 employees at our production sites across both Germany and Mexico and the Sherwin family, but big expectations of where this business goes.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. So it sounds like Q4, the hurricane impact was not going to be that large since it was about $0.05 for Q3. So glad to hear that. I guess, my main question is just around 2025. When think about the opportunity for Paint Stores Group, it does sound pretty encouraging when you think about the share gains that you already achieved from Kelly Moore, maybe I think you sized that in the past is when they exited about $300 million in sales. So assuming a good portion of that potentially that you were able to achieve, maybe you can get a similar amount from PPG, and then if you factor in maybe a 3% price increase as well. Looks like the stores group has line of sight to high single-digit growth next year. Is that how you're thinking about it? Maybe there could be some further gains from lower interest rates, maybe benefiting the second half of next year as well. Is that kind of how you -- we should think about framing up PSG in 2025? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Allen Mistysyn: Yeah, Arun, I'd temper that. We've been talking about it taking a longer period of time for things to filter, like interest rate reductions and things of that nature. I mean, we're not -- I'm not guiding for 2025, and I know you're not asking that. But I'd temper with all the things we've gone through over the last year and a half and how long it's taken to get certain things moving, I would just temper that expectation. And again, we talked about, we expect choppiness in our first half, and then we'll see. In this environment, a line of sight of three quarters out is pretty far. So let us get to January. Let\u2019s -- we're going through our operating plans here coming up with the teams, and we'll get a better line of sight to that, and then we'll certainly share that with you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\nQ \u2013 Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. A two-part question. In your discussion of elevated SG&A costs in the quarter leading to long-term market share gains, perhaps, what you said is that in the fourth quarter, the spending will come down, maybe to 0% year-over-year, and your direction is to lower your SG&A spending. So what exactly happened in the third quarter, where spending was elevated by $50 million, and then it's going to go down in the fourth quarter? And then, secondly, in Consumer Brands, like order of magnitude, your margins are up maybe 900 basis points in the quarter, and your margins in the stores business are sort of flattish. Can you talk about what's keeping the margins constrained in the stores, and what is it this year that really opened up this sort of 800 or 900 basis point improvement in Consumer Brands, with sales being lower?\nA \u2013 Allen Mistysyn: Yeah, Jeff. I think when you look at our second half, there's investments going in, as well as we're controlling G&A tightly, and sometimes the timing doesn't align exactly in a quarter. So that's why I point to the second half and say our expectations of SG&A are in line for the second half, as it was coming into the third quarter. And I would just say we take a disciplined approach to our SG&A. We want to invest in the selling side and driving productivity for our customers by convenience of our stores, expertise in our reps, low turnover in our stores, so they have the same face at the counter, delivery, innovation, all goes into the investments we're making. On the other side of that, on digital and modernization, we want to allow our employees to be more effective in more consistent data, better systems that allow them to be more effective when they get to the field. And so there's other G&A that we're trying to control very tightly and manage that down. So we can help pay for those while we're waiting for market dynamics to help with the overall demand environment. That being said, I go back to res repaint and the 5% mid single-digit growth that we're getting. So the confidence is there in getting the returns. On Consumer, again, it goes back to higher fixed cost absorption that's being -- we're passing that through because global supply chain sits in Consumer Brands, and it's been a headwind for a number of years, and we thought we can get our efficiencies back up to offset it. We chose to readjust our standards and when I look at the GSE allocation, it's really no impact on our overall margin. But what you're also seeing is global supply chain has improved year-over-year. So Consumer Brands is getting a big increase from the allocation to stores and to PCG. But on top of that, they're also getting a tailwind from better operations within our global supply chain.\nHeidi Petz: And Jeff, if I go back to your first question on the elevated SG&A leading towards long-term share gains, which is absolutely the intent. And I just want to free visit, I think you used the language around keeping margins constrained in stores. I would take a different approach there. I think back to Al's earlier comment, when we see these expanded margins, we absolutely want to take advantage of that as an opportunity. So it did give us an opportunity Q3, Q4 to accelerate some of these investments. And I'll take you back to the six priorities that I laid out at our Financial Community presentation, all designed to deliver this above-market growth. So some of the digital priorities that that will absolutely pay off those six priorities, simplification that Al mentioned, helping to make sure our teams have what they need to go faster and add more value to our customers. So it absolutely was by design. And I think an important -- it was opportunistic on our part.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is live.\nChuck Cerankosky: Good morning everyone. In looking at the market share opportunities out there, I'd like you to maybe talk about what's going on at true value and do it best as well as Heidi mentioned better quality sales, can you talk about that given what market share opportunities are available and whether it's DIY sales or contractor sales, res versus commercial? Thank you.\nHeidi Petz: Yes, you bet. I'll start with the true value do it best. Certainly, we won't comment on our customer strategies. But I think again, as I go back to the point earlier, this is a bit of a moment in our industry. I think there's been a lot of pressure across the category broadly for the last few years. So we'll continue to work in lockstep with our customers as they make shifts and decisions relative to the brands and the banners. Move on your quality sales question. Within that, there's kind of two prongs to that. One, and I'll go back to my earlier comment, where we want to -- it's in our core DNA. We're not interested in being all things to all people there. So we're not going to play in the commodity spaces where we're not getting paid, we're not returning -- delivering return to our shareholders. What is of interest in those quality sales, certainly by the premium sub-segments that we serve and making sure that we are focused back to Al's point, how do help make them more successful, so premium products, opportunities to upgrade them, so they're getting on and off of job sites faster. They're saving time and money on labour with some of these premium products that or easier to apply, less touch up. So when we look at the quality sales, it's who we're targeting and how we\u2019re trying to service those with the right mix of products.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is live.\nJosh Spector: Hi. Good morning. Two quick ones, if I may. Just CapEx, can you just explain what's going on with the year-to-date already being at your target versus your full year guide? And just within performance where you talked about customer slowdowns and really that's a watch point for you. Can you just be specific on which submarkets you're seeing that as a bigger risk? Thanks.\nAl Mistysyn: On the CapEx, Josh, year-to-date CapEx was $7 billion, including about $415 million of BOF CapEx. And what happens is we get reimbursed because of our financing arrangement for our new headquarters. So we've really net is about $200 million. So core CapEx is $355 million. So we guided to the $700 million less $180 million, gets you into that $520 million, around 2% of sales, which is where we want to be at. That's just the noise in our new buildings.\nHeidi Petz: And then, Josh, on your -- the question relative to PCG and some of those temporary shutdowns, it's broad-based for sure in the general industrial point more to heavy equipment with some of the ag slowing down. Again, we see this as very much transitory point in time, end of season, and there's no signal yet that, that would be widespread or any signal that, that would be extended at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is live.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you. Can you comment on what drove the 2% decline in COGS? Jim, you mentioned raws were flattish. Was that a general comment and what were volumes in the top line, does that contribute to the lower COGS? And maybe just secondly, in your outlook for your stores business, are you seeing any aggressive pricing from any of your competitors as you're gaining share? PPG indicated they actually picked up share in the third quarter. So where are you gaining share? And do you see risk that they could get aggressive on price?\nAl Mistysyn: So Steve, on our cost of goods sold decreased, the decrease was primarily due to supply chain efficiencies on our Consumer Brands Group with global production volumes up low single digit with the team doing a nice job of controlling costs. The other impact was FX lower cost of goods sold in the quarter. Those are the two main drivers. On the volume side, stores was up low single digit. We -- Performance Coatings was flattish and then more PCG was more than offset with lower volume in our consumer.\nHeidi Petz: And Steve, on the store side relative to any competitive aggressive pricing, I would say that we typically look at our industry is, by and large, it's a very disciplined industry, which was why we have a lot of confidence when we do come out, we generally take a leadership position as it relates to price. We want to be out first. We want to be transparent with our customers. We want to deliver this in a way to our customer that helps to set them up for success, at a key partner in the bidding season, helping to -- where needed, if needed, coach them through how best to pass that along, so that they understand how to best kind of pass that through. Typically, the cost of the actual cost of the product itself is somewhere between 10%, 12%, 15% and then the balance would be the cost of labor. And so if we're able to do what we've continually focused on, which is at these crews on and off of job sites that ultimately is a positive to make sure that we continue to focus on upselling customers, especially in some of these environments. Have not seen -- we've not seen a lot of activity, I would tell you, because this is an unprecedented moment in our industry. We're certainly paying very close attention. We're staying extremely close to our customers to be competitive in a mix of environments, but we're confident that we're going to hold on to this recent -- this price that we just announced, and we'll be back in our 50 to 60 kind of historic run rate, and we don't plan to come off of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman. Your line is live.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey good morning everyone. Just on your kind of initial thoughts on the first half of next year remaining choppy from a high level. Is the way to kind of interpret that, that it's a continuation of the trends you're seeing here in the back half of 2024 at this point?\nAl Mistysyn: Yes. That's exactly what we're seeing.\nHeidi Petz: And if I could, and Adam, Al just nailed it. but I had to jump in here because I go back to this idea of it's not if, it's when. And so this kind of slower longer is playing out in real time, and we are absolutely prepared to manage that situation.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is live.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks. Just on the SG&A and the potential increase in the back half of next year, it sales ramp. Just maybe bigger picture, just how you're thinking about SG&A leverage? Is there a kind of investment of sales you'd be managing to over time? Or is it may be a situation right now?\nAl Mistysyn: I think, Garik, it's situational with -- as we've talked about, our focus is on driving operating margin. And some years, that's gross margin expansion in other years like 2021 and 2022, it's on SG&A leverage. We're -- as Heidi mentioned, I mean we're really being opportunistic to set ourselves up for when demand returns because our gross margin has been stronger because our global supply chain with a more normal production and inventory cycle this year building inventory leading into the summer selling season. We saw our inventory drop through the third quarter, and we expect to build inventory, architectural inventory in our fourth quarter. That bell curve and being more standard helps us with how we schedule our factories, how we're able to produce the right products at the right time and we get efficiencies out of that, and we're realizing those and taking it taken some of the benefit and putting it into these long-term investments.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is live.\nEric Bosshard: Thanks. If I could follow up. Al your comment, I think you just talked about the focus is driving operating margin earlier. How do you talk about achieving above-market growth. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is where does the curve of investment moderate, the market share growth sustains and operating margin expands? Or is that not the target that you're aiming for?\nAl Mistysyn: No. We're -- we absolutely are aiming to -- we'll moderate on the G&A side. I think to help pay for the selling investments because we're confident in our strategy because we've been consistent in our investments and because we know we can get a return on those investments. I think as SG&A -- I'm sorry, as the macro demand environment improves, you will see us get leverage on SG&A going out in the future. It's just not -- going back to -- it's not if, it's when. Because as your volumes start growing and mix improves, you can invest heavy enough to not get leverage on SG&A. So we absolutely are focused on managing gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage at the appropriate time to get our operating margin to grow at a faster pace.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, Matthew, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. As we've often said, we don't run the business for the perfect quarter. But what we do do is run the business to drive that long-term above-market growth and the returns. And that's exactly what we're doing right now. We believe in our strategy. We're investing in it. Heidi mentioned a couple of times, we're at a very unique place in our industry right now. The current opportunity to gain market share is nearly unprecedented, and we're going to take full advantage of that. We're very confident in our approach and our people, the trends favor us long-term and our team is very motivated to get after it. So thank you again. As always, myself, Eric Swanson, will be available for your calls over the remaining week and coming days. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Heidi Petz",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Before I begin my comments on the quarter and our outlook, please know that thoughts and sympathies go out to all those that have been impacted by the recent hurricanes in the Southeast US. Our priority has been the safety of our employees, our customers and their families. We've been working hard to provide our people with appropriate support and I'm amazed at how our teams on the ground have come together to help each other. Approximately 200 of our stores were closed for some period in the third quarter following Hurricane Helene and nearly all were back online by the end of the quarter. Similarly, approximately 225 stores were closed for some period following Hurricane Milton at the start of the fourth quarter, and most of those stores are also now back online. The perseverance and resiliency of our people are inspiring. I could not be prouder of the personal and professional support they are providing our customers as recovery and rebuild efforts begin. At our recent financial community presentation, I described our success by design approach. We deliberately make the right choices and the right investments at the right time to drive sustained above-market growth and returns over the long term. It's an approach that has worked for us for decades and is exactly what we are doing right now. The current opportunity to gain market share is nearly unprecedented, and we will continue to take full advantage of it. While competitors are distracted or inconsistent in their execution, we offer consistency, stability and reliability. We are a predictable partner. We're doubling down on our strategy because we know it works. Our team is focused, determined and aggressive. We continue to provide our customers with solutions to make them more productive and profitable. We have great confidence in what we are doing, and we believe our results will continue to demonstrate outperformance over time. As far as specifics on the third quarter, we'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, where sales increased by low single digits. Volume and price were both up low single digits. Pro architectural pricing realization was in the range we anticipated but was partially offset by unfavorable mix. Segment margin decreased to 24.5% due primarily to higher investments in long-term growth opportunities and mix the quarter. Protective & Marine was up high single digits against a low double-digit comparison and has a solid pipeline of projects extending into next year. In Residential Repaint, our prior investments continued to pay off, as we delivered the fifth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit growth in a flat to down market. New Residential also grew at a mid-single-digit rate in a choppy but improving market. Commercial grew by low single digits against a high single-digit comparison. Property Management was flat with continued delays in CapEx projects. DIY remains soft. From a product perspective, interior paint sales grew faster than exterior paint sales where outdoor conditions caused delays in some of our largest regions. We have opened 45 net new stores year-to-date and expect to open 80 to 100 for the full year. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased by high single digits, inclusive of an approximate 4% impact from unfavorable FX. Sales in North America decreased by a high single-digit percentage, where weakness in existing home sales and inflation continue to pressure the DIY market. In Europe, sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage. In Latin America, volume and price were positive, but were more than offset by unfavorable FX. Adjusted segment margin expanded to 22.9%. This was primarily driven by higher fixed cost absorption in the manufacturing and distribution operations within the segment and effective cost control, partially offset by lower net sales. In the Performance Coatings Group, net sales were effectively flat as volume was offset by unfavorable FX. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 18%, primarily due to lower sales in North America and unfavorable FX. This high teens margin level demonstrates the continued strong performance that reflects our differentiated customer solutions and business optimization efforts. We continue to see choppy demand by division and region. Packaging delivered high single-digit growth with sales up in every region. Coil also delivered solid growth, driven by share gains. Industrial Wood grew low single digits, driven by an acquisition. New account wins in Auto Refinish have been masked by softness in our core business where consumer reluctance to pay deductibles is resulting in lower insurance claims. General Industrial continued to face headwinds in heavy equipment and transportation markets. Regionally, sales in the group were positive in all regions except North America, which decreased by a low single-digit percentage. Moving on to our guidance. The slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2024. The deck also includes our updated guidance for consolidated and segment sales for the full year 2024. Our full year diluted net income per share guidance is unchanged. Our adjusted diluted net income per share growth remains at 8.7% over the prior year at the midpoint of our guidance. We are absolutely focused on executing our plan in the fourth quarter and delivering full year EPS results in the range we provided July. I also recognize that many of you are beginning to formulate your views for 2025. While we're not providing any specific guidance until January, I can share some high-level commentary that may be useful as a preliminary framework. The single largest variable heading into next year is the timing and pacing of a true inflection in the demand environment. We stand by our FCP commentary, but it's only a question of when, not if. However, trying to peg this to a specific quarter, let alone a specific month or a week, it's not something we can do with precision. Our forecasting models incorporate a wide variety of indicators, including LIRA, existing home sales, housing starts, housing affordability, interest rates, consumer spending, and industrial production among many others. Direct input from our customers is a critical data point that also informs our outlook. While several signals are beginning to move from red to yellow and some from yellow to green, our initial view is that demand is likely to remain choppy in the first half of the year. What is certain is our strategy. We deliver differentiated solutions that make our customers more productive and more profitable. The good news is that in a macro and a competitive environment like the current one, approach becomes even more valuable to our current customers, while also attracting many new ones. We will continue being very aggressive in pursuit of new business and share of wallet gains. Sherwin-Williams is incredibly well-positioned in each of our targeted end markets. We are confident we will outperform the market in all environments and significantly so when demand becomes more robust. We are committed to driving success by design for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Yes. Let me start. Vincent, appreciate the question. I'm going to hand it to Al here to talk a bit about cadence and timing. But a few things, I think, that that are really important playing out and as you heard in my prepared remarks, I would tell you we see this as the ideal time to invest in our long-term strategy, and candidly, an opportunity to widen the competitive moat. We're going to continue to capitalize on this, making sure that we are best positioned in areas where our competitors aren't even seeing some of these opportunities. So we're not waiting for the market to recover fully or to tell us it's time to invest. We're going to continue to keep our head down and make sure we're getting rewarded for these efforts. We will tell you amount in front of customers often and they're sharing with us that competitors are out-promising some of these investments and making all types of commitments to try mirror what we're doing at Sherwin-Williams. But because we are confident we've got the best assets at the absolute best people in industry and best technology, we're going to continue to lay in these investments now well ahead of the cycle, well ahead of what's coming into next year. And one more comment before I hand this over to Al, I would very much tell you that I would do this 10 out of 10 times. I think there's no doubt about it, we're confident in our strategy, but we are absolutely going to invest, we're going to win and we're going to continue to deliver for our customers. And John, I would add to that as well. I give the team a lot of credit for a continued focus on refining that portfolio. I'll take you back to some of the key decisions that were made over the last few quarters and years relative to the China divestiture some non-strategic aerosol business. There's a handful of categories and businesses that the team absolutely was focused on where we can get strong organic core growth, and we walked away from some of those. So a new and improved baseline going forward. This business we talked about at our Analyst Day has really been by design built for speed and profit. So a leaner, meaner or fighting machine, if you will. So excited for the volume to come back so we can realize that [indiscernible]. Yes, good morning, John. I'll start with your first question relative to some of the competitive moves and then I'll hand this over to Al to talk about your question on PCG. I think you nailed it. And I think, first of all, let me be really clear there are always opportunities. There's certainly been a lot of shift. In fact, the way that we look at this and take you back to some of our focus on believing in our long-term strategy, our differentiation investing ahead of the curve, we do see this as a unique moment in our industry, where we are being laser focused on simply doing what we say we will do. It's amazing. I'm out with customers. The feedback I hear is you guys are consistent, reliable, dependable, it's amazing what a differentiator that is. So we're holding very firm there and making sure that in a down market in an environment where there is a moment in our industry, we're going to invest. It's a hallmark of Sherwin-Williams. I think you're seeing that playing out in real time. But we're always going to continue to look and assess. And if there are opportunities for us to strengthen or accelerate our strategy, we're always open to those reviews. Well, I'll start with -- we're focused, first and foremost, on the quality sales there very consistent, as we've talked about relative to all of our portfolio. We're not interested in commodities. We want to simply focus on the premium segments at value what it is that we do and what we deliver every day. I will tell you maybe a better way -- I don't know if it's a better way or the way that we're framing that same question, David, would be Kelly-Moore, I would characterize as more of a short-term share grab opportunity. PPG, I would characterize as more of a long term where there was a lot of respect for that company and we've got to get out in front of these customers and earn every gallon every day and make sure that they understand when we bring them into Sherwin-Williams that we want to work hard to service them and build a lifelong customer. So in terms of quantifying the exact number, I can tell you it's more about making sure it's the quality sales that we want to earn and keep over time. Mike, I think this is a -- it's a great question. It's a really good example of -- of this idea success by design. I give Justin Binns and his organization, incredible credit here. I mean you've got a lot of changing in the landscape and the team has been head down at the right point, focused on our differentiation, focus on our -- the value that we can create here. So we're not waiting for the market. To Jim's point, when we do see more moderate recovery, we'll absolutely be best positioned to take advantage of that. But the team is not waiting and making sure that we're out solving some of these needs for these contractors and building loyalty with a lot of new contractors coming into this res repaint space, we're primed for a nice run up here to follow as the market does come back. And I'll touch briefly on the customer shutdown piece. The way that we're looking at this, and there have been a few examples of more of a temporary shutdown over the holidays and not a lot of noise outside of that. Could that extend potentially, but we're obviously seeing really close with our customers. Karl Jorgenrud and his organization are making sure to stay in lockstep relative to the true demand environment so that we can be the best partners on the other side. And I just want to add one piece to that. Al said this really well as we think about more of a moderated SG&A profile next year. I also want to articulate and be very clear that no one's head is in the sand here. While we have had a heightened level by design, we absolutely want to get that return. We owe that to our shareholders, and we expect outsized volume growth. We're going to be relentless until we deliver that. Yes. Ghansham, I would say it definitely pertinent by segment. And Jim covered some of that just a few moments ago. I think if you look broadly across in aggregate, there is -- everyone is reading the same macros. Everyone's hoping that these rate cuts are going to have a faster, more material impact. But I think as everyone's pragmatic here and trying to plan for what the reality is into next year, broadly speaking, it is more of a modest back half potential, what I would say is the broad sentiment. You do cut that by segment and Jim alluded to this a bit earlier, where some of these other signals relative to their existing home sales and the like. We're obviously getting a lot more bullish as we have been on Res Repaint. And I would say the Commercial is probably -- the Commercial segment is probably the area where we know that we've got the biggest challenge even throughout the year as some of these projects based on all the reasons you said before, CapEx, labor constraints, kind of live on, I think that's a reality that we're all navigating and I would say, is reflective in our customer sentiment. Yes. Kevin, I'll start with the Refinish piece. And I think one of the reasons -- one of the big reasons that I wanted to highlight this at our recent financial community presentation is exactly what you said. I think some of that is mass. I love how we're positioned here in this business. If you look at Q3, our sales were impacted by negative low mid-single-digit FX and Latin America, we have more exposure there, just given our mix relative to some of our peers, so you would expect that weight to play out. But if we just take the big approach to your point, is it structural and more kind of transitional. We look at this business over time. You're going to see swings quarter-to-quarter, our sales year-to-date, they are down low single digit against a high single-digit comp. So if you exclude FX from that, our sales are flat which is in line with where our competitors are at in their recent calls. So I want to be really clear that we are not satisfied with this year-to-date number, but it is an environment where claims are down double digits in North America, again, which is our largest region. And having said that, as you look at what is working, and we do expect improving claims, share gains to be a tailwind in next year -- the team has done some fantastic work on our collision core program. We're gaining both momentum and adoption here. And I think it's really important that we continue to look at strengthening what we're doing here. out early November of this year with a high single-digit price increase for our direct customers, and we'll be out with others as necessary, but continue to get paid for what we're doing, but confidence that the team is laser-focused on new accounts and share gains, which I think is absolutely sustainable and systemic. If I go to your second question on Packaging, you mentioned the word acceleration. I think that is a perfect word. Again, this is a business I love how we're positioned. Our sales in our third quarter were up high single digits, all of which was volume. So we're positive in all regions, and our volume was actually up low double digits, which was a bit offset by some of our index pricing agreements. We've got some great momentum. The team has done a fantastic job. So while we're flat year-to-date, if you look at the balance of the year, I would expect to see very strong performance in the fourth quarter leading into next year. We've recaptured some of the temporary share loss that we saw from our Garland, Texas plant event, work is not done. The team's heads are down. They're out earning this business every single day, but strong -- when I say strong, very strong line of sight to additional recovery over the next 12 months and many of these customers have -- again I'm out spending time with they're eager to return back to Sherwin-Williams. And I would characterize that as just a better appreciation not only of our technology, but the service that we're providing to these customers is world class. We continue to invest. We believe in our model here. Some recent new wins across other regions, including North America, Latin America and APAC and was just over in our France plant a few weeks ago for ribbon-cutting ceremony and just couldn't be more pleased with the expansion here. This is going to be the backbone of serving our customers as EFSA, as there ban on BPA rolls over into Q2 of 2026 and there's already some customers that are looking at pacing to that beginning in 2025. So I think we're very well positioned where -- certainly where the category and the market is going here. And last, but not least, really excited that we've just added to our capacity. We just closed on our Henkel metal packaging business October 1. So, of course, we're very excited to welcome about 130 employees at our production sites across both Germany and Mexico and the Sherwin family, but big expectations of where this business goes. And Jeff, if I go back to your first question on the elevated SG&A leading towards long-term share gains, which is absolutely the intent. And I just want to free visit, I think you used the language around keeping margins constrained in stores. I would take a different approach there. I think back to Al's earlier comment, when we see these expanded margins, we absolutely want to take advantage of that as an opportunity. So it did give us an opportunity Q3, Q4 to accelerate some of these investments. And I'll take you back to the six priorities that I laid out at our Financial Community presentation, all designed to deliver this above-market growth. So some of the digital priorities that that will absolutely pay off those six priorities, simplification that Al mentioned, helping to make sure our teams have what they need to go faster and add more value to our customers. So it absolutely was by design. And I think an important -- it was opportunistic on our part. Yes, you bet. I'll start with the true value do it best. Certainly, we won't comment on our customer strategies. But I think again, as I go back to the point earlier, this is a bit of a moment in our industry. I think there's been a lot of pressure across the category broadly for the last few years. So we'll continue to work in lockstep with our customers as they make shifts and decisions relative to the brands and the banners. Move on your quality sales question. Within that, there's kind of two prongs to that. One, and I'll go back to my earlier comment, where we want to -- it's in our core DNA. We're not interested in being all things to all people there. So we're not going to play in the commodity spaces where we're not getting paid, we're not returning -- delivering return to our shareholders. What is of interest in those quality sales, certainly by the premium sub-segments that we serve and making sure that we are focused back to Al's point, how do help make them more successful, so premium products, opportunities to upgrade them, so they're getting on and off of job sites faster. They're saving time and money on labour with some of these premium products that or easier to apply, less touch up. So when we look at the quality sales, it's who we're targeting and how we're trying to service those with the right mix of products. And then, Josh, on your -- the question relative to PCG and some of those temporary shutdowns, it's broad-based for sure in the general industrial point more to heavy equipment with some of the ag slowing down. Again, we see this as very much transitory point in time, end of season, and there's no signal yet that, that would be widespread or any signal that, that would be extended at this point. And Steve, on the store side relative to any competitive aggressive pricing, I would say that we typically look at our industry is, by and large, it's a very disciplined industry, which was why we have a lot of confidence when we do come out, we generally take a leadership position as it relates to price. We want to be out first. We want to be transparent with our customers. We want to deliver this in a way to our customer that helps to set them up for success, at a key partner in the bidding season, helping to -- where needed, if needed, coach them through how best to pass that along, so that they understand how to best kind of pass that through. Typically, the cost of the actual cost of the product itself is somewhere between 10%, 12%, 15% and then the balance would be the cost of labor. And so if we're able to do what we've continually focused on, which is at these crews on and off of job sites that ultimately is a positive to make sure that we continue to focus on upselling customers, especially in some of these environments. Have not seen -- we've not seen a lot of activity, I would tell you, because this is an unprecedented moment in our industry. We're certainly paying very close attention. We're staying extremely close to our customers to be competitive in a mix of environments, but we're confident that we're going to hold on to this recent -- this price that we just announced, and we'll be back in our 50 to 60 kind of historic run rate, and we don't plan to come off of that. And if I could, and Adam, Al just nailed it. but I had to jump in here because I go back to this idea of it's not if, it's when. And so this kind of slower longer is playing out in real time, and we are absolutely prepared to manage that situation."

            "content": "Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. As we have typically done, we're managing growth and operating margin, and we expect a higher gross margin in the second half of the year than we forecasted coming into the quarter. So as we normally do and I reaffirm this at our Investor Day, we take some of that improvement invested in the long-term growth opportunities, particularly in Paint Stores Group that Heidi mentioned. And just to reaffirm what I said on our second quarter call, we are confident in our strategy. We have a consistent investment thesis, and I'm confident we'll get a return for those investments that we are making. And we can point to that like in res repaint up mid single digits over the last five quarters, showing the returns that we're getting for the investments we made in the second half, I think your comment is right. If I look at our second half forecast, it's in line, SG&A is in line with where I thought coming into the quarter. So there's a little bit of timing in that. So right in line with what we're expecting for the second half. And then the only other piece on that is the continued investments in our digital initiatives and our system modernizations that we've been undertaking. Yeah, Chris. As Jim talked about, we announced the 5% price increase in stores, effective January 6th. And the reason behind that is we're feeling pressure and increased feedstocks. We have wage inflation, which is more of a typical increase that we're expecting we're expecting in 2025, but also health care to be significantly higher year-over-year. And I think you're right. The price increase is about where we expect it to be. It's offset by mix and we talk about P&M being stronger, DIY being weaker, which weighs on that overall average selling price. I think when you look into 2025, I think we're going to get into this historical range of 50% to 60%, I'd say. And that's really driven by timing of a number of our national account contracts. We fully expect to get increases. But there's also a new competitive dynamics in the North America architectural market, and have to see how that plays out. But we're committed in this -- you know as we have discipline in getting price when we need it and our expectation is we need it. No, John, we did -- the allocation that I talked about in the first quarter and second quarter is the same. Global supply chain with a little bit better volume did perform better in the entire increase and our segment profit was due to that dynamic. If you look at -- on the commercial side, our North America business actually went backwards in PBT because of volume. And that's been a consistent theme over the last three quarters and even into last -- going back to last year. So no real change to the allocation. It's just they performed better. The team -- I give the team a lot of credit. They're managing their costs tightly and operating more efficiently in a more stable demand dynamic with inventory and production. Yes, John, I think, in particular, the consumer, I think inventory levels have been pretty stable. We certainly do not or don't believe that the impact on our sales in the quarter for consumer was due to destocking. I think it's just been a soft -- continued soft DIY market. And I think you alluded to maybe some of the other opportunities -- if there's opportunities for M&A, we certainly take a disciplined approach to that as we always have, and we look at how different assets accelerate our strategy. And if they're in the right segments, in the right regions, then yes, we'll take a look at them. Yes, Patrick. If you look at -- I'll start with the third quarter impact because having two -- it's bad enough having one major hurricane, having two major hurricanes and one in the third quarter, one in the fourth quarter, really adds to the speed of the recovery, and that's what makes it a more uncertain outlook in our fourth quarter and why the higher range. And it's not necessarily just our stores being able to be open. It's the time it takes for customers to get back to work, to assess the damage, homeowners reviewing insurance claims, and the type of damage that will dictate the speed of recovery, if it's flooding versus really structural. And I'd say, historically, we've taken about four weeks before you start seeing your primers start to pick up, sundries start to pick up and then paint that follows, I just think in this environment with the small quarter that we have in our fourth quarter, and the dynamics that we're talking about with two major hurricanes, it's hard to predict the timing of it actually coming back online. The impact for Helene in our third quarter was a little less than 1 point. It's primarily stores. If you exclude the impact of that stores, it'd be pretty right in line with guidance. And then probably cost us about $0.05 in the quarter. We didn't call it out. I think we expect to get those sales back in our fourth quarter. It's just -- it's going to ramp up as the quarter progresses. Yes. Greg, I think when you -- we look at price, we're getting the effectiveness. It's just because you have a lot of different segments and some are performing better than others, it could dilute that price mix because we look at it as price mix in one bucket. And so it's not going to be quite 3% in the quarter. But as we talked about, volume and price are both up low single digits in the third quarter. And as we roll out next year, as an example, as a new res starts to improve like we saw in our third quarter, that mix change versus Res Repaint and DIY is going to dilute some of that price impact. Yes. Yes, Mike, concerning the fourth quarter and we typically don't give detailed guidance, but I would say this, we expect all our operating segments to show margin improvement year-over-year. Obviously, we still expect to see a seasonal slowdown in in architectural sales the fourth quarter that we have historically seen. So, I don't expect to see operating margin expansion in our two architectural businesses. I think as you get into 2025, I think the plan will be very similar to other years. I realized this year because our first half had an outsized growth because of the investments we made in the second half of last year. I think we'll moderate SG&A without giving full guidance today, we'll give a better guidance in our first -- in January, but the expectations are going to be the same. If we believe volume in the second half of the year, and/or gross margin is going to be stronger in the second half of the year. We take advantage of those situations just like we did in the quarter, and we'll put more investments in to accelerate our growth when some of these headwinds that Jim and Heidi have talked about ease up, and we'll take more of a market share than a higher percent of market share as the market turns. Not an impact we've seen thus far. As we've talked about, we continue to invest in products and services that help our customers be more effective, grow their top line and grow their bottom line because of the efficiencies they gain by moving up in quality. And when I talk price, I typically include mix in that, and we're consistently working with our customers to provide better service, to provide supply chain resilience, so that we can be their supplier of choice, second supplier of choice on down. So there are other input costs that we're taking into account, as Jim just mentioned, on why we need the price increase and the discipline we have to go out with price when we need it. On the CapEx, Josh, year-to-date CapEx was $7 billion, including about $415 million of BOF CapEx. And what happens is we get reimbursed because of our financing arrangement for our new headquarters. So we've really net is about $200 million. So core CapEx is $355 million. So we guided to the $700 million less $180 million, gets you into that $520 million, around 2% of sales, which is where we want to be at. That's just the noise in our new buildings. So Steve, on our cost of goods sold decreased, the decrease was primarily due to supply chain efficiencies on our Consumer Brands Group with global production volumes up low single digit with the team doing a nice job of controlling costs. The other impact was FX lower cost of goods sold in the quarter. Those are the two main drivers. On the volume side, stores was up low single digit. We -- Performance Coatings was flattish and then more PCG was more than offset with lower volume in our consumer. Yes. That's exactly what we're seeing. I think, Garik, it's situational with -- as we've talked about, our focus is on driving operating margin. And some years, that's gross margin expansion in other years like 2021 and 2022, it's on SG&A leverage. We're -- as Heidi mentioned, I mean we're really being opportunistic to set ourselves up for when demand returns because our gross margin has been stronger because our global supply chain with a more normal production and inventory cycle this year building inventory leading into the summer selling season. We saw our inventory drop through the third quarter, and we expect to build inventory, architectural inventory in our fourth quarter. That bell curve and being more standard helps us with how we schedule our factories, how we're able to produce the right products at the right time and we get efficiencies out of that, and we're realizing those and taking it taken some of the benefit and putting it into these long-term investments. No. We're -- we absolutely are aiming to -- we'll moderate on the G&A side. I think to help pay for the selling investments because we're confident in our strategy because we've been consistent in our investments and because we know we can get a return on those investments. I think as SG&A -- I'm sorry, as the macro demand environment improves, you will see us get leverage on SG&A going out in the future. It's just not -- going back to -- it's not if, it's when. Because as your volumes start growing and mix improves, you can invest heavy enough to not get leverage on SG&A. So we absolutely are focused on managing gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage at the appropriate time to get our operating margin to grow at a faster pace."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company's Review of Q2 2024 Results and our Outlook for the Q3 and Full-Year of 2024. With us on today's call are Heidi Petz, President and CEO; Allen Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Finance; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U. S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up this session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJim Jaye: Thank you, and good morning. Sherwin-Williams delivered a strong quarter, driven by continued execution continued execution of our strategy and with little help from what continues to be an uneven global macroeconomic environment. Led by Paint Stores Group, consolidated sales were within our guided range, gross margin expanded and diluted earnings per share and EBITDA grew by double-digit percentages. Margin improved sequentially and year-over-year in all three reportable segments. We continue to make progress on our enterprise priorities and we are clearly seeing returns from the heightened investments made in the back half of last year and which have now annualized. We also maintained our disciplined capital allocation approach during the quarter, returning $613 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases an increase of 57% year-over-year. Our second quarter performance ends our first half on a strong note and coupled with our current visibility into the back half of the year, we are increasing our full year earnings outlook. We remain highly focused on executing our strategy, demonstrating our value proposition to win new accounts and increased share of wallet, and taking advantage of disruptions in the market. We are well positioned to deliver in the current environment and highly confident that our actions and investments will result in even stronger performance when end market demand eventually becomes more robust. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will comment on our second quarter results by segment before moving on to our outlook and your questions.\nHeidi Petz : Thank you, Jim. First, I want to thank all 65,000 of our employees around the world for their efforts in the quarter and for their ongoing passion for our company and for our customers. I continue to be humbled and inspired by all that you do. I believe our second quarter results demonstrate three things: One, we have the right strategy. Two, our team continues to execute and adapt. And three, we continue to see returns from our ongoing investments in the business. At the same time, we're not content with where we are by any means and our team understands that we must continue to operate with determination and urgency. We're delivering strong results in a choppy demand environment while executing on initiatives that will put our customers and our company in position for even greater sustained success. As far as specifics on the second quarter, I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group where sales increased by mid-single digits against a double-digit comparison. Volume and price were both up low-single digits. As we expected, price realization improved as the quarter progressed. Segment margin increased to 25.1%, driven by higher sales and moderating raw material costs. Pro sales were led by residential repaint which was up by a mid-single digit percentage. Strong evidence that we are continuing to take share in a down market. We're clearly seeing a return here from the investments in dedicated sales reps we made in the back half of last year. New residential returned to growth in the quarter as we are seeing improving single family starts turn to completion. Commercial grew by low-single digits against a double-digit comparison. Property management was down less than 1% with continued delays in CapEx projects. Protective and marine was up mid-single digits against a low-20s comparison. And while we acknowledge that there have been project delays, we feel very good about the pipeline. DIY increased low-single digit increased compared to a high-teens comp. From a product perspective, interior paint sales grew faster than exterior paint sales. We have opened 26 net new stores year-to-date and expect to open 80 to 100 for the full year. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group, sales underperformed our expectations in a market that was softer than we anticipated. Lower volume, the impact of the China architectural divestiture and unfavorable currency translation were partially offset by selling price increases primarily in Latin America. Sales in North America decreased by a high-single digit percentage where weakness in existing home sales remains a headwind. Inflation, depleted savings and household debt also continue to pressure consumers who currently appear to be spending their modest available discretionary dollars elsewhere. We understand where we are in this cycle and eventually expect to see an upturn in DIY demand. We're confident that we are well positioned with our growing partnerships over the long-term. Outside of North America, sales decreased by a high-single digit percentage in Latin America and a double-digit percentage in Europe. Adjusted segment margin expanded to 26.1%. This was primarily driven by improvements in manufacturing and distribution fixed cost absorption within the segment and moderating raw material costs partially offset by net sales that were below expectations and higher employee related costs. In the Performance Coatings Group, modest sales growth was driven by an acquisition which was partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Adjusted segment margin improved to 19.4%. This continued strong margin performance reflects our ability to drive our customer success in end markets that value differentiation. It also reflects the ongoing hard work of our team to optimize this business. We continue to see choppy demand by division and region. Industrial wood led the growth including the impact of an acquisition. Coil also delivered solid growth driven by share gains. Auto refinish was up low-single digits in North America and down less than 1% overall. Share gains are offsetting softness in our core business where consumer reluctance to pay deductibles is resulting in lower insurance claims. Packaging was down less than expected and we have a good line of sight to improvement in the back half of the year. General industrial demand was lower in all regions. Heavy equipment and transportation were down more significantly, while energy infrastructure was a bright spot. Regionally, sales in the group were down low-single digits in North America, but positive in other regions. Moving on to our guidance for the third quarter and full year, it's clear that the macroeconomic environment has been softer for longer than many economists anticipated at the start of the year. We don't expect to get material help from the market in our back half. We are unwilling to simply accept these conditions and you can count on us to continue being very aggressive in our pursuit of new business and share of wallet gains. Sherwin-Williams have incredibly well positioned in each of our targeted end markets. Comparisons ease in our second half, competitive dynamics are a tailwind and we are confident share gains will become more apparent over time as market conditions improve. As for our specific outlook, the slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the third of 2024. For the full year 2024, consolidated sales are expected to be up a low-single digit percentage compared to our previous guide of up low- to mid-single digits. Full year sales guidance for the Paint Stores Group and the Performance Coatings Group remain unchanged. We have reduced our Consumer Brands Group guidance meaningfully following the softer than expected first half and continued weak demand in the North American DIY market. We are increasing our full year earnings guidance given our better than expected results in the second quarter. The midpoint of our previous guidance now becomes the low end of our revised guidance. On an adjusted basis, we are now guiding diluted EPS in the range of $11.10 to $11.40 a share, an increase of 8.7% at the midpoint over the prior year. As we have often said, should our sales prove to be better than we are currently anticipating, we would expect EPS to be better. Our slide deck also provides guidance on our expectations for raw material costs and other items helpful for modeling purposes. As we enter our second half, we know that we are not immune from choppy market conditions. This leads us to focus even more intensely on our strategy. In periods of uncertainty and competitive disarray, customers are looking to Sherwin-Williams for consistency, reliability, dependability and differentiated solutions that will drive their productivity and their profitability. We have a deep and experienced team that knows how to do just that. We believe in success by design and we do expect to win. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'd be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is from Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews : Heidi, could you talk to us a little bit about the quarter in paint stores? It seems like 2Q, not unlike 1Q, had at least a month where there were some challenging weather conditions that probably pushed some volume out. So could you talk a little bit about whether the quarter progressed, you started to make up a little bit of 1Q and then maybe May hit and got a little challenging? And what are your customers saying in terms of where their backlogs are as a result of this? And what are you baking in, in terms of being able to make up some of this push out in the back half of the year?\nHeidi Petz : I'm going to -- I'll start here and then hand it over to Al to give a little bit of commentary as well, but I think you characterized it well. I think if you look across segments here, certainly there were some challenge. We don't hide behind weather. We're also obviously not immune to having to make sure that we've got the right paint and application conditions for our contractors, which ultimately benefits our customers and our shareholders in the long run. But let me be really clear about the controllables and where we are laser focused here. If you look by segment, starting with residential repaint, we mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but very confident that we're going to continue to take market share as you've seen over the last few quarters, especially to your point in Q2 where we're posting up mid-single digits in a down market. I would expect to continue to see us doing that. I think it's also a clear signal that we're getting a return on the investments that you'll remember we laid in last year. So by design, we often talk success by design is a great example of how that's playing out in stores. And, it's worth repeating this segment, there's incredible upside as it relates to market share opportunity. My time out in the field with our team and our customers gives me a lot of confidence that what we're doing is working and we're getting a lot of positive feedback from even our new customers, ultimately helping them make more money. That is the reason we're in this. If I then take you over to new residential, again, Q1 to Q2, I'm going to let Al kind of come in and give a little bit of color commentary. But we are encouraged by the growth that we're seeing here. Single family starts are turning to completions. I have been personally spending a lot of time with our builders and the team here and they're ultimately after optimizing cycle time and profitability. So our opportunity, not only do we see momentum here in the back half, we look at that as some solid tailwind but I'm very confident that we are, I would say, best positioned in our industry, specifically within this segment as the market recovers. If I move on to property management, I think we all have seen this interest rates certainly have put this segment on pause both in new construction and renovation. But we're not waiting here. And Vincent, I think this is an area where much like new residential, the teams are hard at work demonstrating our value and securing additional exclusive agreements with plenty of opportunity ahead for us. So we're going to be continuing to focus on helping our customers manage through this pause. We got a lot of discipline in these management companies as they're really taking a look at understanding how to prioritize their investments and helping them try to upgrade older properties, competing with new properties and the like.\nAllen Mistysyn : And so the only thing I would add is just to take a quick look at the second quarter, up 3.5% compared to a strong low-double digit comparison last year. Volume was up low-single digits. Price was up low-single digits, and I would say it was probably slightly below where our expectations were as we were coming into the second quarter, but we exited the second quarter at our targeted run rate, which leads to the second half, third quarter and second half guidance to be similar up low to mid-single digits and that'd be really just broken out between price up low-single digits and volume up low-single digits with as a reminder, we talked about Res Repaint being up at the high end of that range in our second quarter that happened and we expect the same in our second half.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research.\nChris Parkinson: When we take a step back and think about your longer term gross margin opportunity, there's still a lot of moving parts and perhaps some things in the housing market which are out of your control. But when we break down volume, price raws versus labor, and just kind of all the other things that could affect that outlook, how should the investment community be thinking about that, not even for the second half of '24, but \u201825, \u201826 onwards based on all the initiatives including investments you've already been doing?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Chris, this is Al again. I appreciate the question, but we're not going to talk to that specifically that long-term target today. I think FCP gives us -- within the next 30 days gives us a really good opportunity to talk about each of the financial metrics and the targets longer term. And today I think we want to focus on the strong second quarter that we delivered in a tough market environment and also with our second half -- our full year beat and raise for the EPS -- adjusted EPS.\nOperator: Your next question for today is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: Congrats on the strong results. Maybe if I could just get your thoughts on how to frame the share gain opportunity as you look into '25 and \u201826. Obviously, there's a couple competitors who are going through some of their own changes and maybe that could benefit you guys. I think there's a perception that, that's on the several hundred million dollars of potential gains for PCG. Is that correct? And when you do onboard those customers, you talked about new customers earlier, what's the margin profile look like? I know that there's been traditionally, kind of get them up and get them going and get them further up the mix line mentality. Does that still prevail? Maybe you can just kind of frame some of those thoughts for us.\nHeidi Petz : Let me start with your last question, in terms of new customers coming in. Yes, this is certainly positive mix for us. So new customers, existing customers in this segment tend to value more of the premium product premium experience that we provide. So I would say that that's a fair characterization across the segment. Obviously, we won't get into any \u201825 certainly not any \u201826 outlook, but what I would tell you is the confidence in the momentum that we have here relative to the run up we're already experiencing in a few segments. And again, I'll go back to this idea of success by design, the luxury of a very tenured management team that is very astute when it comes to reading market indicators and signals. So, the timing in which we're laying these investments in, at the right point in the cycle, so that we are best positioned for the run up. Res paint is a great example. I point to automotive refinish, is another really good example where you can see, I know you asked specifically about stores, but that same discipline, holds across the portfolio. So we're seeing some positive signals from a market share standpoint. I'm very proud of that team and that organization is as you well know that automotive refinish model very similar to our stores model and our ability to have direct relationships with these customers and end users puts us in a really unique position. So, while we're still putting in the investments here, we've got record high installs. And candidly, I would say that not everyone's getting the penetration and the acceleration that we're seeing. But that's another example outside of stores, but Al, let you pick up anywhere else you want to jump in here.\nAllen Mistysyn : I think some of the things you're seeing in the market, and I think we've talked directly about this Kelly-Moore is a more immediate opportunity, more typically -- basically because of the type of customers that they were supporting at Res Repaint and they're out of business. And I think we've talked about taking more than our fair share and we see that in our districts out in the West Coast in California. I think PCG, we'll see what happens but longer -- maybe more mid-term, longer term opportunities. And it all goes back to this consistent investment thesis that we've talked about, we're very confident in our strategy. We know that the investments that we're making are paying off and I point to Res Repaint being up mid-single digits each of the last three quarters in a down market. And then Chris alluded to this on the previous question about mix shifts. And it really is about getting customers in understanding the services and products we offer that allow them to make more money. The products and services that get them to be more efficient to get on and off jobs faster, grow their top-line and their bottom line, it really drives that customer loyalty.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.\nJeff Zekauskas : Could you talk about your regional performance in paint stores? And once you're done with your R&D capital expenditures and some plant expansions, should your normal capital expenditures be between -- be under $500 million?\nAllen Mistysyn : I'll take the second one on CapEx. And as you know, we are very consistent in our capital allocation philosophy. After you get past the building our future projects, which as a reminder will help us attract and retain world class talent to allow us to continue to drive above market growth, ROS and RONA improvements and drive strong cash flow. And then we'll take that cash flow and we'll target CapEx below 2%. So depending on where the growth rates are, we may have years where we have to add capacity and I'll point specifically to the packaging capacity that we've come online with into our new France with the idea we have a lot of confidence in our market share opportunities there. We continue to build out our Statesville architectural plant net capacity again with our confidence in our growth opportunities both in the Southeast on the architectural paint stores and I would argue in consumer brands group that's facing some short-term headwinds, but certainly a lot of confidence in the outlook. And then we will keep the dividend at approximately 30% of prior EPS and then absent acquisitions we will buy our stock back.\nJim Jaye : And Jeff, this is Jim. From a regional perspective on stores, we don't typically give too much commentary, but I would tell you that in this current quarter, our Southwest division was the leader in the clubhouse. And I'd point out too that that was an area where we've seen one of our competitors close their doors. And so you can read that a little bit as some of the share gains that we've been talking about.\nOperator: Your next question is from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty : So on the gross margin front, you put up this [488] number really high despite some soft volumes. I guess, was the bulk of this price versus raws in terms of the improvement? And if not, how should we be thinking about some of the efficiency and some of the simplicity measures that you've been making? Because obviously, volumes really didn't drive this one entirely. So I guess, how should we be thinking about the big drivers there?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, John, we had a couple of things driving our better gross margin performance in the quarter. Moderating raw materials, certainly is part of that. The price realization that we saw in the second quarter being better than what we saw in the first quarter, along with mix. We did have some global supply chain efficiencies outside of the higher fixed cost absorption that we have talked about in the first quarter, again, was really the entire driver of the consumer brand improvement in the second quarter. But you also have our Paint Stores Group growing faster than the other segments. We've talked about that as that happens, that a higher gross margin it will drive our mix better and continue to drive our gross margin. And really carry that momentum into the second half. And I do expect to see gross margin expansion in the second half, maybe not as much as we saw in the first half, driven by higher Paint Stores Group sales Res Repaint being at the high end of that range. We're going to see moderating raw material costs. But we also should see better price effectiveness in our second half versus our first half. So continuation of what we've seen in the first half, just not as heavy because of the raw material tailwind won't be as high. .\nHeidi Petz : And then, John, I would add to that, you lay in additional volume when we're not in such a choppy environment and that's only going to help continue to stretch us.\nOperator: Your next question for today is from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison : Just curious, I think your outlook for the stores was market demand not getting better in the second half. What do you think happens if demand gets worse? Or do you see that as a possibility? I mean would your share gains actually accelerate in that environment? And then -- more importantly, how are the colors for the Guardian selling these days? I would hope really well.\nHeidi Petz : Well, I'll start with the first question. You know what, I think, first and foremost, we have to be prepared for any environment, which is why we're taking a very realistic approach within a choppy environment. But I think as you look by segment is where some of those answers lie. So in terms of Res Repaint, again, we've continued to talk about this because by design, this is an area of incredible market share gain opportunity for us. And I think we've demonstrated that in a down market, we've continued to take share. So I think that's a really good litmus test of how we will operate in the down market. Having said that, as we -- without repeating what we did cover in the prepared remarks, we're going to be very thoughtful where we see the indicators that are driving growth by segment and make sure that we're pacing our investments to what that growth looks like.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes. Mike, the only thing I'd add to that is if you look at our second half guide for Paint Stores, it's in line with what we expected coming into the year with Res Repaint outperforming, commercial property maintenance about where we thought new res certainly improving in the second half. And then P&M with the delayed projects was maybe a little bit softer, but certainly not too far outside our guide or our expectations coming into the year. I missed the Guardian question other than they're not hitting the baseball and they're not going to win it.\nJim Jaye : Still in first place, though, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question is from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten : Just curious if you can give some color on how the Pros Who Paint business performs relative to the overall segment in the quarter?\nHeidi Petz : Yes, the -- certainly, we're continuing to be a bit under pressure here, just in North America. Pros Who Paint continues to be a really important segment for us. As you know, this is a segment that we've also continued to talk about making sure that we're investing at the right point to continue to partner with our retailer customers relative to reps and all the other things that we think are really important in this segment. Al, I know we had talked about a little bit on the Pro Who Paints and you were going to jump in on some color commentary relative to outlook. I think there's a balance here in terms of making sure that we're working in lockstep with our strategic partners.\nAllen Mistysyn : I just think that the -- when you look at some of the leading indicators that we're following LIRA, we expect to bottom out here in the third quarter and improve in the fourth quarter. And even and that's made up of the higher ticket projects and the lower ticket projects. And I think what we've seen in the past is if you're not remodeling a kitchen, you still have to feed your family. So you revert to maybe some smaller ticket projects to fill in those gaps, and that's what we expect to see going through the second half. Clearly, DIY is where we're seeing the most pressure through the first half and into the second half. And this is why I think the investment -- we're confident in that Pro Who Paint strategy, the investments we made and our ability to get a return on that. And we're looking longer term. We're not looking just to run for the second half of this year. We're looking out '25 and '26 and being best positioned to gain share as that channel and piece of -- segment of the channel comes back.\nHeidi Petz : Adam, one piece I want to add in here, and Al said this, I think, really well. But the Pros Who Paint strategy is a critical part of our strategy. We are very confident this is going to create not just a nice financial but a strategic win for our shareholders. This is a segment that we are just not set up to serve in our stores organization. It is a segment that has high growth high-margin opportunity, and it's strategically very important that in our strategic partnerships that we also have access to this important and growing segment.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Leithead with Barclays.\nMichael Leithead : Just on your income statement, you recorded a $32 million other income net in the quarter, which is a bit large versus prior year last quarter. What is that? And is that allocated to the administrative segment or one of the businesses?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. When you look at that line specifically, and it's really the move in FX goes through there. You know what Mike, what I just address is all the other general other income. We did see credits in the quarter environmental FX and then gain on sales. If you look at it net year-over-year versus it's about a $0.12 tailwind. We did have a higher effective tax rate, which was a headwind of about net $0.07. So if you net those out, we're still up a low double-digit percentage. Not expecting that size of credits going through our second half, even though as expected coming into the year, a beat on non-operating costs year-over-year in our second half was expected. I still expect that because we had some higher environmental and some other charges in our second half last year that I'd expect environmental and other income lines to get back in line as it typically has been in the past.\nOperator: Your next question for today is from Patrick Cunningham with Citi.\nPatrick Cunningham : I'm curious on your outlook for the key performance coatings verticals. Where do you see underlying markets trending in the back half? And where do you see the most upside from share gain opportunities?\nHeidi Petz : Yes, Patrick, I'll start with that. Let me first start at the portfolio level. I think if you look across PCG in total, our margin performance is demonstrating the value that we're delivering. And those that are value what we do, which is helping them make more money or certainly rewarding us for some of these share gains. So if I look at kind of by division here, packaging, I'll start here. We're gaining share outside of the U.S. And per our second half guide, we do expect the progress to continue relative to United States. If you look within packaging, there's -- we know that the technology that we bring to the market is unique. We know it's solving a lot of issues for our customers and our brand owners. We're putting some investment, as you know, into new capacity, preparing for this growth, and we're confident that we're going to continue to see a run up here. Coil is a really good example of our strategy at work. We're winning. We're taking share, and I would attribute that to the team and their excellent execution at the fastest response time delivering customizable solutions, very consistent quality and we've got our tech service team there to support production. I hit on auto refinish, so I won't repeat that. And we did mention industrial wood. As you look certainly with new residential improvements, we would expect that to be a potential tailwind for us in the back half, still choppy, but we're building on a good foundation as we've been up last quarter in all regions.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.\nKevin McCarthy : A two-part question for you on DIY demand. First, could you just speak in general terms about how you would expect your professional contractor sales versus DIY sales to trend in the stores moving forward? And then the second part would be, if I look at your DIY flowing through company owned stores, it's comfortably positive year-to-date. And in the consumer segment, of course, DIY has been quite challenged well into the red. Can you talk about that disparity? And what are the, I don't know, two or three most important reasons behind that?\nHeidi Petz : Yes. It's a good observation, Kevin. And I think you've characterized that well. We often talk about this segment, it's having slightly two different segments. If you think about the DIY consumer in our stores, they're looking for that specialty paint store experience and candidly expect the service that goes along with that, little bit less sensitive in the current macro. The DIY that prefers a home center environment tends to be more value conscious and is certainly feeling the pressure as we talked about prepared remarks early relative to inflation, depleted savings and household debt. So those pressures are very real for that consumer. Having said that, I do want to kind of run right at this question because this is an area that I would tell you, we absolutely do not have our heads in the sand relative to our performance in DIY and certainly relative to our expectations, in the segment. This is a very important segment for us over the long-term. Al referenced that earlier as part of our overall architectural strategy. And when you look at the importance of making sure that we are well positioned here, we understand that there are cycles, certainly in the DIY consumer space. Fundamental belief that we're in a log jam in housing that is going to free up. And so our focus on ensuring we are best positioned with the best strategic partners including our exclusive and growing partnership with Lowe's, among others. So as the market begins to recover, we're very confident in our ability that we will continue to deliver above-market growth. But again, our heads are not in the sand right now and we're going to be laser focused on making sure that we are locked up with our partners.\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin, the comment on DIY through our Paint Stores Group, but part of that is the price increases or the price increase that we took in our stores that is certainly impacting the DIY customer as well as the Pro.\nOperator: Your next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGregory Melich : I'd love to follow-up on two things. First, understanding volume price mix and FX, both in the second quarter and what's implied from your back half guide?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Greg, if you look at our second quarter with our sales up 0.5% volume and price were up slightly, acquisitions at less than 1%. And we also had the headwind of the divestitures and FX. But really the driver in the quarter was our Paint Stores Group up 3.5%, both segment that segment of PCG segment was where we expected, and we talked about the miss on consumer. If I look at the second half, kind of a little bit up low-single-digits guide compared to low-single-digit comparison last year. I think price is expected to be up low-single-digit percentage. And when you look at -- that would tell you that volume is expected to be up or down low-single-digits. And then all the other impacts are, I'd say, immaterial, less than 1%. FX is unfavorable. A little bit of tailwind in acquisitions and again, a little bit of a headwind on the divestitures, but not material. I'd call out Paint Stores Group, just to be clear, and I said this before, second half, we expect volume and price to be up low-single-digits. Consumer down high single to low-double digits, really the continued softness in DIY. We do expect the price to be flat and that's primarily increases we see in Latin America. FX will be a headwind of about [1.5] and then the remainder is volume down high-single-digits and then within PCG for the second half, I expect up low-single-digits. Acquisitions will be a tailwind of the low-single-digits and then FX, about 1% headwind in price because of the small number of accounts we have on index will actually be a small headwind.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.\nGhansham Panjabi : On the slide deck and also in your prepared comments, you alluded to consumer affordability impacting portions of your business such as Consumer Brands and also parts of Performance Coatings, I think you cited ought to refinish as it relates to deductibles. Switching to the Paint Stores segment, are your customers citing incremental issues as it relates to the same consumer affordability dynamic relative to the baseline of what you've already seen over the last 18 months or so?\nHeidi Petz : Ghansham, I would characterize it maybe a little bit differently that there are always going to be value conscious, I would say, more so than focused on maybe the true price affordability piece. And so it's incumbent upon us that every day we are doing what we say we will do is delivering a consistent, reliable service disease, more discerning and very habitual contractors that candidly just expect that from us. And so making sure that we're delivering that value every day, I think, is clearly on display for us and it changes their understanding, we are not having price conversations with them. We're talking about helping them grow their business and helping them make more money.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.\nStephen Byrne : Can you help me understand what led to the higher fixed cost absorption in consumer? Your volumes were down year-over-year. And Al, you mentioned improved efficiencies. What was there an operating rate improvement that in spite of lower volumes that led to that lower cost structure? Can you quantify that for us?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. Steve, as I talked about on our first quarter call, this is consistent with our first quarter. We talked about the choppiness in production volumes that we experienced over the last four or five years and updating our cost our standards to match those higher costs on the conversion side. I talked about this at SCP last year that, that's really been a drag on our Consumer Brands Group. And we thought we could get efficiencies out -- to offset those costs, so we wouldn't have to do a reset to our standard costs like we did coming into this year. It's really not an impact on our overall gross margin because it is offset between Paint Stores Group and Performance Coatings Group, both of which I said on our first quarter call, we're not going to detail that out. We don't think it's material. And you can certainly see that with our Performance Coatings Group performance up to 19.4%, which is an all-time high first half is 18.3% an all-the-time high. And then certainly, we see the improvement in our Paint Stores Group. So you're going to see that phenomenon continued through the second half, I did call out that the entire improvement in Consumer Brands Group operating profit is due to those higher fixed cost absorption really partially offset by a decline in profits when you look at it related to the volume -- sales volume, North America DIY sales volume shortfall that we experienced in the second quarter. So like I said, we're going to continue down this path. My expectation is we'll get more consistent. Think of it as a base to build off into the future on consumer operating margin.\nOperator: Your next question for today is from Josh Spector with UBS.\nJosh Spector : So I wanted to ask on Res Repaint. It's obviously been a source of strength for you this year. I mean in the event that you don't really get any improvement in housing turnover next year or maybe it ticks down. I'd be curious if you'd characterize if you want to think about either your backlog or your opportunity to win in that scenario, basically meaning have we been perhaps still over-earning from a slew of projects coming completion with lower turnover or is that a zero or low risk in your view relative to the market? .\nHeidi Petz : I think it's zero. I mean, I think, Josh, it's a good question. I think the health of those backlog is real. And certainly, we're making the right investments at the right time to ensure that we're well positioned. When you talk about kind of the source of strength here, there's certainly opportunity to take share across the market. This has been an area of strength for us because we understand how to do something. I truly believe that no one can do with this segment. And I take it back to the controlled distribution model that we have. So not only are we investing and laying in reps at the right pace in the right geographies, but we're arming these reps with the world's largest database of painting contractors were laser focused on from day 1, ensuring they have the tools, the understanding what they need to go in and help our contractors to grow their business, to travel to be more successful. So when I think about success in this space and the upside, I don't think that there's a finish line here. We've got -- we're early innings in my opinion here, and we've got a lot of upside.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners.\nMichael Harrison : Another question on the Performance Coatings Group. You said that in the general industrial portion of that business, demand was lower across all regions. Can you kind of walk us through those regions and comment on how things are trending, your expectations for the second half? I guess, are there some signs of improvement in any regions or at least lapping some prior year weakness in general industrial?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, I would say on the -- I'd say on the positive side, starting with that, you do see less of a slowdown in North America. And let me take a step back. It all starts with share gains in this type environment, share gains, share of wallet and differentiation. I think North America will be less of a headwind. I think Europe, again, is we don't expect a lot coming out of Europe in the second half. We do expect Latin America and Asia to -- I'm sorry, Asia Pacific to be positive, more so in Asia against a really soft comp but Latin America holding up. So I think across the regions, North America, as you know, is our largest region across all of PCG and do expect it to moderate as we get through the second half.\nHeidi Petz : And Mike, I think to the team's credit, I would say our focus here, given the fundamentals of the core has been laser focused on new account growth. And I would tell you that that's holding up better than the market. So the team is focused on the right activities here to offset some of the pressure.\nOperator: Your next question is from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs.\nDuffy Fischer : If I could, just a clarification. Al, I thought you said that pricing didn't do as well in the second quarter as you had hoped. Can you just kind of walk us through of the 5% that you announced earlier this year? You kind of usually talked about 60% being realized within a year. How do we trend from where we're at now to getting to that, let's say, 3% of your 5%?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Duffy, we mentioned that the price increase effectiveness improved as the quarter went on, and we exited the quarter at our targeted effectiveness rate. So I would expect to see that kind of realization. We have built into our forecast that kind of realization, low-single-digit and then volume low-single-digit in the second half. .\nOperator: Your next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter : Heidi, can you talk to the cadence of earnings in the back half of the year? And specifically on CBG margins, Al were you implying that they would be up in Q3 versus Q2?\nAllen Mistysyn : No, David, I didn't mean to imply that if that's the way it was taken. It really -- where we're at from an operating margin standpoint within CBG, it will be dependent on where we're at in the sales range and what volume does through the quarter and really through the second half. As you know, we still will expect to see a seasonal architectural slowdown in our fourth quarter. But whether we see sequential improvement in our operating margin, it's really going to depend on sales -- North America DIY sales volume.\nOperator: Your next question is from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov : Al, I wanted to follow-up on your CBG comment that you made earlier that this is the margin level you can build on. So if we think about 2025 or 2026, can we think of this low 20s operating margin plus some volume levers, perhaps in the pace of recovery? So this could be a mid to high-20 margins with volume leverage? Or are there any offsets and perhaps some part of this margin story is not sustainable longer term?\nAllen Mistysyn : No. Like, we have talked in the past, our expectation for Consumer Brands, operating margin is high teens, low 20s. And certainly, we challenge our group and divisions to continue to raise that bar. Volume is the #1 driver of operating margin performance in all our segments, as you well know, and that clearly showed itself in 2020 during the pandemic when we had really strong volumes in consumer out-the-door sales, that drove the operating margins higher. And I would expect that as we continue -- as we see a turn in the market and we start seeing volume to grow, we'll get leverage on that volume.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Roberts with Mizuho.\nJohn Roberts : DIY is mostly interior, I think. So was it unusual for interior to outgrow exterior this quarter? Or was that the weather effect and painters switched to interior when the weather is unfavorable?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. John, I think that's the case. They'll work on jobs where they have the opportunity and they have just lined up. I'll use Res Repaint six \u2013 eight weeks backlogs in advance so they can take advantage of really good weather and do exterior projects. And then again, if it's a wet rainy week, they can pivot and move to interior products -- projects.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.\nChuck Cerankosky : Nice quarter. You explained the price sensitivity of customers purchasing architectural in the CBG group, why does not extend to residential projects in the Paint Stores Group? I know some of those projects are bigger and maybe higher end, but you seem to clearly buck that trend in the Paint Stores Group.\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. I think Chuck, within consumer, we've talked about a different kind of DIY customer and that's where the bulk of the volume is they are more sensitive to inflation, the amount of debt they have. You look at some of those headwinds that Heidi talked about in her opening remarks. It's less so on the DIY side in our stores. And like we talked about, there is a price impact on DIY in our stores. And I think if you look at our Pro, specifically in Res Repaint, we've mentioned this. I think the teams have done a really good job about driving new business through our stores to drive that mid-single-digit growth over the last three quarters in a down market. So it's not that the Res Repainters are immune or those end consumers are immune to higher cost, it's just we continue to take share because of the investments we've continually made and being very consistent about that.\nHeidiPetz: I think it also points to the value of a specialty paint store model, which is certainly on the DIY side, an expectation of premium product, but it is an equally high expectation of that premium service and the willingness to pay for that service and the homeowner color selection, all of the things that go along with us being innovating in and out of the can is a great example of a consumer that values that type of solution.\nOperator: Your next question is from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois : I wanted to ask about raw materials. How much were raws down in 2Q and is flat in the back half of the year, still a good assumption. I think that was the outlook previously.\nAllen Mistysyn : So raws, the basket was down mid-single digits year-over-year in the second quarter. And for the full year, we're still picking or saying that the full year will be down low singles. So that tells you the back half is flattish year-over-year.\nOperator: Your next question is from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard : A question on revenue in two different areas, if I could. The consumer mix, just curious versus 90 days ago, what is so different that is driving the magnitude of the shortfall there? And then on the store side, I'm curious on Res Repaint, the market down and you up mid-single digit. I'm just curious to dive into both of those a little bit, if you would, in terms of the momentum of the market into the back half and then the ability to sustain the magnitude of the share gains of up five in the down market?\nHeidi Petz : So let me start with your first question on the revenue, the CBG mix or kind of what's changed in 90 days. And I would simply put it as -- again, we said this in the prepared remarks, but characterizing this as it's just simply been softer longer. If you look at just the DIY North America market being under pressure. So the fundamentals are not -- have not recovered at the pace that we'd like to see. As it relates to stores and Res Repaint, sustainability of our performance there being up mid-single digits in a down market. I would point to a few things, again, on the fundamentals. First and foremost, it's the segment where we have the greatest upside. So the market share gain runway is material. I would also point to, again, going back to the investments that we have made. And as our team is watching the market very closely and we know the indicators to watch. We'll get as aggressive as we need to be and as realistic as we need to be based on what we see in the market. So our ability to ramp that up. I think we've proven that we can respond pretty quickly to be best positioned for that upside.\nOperator: Your next question is from Aron Ceccarelli with Berenberg.\nAron Ceccarelli : I have a question on Res Repaints. Maybe can you talk a little bit about the profitability of new accounts as you continue to bear market share. If I understood correctly before, you mentioned that usually new accounts came at premium, so the higher margin. I was a little bit surprised. So I would like to ask if you can maybe dig a little bit more into that? And how this should pan out as your market share gains continue?\nHeidi Petz : Yes. Let me start with that, just based on my earlier comment. If you kind of picture a bell curve of a new Res Repaint contractor coming in new versus kind of a more mature Res Repaint contractor, where we've earned over time, more share of wallet. My comment is relative to kind of first and foremost, making sure that we're getting them in and getting them set up on the right products. So when we talk about making sure our customers are making more money, oftentimes there, and that is a conversation of getting them in the right premium product that's helping them get their crews on and off the job site faster, less touch up required. So when you look at the total cost of a project, they're making more money. So making sure that we're helping our teams to help set our customers up for success at the very beginning. And then again, along that bell curve, where there's more maturity of this particular contractor, they could be bigger in size, they may be traveling our teams are meeting them exactly where they are and helping them if they're looking to travel and grow work from store to store or repo playing the role proactively help set them up again and then we're able to leverage our data and our database to put our reps in position to help these contractors kind of optimize what it is their how they're leaning in on us for products, services, all of our digital tools, et cetera.\nOperator: Your next question is from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.\nLaurence Alexander : Just very quickly, will your raw materials in your base case? Will your raw material cost be up year-over-year in Q4?\nAllen Mistysyn : Flattish.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye for closing remarks.\nJim Jaye : Thank you, Heidi, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I think you heard today that while the macro is certainly very choppy, we're very confident in our strategy. We're very well positioned and we're acting to continue outperforming the markets. The global team is aligned and we're focused on our strategy of driving that profitable growth by providing solutions for our customers. Today, you heard we've increased our full year guidance. And as Heidi mentioned, and we've often said, if our sales do prove to be better than what we've outlined today, we would expect our bottom line performance to be better as well. I'll close with, I just want to remind everyone, we have our financial community presentation, which is scheduled for August 29 in Boston starting at 1:30. You'll hear from Heidi, Al and other members of our management team, along with our typical Q&A session. So you can register for that on our IR website or feel free to e-mail our Investor Relations team. They'll also be webcast, and that date again is August 29. So with that, I will thank you again for your interest in Sherwin, and have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Heidi Petz",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. First, I want to thank all 65,000 of our employees around the world for their efforts in the quarter and for their ongoing passion for our company and for our customers. I continue to be humbled and inspired by all that you do. I believe our second quarter results demonstrate three things: One, we have the right strategy. Two, our team continues to execute and adapt. And three, we continue to see returns from our ongoing investments in the business. At the same time, we're not content with where we are by any means and our team understands that we must continue to operate with determination and urgency. We're delivering strong results in a choppy demand environment while executing on initiatives that will put our customers and our company in position for even greater sustained success. As far as specifics on the second quarter, I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group where sales increased by mid-single digits against a double-digit comparison. Volume and price were both up low-single digits. As we expected, price realization improved as the quarter progressed. Segment margin increased to 25.1%, driven by higher sales and moderating raw material costs. Pro sales were led by residential repaint which was up by a mid-single digit percentage. Strong evidence that we are continuing to take share in a down market. We're clearly seeing a return here from the investments in dedicated sales reps we made in the back half of last year. New residential returned to growth in the quarter as we are seeing improving single family starts turn to completion. Commercial grew by low-single digits against a double-digit comparison. Property management was down less than 1% with continued delays in CapEx projects. Protective and marine was up mid-single digits against a low-20s comparison. And while we acknowledge that there have been project delays, we feel very good about the pipeline. DIY increased low-single digit increased compared to a high-teens comp. From a product perspective, interior paint sales grew faster than exterior paint sales. We have opened 26 net new stores year-to-date and expect to open 80 to 100 for the full year. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group, sales underperformed our expectations in a market that was softer than we anticipated. Lower volume, the impact of the China architectural divestiture and unfavorable currency translation were partially offset by selling price increases primarily in Latin America. Sales in North America decreased by a high-single digit percentage where weakness in existing home sales remains a headwind. Inflation, depleted savings and household debt also continue to pressure consumers who currently appear to be spending their modest available discretionary dollars elsewhere. We understand where we are in this cycle and eventually expect to see an upturn in DIY demand. We're confident that we are well positioned with our growing partnerships over the long-term. Outside of North America, sales decreased by a high-single digit percentage in Latin America and a double-digit percentage in Europe. Adjusted segment margin expanded to 26.1%. This was primarily driven by improvements in manufacturing and distribution fixed cost absorption within the segment and moderating raw material costs partially offset by net sales that were below expectations and higher employee related costs. In the Performance Coatings Group, modest sales growth was driven by an acquisition which was partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Adjusted segment margin improved to 19.4%. This continued strong margin performance reflects our ability to drive our customer success in end markets that value differentiation. It also reflects the ongoing hard work of our team to optimize this business. We continue to see choppy demand by division and region. Industrial wood led the growth including the impact of an acquisition. Coil also delivered solid growth driven by share gains. Auto refinish was up low-single digits in North America and down less than 1% overall. Share gains are offsetting softness in our core business where consumer reluctance to pay deductibles is resulting in lower insurance claims. Packaging was down less than expected and we have a good line of sight to improvement in the back half of the year. General industrial demand was lower in all regions. Heavy equipment and transportation were down more significantly, while energy infrastructure was a bright spot. Regionally, sales in the group were down low-single digits in North America, but positive in other regions. Moving on to our guidance for the third quarter and full year, it's clear that the macroeconomic environment has been softer for longer than many economists anticipated at the start of the year. We don't expect to get material help from the market in our back half. We are unwilling to simply accept these conditions and you can count on us to continue being very aggressive in our pursuit of new business and share of wallet gains. Sherwin-Williams have incredibly well positioned in each of our targeted end markets. Comparisons ease in our second half, competitive dynamics are a tailwind and we are confident share gains will become more apparent over time as market conditions improve. As for our specific outlook, the slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the third of 2024. For the full year 2024, consolidated sales are expected to be up a low-single digit percentage compared to our previous guide of up low- to mid-single digits. Full year sales guidance for the Paint Stores Group and the Performance Coatings Group remain unchanged. We have reduced our Consumer Brands Group guidance meaningfully following the softer than expected first half and continued weak demand in the North American DIY market. We are increasing our full year earnings guidance given our better than expected results in the second quarter. The midpoint of our previous guidance now becomes the low end of our revised guidance. On an adjusted basis, we are now guiding diluted EPS in the range of $11.10 to $11.40 a share, an increase of 8.7% at the midpoint over the prior year. As we have often said, should our sales prove to be better than we are currently anticipating, we would expect EPS to be better. Our slide deck also provides guidance on our expectations for raw material costs and other items helpful for modeling purposes. As we enter our second half, we know that we are not immune from choppy market conditions. This leads us to focus even more intensely on our strategy. In periods of uncertainty and competitive disarray, customers are looking to Sherwin-Williams for consistency, reliability, dependability and differentiated solutions that will drive their productivity and their profitability. We have a deep and experienced team that knows how to do just that. We believe in success by design and we do expect to win. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'd be happy to take your questions. I'm going to -- I'll start here and then hand it over to Al to give a little bit of commentary as well, but I think you characterized it well. I think if you look across segments here, certainly there were some challenge. We don't hide behind weather. We're also obviously not immune to having to make sure that we've got the right paint and application conditions for our contractors, which ultimately benefits our customers and our shareholders in the long run. But let me be really clear about the controllables and where we are laser focused here. If you look by segment, starting with residential repaint, we mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but very confident that we're going to continue to take market share as you've seen over the last few quarters, especially to your point in Q2 where we're posting up mid-single digits in a down market. I would expect to continue to see us doing that. I think it's also a clear signal that we're getting a return on the investments that you'll remember we laid in last year. So by design, we often talk success by design is a great example of how that's playing out in stores. And, it's worth repeating this segment, there's incredible upside as it relates to market share opportunity. My time out in the field with our team and our customers gives me a lot of confidence that what we're doing is working and we're getting a lot of positive feedback from even our new customers, ultimately helping them make more money. That is the reason we're in this. If I then take you over to new residential, again, Q1 to Q2, I'm going to let Al kind of come in and give a little bit of color commentary. But we are encouraged by the growth that we're seeing here. Single family starts are turning to completions. I have been personally spending a lot of time with our builders and the team here and they're ultimately after optimizing cycle time and profitability. So our opportunity, not only do we see momentum here in the back half, we look at that as some solid tailwind but I'm very confident that we are, I would say, best positioned in our industry, specifically within this segment as the market recovers. If I move on to property management, I think we all have seen this interest rates certainly have put this segment on pause both in new construction and renovation. But we're not waiting here. And Vincent, I think this is an area where much like new residential, the teams are hard at work demonstrating our value and securing additional exclusive agreements with plenty of opportunity ahead for us. So we're going to be continuing to focus on helping our customers manage through this pause. We got a lot of discipline in these management companies as they're really taking a look at understanding how to prioritize their investments and helping them try to upgrade older properties, competing with new properties and the like. Let me start with your last question, in terms of new customers coming in. Yes, this is certainly positive mix for us. So new customers, existing customers in this segment tend to value more of the premium product premium experience that we provide. So I would say that that's a fair characterization across the segment. Obviously, we won't get into any \u201825 certainly not any \u201826 outlook, but what I would tell you is the confidence in the momentum that we have here relative to the run up we're already experiencing in a few segments. And again, I'll go back to this idea of success by design, the luxury of a very tenured management team that is very astute when it comes to reading market indicators and signals. So, the timing in which we're laying these investments in, at the right point in the cycle, so that we are best positioned for the run up. Res paint is a great example. I point to automotive refinish, is another really good example where you can see, I know you asked specifically about stores, but that same discipline, holds across the portfolio. So we're seeing some positive signals from a market share standpoint. I'm very proud of that team and that organization is as you well know that automotive refinish model very similar to our stores model and our ability to have direct relationships with these customers and end users puts us in a really unique position. So, while we're still putting in the investments here, we've got record high installs. And candidly, I would say that not everyone's getting the penetration and the acceleration that we're seeing. But that's another example outside of stores, but Al, let you pick up anywhere else you want to jump in here. And then, John, I would add to that, you lay in additional volume when we're not in such a choppy environment and that's only going to help continue to stretch us. Well, I'll start with the first question. You know what, I think, first and foremost, we have to be prepared for any environment, which is why we're taking a very realistic approach within a choppy environment. But I think as you look by segment is where some of those answers lie. So in terms of Res Repaint, again, we've continued to talk about this because by design, this is an area of incredible market share gain opportunity for us. And I think we've demonstrated that in a down market, we've continued to take share. So I think that's a really good litmus test of how we will operate in the down market. Having said that, as we -- without repeating what we did cover in the prepared remarks, we're going to be very thoughtful where we see the indicators that are driving growth by segment and make sure that we're pacing our investments to what that growth looks like. Yes, the -- certainly, we're continuing to be a bit under pressure here, just in North America. Pros Who Paint continues to be a really important segment for us. As you know, this is a segment that we've also continued to talk about making sure that we're investing at the right point to continue to partner with our retailer customers relative to reps and all the other things that we think are really important in this segment. Al, I know we had talked about a little bit on the Pro Who Paints and you were going to jump in on some color commentary relative to outlook. I think there's a balance here in terms of making sure that we're working in lockstep with our strategic partners. Adam, one piece I want to add in here, and Al said this, I think, really well. But the Pros Who Paint strategy is a critical part of our strategy. We are very confident this is going to create not just a nice financial but a strategic win for our shareholders. This is a segment that we are just not set up to serve in our stores organization. It is a segment that has high growth high-margin opportunity, and it's strategically very important that in our strategic partnerships that we also have access to this important and growing segment. Yes, Patrick, I'll start with that. Let me first start at the portfolio level. I think if you look across PCG in total, our margin performance is demonstrating the value that we're delivering. And those that are value what we do, which is helping them make more money or certainly rewarding us for some of these share gains. So if I look at kind of by division here, packaging, I'll start here. We're gaining share outside of the U.S. And per our second half guide, we do expect the progress to continue relative to United States. If you look within packaging, there's -- we know that the technology that we bring to the market is unique. We know it's solving a lot of issues for our customers and our brand owners. We're putting some investment, as you know, into new capacity, preparing for this growth, and we're confident that we're going to continue to see a run up here. Coil is a really good example of our strategy at work. We're winning. We're taking share, and I would attribute that to the team and their excellent execution at the fastest response time delivering customizable solutions, very consistent quality and we've got our tech service team there to support production. I hit on auto refinish, so I won't repeat that. And we did mention industrial wood. As you look certainly with new residential improvements, we would expect that to be a potential tailwind for us in the back half, still choppy, but we're building on a good foundation as we've been up last quarter in all regions. Yes. It's a good observation, Kevin. And I think you've characterized that well. We often talk about this segment, it's having slightly two different segments. If you think about the DIY consumer in our stores, they're looking for that specialty paint store experience and candidly expect the service that goes along with that, little bit less sensitive in the current macro. The DIY that prefers a home center environment tends to be more value conscious and is certainly feeling the pressure as we talked about prepared remarks early relative to inflation, depleted savings and household debt. So those pressures are very real for that consumer. Having said that, I do want to kind of run right at this question because this is an area that I would tell you, we absolutely do not have our heads in the sand relative to our performance in DIY and certainly relative to our expectations, in the segment. This is a very important segment for us over the long-term. Al referenced that earlier as part of our overall architectural strategy. And when you look at the importance of making sure that we are well positioned here, we understand that there are cycles, certainly in the DIY consumer space. Fundamental belief that we're in a log jam in housing that is going to free up. And so our focus on ensuring we are best positioned with the best strategic partners including our exclusive and growing partnership with Lowe's, among others. So as the market begins to recover, we're very confident in our ability that we will continue to deliver above-market growth. But again, our heads are not in the sand right now and we're going to be laser focused on making sure that we are locked up with our partners. Ghansham, I would characterize it maybe a little bit differently that there are always going to be value conscious, I would say, more so than focused on maybe the true price affordability piece. And so it's incumbent upon us that every day we are doing what we say we will do is delivering a consistent, reliable service disease, more discerning and very habitual contractors that candidly just expect that from us. And so making sure that we're delivering that value every day, I think, is clearly on display for us and it changes their understanding, we are not having price conversations with them. We're talking about helping them grow their business and helping them make more money. I think it's zero. I mean, I think, Josh, it's a good question. I think the health of those backlog is real. And certainly, we're making the right investments at the right time to ensure that we're well positioned. When you talk about kind of the source of strength here, there's certainly opportunity to take share across the market. This has been an area of strength for us because we understand how to do something. I truly believe that no one can do with this segment. And I take it back to the controlled distribution model that we have. So not only are we investing and laying in reps at the right pace in the right geographies, but we're arming these reps with the world's largest database of painting contractors were laser focused on from day 1, ensuring they have the tools, the understanding what they need to go in and help our contractors to grow their business, to travel to be more successful. So when I think about success in this space and the upside, I don't think that there's a finish line here. We've got -- we're early innings in my opinion here, and we've got a lot of upside. And Mike, I think to the team's credit, I would say our focus here, given the fundamentals of the core has been laser focused on new account growth. And I would tell you that that's holding up better than the market. So the team is focused on the right activities here to offset some of the pressure. I think it also points to the value of a specialty paint store model, which is certainly on the DIY side, an expectation of premium product, but it is an equally high expectation of that premium service and the willingness to pay for that service and the homeowner color selection, all of the things that go along with us being innovating in and out of the can is a great example of a consumer that values that type of solution. So let me start with your first question on the revenue, the CBG mix or kind of what's changed in 90 days. And I would simply put it as -- again, we said this in the prepared remarks, but characterizing this as it's just simply been softer longer. If you look at just the DIY North America market being under pressure. So the fundamentals are not -- have not recovered at the pace that we'd like to see. As it relates to stores and Res Repaint, sustainability of our performance there being up mid-single digits in a down market. I would point to a few things, again, on the fundamentals. First and foremost, it's the segment where we have the greatest upside. So the market share gain runway is material. I would also point to, again, going back to the investments that we have made. And as our team is watching the market very closely and we know the indicators to watch. We'll get as aggressive as we need to be and as realistic as we need to be based on what we see in the market. So our ability to ramp that up. I think we've proven that we can respond pretty quickly to be best positioned for that upside. Yes. Let me start with that, just based on my earlier comment. If you kind of picture a bell curve of a new Res Repaint contractor coming in new versus kind of a more mature Res Repaint contractor, where we've earned over time, more share of wallet. My comment is relative to kind of first and foremost, making sure that we're getting them in and getting them set up on the right products. So when we talk about making sure our customers are making more money, oftentimes there, and that is a conversation of getting them in the right premium product that's helping them get their crews on and off the job site faster, less touch up required. So when you look at the total cost of a project, they're making more money. So making sure that we're helping our teams to help set our customers up for success at the very beginning. And then again, along that bell curve, where there's more maturity of this particular contractor, they could be bigger in size, they may be traveling our teams are meeting them exactly where they are and helping them if they're looking to travel and grow work from store to store or repo playing the role proactively help set them up again and then we're able to leverage our data and our database to put our reps in position to help these contractors kind of optimize what it is their how they're leaning in on us for products, services, all of our digital tools, et cetera."

            "content": "And so the only thing I would add is just to take a quick look at the second quarter, up 3.5% compared to a strong low-double digit comparison last year. Volume was up low-single digits. Price was up low-single digits, and I would say it was probably slightly below where our expectations were as we were coming into the second quarter, but we exited the second quarter at our targeted run rate, which leads to the second half, third quarter and second half guidance to be similar up low to mid-single digits and that'd be really just broken out between price up low-single digits and volume up low-single digits with as a reminder, we talked about Res Repaint being up at the high end of that range in our second quarter that happened and we expect the same in our second half. Yes, Chris, this is Al again. I appreciate the question, but we're not going to talk to that specifically that long-term target today. I think FCP gives us -- within the next 30 days gives us a really good opportunity to talk about each of the financial metrics and the targets longer term. And today I think we want to focus on the strong second quarter that we delivered in a tough market environment and also with our second half -- our full year beat and raise for the EPS -- adjusted EPS. I think some of the things you're seeing in the market, and I think we've talked directly about this Kelly-Moore is a more immediate opportunity, more typically -- basically because of the type of customers that they were supporting at Res Repaint and they're out of business. And I think we've talked about taking more than our fair share and we see that in our districts out in the West Coast in California. I think PCG, we'll see what happens but longer -- maybe more mid-term, longer term opportunities. And it all goes back to this consistent investment thesis that we've talked about, we're very confident in our strategy. We know that the investments that we're making are paying off and I point to Res Repaint being up mid-single digits each of the last three quarters in a down market. And then Chris alluded to this on the previous question about mix shifts. And it really is about getting customers in understanding the services and products we offer that allow them to make more money. The products and services that get them to be more efficient to get on and off jobs faster, grow their top-line and their bottom line, it really drives that customer loyalty. I'll take the second one on CapEx. And as you know, we are very consistent in our capital allocation philosophy. After you get past the building our future projects, which as a reminder will help us attract and retain world class talent to allow us to continue to drive above market growth, ROS and RONA improvements and drive strong cash flow. And then we'll take that cash flow and we'll target CapEx below 2%. So depending on where the growth rates are, we may have years where we have to add capacity and I'll point specifically to the packaging capacity that we've come online with into our new France with the idea we have a lot of confidence in our market share opportunities there. We continue to build out our Statesville architectural plant net capacity again with our confidence in our growth opportunities both in the Southeast on the architectural paint stores and I would argue in consumer brands group that's facing some short-term headwinds, but certainly a lot of confidence in the outlook. And then we will keep the dividend at approximately 30% of prior EPS and then absent acquisitions we will buy our stock back. Yes, John, we had a couple of things driving our better gross margin performance in the quarter. Moderating raw materials, certainly is part of that. The price realization that we saw in the second quarter being better than what we saw in the first quarter, along with mix. We did have some global supply chain efficiencies outside of the higher fixed cost absorption that we have talked about in the first quarter, again, was really the entire driver of the consumer brand improvement in the second quarter. But you also have our Paint Stores Group growing faster than the other segments. We've talked about that as that happens, that a higher gross margin it will drive our mix better and continue to drive our gross margin. And really carry that momentum into the second half. And I do expect to see gross margin expansion in the second half, maybe not as much as we saw in the first half, driven by higher Paint Stores Group sales Res Repaint being at the high end of that range. We're going to see moderating raw material costs. But we also should see better price effectiveness in our second half versus our first half. So continuation of what we've seen in the first half, just not as heavy because of the raw material tailwind won't be as high. . Yes. Mike, the only thing I'd add to that is if you look at our second half guide for Paint Stores, it's in line with what we expected coming into the year with Res Repaint outperforming, commercial property maintenance about where we thought new res certainly improving in the second half. And then P&M with the delayed projects was maybe a little bit softer, but certainly not too far outside our guide or our expectations coming into the year. I missed the Guardian question other than they're not hitting the baseball and they're not going to win it. I just think that the -- when you look at some of the leading indicators that we're following LIRA, we expect to bottom out here in the third quarter and improve in the fourth quarter. And even and that's made up of the higher ticket projects and the lower ticket projects. And I think what we've seen in the past is if you're not remodeling a kitchen, you still have to feed your family. So you revert to maybe some smaller ticket projects to fill in those gaps, and that's what we expect to see going through the second half. Clearly, DIY is where we're seeing the most pressure through the first half and into the second half. And this is why I think the investment -- we're confident in that Pro Who Paint strategy, the investments we made and our ability to get a return on that. And we're looking longer term. We're not looking just to run for the second half of this year. We're looking out '25 and '26 and being best positioned to gain share as that channel and piece of -- segment of the channel comes back. Yes. When you look at that line specifically, and it's really the move in FX goes through there. You know what Mike, what I just address is all the other general other income. We did see credits in the quarter environmental FX and then gain on sales. If you look at it net year-over-year versus it's about a $0.12 tailwind. We did have a higher effective tax rate, which was a headwind of about net $0.07. So if you net those out, we're still up a low double-digit percentage. Not expecting that size of credits going through our second half, even though as expected coming into the year, a beat on non-operating costs year-over-year in our second half was expected. I still expect that because we had some higher environmental and some other charges in our second half last year that I'd expect environmental and other income lines to get back in line as it typically has been in the past. Yes, Kevin, the comment on DIY through our Paint Stores Group, but part of that is the price increases or the price increase that we took in our stores that is certainly impacting the DIY customer as well as the Pro. Yes, Greg, if you look at our second quarter with our sales up 0.5% volume and price were up slightly, acquisitions at less than 1%. And we also had the headwind of the divestitures and FX. But really the driver in the quarter was our Paint Stores Group up 3.5%, both segment that segment of PCG segment was where we expected, and we talked about the miss on consumer. If I look at the second half, kind of a little bit up low-single-digits guide compared to low-single-digit comparison last year. I think price is expected to be up low-single-digit percentage. And when you look at -- that would tell you that volume is expected to be up or down low-single-digits. And then all the other impacts are, I'd say, immaterial, less than 1%. FX is unfavorable. A little bit of tailwind in acquisitions and again, a little bit of a headwind on the divestitures, but not material. I'd call out Paint Stores Group, just to be clear, and I said this before, second half, we expect volume and price to be up low-single-digits. Consumer down high single to low-double digits, really the continued softness in DIY. We do expect the price to be flat and that's primarily increases we see in Latin America. FX will be a headwind of about [1.5] and then the remainder is volume down high-single-digits and then within PCG for the second half, I expect up low-single-digits. Acquisitions will be a tailwind of the low-single-digits and then FX, about 1% headwind in price because of the small number of accounts we have on index will actually be a small headwind. Yes. Steve, as I talked about on our first quarter call, this is consistent with our first quarter. We talked about the choppiness in production volumes that we experienced over the last four or five years and updating our cost our standards to match those higher costs on the conversion side. I talked about this at SCP last year that, that's really been a drag on our Consumer Brands Group. And we thought we could get efficiencies out -- to offset those costs, so we wouldn't have to do a reset to our standard costs like we did coming into this year. It's really not an impact on our overall gross margin because it is offset between Paint Stores Group and Performance Coatings Group, both of which I said on our first quarter call, we're not going to detail that out. We don't think it's material. And you can certainly see that with our Performance Coatings Group performance up to 19.4%, which is an all-time high first half is 18.3% an all-the-time high. And then certainly, we see the improvement in our Paint Stores Group. So you're going to see that phenomenon continued through the second half, I did call out that the entire improvement in Consumer Brands Group operating profit is due to those higher fixed cost absorption really partially offset by a decline in profits when you look at it related to the volume -- sales volume, North America DIY sales volume shortfall that we experienced in the second quarter. So like I said, we're going to continue down this path. My expectation is we'll get more consistent. Think of it as a base to build off into the future on consumer operating margin. Yes, Mike, I would say on the -- I'd say on the positive side, starting with that, you do see less of a slowdown in North America. And let me take a step back. It all starts with share gains in this type environment, share gains, share of wallet and differentiation. I think North America will be less of a headwind. I think Europe, again, is we don't expect a lot coming out of Europe in the second half. We do expect Latin America and Asia to -- I'm sorry, Asia Pacific to be positive, more so in Asia against a really soft comp but Latin America holding up. So I think across the regions, North America, as you know, is our largest region across all of PCG and do expect it to moderate as we get through the second half. Yes, Duffy, we mentioned that the price increase effectiveness improved as the quarter went on, and we exited the quarter at our targeted effectiveness rate. So I would expect to see that kind of realization. We have built into our forecast that kind of realization, low-single-digit and then volume low-single-digit in the second half. . No, David, I didn't mean to imply that if that's the way it was taken. It really -- where we're at from an operating margin standpoint within CBG, it will be dependent on where we're at in the sales range and what volume does through the quarter and really through the second half. As you know, we still will expect to see a seasonal architectural slowdown in our fourth quarter. But whether we see sequential improvement in our operating margin, it's really going to depend on sales -- North America DIY sales volume. No. Like, we have talked in the past, our expectation for Consumer Brands, operating margin is high teens, low 20s. And certainly, we challenge our group and divisions to continue to raise that bar. Volume is the #1 driver of operating margin performance in all our segments, as you well know, and that clearly showed itself in 2020 during the pandemic when we had really strong volumes in consumer out-the-door sales, that drove the operating margins higher. And I would expect that as we continue -- as we see a turn in the market and we start seeing volume to grow, we'll get leverage on that volume. Yes. John, I think that's the case. They'll work on jobs where they have the opportunity and they have just lined up. I'll use Res Repaint six \u2013 eight weeks backlogs in advance so they can take advantage of really good weather and do exterior projects. And then again, if it's a wet rainy week, they can pivot and move to interior products -- projects. Yes. I think Chuck, within consumer, we've talked about a different kind of DIY customer and that's where the bulk of the volume is they are more sensitive to inflation, the amount of debt they have. You look at some of those headwinds that Heidi talked about in her opening remarks. It's less so on the DIY side in our stores. And like we talked about, there is a price impact on DIY in our stores. And I think if you look at our Pro, specifically in Res Repaint, we've mentioned this. I think the teams have done a really good job about driving new business through our stores to drive that mid-single-digit growth over the last three quarters in a down market. So it's not that the Res Repainters are immune or those end consumers are immune to higher cost, it's just we continue to take share because of the investments we've continually made and being very consistent about that. So raws, the basket was down mid-single digits year-over-year in the second quarter. And for the full year, we're still picking or saying that the full year will be down low singles. So that tells you the back half is flattish year-over-year. Flattish."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Thank you for joining The Sherwin-Williams Company's review of First Quarter 2024 Results and our Outlook for the Second Quarter and Full-Year of 2024. With us on today's call are Heidi Petz, President and CEO; Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Finance; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.\nJames Jaye: Thank you, and good morning. In what is a seasonally smaller first quarter and with continued demand choppiness in several end markets, Sherwin-Williams delivered consolidated sales within our guided range, gross margin expansion and diluted earnings per share and EBITDA growth. Throughout the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategy, demonstrate our value proposition with current and prospective customers and position ourselves to take advantage of disruptions in the market. While our results were at the lower end of our sales expectations, we remain confident in our full year outlook and there is no change from the guidance we provided in January. We also remain highly confident in our differentiated business model and we are well positioned as the painting season begins. While uncertainties persist in the macroeconomic environment, we see opportunity. We are encouraged by pro architectural sentiment in April and customers in several end markets are optimistic about an improving demand environment as the year progresses. Competitor decisions coupled with our recent growth investments are enabling us to continue penetrating our targeted end markets at multiple levels. We expect share gains and returns to become more and more evident as the year progresses. Consolidated sales in the quarter were at the low end of our range, driven by lower than anticipated volume, primarily in Paint Stores Group against the strongest comparison we will face this year followed by Consumer Brands Group in North America. Contributions from price were modest, as expected and we are now seeing our recently announced increases in Paint Stores beginning to ramp more fully in our second quarter. Gross margin expanded 270 basis points year-over-year to 47.2%. Higher SG&A in the quarter reflects the deliberate and accelerated investments in growth we made in the second half of last year and which have not yet annualized. EBITDA margin improved by 60 basis points to 16.7% and adjusted diluted net income per share increased 6.4%. We also maintained our disciplined capital allocation approach and returned $728 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, an increase of 59% year-over-year. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our first quarter results by segment before moving on to our outlook and your questions.\nHeidi Petz: Thank you, Jim. We are successfully implementing our strategy, which at Sherwin-Williams we do with a very forward looking and aggressive approach. While market conditions are choppy and may give others in our industry a moment of pause, let me be clear, we are not pausing. So this morning, I'm going to talk as much about our results as I am about what we're doing to ensure the momentum of our company not only continues but accelerates our ability to widen the gap between us and our competition. So let me start with the results of the first quarter. As Jim mentioned, our first quarter is a seasonally smaller one and our results do not necessarily dictate how our full year will unfold. While our sales came in within our guidance, it was at the lower end of our range. Going forward, I believe in our differentiated strategy, our deeply experienced leadership and our team's ability to execute in lockstep with our customers to deliver above market growth. Here are several of the leading indicators that give me great confidence that we continue to strengthen our position. For example, we increased the number of exclusive national contracts we have with homebuilders and property management customers in the quarter. New accounts and active purchasing accounts in our stores are up significantly from a year ago. Paint Stores Group rep call activity and unique accounts calls are also up in the quarter. Foot traffic in our stores is up and our net promoter score is at an all-time high. And we're seeing multiple share of wallet and meaningful new customer wins across our industrial businesses. These are just some of the factors we expect will translate into strong performance as the year unfolds. As far as specifics on the first quarter, I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, where sales increased by 0.5 percentage against a mid-teens comparison. We are not satisfied with this level of performance as volume was basically flat in the quarter. Exterior paint sales were exterior paint sales were pressured by challenging outdoor painting conditions in some geographies. As we've demonstrated in the past, we expect to see the benefit of our focused investments unfold throughout the balance of the year. A few strong weeks in June can more than offset first quarter challenges. Price was up modestly related to our February 1 announced increase. We are now seeing a ramp to typical effectiveness as our second quarter moves forward. Segment margin decreased to 17.2%, reflecting flat volume and the higher year-over-year planned growth investments. As a reminder, Paint Store sales were up by a double-digit percentage in every customer segment in the first quarter a year ago. In this year's first quarter, pro sales were led by residential repaint where gallons were up mid-single-digits. We see this above market growth as evidence that our increased investments in this segment are already beginning to deliver a return. Commercial and protective and marine grew modestly in the quarter. New residential was down as expected, but there is momentum in single family starts that will increasingly turn to completions as the year progresses. Property management was also down driven by delays in CapEx projects even as apartment turns remained steady. From a product perspective, interior paint sales increased by a low-single-digit percentage while exterior sales decreased modestly. Encouragingly, spray equipment sales were up mid-single-digits in the quarter. We opened seven net new stores in the quarter and expect to open 80 to 100 for the full year. Our doors are open. We are laser focused on the momentum we have created serving both existing and new customers. We'll continue to win business and take share based on our differentiated solutions. Moving on to our consumer brands group, sales decreased by 7.1% in the quarter. Lower volume and the impact of divestitures were partially offset by selling price increases primarily in Latin America. Sales in North America decreased by a high single-digit percentage, as our strategic partners manage the timing of their seasonal inventory build. Outside of North America, sales increased by a double-digit percentage in Europe and a low-single-digit percentage in Latin America. Adjusted segment margin which excludes acquisition related amortization expense expanded to 20.9%. This was primarily driven by improved manufacturing and distribution fixed cost absorption, moderating raw material costs and improved results in Latin America and Europe, partially offset by lower North America sales volume. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group were in the range we expected with continued choppiness across each of our businesses and regions. Lower volume was partially offset by growth from acquisitions. Sales growth in Europe and Asia was offset by decreases in North America and Latin America. Adjusted segment margin, which excludes acquisition related amortization expense improved to 17.1%. This is the fifth straight quarter this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement and again reflects the disciplined strategy to growing operating margin in the industrial business to mirror that of our architectural business. Industrial wood led the growth including the impact of recent acquisitions. Coil also delivered solid growth. Auto Refinish was flat against a mid-teens comparison. We are confident recent share wins driven by our differentiated service and technology will begin to show up more meaningfully as the year progresses. Packaging was down as expected with improvement expected in the back half of the year. General industrial was impacted by lower demand in all regions. Moving on to our guidance for the second quarter and full year. First, I want to talk about our global team. It always comes down to our people. Our team is highly engaged, aggressive and acting with determination and urgency. They are focused on the right priorities and this will become more and more visible in our results. I would bet on this team all day every day. Second, on our January call, we acknowledged there are uncertainties in the economy. We don't expect to get material help from the macro environment this year, but a few bright spots are emerging. Single family housing starts have improved and this will increasingly turn to completions as the year progresses. Existing home sales are unlikely to get much softer. Last week's LIRA report from Harvard indicates that the remodeling outlook continues to improve with declines easing and momentum building later in the year. On the industrial side, the manufacturing PMI has stabilized or improved in several regions. Third, we are tilting the table in our favor by controlling what we can control. Year-to-date, we have signed 56 new exclusive national account agreements in Paint Stores Group primarily in new residential and property maintenance. We also have increased sales rep call activity and unique accounts called significantly. We have a robust plan and aggressive field activity to engage customers of competitors who have recently closed their doors or are otherwise distracted. As I said earlier, our doors are open. We are not distracted. You can expect us to be very aggressive here. In addition to our stores platform and team of experienced reps and store managers, we're driving customer stickiness through our digital initiatives. In March, we had the highest number of pro plus users ever engaging with our platform, along with a near record number of new registrations. We have opened our Tournus France packaging plant which will support customers converting to non-BPA coating to meet the European Commission's 2026 mandate. We expect on multiple new infrastructure and mega projects that are gaining momentum. And we're introducing multiple new products in both the architectural and industrial businesses to drive our customers' success. Obviously, we're not going to share everything that we're doing for competitive reasons, but you can be certain that there's a long list of actions that we are taking in addition to these items. The key takeaway is this, at some point the demand logjam in multiple end markets is going to break. We will be there to capitalize. We're very confident it's a matter of when, not if. As for our specific outlook, the slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the second quarter of 2024. The deck also contains our full year sales and earnings per share outlook, which again is unchanged from what we provided in January. We expect to provide an update on our 2024 full year outlook when we report our second quarter results in July. Our slide deck also provides guidance on our expectations for raw material costs and other items helpful for modeling purposes. All of these remain unchanged from our January call as well. As you can see, we have high expectations of ourselves. Our team is aggressive, determined and focused on the right priorities. I want to be clear, we are playing to win. We know our strategy is the right one and we have demonstrated for decades that it works. We expect to outperform the market and we are confident our differentiated solutions will continue to drive our customers' success, while also rewarding our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you all for joining us this morning. We'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Heidi, I know historically the company doesn't like to talk about weather and use it as an excuse, but maybe you could comment on it a little bit since it was in your deck and you brought it up. Just curious how much you think you may be lost from an exterior days perspective and how much you think you might make up in 2Q? And related to that, you did mention that you were disappointed with results in the quarter and PSG did come at the low end of your range. So I just want to clarify whether that was all weather related or whether you felt like the execution could have been better in the quarter and you're looking to course correct as you move into 2Q?\nHeidi Petz: I would tell you weather is a part of it, but certainly there's no excuse. But the last thing we're going to do is sit back and point to weather. We're trying to create our own weather here at Sherwin-Williams. So I would say not so much with return -- with relative execution, but I think in some regards, a lot of this is delayed activity. Let me just take a minute here. If you look broadly at stores and I'm spending as you would imagine, a lot of time out in the market right now with our team and with existing customers, also with potential and newly acquired customers and the theme that we're hearing over and over that I'm getting a lot of validation is that our differentiated strategy of distribution, certainly with our paint store, unique specialty paint store model, our quality of people, the availability of our products, the list goes on. That is really critical right now in this environment. And I'll point to a few areas that give me a lot of confidence as we head into the balance of the year. The ability to be accessible, to be dependable, the consistent execution that our contractors are experiencing store to store with us, certainly is really critical going forward and important launch pad. I'd point to a few areas relative to the quarter. Weather certainly is part of it. The choppiness in the market, you're going to see that ranging by segment. I'm going to ask Al to jump in here and give you a little bit of color and then I'll come back with some additional points.\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. We did talk about in the opening about softer than anticipated exterior sales, which were pressured by that challenging outdoor painting conditions. And we saw it, if you looked at our slide deck, Southeastern division, which is our largest sales division in the first quarter was a laggard, which is typically not the case. Commercial, we saw slower exterior sales, property maintenance and then protective and marine got off to a slower start than we were expecting. All of these three segments, we have confidence that these jobs and projects have just been moved and not all of them will get done in the second quarter, some will be pushed into the balance of the year, but certainly have a high level of confidence there. One highlight I think -- that I think is worth mentioning and Heidi mentioned in her opening remarks. We talk about res repaint market being flat for the year but with the investments we've made, we were up mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter, we're up mid-single-digits in the first quarter. And I think if you look at how the quarter unfolded on a same day basis, March was the strongest month for Paint Stores Group in the first quarter and we see that continued momentum in April.\nHeidi Petz: One piece I would add just on the residential repaint side, I'll said this, but remind all of us obviously that we not only do we think it will be flat and we had mid to high in the range. But we're looking at our comparisons are not only indicative of now, but also previous year with a pretty aggressive comp last year. And I do think it's evidence that we're making the right investments here. Delivering this above market growth, we expect to continue to do so here. We're taking this segment very seriously as you can think about the value proposition that we have designed specific for this segment, not just the products but certainly the services, everything that we're doing to try to continue to help this contractor be as successful as possible. And I think that's what you're seeing now in this above market growth relative to the resi paint.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich: I wanted to follow-up on the margins, specifically gross margin. I think you mentioned that there was some operating leverage in the Consumer Brands Group, but volume was flat or disappointing. So just like could you put that together and maybe help us understand, was there any benefit to gross margin from manufacturing or was it all price versus raws in 1Q?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Greg. It's primarily moderating raw material costs and modest price increases in Paint Storage Group. And also as another tailwind is that Paint Stores Group volumes were higher than the other segments, which has a higher gross margin in the company. So those are the primary drivers of the year-over-year improvement. The call out on the higher fixed cost manufacturing affected the Consumer Brands operating margin and including the gross margin, but that was offset by other segments. And if you recall, I did talk about this on our year-end call that I expected our global supply chain to improve performance throughout the year in 2024. I also if you recall, I talked about it on our financial community presentation last August that our consumer operating margin was under pressure and underperformed due to the supply chain inefficiencies. We've experienced choppy production swings that negatively impacted our cost plus higher wages, energy and other costs. And so as we typically do And so as we typically do annually, we update our product costs. As we do expect to continue to see improvements in incremental cost per gallon with our global supply chain, continuous improvement and simplification efforts. There is an impact on Paint Stores Group and PCG. I talked about not getting into the detail of that on our year-end call and it's really not a material impact in the quarter. It is on consumer because it's a small quarter for consumer. But if you look at Paint Stores as we talked about that's volume driven and the incremental investments in SG&A. On PCG, we're still in the high teens performance, nice improvement year-over-year and we'd expect that kind of performance as the year goes out.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.\nJeff Zekauskas: In the first quarter in Consumer Brands, you earned roughly $170 million in EBIT adjusted. And normally the Consumer Brands business is seasonally weak in the first quarter, that is your sales, whether they grow a little bit or whether they shrink a little bit are higher in the second and third quarter. So from a logical standpoint, should it be the case that you earn at least as much in the Consumer Brands Group in the second and third quarter as you did in the first?\nAllen Mistysyn: Yes, Jeff. Even though we don't give operating margin guidance by segment, I will add color that yes, we would expect sequential margin improvement in the second and third quarter because of the seasonality -- seasonally higher architectural sales in 2Q and 3Q. I do expect North America sales volume to be less of a headwind in our second quarter compared to our first quarter with our guidance being our second quarter guidance for consumer sales being down low-single-digits. I do expect that the higher fixed cost absorption in manufacturing and distribution operations will continue in our second and the remaining quarters of the year. But I agree with that. We should be back to our more typical bell curve with the seasonality of architectural going into 2Q and 3Q and then dropping as it typically does in our fourth quarter.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Heidi, you mentioned you won 56 new exclusive national account wins. Is that a big number? Is that a small number? What was it last year or maybe the average of the last three years? And is there a dollar amount associated with that 56 win number?\nHeidi Petz: I won't share the numbers, but I appreciate your question. What I would tell you it's material. And I would also tell you that it was also, it's evidence of our ability to put on display what it is that only Sherwin-Williams can do relative to servicing these contractors, certainly both from a new residential and a property maintenance standpoint in a way that only a specialty Paint Store can do. And so it's a function of our footprint of our team, of the expertise that we have, not just on a broad base nationally leveraging that platform, but our ability to be nimble and local and support the needs of these local contractors. So I think what you're seeing, it's a material pickup, but it's evidence of our value proposition and what we're able to do uniquely in the market.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn McNulty: Maybe we can speak to the raw material environment. You've left the outlook for the year unchanged. It does seem like we've kind of got a mixed bag out there with the oil having run up, but a lot of the derivatives not really moving. TiO2 is kind of a little bit of a question mark. So I guess, can you give us color on how you're seeing your raw material basket at this point, if there are -- if everything is kind of stable, if you're starting to see things from an inflationary perspective go higher or are some still falling lower? I guess maybe you can just give us a little bit more color behind the raw material basket?\nJim Jaye: Yes, sure. This is Jim. Yes, maybe I'll just talk start with the first quarter our basket was down year-over-year mid-single-digit percentage and that's likely the biggest benefit of the year also down slightly sequentially. Where we saw the biggest benefit in the first quarter was monomer, resins, solvents and TiO2, I would say was flattish year-over-year. You look out for the rest of the year, 2Q raws still down probably low-single-digits year-over-year, a little bit less benefit than what we saw in 1Q. And then in the back half of the year, I think it's just down slightly flattish in the back half year-over-year. So that full year right now, we're still looking at down low-single-digits for the year. We'll see if there's some upside as the year progresses, but right now we're still in that down low-single-digit. Your question about some of the commodities specifically, John, crude right now $80, $81 a barrel, that's up year-over-year and since December, but it's still down from where we were in the fall when it ran up into the 90s. Propylene has ticked up sequentially here. Now it's sort of flattish year-over-year. And then I'd say on TiO2, we're seeing some of the producers do a little bit of restocking, but the true end demand in some of these markets is still choppy. Their utilization rates are picking up a little bit. They're seeing some lower input costs. I'd say for us, we expect to still see a little bit of moderation in TiO2 and the other thing that's out there always is China. And with their domestic demand in China being softer, they're exporting a lot of that and I think that's going to continue to put some pressure on the demand environment for TiO2. So summarize it, still down low-single-digits for the year, a bit in 2Q and then flattening out.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research.\nChris Parkinson: So can you just give a little more highlights on your projected market share gain? All of us obviously have a thesis across the sell side community as well as the buy side community. But it seems three things are going on. You have the inflection of historically low single family inventories potentially. Obviously, rates will have to do with that. You have a demographic advantage in many ways. And then also you have the underlying share gain narrative versus not one, but now 2 of your competitors. So has your spending plans actually evolved or changed over the last 6 to 12 months? Or is this something where you're kind of further positioning and further thinking about things as it relates to an eventual inflection in your outlook for \u201925 or \u201826 and onwards.\nAIlen Mistysyn : Yes, Chris, I don't think our spending thesis has changed yet. I think you look at what we talked about on our second half and our year-end call, leaning in with additional investments or accelerated investments to influence the share gains and accelerate the share gains that we expect to see and we saw that with res repaint. I think as we get through the second quarter, as we've typically done, we'll look at the indicators, market indicators and what we see happening not only in the second half of 2024. But to your point looking at the first half of 2025 look at the trends and volumes, the trends in our growth margin and as we have done not just in 2023 but in the past, we believe that we have upside in our volumes, upside in our gross margin we will lean in and add more investments than we would normally do or typically do. Because of the confidence we have in our strategy, because of the confidence we have in long-term new single family construction and need for housing in this country and as interest we talked about this on our first quarter call. As interest rates moderate, we would expect to see existing home sales improve. We'd expect to see an acceleration in new single family starts and in property maintenance improved CapEx. And we will be better positioned as those turn to get a greater share of that market.\nHeidi Petz: Chris, I would add to that as well. Just to reiterate what we said earlier, it's not a matter of if it's when and spending a lot of time strengthening our position in the market. We pointed to a few examples. I shared some of the indicators that gave me a lot of confidence. I'll just give you a bit more color here. If you think about the short-term, executing some actions here. You mentioned increased call activity but the other way to think about this is because of our controlled distribution model. As you well know, we own that data. We're unleashing our selling team right now on the world's largest database of painting contractors. So the team is out hunting in a very surgical and a very targeted fashion. We're not guessing where to spend time or energy. We're being very prescriptive in terms of where we want the team focused. So I think in terms of my confidence relative to how the team's hunting. Our new account activation and mentioned earlier on the unique accounts, but also a significant increase in our active accounts, we're also working hard in the store and with our reps and our managers, getting paint out of the bucket, getting products into the hands of these painters and the pro who paints. So in the short-term, making sure we're very clear and deliberate about how we want to go into the painting season. And when you think about some of these actions that are going to impact the long-term, that give us a lot of confidence in market share is investing a lot in these activities, such as specifications, applications and then working with owners to make sure that the projects are meeting their expectations. So there's a lot of factors here that we're making sure that we're continuing to control what we can control, which is strengthening our position coming out of this, we will be in a position to take Alpha's gross share.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS.\nJosh Spector : I wanted to ask a question on pricing and first, I guess, what was the realized price in the Paint Store Group, specifically in first quarter and how do you expect that to roll into the coming quarters? So it sounds a little bit more phased in your description of that. So do we see in 2Q or 3Q kind of the full impact of that pricing rollout?\nAIlen Mistysyn : Yes. Josh, we talked about this on our first year end call, we went out -- just as a reminder, we went out with 5% February 1, and we said we would realize the increase -- the full price increase over the next few quarters -- the next couple of quarters as we typically have done, I would say, prior pre-COVID, so it's more typical. As we talked about, we had a 0.5% increase in our first quarter split pretty evenly between price and volume and we'd expect that price to ramp up and get fully realized as we exit the second quarter.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global.\nMike Harrison : One of your competitors announced a strategic review of their architectural business. I think you guys have alluded to their challenges, helping to drive some customer wins. But I'm just curious, are there parts of this business that you will consider looking at and have you ever acquired paint stores as part of your store expansion efforts? Where are you always new builds or kind of new storage rather than acquiring?\nHeidi Petz : The answer is no. And I would tell you the way that we're looking at this is an acquisition without the cash outlay. We got a lot of excitement in terms of the opportunity to demonstrate our value proposition in the market. I think there's a lot of confusion out there as a result of some of these decisions. And -- but frankly, this -- again, this is our opportunity to reinforce the consistency and the reliability of Sherwin-Williams. So when customers want to partner with us and choose to partner with us, they know and they trust that we're going to be there with them every step of the way, whether it's product or project or planning or bidding, helping them with leads, we're going to help make sure that without a doubt that they are successful. So there's the stability and the continuity of our strategy, I think, is on display here, and it's our opportunity to go out and continue to demonstrate that.\nAIlen Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, we have purchased store chains before. The last one I want to say was PPI, which was a part of COMEX, and that was back in 2010. I think as Heidi mentioned, we're confident in our strategy in opening 80 to 100 stores is like acquiring a small store chain in the U.S. as it is. So we're happy with that strategy, and we'll continue executing against that.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Patrick Cunningham from Citi Investment Research.\nPatrick Cunningham : There still seems to be quite a bit of choppiness in general industrial and packaging. What are your expectations for volumes for the year? And how much do you expect to outperform from share gains? And then maybe just across Performance Coatings broadly, what are your expectations for pricing for the year, given there might be some indices rolling off, but maybe some targeted price increases as well.\nHeidi Petz : Yes. I'll take the first piece of that relative to the segments and some of the outlook, and then I'll hand over to Allen on some of the pricing. I think if you look across the board, packaging, auto refinish, industrial wood, coil and P&M. I would say there's upside to all of that there's absolutely choppiness. If you look at this a bit more by geography, I would say that that's true. GI certainly continues to be, as we said last quarter, the most under pressure segment. But if I just start with packaging, we said this in our prepared remarks, while the sales were down in the quarter as we expected. There were some customers, some of our customers out there that were required to make a short-term commitment proud and we\u2019re really proud and excited that our plant in Texas is back up and running. As Allen mentioned earlier, plant in Europe is now to regain these customers through the use of our non-BPA coating, which is a superior technology allows our customers not only to be faster and more efficient more profitable, but also to be more sustainable as a result of this advanced technology that we have in the market. So there's a lot of excitement in terms of what we can do to take this technology and a more global basis to support our customers and their sustainability agendas. Automotive refinish, we've talked about this our installed continued to be up double-digits in North America. We are taking share. There's a unique technology and service that we're offering together. So it's the package along with our ability to leverage our automotive branches, much like our Paint Stores Group to provide that consistent and reliable service. So another point of differentiation is something that we're really proud of. And I don't think everyone can say that they're taking share here. We know the customers that we're winning. We know the competitors we're taking business from. And we certainly know the volume we're gaining. So these numbers will clearly evident as the year unfolds. We've got a lot more work ahead but we're winning with small customers. We're winning with medium-sized customers, and we're finally winning with large customers here. Just briefly on Coil, mentioned this earlier but North America is holding up a bit better than other regions. We have had some significant new business wins in North America. There's some positive tailwind as it relates to nearshoring. Mexico is helping to create some demand here. Industrial wood, another positive story here for us. We believe that the market has bottomed out in all regions to your point demand does continue to be choppy going into the second quarter. Some of the recent acquisitions, Sika and Oskar Nolte, EBITDA dollars and percent continue to be ahead of plan. So we're seen this is very accretive to the industrial wood program and we're chasing new accounts pretty aggressively and we expect a lot more as, again, as the year unfolds. And I won't go into much detail on general industrial that that's choppy and down in all regions, and we're continuing to fight hard to make sure that we best position ourselves as we recover there.\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Patrick, on the volumes with our second quarter guidance to be upper down low-single-digits. That would tell you our first half volumes will be down low-single-digits. Full year guidance is flat to up low-single-digits. There was no change to that which tells you that our volume in the second half has to be up -- flat to up low-single-digits.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov : You mentioned momentum in homebuilding as homebuilding customers and new residential. To what extent have you sensed any the change among this set of customers was latest volatility in rates. Has the optimism basically maintained the same level or has it moderated perhaps?\nJames Jaye : Yes, I'll take that, Aleksey. I think the sentiment among our homebuilder customers continues to be very positive. Matter of fact, I was in Texas traveling with our national accounts team earlier in the quarter and spoke to several of our customers down there. And they remain optimistic about where things are heading. The rate environment, we'll see how that plays out. It seems to change month-to-month of what's going to happen there. But I think Al started to hit some of the demographics that are there driving people to need a place to live are intact. And I think also what you're seeing a little bit is people may be adjusting some of their expectations around what type of a home they might be able to afford or buy and the homebuilders are working to drive affordability and we're part of that as well.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.\nGhansham Panjabi : Heidi just follow-up on the last question. You gave us a fair amount of color on how Sherwin is positioned based on your various internal initiatives, but has your outlook for any of the various PSG verticals changed in any meaningful way versus your initial view coming into the year? And then just a second question, maybe for Al in terms of free cash flow allocation in context of a fair amount of debt coming due between this year and next year and how are you kind of balancing buybacks versus debt pay down?\nHeidi Petz : No, I don't think anything has materially changed. Again, as you look segment by segment, I'd point to Protective & Marine was a segment certainly that we see upside. And I think I'll use them as an example because there continues to be demand strength in all markets. Some of the projects have been delayed, so there's been some timing issues here. But think when you look at the visibility that we're gaining relative to some of these mega projects, we're launching some pretty significant new technology into the market this year in fire and flooring and protective coatings, which is an indicator not just of our incremental investment, but I think some good upside. Having said that, I want to go back to where I started which is there's nothing that's materially different from where we came in last quarter. But again, as rates fluctuate as some of these jobs pick back up, then we'll be back out in July if there's any more upside than what we're at today.\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Ghansham, I would say that I feel very good about our strong net operating cash flow generation for the year. You saw us return a big increase in shareholder cash and dividends and buybacks in our first quarter. I think when you look at our debt, I do expect our total debt to remain flat in 2024, and we'll refinance to your point the $1.1 billion of debt maturing, albeit they'll be at higher rates, likely will take out short-term debt and then mature it out as we see fit. But just to reiterate, I mean, we're going to stick to our capital allocation philosophy. We've been very disciplined about that. We invest in CapEx. We paid the dividend, which was a nice increase of over 18% our first quarter. We expect that to continue. And then absent acquisitions, we're going to buy our stock back. And I do expect to be in that 2 to 2.5 debt-to-EBITDA target range by end of the year.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Michael Leithead from Barclays.\nMichael Leithead : On SG&A, I think first quarter was up about 6% year-on-year. Is that roughly in line with the rate of wage inflation you're incurring? Or how should we think about wage inflation relative to other growth investment drivers in that year-over-year increase?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, I think about it this way. The wage inflation is for 2024 is more typical to prior years. So think about a low-single-digit impact. I think what you're seeing in our first quarter, the start of the annualization of the accelerated long-term growth investments we made in the second half of last year. As you recall, on our year-end call, I said I thought SG&A would be up a mid-single-digit percentage for the full year with the first half being above that range because we're annualizing the investments that we made in the second half and then that will level out in the second half of this year.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten : I just say I don't know if you mentioned this, but could you give us an update on how the Pros Who Paint business did in the quarter? I know you mentioned DIY was soft, but maybe some color on Pros Who Paint.\nHeidi Petz : Yes. I think certainly, there's bit of a challenged quarter, I would say, is maybe the best way to characterize Pro Who Paints in the first quarter, which was below our expectations. But we have a lot of confidence in our investments and I would also say a lot of confidence in our strong alignment with our retail partners. I don't know that the alignment has never been in a better place, gives us a lot of confidence that we are going to continue to grow share in this space for the balance of the year. But no doubt, we've got some work to do here.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs.\nDuffy Fischer: Can we drill down our margins in PSG I would assume you got a little price, raw material was a meaningful benefit. So I have a hard time attributing to decline from those increases to the negative margin wholly to your growth investments. So were there other things besides the growth investments that were negative in that segment, maybe the transfer from segment to segment on the paint, which was basically the benefit you saw in consumer? Or anything else that's pulling down the margin other than the growth investments?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Duffy, it's primarily volume. As we have talked about in the past, volume is the single biggest driver of operating margin leverage in, I'd say, all of our segments, but for sure, in our Paint Stores Group. So that's going to be the majority of it. And then yes, we also have an impact from the investments we made but we do expect to continue to get a return for those investments as the year progresses.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison : I guess sort of a follow-up on that is as you get into 2Q, 3Q, 4Q for PSG, do you expect segment profit to turn positive? And for the full year, will segment profit growth?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, on all of that.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.\nKevin McCarthy : Maybe a two-part question, if I may, on Paint Stores Group. First, with a few more months in the rearview mirror, would you comment on where you think U.S. architectural industry gallonage came in for 2023 and where you think it might track for this year? And then the second part would be to do with Protective & Marine coatings. Crafting your segment guidance for PSG, do you think Protective & Marine is likely to grow faster than your paint stores sales or slower or on par? How would you characterize that given the commentary around timing and slower start and so forth?\nHeidi Petz : Yes. I'll start with the P&M piece, and then I'll hand it over to Al. We look at some of the gallons year-over-year. I think you said it in your question, it is timing. And I think with some of these project delays we don't believe in any regard that they have gone away, it's simply timing. And as I mentioned earlier, what gives us confidence is our increased visibility into some of this project work. So again, the team is working hard to make sure that with some of these launches, we are best positioned in the industry. So when the timing does recover, we're at the front of that line. And then I'll hand it over to Al to talk about your question relative to.\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. Kevin, I think the P&M, we do expect to grow faster than architectural just because as we talked about new res, we expect it to be softer in the first half and stronger in the second half. We commented that commercial. We had a better line of sight to the first half being strong and then likely softening, I think that maybe has changed a little bit with the first quarter project delays that we're experiencing. So some of that will probably find its way into our third quarter this year. So -- but we have a lot of confidence in P&M and the strength in that. I think that when you talk about industry volume, I think 2023 is likely down maybe low-single. And I think \u201824, we talked about because the new res was down so much. But I think in \u201824, with bettering coming into the year, we talked about it probably being flattish.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from John Roberts from Mizuho.\nJohn Roberts: Is the delayed property maintenance activity delayed into the June quarter, so that's in your guidance for the June quarter? Or are there more significant delays going on because of the mortgage issues with some apartment buildings and commercial properties?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. I think from project delay relative to what we saw from weather in the first quarter, we'll see those pick up in the second quarter and into the third quarter. As far as CapEx projects, we talked about this on our first quarter call. As rates moderate, we do expect to start seeing CapEx projects improve both rates and lending gets easier at lending standards ease up a little bit. John, we don't have material growth impact in our forecast for property maintenance CapEx growing a significant amount in our second half. So turns are going to continue to improve. And then as CapEx returns will benefit with that as a slight tailwind.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois : You mentioned there was some impact in Consumer Brands in the quarter due to limited inventory build. Is there any way to size if that was material to the quarter or would you expect any restocking in 2Q and maybe speak broadly to any opportunities for restocking across your network?\nHeidi Petz : I'll start with that and ask Al to jump in. I would say we're not going to obviously comment on materiality because that's certainly something we would ask our customers to comment on. But I think it goes without saying that as we've all come through the last few years, wanting to come into the season in a very strong position is a signal that there's opportunity ahead. And Alan, anything you'd want to add to that?\nAllen Mistysyn : Garik, I mean, think about our first quarter is a small quarter for consumer in North America and it ramps up as the architectural season ramps up. So we have seen this in the past and it's not overly material. You think about a couple of percent on $800 million, it's not huge.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne : You made the comment about your sales forces out there hunting for new accounts. And clearly, that's been the model. My question for you is, how are you incentivizing that or driving that with your investments. Is it headcount related? Or are you doing something to drive more servicing to existing accounts? And is this really to drive share gains? Or can this also drive mix shift to higher-performing products?\nHeidi Petz : I would say a few things. I think if you look at we use the word ecosystem a lot to talk about what it is that we're trying to bring to our contractors. So it's basically everything you said. When you look at the reps and certainly our suite of digital tools, the goal here is, regardless of where these contractors are at -- in their business maturity, their selling cycle their growth plans, we are going to intercept them exactly where they are in that cycle. And so it differs by segment. The needs, obviously, of those contractor is different by segment, if it's residential repaint versus new res versus commercial. So the readiness of our team and the digital tools to support them to intercept these contractors is where we're investing. We obviously won't go into a lot of details on that for obvious reasons. But when we're out hunting and I mentioned the word surgical, it is just that. We've got the data. We've got the team prepared. We've got the right set of tools to help make our team more efficient to help make our customers more successful.\nAllen Mistysyn : Steve, the only thing I would add to that is we often talk about surveys painting contractors and the number one driver of their loyalty is who helps them make the most money. So the more reps we have in the field and our ability to spend more time with those painting contractors and doing demos with higher-quality products we can show them the efficiencies that they can gain so that they can grow their top line and their bottom line with the same number of painters because the labor markets haven't improved dramatically. So that's a value add that I think we can provide.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan : Just maybe two questions on Paint Stores Group. So first of all, historically, I think you've been underpenetrated on the West Coast. And given one of your competitors now there has shut at stores. Is that something that you could maybe pivot and increase your store openings towards? And then my second question was basically on growth and margins. So it looks like you face your easiest comps in the second half in Paint Stores Group. Last year, you were up 2% to 4% or so in those quarters. So would you expect to be up kind of mid-single-digits in Paint Stores Group in the second half of this year towards the upper end of your full year guide for sales?\nHeidi Petz : Yes, Arun I'll start with the first one, and then I'll hand it over to Al to cover your second one. And by the way, nice job getting two questions into the one question. You did that really gracefully. So on the first one, yes I think your point on what was happening in the West. We've recognized the Kelly-Moore closure. And I would tell you that we have long and aggressively competed against Kelly-Moore with a lot of respect for them as a competitor. We are well positioned and are already beginning to serve some of their former customers. We expect to gain continued share here. We're not going to comment on the potential size of the gains. But as I said earlier, you can expect us to be very aggressive. And I wouldn't look at this through the lens of opening new stores necessarily there. I think when something like this happens in our industry, we want to make sure that we're very thoughtful about where real estate makes sense for us, talent that we've taken the steps and the actions to take the best of and we're ready to go.\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes, Arun, I think you're right. We would expect that our second half would be in that mid-single-digit range. Of course, as we see the summer selling season unfold. We'll look at those trends, look at indicators and certainly give an update to the street on our July call as appropriate.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.\nLaurence Alexander : Just a quick one on industrial coatings, can you just characterize the landscape for bolt-on M&A how appealing it is currently and our multiples in discussions starting to drift down?\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. Laurence, as you said, I think in this type of uncertain environment, you do see multiples start to decline. You also see maybe a smaller pipeline than you would typically see in a growing market. That being said, I think we're out -- we know our -- we're confident in our strategy in industrial. We are actively pursuing bolt-ons that fit that strategy and accelerate that strategy. And as the markets turn and as there's better line of sight to growth and that will be certainly well positioned with our balance sheet to make any acquisitions that we want to make and that fit our strategy.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard : I wanted to ask about SG&A that you're making to gain share. Al, you talked as rates moderated and there were some conversation earlier about improving remodel in the second half. And obviously, I think Heidi you said it the question is when. In a scenario where perhaps rates don't go down and the remodel doesn't improve. Do you sustain the investment? Is there a point where you tap the brakes a little bit on the investment that you're being made and what is in that scenario, a bit of a slower environment? And then the second is, once we cycle this incremental investment, do we get back to where SG&A grows lower than sales?\nHeidi Petz : So Eric, no, we don't see a situation or an environment where we pull back. We're confident again in our strategy. The comment we made earlier is these are very focused investments. And so we're not trying to be all things to all people, water all the trees. But where we know we've got points of differentiation that are meaningful in the market. You can expect that we'll continue to be very bullish there. So no, I don't see us pulling back in any regard there. And Al, I'll let you speak to the rates relative to the what\u2019s in.\nAllen Mistysyn : Yes. Eric, as you know, I mean, we're focused on growing operating margin and sometimes that's through gross margin expansion. Sometimes that's in SG&A leverage whenever we see outsized gross margin expansion, we take that opportunity to accelerate the investments, again, because it's the confidence you have -- we have in our strategy. But yes, as rates start to come down, existing home sales improve, new single-family starts improvement in the CapEx that I talked about with property maintenance. And we see those volumes improving. I would expect to start seeing leverage on our SG&A into '25 into '26 in the go forward.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Aaron Ceccarelli from Berenberg.\nAron Ceccarelli : If I understood correctly, you mentioned that traffic in your PSG was all-time high in March. What part of your retail network in your view has the largest upside in terms of sales density or traffic? I mean, is there any part of your stores -- retail stores that is not running yet as you would like to? Where is the opportunity, I would like to understand.\nHeidi Petz : It's a great question. I would say the opportunity continues to be first and foremost. While there's opportunity in every segment, the biggest opportunity for us, as we've said historically is res repaint where we've got more share there. And I would say that it's on top of already very healthy growth. So I don't think in any way this incremental traffic is going to help correct think this incremental traffic is going to continue help us to outperform kind of the flat environment that res repaint sits in today. So it will be accretive, and it's something that we're confident that this is an opportunity, as you mentioned -- as I mentioned earlier, an increased call activity and increased unique accounts rather and active accounts, so this is evidence that we're taking share.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nJames Jaye : Yes. Thank you, everybody for joining our call today. I think you heard that the team is very aligned, very confident in our strategy and what we're doing. We've made the right investments, and we're driving those solutions for our customers. And we're pretty confident that you're going to see as the year unfolds, those share gains and those returns become more and more evident. The other thing I would do is just remind you, we will have our annual financial community presentation this year in Boston. That's on August 29. And in addition to Heidi and Al, you'll hear commentary from our group presidents as well. So additional information on that will be coming out some time soon. So look for that, please. And as always, thanks for your interest and we'll be available for your follow-up calls over the next several days. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Heidi Petz",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. We are successfully implementing our strategy, which at Sherwin-Williams we do with a very forward looking and aggressive approach. While market conditions are choppy and may give others in our industry a moment of pause, let me be clear, we are not pausing. So this morning, I'm going to talk as much about our results as I am about what we're doing to ensure the momentum of our company not only continues but accelerates our ability to widen the gap between us and our competition. So let me start with the results of the first quarter. As Jim mentioned, our first quarter is a seasonally smaller one and our results do not necessarily dictate how our full year will unfold. While our sales came in within our guidance, it was at the lower end of our range. Going forward, I believe in our differentiated strategy, our deeply experienced leadership and our team's ability to execute in lockstep with our customers to deliver above market growth. Here are several of the leading indicators that give me great confidence that we continue to strengthen our position. For example, we increased the number of exclusive national contracts we have with homebuilders and property management customers in the quarter. New accounts and active purchasing accounts in our stores are up significantly from a year ago. Paint Stores Group rep call activity and unique accounts calls are also up in the quarter. Foot traffic in our stores is up and our net promoter score is at an all-time high. And we're seeing multiple share of wallet and meaningful new customer wins across our industrial businesses. These are just some of the factors we expect will translate into strong performance as the year unfolds. As far as specifics on the first quarter, I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, where sales increased by 0.5 percentage against a mid-teens comparison. We are not satisfied with this level of performance as volume was basically flat in the quarter. Exterior paint sales were exterior paint sales were pressured by challenging outdoor painting conditions in some geographies. As we've demonstrated in the past, we expect to see the benefit of our focused investments unfold throughout the balance of the year. A few strong weeks in June can more than offset first quarter challenges. Price was up modestly related to our February 1 announced increase. We are now seeing a ramp to typical effectiveness as our second quarter moves forward. Segment margin decreased to 17.2%, reflecting flat volume and the higher year-over-year planned growth investments. As a reminder, Paint Store sales were up by a double-digit percentage in every customer segment in the first quarter a year ago. In this year's first quarter, pro sales were led by residential repaint where gallons were up mid-single-digits. We see this above market growth as evidence that our increased investments in this segment are already beginning to deliver a return. Commercial and protective and marine grew modestly in the quarter. New residential was down as expected, but there is momentum in single family starts that will increasingly turn to completions as the year progresses. Property management was also down driven by delays in CapEx projects even as apartment turns remained steady. From a product perspective, interior paint sales increased by a low-single-digit percentage while exterior sales decreased modestly. Encouragingly, spray equipment sales were up mid-single-digits in the quarter. We opened seven net new stores in the quarter and expect to open 80 to 100 for the full year. Our doors are open. We are laser focused on the momentum we have created serving both existing and new customers. We'll continue to win business and take share based on our differentiated solutions. Moving on to our consumer brands group, sales decreased by 7.1% in the quarter. Lower volume and the impact of divestitures were partially offset by selling price increases primarily in Latin America. Sales in North America decreased by a high single-digit percentage, as our strategic partners manage the timing of their seasonal inventory build. Outside of North America, sales increased by a double-digit percentage in Europe and a low-single-digit percentage in Latin America. Adjusted segment margin which excludes acquisition related amortization expense expanded to 20.9%. This was primarily driven by improved manufacturing and distribution fixed cost absorption, moderating raw material costs and improved results in Latin America and Europe, partially offset by lower North America sales volume. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group were in the range we expected with continued choppiness across each of our businesses and regions. Lower volume was partially offset by growth from acquisitions. Sales growth in Europe and Asia was offset by decreases in North America and Latin America. Adjusted segment margin, which excludes acquisition related amortization expense improved to 17.1%. This is the fifth straight quarter this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement and again reflects the disciplined strategy to growing operating margin in the industrial business to mirror that of our architectural business. Industrial wood led the growth including the impact of recent acquisitions. Coil also delivered solid growth. Auto Refinish was flat against a mid-teens comparison. We are confident recent share wins driven by our differentiated service and technology will begin to show up more meaningfully as the year progresses. Packaging was down as expected with improvement expected in the back half of the year. General industrial was impacted by lower demand in all regions. Moving on to our guidance for the second quarter and full year. First, I want to talk about our global team. It always comes down to our people. Our team is highly engaged, aggressive and acting with determination and urgency. They are focused on the right priorities and this will become more and more visible in our results. I would bet on this team all day every day. Second, on our January call, we acknowledged there are uncertainties in the economy. We don't expect to get material help from the macro environment this year, but a few bright spots are emerging. Single family housing starts have improved and this will increasingly turn to completions as the year progresses. Existing home sales are unlikely to get much softer. Last week's LIRA report from Harvard indicates that the remodeling outlook continues to improve with declines easing and momentum building later in the year. On the industrial side, the manufacturing PMI has stabilized or improved in several regions. Third, we are tilting the table in our favor by controlling what we can control. Year-to-date, we have signed 56 new exclusive national account agreements in Paint Stores Group primarily in new residential and property maintenance. We also have increased sales rep call activity and unique accounts called significantly. We have a robust plan and aggressive field activity to engage customers of competitors who have recently closed their doors or are otherwise distracted. As I said earlier, our doors are open. We are not distracted. You can expect us to be very aggressive here. In addition to our stores platform and team of experienced reps and store managers, we're driving customer stickiness through our digital initiatives. In March, we had the highest number of pro plus users ever engaging with our platform, along with a near record number of new registrations. We have opened our Tournus France packaging plant which will support customers converting to non-BPA coating to meet the European Commission's 2026 mandate. We expect on multiple new infrastructure and mega projects that are gaining momentum. And we're introducing multiple new products in both the architectural and industrial businesses to drive our customers' success. Obviously, we're not going to share everything that we're doing for competitive reasons, but you can be certain that there's a long list of actions that we are taking in addition to these items. The key takeaway is this, at some point the demand logjam in multiple end markets is going to break. We will be there to capitalize. We're very confident it's a matter of when, not if. As for our specific outlook, the slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the second quarter of 2024. The deck also contains our full year sales and earnings per share outlook, which again is unchanged from what we provided in January. We expect to provide an update on our 2024 full year outlook when we report our second quarter results in July. Our slide deck also provides guidance on our expectations for raw material costs and other items helpful for modeling purposes. All of these remain unchanged from our January call as well. As you can see, we have high expectations of ourselves. Our team is aggressive, determined and focused on the right priorities. I want to be clear, we are playing to win. We know our strategy is the right one and we have demonstrated for decades that it works. We expect to outperform the market and we are confident our differentiated solutions will continue to drive our customers' success, while also rewarding our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you all for joining us this morning. We'll be happy to take your questions. I would tell you weather is a part of it, but certainly there's no excuse. But the last thing we're going to do is sit back and point to weather. We're trying to create our own weather here at Sherwin-Williams. So I would say not so much with return -- with relative execution, but I think in some regards, a lot of this is delayed activity. Let me just take a minute here. If you look broadly at stores and I'm spending as you would imagine, a lot of time out in the market right now with our team and with existing customers, also with potential and newly acquired customers and the theme that we're hearing over and over that I'm getting a lot of validation is that our differentiated strategy of distribution, certainly with our paint store, unique specialty paint store model, our quality of people, the availability of our products, the list goes on. That is really critical right now in this environment. And I'll point to a few areas that give me a lot of confidence as we head into the balance of the year. The ability to be accessible, to be dependable, the consistent execution that our contractors are experiencing store to store with us, certainly is really critical going forward and important launch pad. I'd point to a few areas relative to the quarter. Weather certainly is part of it. The choppiness in the market, you're going to see that ranging by segment. I'm going to ask Al to jump in here and give you a little bit of color and then I'll come back with some additional points. One piece I would add just on the residential repaint side, I'll said this, but remind all of us obviously that we not only do we think it will be flat and we had mid to high in the range. But we're looking at our comparisons are not only indicative of now, but also previous year with a pretty aggressive comp last year. And I do think it's evidence that we're making the right investments here. Delivering this above market growth, we expect to continue to do so here. We're taking this segment very seriously as you can think about the value proposition that we have designed specific for this segment, not just the products but certainly the services, everything that we're doing to try to continue to help this contractor be as successful as possible. And I think that's what you're seeing now in this above market growth relative to the resi paint. I won't share the numbers, but I appreciate your question. What I would tell you it's material. And I would also tell you that it was also, it's evidence of our ability to put on display what it is that only Sherwin-Williams can do relative to servicing these contractors, certainly both from a new residential and a property maintenance standpoint in a way that only a specialty Paint Store can do. And so it's a function of our footprint of our team, of the expertise that we have, not just on a broad base nationally leveraging that platform, but our ability to be nimble and local and support the needs of these local contractors. So I think what you're seeing, it's a material pickup, but it's evidence of our value proposition and what we're able to do uniquely in the market. Chris, I would add to that as well. Just to reiterate what we said earlier, it's not a matter of if it's when and spending a lot of time strengthening our position in the market. We pointed to a few examples. I shared some of the indicators that gave me a lot of confidence. I'll just give you a bit more color here. If you think about the short-term, executing some actions here. You mentioned increased call activity but the other way to think about this is because of our controlled distribution model. As you well know, we own that data. We're unleashing our selling team right now on the world's largest database of painting contractors. So the team is out hunting in a very surgical and a very targeted fashion. We're not guessing where to spend time or energy. We're being very prescriptive in terms of where we want the team focused. So I think in terms of my confidence relative to how the team's hunting. Our new account activation and mentioned earlier on the unique accounts, but also a significant increase in our active accounts, we're also working hard in the store and with our reps and our managers, getting paint out of the bucket, getting products into the hands of these painters and the pro who paints. So in the short-term, making sure we're very clear and deliberate about how we want to go into the painting season. And when you think about some of these actions that are going to impact the long-term, that give us a lot of confidence in market share is investing a lot in these activities, such as specifications, applications and then working with owners to make sure that the projects are meeting their expectations. So there's a lot of factors here that we're making sure that we're continuing to control what we can control, which is strengthening our position coming out of this, we will be in a position to take Alpha's gross share. The answer is no. And I would tell you the way that we're looking at this is an acquisition without the cash outlay. We got a lot of excitement in terms of the opportunity to demonstrate our value proposition in the market. I think there's a lot of confusion out there as a result of some of these decisions. And -- but frankly, this -- again, this is our opportunity to reinforce the consistency and the reliability of Sherwin-Williams. So when customers want to partner with us and choose to partner with us, they know and they trust that we're going to be there with them every step of the way, whether it's product or project or planning or bidding, helping them with leads, we're going to help make sure that without a doubt that they are successful. So there's the stability and the continuity of our strategy, I think, is on display here, and it's our opportunity to go out and continue to demonstrate that. Yes. I'll take the first piece of that relative to the segments and some of the outlook, and then I'll hand over to Allen on some of the pricing. I think if you look across the board, packaging, auto refinish, industrial wood, coil and P&M. I would say there's upside to all of that there's absolutely choppiness. If you look at this a bit more by geography, I would say that that's true. GI certainly continues to be, as we said last quarter, the most under pressure segment. But if I just start with packaging, we said this in our prepared remarks, while the sales were down in the quarter as we expected. There were some customers, some of our customers out there that were required to make a short-term commitment proud and we're really proud and excited that our plant in Texas is back up and running. As Allen mentioned earlier, plant in Europe is now to regain these customers through the use of our non-BPA coating, which is a superior technology allows our customers not only to be faster and more efficient more profitable, but also to be more sustainable as a result of this advanced technology that we have in the market. So there's a lot of excitement in terms of what we can do to take this technology and a more global basis to support our customers and their sustainability agendas. Automotive refinish, we've talked about this our installed continued to be up double-digits in North America. We are taking share. There's a unique technology and service that we're offering together. So it's the package along with our ability to leverage our automotive branches, much like our Paint Stores Group to provide that consistent and reliable service. So another point of differentiation is something that we're really proud of. And I don't think everyone can say that they're taking share here. We know the customers that we're winning. We know the competitors we're taking business from. And we certainly know the volume we're gaining. So these numbers will clearly evident as the year unfolds. We've got a lot more work ahead but we're winning with small customers. We're winning with medium-sized customers, and we're finally winning with large customers here. Just briefly on Coil, mentioned this earlier but North America is holding up a bit better than other regions. We have had some significant new business wins in North America. There's some positive tailwind as it relates to nearshoring. Mexico is helping to create some demand here. Industrial wood, another positive story here for us. We believe that the market has bottomed out in all regions to your point demand does continue to be choppy going into the second quarter. Some of the recent acquisitions, Sika and Oskar Nolte, EBITDA dollars and percent continue to be ahead of plan. So we're seen this is very accretive to the industrial wood program and we're chasing new accounts pretty aggressively and we expect a lot more as, again, as the year unfolds. And I won't go into much detail on general industrial that that's choppy and down in all regions, and we're continuing to fight hard to make sure that we best position ourselves as we recover there. No, I don't think anything has materially changed. Again, as you look segment by segment, I'd point to Protective & Marine was a segment certainly that we see upside. And I think I'll use them as an example because there continues to be demand strength in all markets. Some of the projects have been delayed, so there's been some timing issues here. But think when you look at the visibility that we're gaining relative to some of these mega projects, we're launching some pretty significant new technology into the market this year in fire and flooring and protective coatings, which is an indicator not just of our incremental investment, but I think some good upside. Having said that, I want to go back to where I started which is there's nothing that's materially different from where we came in last quarter. But again, as rates fluctuate as some of these jobs pick back up, then we'll be back out in July if there's any more upside than what we're at today. Yes. I think certainly, there's bit of a challenged quarter, I would say, is maybe the best way to characterize Pro Who Paints in the first quarter, which was below our expectations. But we have a lot of confidence in our investments and I would also say a lot of confidence in our strong alignment with our retail partners. I don't know that the alignment has never been in a better place, gives us a lot of confidence that we are going to continue to grow share in this space for the balance of the year. But no doubt, we've got some work to do here. Yes. I'll start with the P&M piece, and then I'll hand it over to Al. We look at some of the gallons year-over-year. I think you said it in your question, it is timing. And I think with some of these project delays we don't believe in any regard that they have gone away, it's simply timing. And as I mentioned earlier, what gives us confidence is our increased visibility into some of this project work. So again, the team is working hard to make sure that with some of these launches, we are best positioned in the industry. So when the timing does recover, we're at the front of that line. And then I'll hand it over to Al to talk about your question relative to. I'll start with that and ask Al to jump in. I would say we're not going to obviously comment on materiality because that's certainly something we would ask our customers to comment on. But I think it goes without saying that as we've all come through the last few years, wanting to come into the season in a very strong position is a signal that there's opportunity ahead. And Alan, anything you'd want to add to that? I would say a few things. I think if you look at we use the word ecosystem a lot to talk about what it is that we're trying to bring to our contractors. So it's basically everything you said. When you look at the reps and certainly our suite of digital tools, the goal here is, regardless of where these contractors are at -- in their business maturity, their selling cycle their growth plans, we are going to intercept them exactly where they are in that cycle. And so it differs by segment. The needs, obviously, of those contractor is different by segment, if it's residential repaint versus new res versus commercial. So the readiness of our team and the digital tools to support them to intercept these contractors is where we're investing. We obviously won't go into a lot of details on that for obvious reasons. But when we're out hunting and I mentioned the word surgical, it is just that. We've got the data. We've got the team prepared. We've got the right set of tools to help make our team more efficient to help make our customers more successful. Yes, Arun I'll start with the first one, and then I'll hand it over to Al to cover your second one. And by the way, nice job getting two questions into the one question. You did that really gracefully. So on the first one, yes I think your point on what was happening in the West. We've recognized the Kelly-Moore closure. And I would tell you that we have long and aggressively competed against Kelly-Moore with a lot of respect for them as a competitor. We are well positioned and are already beginning to serve some of their former customers. We expect to gain continued share here. We're not going to comment on the potential size of the gains. But as I said earlier, you can expect us to be very aggressive. And I wouldn't look at this through the lens of opening new stores necessarily there. I think when something like this happens in our industry, we want to make sure that we're very thoughtful about where real estate makes sense for us, talent that we've taken the steps and the actions to take the best of and we're ready to go. So Eric, no, we don't see a situation or an environment where we pull back. We're confident again in our strategy. The comment we made earlier is these are very focused investments. And so we're not trying to be all things to all people, water all the trees. But where we know we've got points of differentiation that are meaningful in the market. You can expect that we'll continue to be very bullish there. So no, I don't see us pulling back in any regard there. And Al, I'll let you speak to the rates relative to the what's in. It's a great question. I would say the opportunity continues to be first and foremost. While there's opportunity in every segment, the biggest opportunity for us, as we've said historically is res repaint where we've got more share there. And I would say that it's on top of already very healthy growth. So I don't think in any way this incremental traffic is going to help correct think this incremental traffic is going to continue help us to outperform kind of the flat environment that res repaint sits in today. So it will be accretive, and it's something that we're confident that this is an opportunity, as you mentioned -- as I mentioned earlier, an increased call activity and increased unique accounts rather and active accounts, so this is evidence that we're taking share."

            "content": "Yes, Chris, I don't think our spending thesis has changed yet. I think you look at what we talked about on our second half and our year-end call, leaning in with additional investments or accelerated investments to influence the share gains and accelerate the share gains that we expect to see and we saw that with res repaint. I think as we get through the second quarter, as we've typically done, we'll look at the indicators, market indicators and what we see happening not only in the second half of 2024. But to your point looking at the first half of 2025 look at the trends and volumes, the trends in our growth margin and as we have done not just in 2023 but in the past, we believe that we have upside in our volumes, upside in our gross margin we will lean in and add more investments than we would normally do or typically do. Because of the confidence we have in our strategy, because of the confidence we have in long-term new single family construction and need for housing in this country and as interest we talked about this on our first quarter call. As interest rates moderate, we would expect to see existing home sales improve. We'd expect to see an acceleration in new single family starts and in property maintenance improved CapEx. And we will be better positioned as those turn to get a greater share of that market. Yes. Josh, we talked about this on our first year end call, we went out -- just as a reminder, we went out with 5% February 1, and we said we would realize the increase -- the full price increase over the next few quarters -- the next couple of quarters as we typically have done, I would say, prior pre-COVID, so it's more typical. As we talked about, we had a 0.5% increase in our first quarter split pretty evenly between price and volume and we'd expect that price to ramp up and get fully realized as we exit the second quarter. Yes, Mike, we have purchased store chains before. The last one I want to say was PPI, which was a part of COMEX, and that was back in 2010. I think as Heidi mentioned, we're confident in our strategy in opening 80 to 100 stores is like acquiring a small store chain in the U.S. as it is. So we're happy with that strategy, and we'll continue executing against that."

            "name": "Allen Mistysyn",
            "content": "Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. We did talk about in the opening about softer than anticipated exterior sales, which were pressured by that challenging outdoor painting conditions. And we saw it, if you looked at our slide deck, Southeastern division, which is our largest sales division in the first quarter was a laggard, which is typically not the case. Commercial, we saw slower exterior sales, property maintenance and then protective and marine got off to a slower start than we were expecting. All of these three segments, we have confidence that these jobs and projects have just been moved and not all of them will get done in the second quarter, some will be pushed into the balance of the year, but certainly have a high level of confidence there. One highlight I think -- that I think is worth mentioning and Heidi mentioned in her opening remarks. We talk about res repaint market being flat for the year but with the investments we've made, we were up mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter, we're up mid-single-digits in the first quarter. And I think if you look at how the quarter unfolded on a same day basis, March was the strongest month for Paint Stores Group in the first quarter and we see that continued momentum in April. Yes, Greg. It's primarily moderating raw material costs and modest price increases in Paint Storage Group. And also as another tailwind is that Paint Stores Group volumes were higher than the other segments, which has a higher gross margin in the company. So those are the primary drivers of the year-over-year improvement. The call out on the higher fixed cost manufacturing affected the Consumer Brands operating margin and including the gross margin, but that was offset by other segments. And if you recall, I did talk about this on our year-end call that I expected our global supply chain to improve performance throughout the year in 2024. I also if you recall, I talked about it on our financial community presentation last August that our consumer operating margin was under pressure and underperformed due to the supply chain inefficiencies. We've experienced choppy production swings that negatively impacted our cost plus higher wages, energy and other costs. And so as we typically do And so as we typically do annually, we update our product costs. As we do expect to continue to see improvements in incremental cost per gallon with our global supply chain, continuous improvement and simplification efforts. There is an impact on Paint Stores Group and PCG. I talked about not getting into the detail of that on our year-end call and it's really not a material impact in the quarter. It is on consumer because it's a small quarter for consumer. But if you look at Paint Stores as we talked about that's volume driven and the incremental investments in SG&A. On PCG, we're still in the high teens performance, nice improvement year-over-year and we'd expect that kind of performance as the year goes out. Yes, Jeff. Even though we don't give operating margin guidance by segment, I will add color that yes, we would expect sequential margin improvement in the second and third quarter because of the seasonality -- seasonally higher architectural sales in 2Q and 3Q. I do expect North America sales volume to be less of a headwind in our second quarter compared to our first quarter with our guidance being our second quarter guidance for consumer sales being down low-single-digits. I do expect that the higher fixed cost absorption in manufacturing and distribution operations will continue in our second and the remaining quarters of the year. But I agree with that. We should be back to our more typical bell curve with the seasonality of architectural going into 2Q and 3Q and then dropping as it typically does in our fourth quarter. Yes, Patrick, on the volumes with our second quarter guidance to be upper down low-single-digits. That would tell you our first half volumes will be down low-single-digits. Full year guidance is flat to up low-single-digits. There was no change to that which tells you that our volume in the second half has to be up -- flat to up low-single-digits. Yes, Ghansham, I would say that I feel very good about our strong net operating cash flow generation for the year. You saw us return a big increase in shareholder cash and dividends and buybacks in our first quarter. I think when you look at our debt, I do expect our total debt to remain flat in 2024, and we'll refinance to your point the $1.1 billion of debt maturing, albeit they'll be at higher rates, likely will take out short-term debt and then mature it out as we see fit. But just to reiterate, I mean, we're going to stick to our capital allocation philosophy. We've been very disciplined about that. We invest in CapEx. We paid the dividend, which was a nice increase of over 18% our first quarter. We expect that to continue. And then absent acquisitions, we're going to buy our stock back. And I do expect to be in that 2 to 2.5 debt-to-EBITDA target range by end of the year. Yes, Mike, I think about it this way. The wage inflation is for 2024 is more typical to prior years. So think about a low-single-digit impact. I think what you're seeing in our first quarter, the start of the annualization of the accelerated long-term growth investments we made in the second half of last year. As you recall, on our year-end call, I said I thought SG&A would be up a mid-single-digit percentage for the full year with the first half being above that range because we're annualizing the investments that we made in the second half and then that will level out in the second half of this year. Yes, Duffy, it's primarily volume. As we have talked about in the past, volume is the single biggest driver of operating margin leverage in, I'd say, all of our segments, but for sure, in our Paint Stores Group. So that's going to be the majority of it. And then yes, we also have an impact from the investments we made but we do expect to continue to get a return for those investments as the year progresses. Yes, on all of that. Yes. Kevin, I think the P&M, we do expect to grow faster than architectural just because as we talked about new res, we expect it to be softer in the first half and stronger in the second half. We commented that commercial. We had a better line of sight to the first half being strong and then likely softening, I think that maybe has changed a little bit with the first quarter project delays that we're experiencing. So some of that will probably find its way into our third quarter this year. So -- but we have a lot of confidence in P&M and the strength in that. I think that when you talk about industry volume, I think 2023 is likely down maybe low-single. And I think \u201824, we talked about because the new res was down so much. But I think in \u201824, with bettering coming into the year, we talked about it probably being flattish. Yes. I think from project delay relative to what we saw from weather in the first quarter, we'll see those pick up in the second quarter and into the third quarter. As far as CapEx projects, we talked about this on our first quarter call. As rates moderate, we do expect to start seeing CapEx projects improve both rates and lending gets easier at lending standards ease up a little bit. John, we don't have material growth impact in our forecast for property maintenance CapEx growing a significant amount in our second half. So turns are going to continue to improve. And then as CapEx returns will benefit with that as a slight tailwind. Garik, I mean, think about our first quarter is a small quarter for consumer in North America and it ramps up as the architectural season ramps up. So we have seen this in the past and it's not overly material. You think about a couple of percent on $800 million, it's not huge. Steve, the only thing I would add to that is we often talk about surveys painting contractors and the number one driver of their loyalty is who helps them make the most money. So the more reps we have in the field and our ability to spend more time with those painting contractors and doing demos with higher-quality products we can show them the efficiencies that they can gain so that they can grow their top line and their bottom line with the same number of painters because the labor markets haven't improved dramatically. So that's a value add that I think we can provide. Yes, Arun, I think you're right. We would expect that our second half would be in that mid-single-digit range. Of course, as we see the summer selling season unfold. We'll look at those trends, look at indicators and certainly give an update to the street on our July call as appropriate. Yes. Laurence, as you said, I think in this type of uncertain environment, you do see multiples start to decline. You also see maybe a smaller pipeline than you would typically see in a growing market. That being said, I think we're out -- we know our -- we're confident in our strategy in industrial. We are actively pursuing bolt-ons that fit that strategy and accelerate that strategy. And as the markets turn and as there's better line of sight to growth and that will be certainly well positioned with our balance sheet to make any acquisitions that we want to make and that fit our strategy. Yes. Eric, as you know, I mean, we're focused on growing operating margin and sometimes that's through gross margin expansion. Sometimes that's in SG&A leverage whenever we see outsized gross margin expansion, we take that opportunity to accelerate the investments, again, because it's the confidence you have -- we have in our strategy. But yes, as rates start to come down, existing home sales improve, new single-family starts improvement in the CapEx that I talked about with property maintenance. And we see those volumes improving. I would expect to start seeing leverage on our SG&A into '25 into '26 in the go forward."
