        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the United Therapeutics Corporation, Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. My name is Kenzie, and I will be your conference operator today.  I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Dewey Steadman, Head of Investor Relations at United Therapeutics.\nDewey Steadman: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome you to the United Therapeutics Corporation fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Accompanying me on today's call are Dr. Martine Rothblatt, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Michael Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Mr. James Edgemond, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Dr. Leigh Peterson, Vice President of Product Development.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Dewey. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the 2020 full year and fourth quarter earnings call of United Therapeutics. We are going to have a really great call today. UT is a pulmonary hypertension Company, now becoming both a pulmonary hypertension and a pulmonary fibrosis Company. We expect our products for these two markets to generate double-digit growth for several years to come. For example, today we report that our fourth quarter 2020 revenues grew by double-digits, about 24% from fourth quarter 2019 and even excluding a one-time 2019 operation in the distributor order patterns, revenue still grew over 10%, fourth quarter year-over-year with Tyvaso posting a 27% growth fourth quarter year-over-year and Orenitram posting a UT record 30% growth. Let me now go into some detail on why we expect strong growth in Treprostinil patient counts to continue. Starting with our pulmonary hypertension activities, we believe organic growth from our existing three commercialized products as well as new products emerging from our pipeline will drive double-digit growth. Organic growth from our three existing products includes, first of all, the increasing use of Remodulin, as part of our Remunity protocol to drive pulmonary artery pressures down below 40 millimeters of mercury, before rapidly switching the patients for long-term management on Orenitram.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Joseph Thome with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJoseph Thome: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on all the progress. I want to discuss the hopeful integration of the DPI, a little bit. Can you give us your thoughts on how you expect to transition in, or start patients on the DPI and PAH? And then for PH- ILD because the DPI could launch reasonably quickly after the formal label expansion, how are you thinking over the next 12 months to 18 months, integrating PH-ILD patients on the DPI versus the nebulized Tyvaso version? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. Thanks so much for those good questions. You know, they're both really in the realm of business questions that Mike Benkowitz and his very talented team have already been working on and interacting with physicians on. So Mike, could you take that question?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. I think the answer applies really, I think to both indications. And we're really excited about the progress we've made with Tyvaso DPI. We're looking forward to the filing as Martine said in April. And with the priority review voucher, we purchased at the end of last year, are hopeful that just assuming everything goes well with the FDA we'll be able to launch that into both indications by the end of this year. And I'll tell you that there is both and with PAH docs and with PH-ILD docs, there is a lot of excitement and enthusiasm around having a dry powder inhaler. And so, we're preparing to aggressively launch that product and make it available to as many patients as are wanting to either start initiating therapy on Tyvaso as well as transition over. And so, I think at this point we're very encouraged by the feedback we're hearing from the physicians, very optimistic that there will be a - I think, there will be a relatively speaking in PAH, a quick transition for those patients that want to transition to DPI to be able to do so, very soon after launch.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Liana Moussatos with Wedbush. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nLiana Moussatos: Thank you for taking my question. So for Remunity launch, how should we think about Q1 revenues?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Liana. Nice to hear your voice this morning. Again another business question, I'd like to forward that to Mike Benkowitz.\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes. So Liana, I think with the Remunity launch, you're looking at, I think another product where there's a lot of excitement in the market as Martine said. We launched that earlier this month. We're pleased to see the really early enthusiasm from physicians around Remunity. We're already seeing referrals come in. So we expect to get those patients on therapy in the coming weeks, months and into the future.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike. You know, I'm so excited about Remunity, Liana, I can't actually hold myself back from sharing the anecdote that flowed in just the past couple of days ago. There is - you know, an important pulmonary hypertension center that had regularly put patients on IV Remodulin, but was very resistant to putting patients on subcu Remodulin. They actually have become the first center to put patients on Remunity. They were so impressed with the differences of Remunity compared to subcu Remodulin, that this center that had not put patients on subcu Remodulin for a long time was now switching patients over or starting new patients on Remunity, whereas they wouldn't have done that for subcu Remodulin. So I just think that, that anecdote is a very positive indicator of things to come for Remunity. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nEun Yang: Thank you. Questions on Tyvaso DPI. So once it's approved, you owe double-digit percentage of royalty to MannKind. Are there any regulatory or sales-related milestones? And with that, do you expect the gross margin to kind of settle around mid to high 80s? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Thank you, Eun so much for the question. That sounds to me like pretty much of a financial question. So I'm going to ask our CFO James Edgemond to please handle that one.\nJames Edgemond: Yes. Thank you, Martine and good morning Eun. You're right, we do owe MannKind royalties related to patients that use the DPI going forward. And as you've probably recognized and noted in the financial statements, we have historically made milestone payment and we achieved these milestones under our agreement with MannKind. Going forward, there are limited milestones with respect to pursuing other indications. So our main financial obligation as you kind of referred to is fully around our royalty obligation for new patients going to DPI. And as for kind of your question around gross margin, you're getting very specific in terms of what it would be acting overall, because we don't necessarily anticipate breaking out Tyvaso or DPI versus the current nebulizer.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, James. Appreciate it. Operator, could you please receive the next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJessica Fye: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. My question is on the Tyvaso, PH-ILD launch and in the press release, how - you kind of reiterated the hope to double the number of Tyvaso patients in the near-term. I think in the past you suggested maybe looking at about 18 months. When we think about that growth in patients, should we think of that as sort of straight line growth or is this something that could have an initial bolus or conversely something that might start slow and then sort of inflect over time?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Jessica for your question. Nice hearing your voice this morning. That's a very squarely a business question, so I'll pass that one to Mike.\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes, thanks. Thanks, Jess. It's a great question. As we talked about when we did the INCREASE call, investor call last month. I think our belief is that it probably won't be straight line. We do think that there may be an initial bolus, I can't really quantify what that is right now, because I think we're still gathering that data through interactions with our physicians. So there may be an initial bolus, and then it may - it could dip a little bit, and then start to ramp back up. But I think it's - my belief based on what we're hearing right now is, I think it will be thinking about a big picture, a little bit slower than ramping up over the next 18 month period of time. And that's really just a function of getting the patients and getting them strained, getting them echoed on, getting the right heart cath. And I think there is still some - but there's scheduling, there's logistics and all of that stuff has to happen, and then you have to get the referrals, I think, get patients initiated on therapy. So that's really the reason for that. It has nothing to do I think with lack of awareness or lack of enthusiasm for Tyvaso indication. As we talked about last month there's certainly a lot of excitement about being able to have this to treatment armamentarium for pulmonary hypertension ILD.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Marty Auster with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nMartin Auster: Thanks Martine. I think this one is going to fall into the business question category as well. But I just wanted to check in with Mike, Tyvaso had some nice growth this year and obviously there's a lot of awareness and interest in the Group 3 PH-ILD indication that we're all hoping for approval on the PDUFA date coming up in April. Curious if you can maybe talk a little bit about, did you see any sort of increasing in terms of the breadth of prescribers of Tyvaso this year, where you're just seeing kind of a little - kind of better depth and uptake of existing base? Just curious if you could kind of comment as we're trying to think about how much - kind of how much of that growth is reflecting some early enthusiasm for the broadened indication. Thanks.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Marty. Great hearing your voice again today as well. You guessed it. Mike?\nMartin Auster: Having earned my paycheck today, that feels great. Yeah, so it's a little bit difficult to know the extent to which there is off-label used as a result of the increased data. All that we're able to track is the - is who is writing the referral. So to your point about being the prescriber base, that hasn't changed. The folks that are being writing Tyvaso, are our typical PAH prescribers. We have not seen a material change in that. We haven't seen really an uptick in new prescribers yet. We do expect that that's going to - that's going to occur after we had label expansion. So within that prescriber base, our usual prescriber base to the extent that they're seeing ILD patients, they could be writing for the indication. But by and large, the performance of Tyvaso is within our traditional PAH stocks. I think a lot of it has to do with the buzz around Tyvaso, the New England Journal and I think it's just a lot on the PAH side, just reminding physicians of what a great drug that is for PAH patients.\nMartine Rothblatt: Awesome. Thanks, Mike. Thank you, Marty. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nHartaj Singh: Great. Thank you for the question. Just a financial question. In 2020, you had a dip in your sales from losing Adcirca. James, I know you always talk about OpEx spend as being 50% of previous year's sales. However, in 2021, you're going to have potential launches, a lot of things going on. Just how to think about that, and then going forward also. Thank you for the question.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks Hartaj. Great hearing you online today. Hopefully, winter is not treating you too bad there in New York. And James, solid financial question.\nJames Edgemond: Yes. Thank you, Martine. Good morning, Hartaj. And as always good to hear your voice. Thanks for the question. So the budget algorithm that we have talked about historically that you referred to this morning where we plan our budget in a current year, for example 2021 based upon 50% of prior year revenues in total. So to your point around the decrease in sales, if you use Adcirca as an example, overall, we still need to maintain our budgets and our financial discipline with respect to our total revenues. So as revenues grow going forward, that means Unitarians in terms of their budgets will get additional funds for projects. With respect to your specific question on 2021, we still need to stay within our budget algorithm with all the activity that Martine and Michael talked about in terms of product launches and clinical development. We still need to make sure we stay within that budget algorithm. So our 2021 budgets are based upon 2020 revenues. And that's how we've built them and that's how we'll execute across the course of 2021. And all Unitherians know that in order to get more in additional budget dollars, we need to all grow revenue across the firm and that's what Martine talked about double-digit growth going forward. And that really is objective across United Therapeutics. So thanks for your question, Hartaj and Martine back to you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, James for your great answer. And it's really beautiful hearing you describe the budget algorithm because the vision that I have in my head is that we have not a 100 people rowing to grow the business of the Company like just the sales and marketing force, but we have a 1,000, the total head count of United Therapeutics all rowing in the same direction. The product development, the research and development, legal, financial, everybody is focused on a singular goal of growing the Company so that everybody there, everybody in the Company can have additional resources available to grow the projects that are nearest and dearest and center to their own career development experience. So that budget algorithm has had a excellent effect of kind of - you know, magnetically aligning all 1,000 Unitherians in the same positive direction. Thanks for bringing up that question. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. Martine, you talked about double-digit revenue growth. Just wondering, you know that I think, for 2021 that how sustainable is that longer-term and then on ralinepag, another important late-stage program for you guys, maybe any update on enrollment there and the potential timing of the data? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Sure. Thanks. I'm going to answer the first question, which is kind of, I guess more of like a strategic overall question and then I'm going to pass it to Dr. Peterson to answer the scientific question relating to ralinepag. So as to the durability of our revenue growth, I think it looks really strong, and that was the reason I wanted to kind of highlight in the introductory remarks that we're not talking about growing within kind of a single small finite crowded pond, which is a bit how I would describe Group 1 pulmonary hypertension, about ten approved drugs, roughly speaking, 50,000 U.S. patients. We are going to grow in that Group 1 pulmonary hypertension. But the durability of our growth, you know, throughout the 2020 doesn't depend just on Group 1 pulmonary hypertension. We've been on top of that, have this Group 3 community, which is one of their feet are in pulmonary fibrosis, which is the cause of their disease, and the other of their feet is in pulmonary hypertension which we know very well. And now, we are - we've done the necessary pivotal trial, executed to a level of scientific rigor and confidence that it enjoyed publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, and hopefully to be approved in April. Now with that launch, we would go into a patient population of approximately 30,000 patients who are almost are already being treated for their pulmonary fibrosis, but virtually none of them are being treated for their pulmonary hypertension because there was no drug approved to treat that. And that's why I mentioned at the beginning of the call, this is to me like you know kind of a very beautiful scenario. It's like when we started the Company a decade or two ago, there were maybe 20,000 pulmonary hypertension patients, and we were competing with Glaxo on the  side. We were competing with Actelion on the oral side. We were competing with another drug called Iloprost on the inhaled side. And those actually fragmented and then we had ten different competitors as we do to date, but still growing organically within Group 1. But in Group 3 there is none of that. There's 30,000 patients in need of a therapy and hopefully knock on wood, the - we will get approved in April and then we have an awesome therapy for them in Tyvaso. And then Mike just - you know, a year later, absolutely revolutionary therapy with the Tyvaso DPI product. So I think that's going to drive our growth for well beyond 2021, in fact for several years. And then, you know, one more thing, which I mentioned in the introductory remarks, is this pure pulmonary fibrosis population of 100,000 patients in the U.S., all being managed with a drug, which unfortunately reduces the rate of decline in their forced vital capacity, but does not improve it, does not modify the disease and we've got this very promising data from the INCREASE study that builds upon earlier bench-top data that shows actually there is disease modifying capability in Tyvaso for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. We need to now validate that hypothesis with the prospective study, which is what our TETON study is currently enrolling. So you add up the Group 1, the Group 3, the pulmonary fibrosis, not to mention the PERFECT study, and I think this growing our patients by double-digit rates is something that can be reasonably anticipated for the balance of the 2020. So with that answer to your business question or strategic question, let me shift over to Dr. Peterson to address the scientific question.\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. So basically you were asking about the ralinepag studies, and in spite of the pandemic, the enrollment in those studies especially the outcome study is going quite well. We still have a few sites that are open due to the pandemic, but of those sites, the majority of the sites are open and again they are enrolling quite well. This is - the outcome study is an international trial. So we have sites all over the world. And we have pretty - we have good enrollment, both in the U.S. as well as outside of the U.S. We're still planning to have the outcome study enrolled in 2022 and then have a readout in 2024. Now remember this study is endpoint driven, hence the name, outcome study. And so, not only do we have - need to have the patients enrolled, but we need to follow them and collect data on the disease progression of these patients, and then compare that in the two groups. So we expect a 2024 readout and a 2025 launch. We're also enrolling our  study. Now that study isn't endpoint driven it's change in peak VO2 from baseline to week 28, and we'll be enrolling 193 patients in that study, and that allows for dropout. And so if we don't have as many dropouts as maybe we put into the initial calculations, we could finish that trial sooner. But we're counting on them both to be finishing around the same time, at this point. We'll know more as enrollment progresses and the sites continue to open up.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, Dr. Peterson. Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: We have no telephone questions in queue at this time.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Thank you so much. Well everybody, I would really like to express our appreciation for you participating in this quarterly earnings call covering the fourth quarter of 2020, full year 2020. As promised at the beginning, it's going - it was going to be a really great call, and it was. We had so many good questions. And it's been the pleasure of Mike Benkowitz, James Edgemond, Dewey and Dr. Peterson and myself to join you this morning. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation conference call.

            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Martine and good morning Eun. You're right, we do owe MannKind royalties related to patients that use the DPI going forward. And as you've probably recognized and noted in the financial statements, we have historically made milestone payment and we achieved these milestones under our agreement with MannKind. Going forward, there are limited milestones with respect to pursuing other indications. So our main financial obligation as you kind of referred to is fully around our royalty obligation for new patients going to DPI. And as for kind of your question around gross margin, you're getting very specific in terms of what it would be acting overall, because we don't necessarily anticipate breaking out Tyvaso or DPI versus the current nebulizer. Yes. Thank you, Martine. Good morning, Hartaj. And as always good to hear your voice. Thanks for the question. So the budget algorithm that we have talked about historically that you referred to this morning where we plan our budget in a current year, for example 2021 based upon 50% of prior year revenues in total. So to your point around the decrease in sales, if you use Adcirca as an example, overall, we still need to maintain our budgets and our financial discipline with respect to our total revenues. So as revenues grow going forward, that means Unitarians in terms of their budgets will get additional funds for projects. With respect to your specific question on 2021, we still need to stay within our budget algorithm with all the activity that Martine and Michael talked about in terms of product launches and clinical development. We still need to make sure we stay within that budget algorithm. So our 2021 budgets are based upon 2020 revenues. And that's how we've built them and that's how we'll execute across the course of 2021. And all Unitherians know that in order to get more in additional budget dollars, we need to all grow revenue across the firm and that's what Martine talked about double-digit growth going forward. And that really is objective across United Therapeutics. So thanks for your question, Hartaj and Martine back to you."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of the third quarter 2020 financial results and business activities of United Therapeutics. Martine?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Dewey. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call for 2020. I'm going to be joined on the call today by our President, Michael Benkowitz; our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond; and our Head of Product Development, Dr. Leigh Peterson. We really have all good news to report today. So it's going to be a very fun earnings call. Let me divide the good news into two categories: pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. Let's start with pulmonary hypertension. We had over the past quarter the highest number of patients on our treprostinil medicines ever. In addition to that, we've seen double-digit growth in the number of our patients on Orenitram and the number of patients on Tyvaso, that's double-digit growth year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter. On top of that, we've also had solid Remodulin performance. And we expect this solid Remodulin performance to be even further enhanced with two planned launches for 2021. First, the Remunity launch for the patient on subcutaneous forms of Remodulin; and secondly, the ISR or Implantable System for Remodulin launch for patients on the intravenous form of Remodulin. These new product launches are important, because most pulmonary hypertension patients declined Remodulin due to its grave difficulty of delivery. Indeed, most pulmonary hypertension patients die without ever having access to Remodulin therapy. Speaking of our pipeline for pulmonary hypertension, also of great significance is our accelerating progress on ralinepag. We expect both the ralinepag outcomes and the ralinepag capacity Phase 3 trials to be half enrolled in 2021 and fully enrolled by the end of 2022. Let me then to some of the good news related to pulmonary fibrosis. We remain on schedule to launch our Tyvaso product for IPF-associated pulmonary hypertension in April '21, subject to FDA approval on its PDUFA date. We expect to further penetrate that 30,000 patients market for patients with pulmonary fibrosis associated pulmonary hypertension with the launch of our Dreamboat TreT product by the end of 2021 or possibly early-2022. I'd like to remind everyone that systemic drugs for treating this type of pulmonary hypertension, the pulmonary fibrosis associated pulmonary hypertension are contraindicated, leaving Tyvaso as probably the only medicine approved by the FDA to treat this 30,000-patient population. We then expect to greatly expand our pulmonary fibrosis footprint with our TETON study in pure pulmonary fibrosis patients starting in the first quarter of '21. Indeed, we will be filing the IND for this TETON study next quarter. That 400-patient study should be completely enrolled by '22. So there is a lot of things that are happening both not only in our core historical franchise of pulmonary hypertension, but you can also see that the Company is making a steady adjacent market expansion into the field of pulmonary fibrosis first by having kind of one leg in two camps with the Group 3 pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary fibrosis and then with the other leg completely in the pulmonary fibrosis side of the fence with the TETON study. While I've been talking about our pipeline, let me also talk about things that are going on at the Phase 1 and what I would call the Phase 0.9 level of our pipeline. So with regard to Phase 1, in the - in early-2021, we will begin clinical development of our once-daily form of Orenitram based on an IND that will be going in shortly. This will be a much more convenient for patients than the three times daily form of Orenitram and I think will be instrumental in continuing the double-digit growth that we're currently seeing year-over-year in Orenitram. Another exciting activity that I would say is that the Phase 0.9 level is RemoPro. This is the pain-less form of subcutaneous Remodulin, designed ultimately to go into the Remunity Pump. We plan to file our IND in the fourth quarter of '21, and then move into Phase 1 right after that in '22. Speaking of filing INDs in '21, another IND we plan to file in '21 is for our xenokidney project. This is a 10-gene modified porcine kidney designed specifically to avoid the types of rejection that are common in xenografting and instead to appear to the recipient as no different than another allograft. We expect to file the IND for the xenokidney program in '21. And then, due to the unique nature of that type of a product move directly into a Phase 2/3 study in '22. With that overview of our clinical development and pipeline activities, I'd like to next turn the microphone to our President, Michael Benkowitz, to give a review of other aspects of our operations, including commercialization. Michael?\nMichael Benkowitz: Great. Thanks, Martine. Good morning, everyone. As Martine said, overall, we're extremely pleased with our reported revenue performance in the third quarter, highlighted by strong double-digit year-over-year growth at Orenitram, Tyvaso and Unituxin. And when you adjust our revenue growth to account for the Excess Order that occurred by one of our distributors in the third quarter of 2019, that growth is even stronger. On this adjusted basis, US Remodulin revenues grew year-over-year and 5% sequentially, and Tyvaso and Orenitram revenues grew by approximately 30% each year-over-year. We periodically caution that our revenues represent sales to our distributors and may not reflect underlying demand for our products. Happily, we can report that revenue growth we saw in Q3 is supported by growing demand in the US as reflected by the following highlights during the quarter. First, after experiencing some COVID-related softness in new patient start earlier during the pandemic, total treprostinil starts returned to pre-pandemic levels during the quarter. Second, as Martine noted, the number of patients utilizing one of our treprostinil products reached another all-time high. This is the fourth quarter in a row that we've achieved an active patient census record for our treprostinil products. We have a record number of patients benefiting from Orenitram, reflecting continuing and increasing adoption of this therapy by physicians following the FREEDOM-EV label expansion last year. We have more patients benefiting from Tyvaso than we have had in approximately five years prior to the commercial availability of oral prostacyclin class medicines. And finally, we are just shy of a record number of patients utilizing Remodulin. In addition to those highlights, we're seeing increases in average dose levels and a length of time our patients stay on our medicines, both of which positively impact our revenues. So we're very pleased all the way around with the momentum and trending of our commercial products. Meanwhile, we are making very good progress towards our near-term new product launches. We are building out our field-based medical sales and nursing teams to support the expected Tyvaso label expansion in April 2021 to include patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease following our INCREASE trial. We have started engaging with physicians that treat these patients which by and large as a new prescriber base compared to those currently prescribing our products for PAH and appropriate forums such as investigator meetings, scientific presentations at healthcare conferences, advisory boards, market research and one-on-one interactions. The INCREASE data is roundly considered overwhelmingly positive and the ILD treating community is looking for Tyvaso in their treatment armamentarium for these very sick patients upon FDA approval. Between the momentum we're seeing with Tyvaso and its approved WHO Group 1 indication and the excitement around the upcoming launch into WHO Group 3, we're well on our way to solidifying Tyvaso as our largest product in the very near-term. Our two upcoming Remodulin pump launches are also progressing. In the case of Remunity, our new subcu pump that was approved by the FDA earlier this year, we believe, we have overcome the COVID-related delays that impacted the July launch timing. Our partner, DEKA Research, is building commercial inventory. And once we have sufficient safety stock, which we expect soon, we'll be again making the Remunity Pumps commercially available. And finally, our partner, Medtronic, continues their discussions with the FDA to clear the outstanding conditions of approval for the ISR, which is our new IV pump. We believe, we remain on track for a launch next year and we are already working with key PAH centers to get them ready for this launch. So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike. Operator, I'm now happy to field the calls, and I'll direct them amongst Dr. Peterson, James Edgemond and Mike Benkowitz as appropriate.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nHartaj Singh: Great. Thank you. And a really, really good quarter, Martine and team. So, thank you. Just a quick question on Tyvaso. We're seeing a definite uptick in the trend growth over the last few quarters, Martine, as you mentioned, year-on-year double-digit growth. Key opinion leader calls, we've noticed that there is a lot of overlap between the physicians treating PAH using Tyvaso there and physicians treating PAH ILD. Do you expect a lot of this enthusiasm to be occurring in those patients and then also Tyvaso uptick in that Group 3 patients occurring there? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Hartaj. Excellent question and good to hear your voice this morning. I think, the best person on this call to field the question would be Mike, because he is right in the middle of all of the details right now of actually assigning different regional sales managers and their teams amongst the different types of physicians those who treat patients with ILD that have never seen really pulmonary hypertension patient treatment options and those who are normal PAH treatment physicians that then in addition to that also treat patients with PAH associated with their ILD. So Mike would really have the best answers for that. And Mike, if you could provide some color on Hartaj's question.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Thanks, Hartaj, for the question. I think the short answer to the question is, it's hard to tell when physicians are writing or submitting referrals or prescriptions for Tyvaso, they're not indicating whether it's a PH-ILD patient or a PAH patient. So, it's a little hard to tell if there's some off-label use in that group. What I can tell you though about the treating community is, and as I said in my opening remarks, we do see some differences in that group. I mean, we - by our account in terms of those physicians that are treating PAH and those that are treating ILD, there is maybe only about a 20% to 25% overlap and there's sort of an inverse relationship between the number of PAH patients those doctors see and the number of ILD patients those doctors see. In other words, if you've got a doctor that sees a lot of PAH patients are seeing very few ILD patients and vice versa. So, what we can see on the referral form are the doctors that are writing the prescriptions. And so what we haven't seen is a lot of new prescribers, which tells us obviously that all of the vast, vast majority of these type Tyvaso prescriptions are coming in are being submitted by your typical PAH doctors. And given the just sort of the, I think, the underlying data that we see would lead me to believe that the vast, vast majority are for PAH patients, but again we don't have the visibility to know exactly whether they are PAH or PH-ILD.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike. That's a great response. Hartaj, one little footnote I'd add to Mike's response is, it's very interesting to me just having studied this field for quite a bit that there are this very substantial quantity of patients in the Group 3, WHO Group 3 type of pulmonary hypertension, over 30,000 patients that for those patients, the systemic drugs are contraindicated. So here in the field of Group 1 WHO, we have upwards of 12 different medicines available to treat pulmonary hypertension. And there are just about as many Group 3 patients as Group 1 patients, but there are zero no approved medicines to treat those Group 3 patients. So it's a screaming unmet medical need. And we are just crossing every finger we could cross that on - in April on the PDUFA date that the FDA will give us clearance to translate the INCREASE clinical trial results into an approved treatment for those 30,000 patients that would be the only approved treatment for those patients. It was a great trial, the INCREASE trial, as you are well aware, Hartaj, we met all of our primary and secondary endpoints. So I think there is going to be a tremendous amount of excitement amongst the physicians that finally they have something to treat those 30,000 patients with. Thanks so much again. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nEun Yang: Thank you. For Tyvaso in new indication PH-ILD, can you comment on your regulatory filing ex-US? And then for TreT, it to use in PH-ILD, do you expect you would need to run another switching study similar to Phase 3 BREEZE? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. Thank you, Eun, for those very interesting questions and exploring some kind of areas that a lot of people overlook. So I'm glad you've asked those questions. At this point in time, we haven't made a firm decision with regard to the European filing schedule, mostly because we're just like laser focused on gaining FDA approval to deal with this huge unmet medical need that I just talked about, the 30,000 patients here. So we are kind of like a step-by-step strategy here, and first we want to be able to successfully get approval into the US, and then we'll consider what is the best approach to go as to Europe. The second part of your question is also quite insightful, because the Dreamboat TreT device is a much easier to use device than the Opti-Neb nebulizer that that we used in the INCREASE study and that we submitted for FDA approval on. And I think, most people feel that whatever the captured market would be for this nebulizer, that dry powder Dreamboat device could give you two, maybe three times larger market, because of its greater convenience. So, as you mentioned, Eun, we did - we do plan to file for approval of the Dreamboat device based on the current BREEZE study in the April - in April of 2021 and then that would take its normal FDA approval period. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, hopefully, we can get that approved if not by the end of '21, then at the very beginning of '22. Now whether or not that Dreamboat TreT device is approved for just WHO Group 1, pulmonary hypertension, which is the population in which we did our BREEZE study or is also going to be approved for the WHO Group 3 population, that would be a decision which is, of course, up to the FDA. What we will do to support that decision and provide guidance is as soon as we wrap up the filing based on the BREEZE 1 study in the WHO Group 1 population, we will immediately begin a BREEZE 2 study in the ILD population or the WHO Group 3 population. And that way, we will at least have that data available for the FDA. If they feel that they are not comfortable to approve Dreamboat in Group 3 without some data, we should have that data by the time they would reach their PDUFA date for approving the BREEZE device in the Group 1 population. If for any reason things take a little longer, we'll have that data immediately available. I don't think it's really going to be of much consequence, because, in fact, the desperation in the WHO Group 3 population for any treatment is so large that the Opti-Neb-based nebulizer-based form of Tyvaso, I think, will be very rapidly taken up, but you always want to keep building on your momentum and making it easier for larger and larger patient populations to avail themselves of Tyvaso. So we will be right on with BREEZE 2 data for the ILD population will be right on that immediately after completing the BREEZE 1 filing. Thanks for your question, Eun. Next question, operator.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Marty Auster with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMartin Auster: Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Martine, will you indulge my two-decade tenure to let me ask two questions again?\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes, Dr. Auster. One for being Marty and one for being doctor.\nMartin Auster: Thank you kindly. So, a couple of things I want to follow up on. First on TreT; you reported the healthy volunteer kind of part of that study was done. Can you comment at all on the what that data looks like in the equivalents to what you've seen with Tyvaso? And then can you also talk on TreT about what the supply means that you're anticipating would be and if you think you'll be able to kind of meet where the demand for that new device and that new system might be if you were approved on a first pass approval? The second question was on the xeno organ side. I think there is something like 20,000, 25,000 kidneys transplanted in the US each year. You probably know the number more specifically. But if you could, comment maybe on what the overall big picture opportunity? I know there is a very long wait list and I know there is lot of people that don't, they don't get served. What is the kind of addressable big picture market opportunity there and when do you need to think about pulling the trigger to make decisions on expanding and building out your DPF capabilities to kind of start thinking about how to meet some of that long-term demand? Thanks.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Thanks, Marty. Fascinating questions. Kind of things we could like talk in a coffee house for hours over, if we could talk in a coffee house. But with regard to the first question on BREEZE, the PK data, the buildup of TreT devices, Dr. Peterson, if you could, at least, talk about the PK side. And if you feel comfortable talking about the inventory side roll into that. And if not, I'll talk about that at the front end of xeno stuff.\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. Sure. Hi, everyone. Thank you all for calling in. Great to speak with you. So, you all know that the TreT study in healthy volunteers, that was - the primary objective of that was to show comparable PK between Tyvaso and TreT. And that has been completed and we're actually undergoing the data analysis right now. So I don't have the final output package to discuss with you. But I will tell you that - I mean, this was an open label study and we're seeing consistent results between the two medications. We're actually seeing - it appeared at least in early on that the TreT device actually seems to penetrate the lung a little bit better than Tyvaso with Opti-Neb, but that also might be because as you all might know, TreT, you get your entire dose from like one to two breaths. And so, you just need a tiny little cartridge. And if you breathe it in, and then you get the full dose, whereas with Tyvaso it can take like 9 or 10 or it takes several different breaths to - multiple breaths to get the full dose. And so, that can explain the lung penetration. But again, the final data are being analyzed literally as I'm speaking, and we will be able to get that up to you very shortly, but we definitely do not expect any surprises there.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Dr. Peterson. Thank you very much. So with regard to the inventory, Marty, I think, we're going to be in good shape. In fact, just this week, at the request of our Head of Manufacturing, Pat Poisson, we allocated $5 million for inventory buildup for the TreT launch during 2021. So, he regularly visits the MannKind plant in Connecticut, where we do the manufacturing of everything. And I feel confident that we'll have adequate supply to meet our needs. As you probably recall from reviewing our proxy, how one of our companies for companywide objective is upon which everybody's bonus is based in the entire company is that we have to have a two-year inventory of all commercially launched products at the rate of the product take-up. So Mike Benkowitz and his commercial team, they would provide a forecast to manufacturing in terms of how many Dreamboat TreT patients we expect to garner in the first 12 months after launch, which would be mostly a 2022 thing. And then, so already in 2021, Pat Poisson and our manufacturing team are making sure that we have 2 times that amount of inventory built up for at the time of launch, so that we can crush that manufacturing and inventory milestone as we actually always have every year for as far back as I can remember. With regard to the xeno question, I think, your numbers are quite accurate, Marty. There are 20,000-plus kidney transplants done. If you get into what are called living related kidney transplants, where people designate a kidney to a relative or something like that, you get up into the 35,000 type of category. And the next number that comes up a lot is 100,000 people are waiting for kidney transplants and are currently on dialysis. And then the next number that comes up is that there is something like 300,000 people in need of a kidney transplant, but for various and sundry reasons, they are not even able to access dialysis. So, it is probably one of the largest unmet medical needs in the United States. It's not unrelated to the very high levels of diabetes in the United States, but that's not the only reason for end-stage renal disease. So kidney transplantation is a cure for end-stage renal disease. And people such as ourselves have been working many years in order to have an unlimited supply of transplantable kidneys that would be well-tolerated by the recipients. And I think that's what we are on the cusp of here. We've spent several years not knocking out or knocking in gene after gene and then testing the results to make sure that we had really the ideal level and the ideal combination of genes that have been knocked in or knocked out. And then we've also constructed a pathogen-free facility, which is the xeno equivalent of a good manufacturing product in Alabama. And it is those kidneys coming out of that DPF facility, which would be the first ones going into the clinic, which is why I mentioned that we expect to file an IND in 2021 based on kidneys coming out of that DPF. In terms of when we would pull the trigger on building a commercial scale DPF, the one I just referred to in Alabama is a clinical trial scale DPF. The commercial scale DPF will take a couple of years to build and bring into operation. So I think the right time to pull the trigger on that would be once we have a successful result in the first clinical xenokidney transplant and with the - as mentioned in the beginning of the call, with the IND going in '21, so we will know in '22 whether we have a successful xenokidney product. And so that would be the time to pull the trigger. We have already completely designed the facility, using our design architects at EwingCole company in Philadelphia. They specialize in bio agro type of manufacturing designs. So, we have a well vetted design that's been reviewed by all of the experts in controlling viruses and microbes and whatnot in animal populations. So, I think we're ready to like sign a contract pretty rapidly and proceed with the construction and then that whole facility could be brought into operation sometime during 2024. Thanks for the question, Marty. And operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Joseph Thome with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoseph Thome: Hi there. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the great quarter. Just a little bit on Tyvaso in ILD, can you comment a little bit on how well these patients are identified currently given that as you mentioned, there really aren't great treatment options for patients? Do you anticipate that the potential approval of Tyvaso in the indication will change this paradigm and is it your expectation that there are some PH-ILD patients sort of built up and waiting for launch? Thanks.\nMartine Rothblatt: Sure. Let me suggest like we give you a two-part answer to that question, with the first part being given by Dr. Peterson, because she was ultimately in charge of the INCREASE study that produce the clinical result in the ILD patients, so she could speak most expertly about those results and which were reported at the abstract level at the ATS conference, and I believe are imminently going to be appearing in a peer-reviewed publication. So she could talk about kind of the medical thing of how well it worked in those patients. And then Mike Benkowitz, our President, who has spent a lot of time thinking about the market segmentation and the approach to the market, can speak more about the second part of your question. Dr. Peterson?\nLeigh Peterson: Yes, sure. So, as you know, Tyvaso works quite well in the patient population 2/3  population. And this is - this was ILD plus pulmonary hypertension. And in this population, for the INCREASE study, the patients actually did have data from a right heart caths, okay? So they had documented pulmonary hypertension. And up until now, since there was no medication for this group, the doctors didn't really if they suspected IPS, they - or even suspected pulmonary hypertension in this population, they didn't give the patients necessarily a right heart cath, because even if they did discover PAH, there was nothing to treat them, so why go through all of that invasive procedure in order to find that out. So, we've heard several times that now that there is a treatment, they will be performing those right heart caths to see the degree of pulmonary hypertension, because they do have - they presumably will have an approved treatment relatively soon. So, yes, the identification of this population will definitely be more robust since we have something to give them. And again, also with what Martine said about the publication, so we do expect to publish these results in a major medical journal very shortly, prior to the PDUFA date of April. So that's definitely will - what we've also heard from the docs is that once we have that published that gives them even additional confidence in looking for this - for pulmonary hypertension in this patient population. And yes, we'll likely - they have said they will either prescribe or certainly be waiting for the approval if they feel comfortable. So I hope that answers the question.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Dr. Peterson. That was great answer. And Mike, would you like to add some color on that that we're getting from all of our medical sales teams?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. I agree with everything Leigh said. I think the - there is a lot of pent-up demand. There is also, I think, an - there has been, I think, an under-diagnosis of PH-ILD for the reasons that Dr. Peterson stated, which is you have these physicians that may suspect pulmonary hypertension, that suspicion typically happens as the - obviously, as the symptoms become more severe and present themselves. But because there is no treatment out there, the doctors are putting the patients through very invasive procedure of the right heart cath. All of our interactions with physicians, be it advisory boards, healthcare - scientific presentations at healthcare conferences, interactions with our medical team suggest that now that there is a treatment available, these physicians suspect that significant percentages of their patient population have pulmonary hypertension and well start to really screen and diagnose those patients appropriately. So - and that's really a large part of what we're doing right now to prepare for the launch in April as we've got our medical teams out, educate - certainly the key opinion leaders in the field understand the disease and understand the pulmonary hypertension piece related to interstitial lung disease. But as you get into some of the community physicians, we're spending a lot of time educating them on PH-ILD, how do you screen for these patients, how do - What are the things that may lead you to suspect, okay, this patient has pulmonary hypertension and then how do you go about arranging for right heart cath to confirm the diagnosis?\nMartine Rothblatt: Great. Thanks, Mike. Operator, there's time for one bonus question here. Do you have another person lined up?\nOperator: I do. Our next question comes from the line of Liana Moussatos with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMartine Rothblatt: That's excellent. Okay. Hi, Liana. Good morning.\nLiana Moussatos: Good morning. Thank you. Since COVID continues to be a problem and infection rates are going up and it's affecting our industry, clinical trials and commercialization, can you just give us a brief overview of what has to happen and when do you think the timing of this could be resolved between now and maybe end of '21?\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. It's like one of these kind of 30,000 foot questions that cover everything. In our Company, Liana, we have a risk management group that reports in to our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond. And this risk management group ultimately has group meetings that involve as many as like 50, 60, 70 people at United Therapeutics and every week they issue a report regarding COVID-19 and how it affects all the different parts of the Company. So, James, maybe if you could, provide some color for, Liana's question in terms of the overall impact of COVID-19 on United Therapeutics and when we see - based on inputs we're getting from our risk management group, when we see some of those effects perhaps ameliorating.\nJames Edgemond: Yes. Thank you, Martine. And Liana, good to hear your voice. So as Martine mentioned, internally way back to the beginning part of this year we organized a leadership team to make sure that across the organization we were communicating effectively and coordinating with each other with respect to risk management and the impacts around COVID-19 on all areas of the business, from human capital to manufacturing, to clinical trials, product development through specialty pharmaceutical distributors. And it's been a really effective tool for us to make sure that across the organization everybody is in tune to what impacts there are to the organization as a whole. And I think broadly speaking, everybody has stepped up, all the Unitarians, as we call ourselves internally, has stepped up to make sure that we have understood the various risks and the impacts not only internally, but to those of our patients and those importantly to the patients and individuals in the clinical trials, both that were enrolled, that continued to be enrolled, as well as those that were back to enter clinical trials that we may have shut down as we talked about and we've begun to reopen some of those based upon the opportunities and really the hotspots around the country or around the globe. So broadly speaking, I think, Martine is right, it's been a coordinated effort to really understand and prepare and execute to make sure as an organization we can continue again for the Unitarians or patients at large. From a standpoint of when we think things will get better, we hope for the best as everybody does in the near-term. But we're going to need to stay vigilant around all aspects of the organization to make sure that we can continue to perform as an organization. And so, I think, as things unfold and we all continue to get better educated and educated on the multiple aspects, we'll certainly continue to communicate in our public filings and on conference calls in various questions, but it's something that we'll continue to take seriously as everybody is doing to make sure the business at whole and at large continue to move forward. So, back to you, Martine.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, James. To wrap up, everybody on the earnings call, we've had a great quarter. I think this quarter and perhaps more generally this half of the year, will be looked at in retrospect as a key pivot point for United Therapeutics. This will be the time when we pivoted from being solely a pulmonary hypertension company to becoming both a pulmonary hypertension company, as well as a pulmonary fibrosis and other forms of interstitial lung disease company. You can see this pivot in us moving into a group of pulmonary hypertension patients WHO Group 3, as to whom pulmonary hypertension is not their primary problem, their primary problem is interstitial lung disease. It's of course gravely worsened by the pulmonary hypertension, but the source of their pulmonary hypertension is ultimately interstitial lung disease. So, for the first time, we're moving into a group of patients for whom pulmonary hypertension is not their number one problem, if you will. And secondly, for the first time, we're moving into a large Phase 3 study in which patients do not have pulmonary hypertension at all, they simply have this form of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis. If you take a look at a diagram of all of the species and sub-species of interstitial lung disease, you'll see it is a very large and diverse population. And we were really pleased to see in the outcome of our INCREASE study that we actually were able to modify the disease. In other words, not only slow the rate of decline and forced vital capacity, but actually improve forced vital capacity in the patients with pulmonary fibrosis, as well as a couple of other subsets of interstitial lung disease. So, it's a very exciting time here at United Therapeutics. You always hope that you can be strong at your home base and then expand from that. And with this adjacency of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension, we have a very logical and solid basis from which to expand our footprint in providing more and better healthcare to ever larger numbers of people. Thank you so much for your time and attention this morning. Look forward to seeing you at upcoming healthcare conferences. Operator, you can wrap up.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation conference call.

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Martine. Good morning, everyone. As Martine said, overall, we're extremely pleased with our reported revenue performance in the third quarter, highlighted by strong double-digit year-over-year growth at Orenitram, Tyvaso and Unituxin. And when you adjust our revenue growth to account for the Excess Order that occurred by one of our distributors in the third quarter of 2019, that growth is even stronger. On this adjusted basis, US Remodulin revenues grew year-over-year and 5% sequentially, and Tyvaso and Orenitram revenues grew by approximately 30% each year-over-year. We periodically caution that our revenues represent sales to our distributors and may not reflect underlying demand for our products. Happily, we can report that revenue growth we saw in Q3 is supported by growing demand in the US as reflected by the following highlights during the quarter. First, after experiencing some COVID-related softness in new patient start earlier during the pandemic, total treprostinil starts returned to pre-pandemic levels during the quarter. Second, as Martine noted, the number of patients utilizing one of our treprostinil products reached another all-time high. This is the fourth quarter in a row that we've achieved an active patient census record for our treprostinil products. We have a record number of patients benefiting from Orenitram, reflecting continuing and increasing adoption of this therapy by physicians following the FREEDOM-EV label expansion last year. We have more patients benefiting from Tyvaso than we have had in approximately five years prior to the commercial availability of oral prostacyclin class medicines. And finally, we are just shy of a record number of patients utilizing Remodulin. In addition to those highlights, we're seeing increases in average dose levels and a length of time our patients stay on our medicines, both of which positively impact our revenues. So we're very pleased all the way around with the momentum and trending of our commercial products. Meanwhile, we are making very good progress towards our near-term new product launches. We are building out our field-based medical sales and nursing teams to support the expected Tyvaso label expansion in April 2021 to include patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease following our INCREASE trial. We have started engaging with physicians that treat these patients which by and large as a new prescriber base compared to those currently prescribing our products for PAH and appropriate forums such as investigator meetings, scientific presentations at healthcare conferences, advisory boards, market research and one-on-one interactions. The INCREASE data is roundly considered overwhelmingly positive and the ILD treating community is looking for Tyvaso in their treatment armamentarium for these very sick patients upon FDA approval. Between the momentum we're seeing with Tyvaso and its approved WHO Group 1 indication and the excitement around the upcoming launch into WHO Group 3, we're well on our way to solidifying Tyvaso as our largest product in the very near-term. Our two upcoming Remodulin pump launches are also progressing. In the case of Remunity, our new subcu pump that was approved by the FDA earlier this year, we believe, we have overcome the COVID-related delays that impacted the July launch timing. Our partner, DEKA Research, is building commercial inventory. And once we have sufficient safety stock, which we expect soon, we'll be again making the Remunity Pumps commercially available. And finally, our partner, Medtronic, continues their discussions with the FDA to clear the outstanding conditions of approval for the ISR, which is our new IV pump. We believe, we remain on track for a launch next year and we are already working with key PAH centers to get them ready for this launch. So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine. Sure. Thanks, Hartaj, for the question. I think the short answer to the question is, it's hard to tell when physicians are writing or submitting referrals or prescriptions for Tyvaso, they're not indicating whether it's a PH-ILD patient or a PAH patient. So, it's a little hard to tell if there's some off-label use in that group. What I can tell you though about the treating community is, and as I said in my opening remarks, we do see some differences in that group. I mean, we - by our account in terms of those physicians that are treating PAH and those that are treating ILD, there is maybe only about a 20% to 25% overlap and there's sort of an inverse relationship between the number of PAH patients those doctors see and the number of ILD patients those doctors see. In other words, if you've got a doctor that sees a lot of PAH patients are seeing very few ILD patients and vice versa. So, what we can see on the referral form are the doctors that are writing the prescriptions. And so what we haven't seen is a lot of new prescribers, which tells us obviously that all of the vast, vast majority of these type Tyvaso prescriptions are coming in are being submitted by your typical PAH doctors. And given the just sort of the, I think, the underlying data that we see would lead me to believe that the vast, vast majority are for PAH patients, but again we don't have the visibility to know exactly whether they are PAH or PH-ILD. Sure. I agree with everything Leigh said. I think the - there is a lot of pent-up demand. There is also, I think, an - there has been, I think, an under-diagnosis of PH-ILD for the reasons that Dr. Peterson stated, which is you have these physicians that may suspect pulmonary hypertension, that suspicion typically happens as the - obviously, as the symptoms become more severe and present themselves. But because there is no treatment out there, the doctors are putting the patients through very invasive procedure of the right heart cath. All of our interactions with physicians, be it advisory boards, healthcare - scientific presentations at healthcare conferences, interactions with our medical team suggest that now that there is a treatment available, these physicians suspect that significant percentages of their patient population have pulmonary hypertension and well start to really screen and diagnose those patients appropriately. So - and that's really a large part of what we're doing right now to prepare for the launch in April as we've got our medical teams out, educate - certainly the key opinion leaders in the field understand the disease and understand the pulmonary hypertension piece related to interstitial lung disease. But as you get into some of the community physicians, we're spending a lot of time educating them on PH-ILD, how do you screen for these patients, how do - What are the things that may lead you to suspect, okay, this patient has pulmonary hypertension and then how do you go about arranging for right heart cath to confirm the diagnosis?"
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Leigh Peterson",
            "content": "Yes. Sure. Hi, everyone. Thank you all for calling in. Great to speak with you. So, you all know that the TreT study in healthy volunteers, that was - the primary objective of that was to show comparable PK between Tyvaso and TreT. And that has been completed and we're actually undergoing the data analysis right now. So I don't have the final output package to discuss with you. But I will tell you that - I mean, this was an open label study and we're seeing consistent results between the two medications. We're actually seeing - it appeared at least in early on that the TreT device actually seems to penetrate the lung a little bit better than Tyvaso with Opti-Neb, but that also might be because as you all might know, TreT, you get your entire dose from like one to two breaths. And so, you just need a tiny little cartridge. And if you breathe it in, and then you get the full dose, whereas with Tyvaso it can take like 9 or 10 or it takes several different breaths to - multiple breaths to get the full dose. And so, that can explain the lung penetration. But again, the final data are being analyzed literally as I'm speaking, and we will be able to get that up to you very shortly, but we definitely do not expect any surprises there. Yes, sure. So, as you know, Tyvaso works quite well in the patient population 2/3  population. And this is - this was ILD plus pulmonary hypertension. And in this population, for the INCREASE study, the patients actually did have data from a right heart caths, okay? So they had documented pulmonary hypertension. And up until now, since there was no medication for this group, the doctors didn't really if they suspected IPS, they - or even suspected pulmonary hypertension in this population, they didn't give the patients necessarily a right heart cath, because even if they did discover PAH, there was nothing to treat them, so why go through all of that invasive procedure in order to find that out. So, we've heard several times that now that there is a treatment, they will be performing those right heart caths to see the degree of pulmonary hypertension, because they do have - they presumably will have an approved treatment relatively soon. So, yes, the identification of this population will definitely be more robust since we have something to give them. And again, also with what Martine said about the publication, so we do expect to publish these results in a major medical journal very shortly, prior to the PDUFA date of April. So that's definitely will - what we've also heard from the docs is that once we have that published that gives them even additional confidence in looking for this - for pulmonary hypertension in this patient population. And yes, we'll likely - they have said they will either prescribe or certainly be waiting for the approval if they feel comfortable. So I hope that answers the question."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thank you, Dewey. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call for 2020. I'm going to be joined on the call today by our President, Michael Benkowitz; our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond; and our Head of Product Development, Dr. Leigh Peterson. We really have all good news to report today. So it's going to be a very fun earnings call. Let me divide the good news into two categories: pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. Let's start with pulmonary hypertension. We had over the past quarter the highest number of patients on our treprostinil medicines ever. In addition to that, we've seen double-digit growth in the number of our patients on Orenitram and the number of patients on Tyvaso, that's double-digit growth year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter. On top of that, we've also had solid Remodulin performance. And we expect this solid Remodulin performance to be even further enhanced with two planned launches for 2021. First, the Remunity launch for the patient on subcutaneous forms of Remodulin; and secondly, the ISR or Implantable System for Remodulin launch for patients on the intravenous form of Remodulin. These new product launches are important, because most pulmonary hypertension patients declined Remodulin due to its grave difficulty of delivery. Indeed, most pulmonary hypertension patients die without ever having access to Remodulin therapy. Speaking of our pipeline for pulmonary hypertension, also of great significance is our accelerating progress on ralinepag. We expect both the ralinepag outcomes and the ralinepag capacity Phase 3 trials to be half enrolled in 2021 and fully enrolled by the end of 2022. Let me then to some of the good news related to pulmonary fibrosis. We remain on schedule to launch our Tyvaso product for IPF-associated pulmonary hypertension in April '21, subject to FDA approval on its PDUFA date. We expect to further penetrate that 30,000 patients market for patients with pulmonary fibrosis associated pulmonary hypertension with the launch of our Dreamboat TreT product by the end of 2021 or possibly early-2022. I'd like to remind everyone that systemic drugs for treating this type of pulmonary hypertension, the pulmonary fibrosis associated pulmonary hypertension are contraindicated, leaving Tyvaso as probably the only medicine approved by the FDA to treat this 30,000-patient population. We then expect to greatly expand our pulmonary fibrosis footprint with our TETON study in pure pulmonary fibrosis patients starting in the first quarter of '21. Indeed, we will be filing the IND for this TETON study next quarter. That 400-patient study should be completely enrolled by '22. So there is a lot of things that are happening both not only in our core historical franchise of pulmonary hypertension, but you can also see that the Company is making a steady adjacent market expansion into the field of pulmonary fibrosis first by having kind of one leg in two camps with the Group 3 pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary fibrosis and then with the other leg completely in the pulmonary fibrosis side of the fence with the TETON study. While I've been talking about our pipeline, let me also talk about things that are going on at the Phase 1 and what I would call the Phase 0.9 level of our pipeline. So with regard to Phase 1, in the - in early-2021, we will begin clinical development of our once-daily form of Orenitram based on an IND that will be going in shortly. This will be a much more convenient for patients than the three times daily form of Orenitram and I think will be instrumental in continuing the double-digit growth that we're currently seeing year-over-year in Orenitram. Another exciting activity that I would say is that the Phase 0.9 level is RemoPro. This is the pain-less form of subcutaneous Remodulin, designed ultimately to go into the Remunity Pump. We plan to file our IND in the fourth quarter of '21, and then move into Phase 1 right after that in '22. Speaking of filing INDs in '21, another IND we plan to file in '21 is for our xenokidney project. This is a 10-gene modified porcine kidney designed specifically to avoid the types of rejection that are common in xenografting and instead to appear to the recipient as no different than another allograft. We expect to file the IND for the xenokidney program in '21. And then, due to the unique nature of that type of a product move directly into a Phase 2/3 study in '22. With that overview of our clinical development and pipeline activities, I'd like to next turn the microphone to our President, Michael Benkowitz, to give a review of other aspects of our operations, including commercialization. Michael? Thanks so much, Mike. Operator, I'm now happy to field the calls, and I'll direct them amongst Dr. Peterson, James Edgemond and Mike Benkowitz as appropriate. Thanks, Hartaj. Excellent question and good to hear your voice this morning. I think, the best person on this call to field the question would be Mike, because he is right in the middle of all of the details right now of actually assigning different regional sales managers and their teams amongst the different types of physicians those who treat patients with ILD that have never seen really pulmonary hypertension patient treatment options and those who are normal PAH treatment physicians that then in addition to that also treat patients with PAH associated with their ILD. So Mike would really have the best answers for that. And Mike, if you could provide some color on Hartaj's question. Thanks so much, Mike. That's a great response. Hartaj, one little footnote I'd add to Mike's response is, it's very interesting to me just having studied this field for quite a bit that there are this very substantial quantity of patients in the Group 3, WHO Group 3 type of pulmonary hypertension, over 30,000 patients that for those patients, the systemic drugs are contraindicated. So here in the field of Group 1 WHO, we have upwards of 12 different medicines available to treat pulmonary hypertension. And there are just about as many Group 3 patients as Group 1 patients, but there are zero no approved medicines to treat those Group 3 patients. So it's a screaming unmet medical need. And we are just crossing every finger we could cross that on - in April on the PDUFA date that the FDA will give us clearance to translate the INCREASE clinical trial results into an approved treatment for those 30,000 patients that would be the only approved treatment for those patients. It was a great trial, the INCREASE trial, as you are well aware, Hartaj, we met all of our primary and secondary endpoints. So I think there is going to be a tremendous amount of excitement amongst the physicians that finally they have something to treat those 30,000 patients with. Thanks so much again. Operator, next question please. Yes. Thank you, Eun, for those very interesting questions and exploring some kind of areas that a lot of people overlook. So I'm glad you've asked those questions. At this point in time, we haven't made a firm decision with regard to the European filing schedule, mostly because we're just like laser focused on gaining FDA approval to deal with this huge unmet medical need that I just talked about, the 30,000 patients here. So we are kind of like a step-by-step strategy here, and first we want to be able to successfully get approval into the US, and then we'll consider what is the best approach to go as to Europe. The second part of your question is also quite insightful, because the Dreamboat TreT device is a much easier to use device than the Opti-Neb nebulizer that that we used in the INCREASE study and that we submitted for FDA approval on. And I think, most people feel that whatever the captured market would be for this nebulizer, that dry powder Dreamboat device could give you two, maybe three times larger market, because of its greater convenience. So, as you mentioned, Eun, we did - we do plan to file for approval of the Dreamboat device based on the current BREEZE study in the April - in April of 2021 and then that would take its normal FDA approval period. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, hopefully, we can get that approved if not by the end of '21, then at the very beginning of '22. Now whether or not that Dreamboat TreT device is approved for just WHO Group 1, pulmonary hypertension, which is the population in which we did our BREEZE study or is also going to be approved for the WHO Group 3 population, that would be a decision which is, of course, up to the FDA. What we will do to support that decision and provide guidance is as soon as we wrap up the filing based on the BREEZE 1 study in the WHO Group 1 population, we will immediately begin a BREEZE 2 study in the ILD population or the WHO Group 3 population. And that way, we will at least have that data available for the FDA. If they feel that they are not comfortable to approve Dreamboat in Group 3 without some data, we should have that data by the time they would reach their PDUFA date for approving the BREEZE device in the Group 1 population. If for any reason things take a little longer, we'll have that data immediately available. I don't think it's really going to be of much consequence, because, in fact, the desperation in the WHO Group 3 population for any treatment is so large that the Opti-Neb-based nebulizer-based form of Tyvaso, I think, will be very rapidly taken up, but you always want to keep building on your momentum and making it easier for larger and larger patient populations to avail themselves of Tyvaso. So we will be right on with BREEZE 2 data for the ILD population will be right on that immediately after completing the BREEZE 1 filing. Thanks for your question, Eun. Next question, operator. Yes, Dr. Auster. One for being Marty and one for being doctor. Okay. Thanks, Marty. Fascinating questions. Kind of things we could like talk in a coffee house for hours over, if we could talk in a coffee house. But with regard to the first question on BREEZE, the PK data, the buildup of TreT devices, Dr. Peterson, if you could, at least, talk about the PK side. And if you feel comfortable talking about the inventory side roll into that. And if not, I'll talk about that at the front end of xeno stuff. Thanks, Dr. Peterson. Thank you very much. So with regard to the inventory, Marty, I think, we're going to be in good shape. In fact, just this week, at the request of our Head of Manufacturing, Pat Poisson, we allocated $5 million for inventory buildup for the TreT launch during 2021. So, he regularly visits the MannKind plant in Connecticut, where we do the manufacturing of everything. And I feel confident that we'll have adequate supply to meet our needs. As you probably recall from reviewing our proxy, how one of our companies for companywide objective is upon which everybody's bonus is based in the entire company is that we have to have a two-year inventory of all commercially launched products at the rate of the product take-up. So Mike Benkowitz and his commercial team, they would provide a forecast to manufacturing in terms of how many Dreamboat TreT patients we expect to garner in the first 12 months after launch, which would be mostly a 2022 thing. And then, so already in 2021, Pat Poisson and our manufacturing team are making sure that we have 2 times that amount of inventory built up for at the time of launch, so that we can crush that manufacturing and inventory milestone as we actually always have every year for as far back as I can remember. With regard to the xeno question, I think, your numbers are quite accurate, Marty. There are 20,000-plus kidney transplants done. If you get into what are called living related kidney transplants, where people designate a kidney to a relative or something like that, you get up into the 35,000 type of category. And the next number that comes up a lot is 100,000 people are waiting for kidney transplants and are currently on dialysis. And then the next number that comes up is that there is something like 300,000 people in need of a kidney transplant, but for various and sundry reasons, they are not even able to access dialysis. So, it is probably one of the largest unmet medical needs in the United States. It's not unrelated to the very high levels of diabetes in the United States, but that's not the only reason for end-stage renal disease. So kidney transplantation is a cure for end-stage renal disease. And people such as ourselves have been working many years in order to have an unlimited supply of transplantable kidneys that would be well-tolerated by the recipients. And I think that's what we are on the cusp of here. We've spent several years not knocking out or knocking in gene after gene and then testing the results to make sure that we had really the ideal level and the ideal combination of genes that have been knocked in or knocked out. And then we've also constructed a pathogen-free facility, which is the xeno equivalent of a good manufacturing product in Alabama. And it is those kidneys coming out of that DPF facility, which would be the first ones going into the clinic, which is why I mentioned that we expect to file an IND in 2021 based on kidneys coming out of that DPF. In terms of when we would pull the trigger on building a commercial scale DPF, the one I just referred to in Alabama is a clinical trial scale DPF. The commercial scale DPF will take a couple of years to build and bring into operation. So I think the right time to pull the trigger on that would be once we have a successful result in the first clinical xenokidney transplant and with the - as mentioned in the beginning of the call, with the IND going in '21, so we will know in '22 whether we have a successful xenokidney product. And so that would be the time to pull the trigger. We have already completely designed the facility, using our design architects at EwingCole company in Philadelphia. They specialize in bio agro type of manufacturing designs. So, we have a well vetted design that's been reviewed by all of the experts in controlling viruses and microbes and whatnot in animal populations. So, I think we're ready to like sign a contract pretty rapidly and proceed with the construction and then that whole facility could be brought into operation sometime during 2024. Thanks for the question, Marty. And operator, we have time for one last question. Sure. Let me suggest like we give you a two-part answer to that question, with the first part being given by Dr. Peterson, because she was ultimately in charge of the INCREASE study that produce the clinical result in the ILD patients, so she could speak most expertly about those results and which were reported at the abstract level at the ATS conference, and I believe are imminently going to be appearing in a peer-reviewed publication. So she could talk about kind of the medical thing of how well it worked in those patients. And then Mike Benkowitz, our President, who has spent a lot of time thinking about the market segmentation and the approach to the market, can speak more about the second part of your question. Dr. Peterson? Thanks, Dr. Peterson. That was great answer. And Mike, would you like to add some color on that that we're getting from all of our medical sales teams? Great. Thanks, Mike. Operator, there's time for one bonus question here. Do you have another person lined up? That's excellent. Okay. Hi, Liana. Good morning. Yes. It's like one of these kind of 30,000 foot questions that cover everything. In our Company, Liana, we have a risk management group that reports in to our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond. And this risk management group ultimately has group meetings that involve as many as like 50, 60, 70 people at United Therapeutics and every week they issue a report regarding COVID-19 and how it affects all the different parts of the Company. So, James, maybe if you could, provide some color for, Liana's question in terms of the overall impact of COVID-19 on United Therapeutics and when we see - based on inputs we're getting from our risk management group, when we see some of those effects perhaps ameliorating. Thanks so much, James. To wrap up, everybody on the earnings call, we've had a great quarter. I think this quarter and perhaps more generally this half of the year, will be looked at in retrospect as a key pivot point for United Therapeutics. This will be the time when we pivoted from being solely a pulmonary hypertension company to becoming both a pulmonary hypertension company, as well as a pulmonary fibrosis and other forms of interstitial lung disease company. You can see this pivot in us moving into a group of pulmonary hypertension patients WHO Group 3, as to whom pulmonary hypertension is not their primary problem, their primary problem is interstitial lung disease. It's of course gravely worsened by the pulmonary hypertension, but the source of their pulmonary hypertension is ultimately interstitial lung disease. So, for the first time, we're moving into a group of patients for whom pulmonary hypertension is not their number one problem, if you will. And secondly, for the first time, we're moving into a large Phase 3 study in which patients do not have pulmonary hypertension at all, they simply have this form of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis. If you take a look at a diagram of all of the species and sub-species of interstitial lung disease, you'll see it is a very large and diverse population. And we were really pleased to see in the outcome of our INCREASE study that we actually were able to modify the disease. In other words, not only slow the rate of decline and forced vital capacity, but actually improve forced vital capacity in the patients with pulmonary fibrosis, as well as a couple of other subsets of interstitial lung disease. So, it's a very exciting time here at United Therapeutics. You always hope that you can be strong at your home base and then expand from that. And with this adjacency of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension, we have a very logical and solid basis from which to expand our footprint in providing more and better healthcare to ever larger numbers of people. Thank you so much for your time and attention this morning. Look forward to seeing you at upcoming healthcare conferences. Operator, you can wrap up."

All participants are in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of this earnings call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dewey Steadman, Head of Investor Relations at United Therapeutics.\nDewey Steadman: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome you to the United Therapeutics Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Accompanying me on today's call are Dr. Martine Rothblatt, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Michael Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Mr. James Edgemond, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Dr. Leigh Peterson, our Vice President of Product Development.

All prescribing information for the products is available on our Web site. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of our second quarter financial results and business activities of United Therapeutics. Dr. Rothblatt?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Dewey, and welcome everybody to our second quarter earnings call. I'll be pleased to coordinate the call starting with a brief overview. I'll then turn the call over to our President, Chief Operating Officer, Mike Benkowitz, who provide a more in depth overview, and then he'll bounce the call back to me and we'll open up the lines to questions and take the questions as they come. And I will forward them according to the topic either if it's finance related to James, our CFO, if it's science or clinical related to our Head of Product Development, Leigh Peterson or if it's commercial related or related to other areas of the company's operations to Mike Benkowitz. While I'm really pleased with the quarter because for the products that are material to us that really matter, namely U.S. sales of Remodulin, Tyvaso, Orenitram and Unituxin. It's clear that we are poised to return to revenue growth as our patients are approaching now the levels that we had pre-pandemic. We have previously guided that we believe these products will more than double current revenues for the following reasons. First, we expect net gains from Remodulin patients each year, once we launched the highly differentiated products for Remunity and the implantable system for Remodulin. These launches have been delayed for various supply chain reasons related to the pandemic, for Remunity and for FDA Medtronic coordination reasons for the implantable system for Remodulin, but we think these delays will not carry on very much longer. Also, we expect to contribute to net gains in Remodulin the pending approval of Trevyent, which is in front of the FDA, as a form of subcutaneous Remodulin and our R&D project of the -- with Smiths medical of have a very advanced, smart, pump device for Remodulin that really I think will provide a great amount of convenience and greater certainty to patients, families, physicians and payers. So for all of these differentiated products we expect Remodulin to continue to gain in patients year-after-year. We also expect net gains in Tyvaso patients from our new Dreamboat product which is completing its final stage of clinical development and a pending new market approval for Tyvaso in WHO Group 3 PAH patients. That's one now pending in front of the FDA. We also have very exciting pipeline extensions for Tyvaso in the field of COPD with our perfect study and in a non-pulmonary hypertension field, interstitial lung disease with our new Phase 3 TETON study. Third, we expect net gains in Orenitram patients due to greater familiarity with its powerful new label and greater doctor confidence and appreciation of its unique titrate ability among oral treatments for pulmonary hypertension. Meanwhile, our pipeline is full of new opportunities. These include Phase 3 programs such as Ralinepag for pulmonary hypertension, Tyvaso for interstitial lung disease, Tyvaso for COPD and endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene therapy or heNOS gene therapy for pulmonary hypertension and finally a Phase 3 trial relating to organ manufacturing processes. Beyond these Phase 3 programs, we have pipeline feeder projects, such as a less painful or painless form of Remodulin and regenerative medicine Exosomes, which are a biological product and that could be very helpful in a number of pulmonary and respiratory conditions. So when you take a look at the already existing products, which are being rejuvenated and relaunched with differentiated drug delivery systems, or being advanced significantly due to label expansion, such as in the case of Orenitram, showing ability to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality, or in the case of something like Tyvaso move into a virgin market area such as Group 3 pulmonary hypertension, with some 30,000 patients that are yet then unable to benefit from prostacyclin therapy. I mean, that's a whole new company right there, those three areas, it's like three new companies. So that's what you'd call super low hanging fruit because products which have completed clinical development or virtually done or pending before the FDA. And then, you add-on top of that, these opportunities that are currently in the midst of their Phase 3 strides, such as the Ralinepag program for PAH, the Tyvaso program for COPD, the new TETON study in Phase 3, that again is like a whole new company worth of products. Then you've got these very exciting transformative opportunities such as gene therapy to actually cure or significantly reduce the need of treatment for pulmonary hypertension, and organ manufacturing with some hundred thousand patients hanging out there on dialysis waiting for a kidney transplant. This very month and next month, we move into the pivotal phase of our preclinical development of our xeno kidneys with multiple transplants of our 10-gene xeno kidney, which we hope will pave the way for the first clinical transplants sometime later in 2021. So it is the most exciting of times at United Therapeutics. This company is literally roaring on all thrusters and has the ability to do so for many years to come. With that 30,000 foot view of everything, I'd like to turn the line over to Mike Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer to provide some additional color on where we're at. Mike?\nMike Benkowitz: Thanks, Martine. Yes, I'd like to provide some color around physician and patient demand in the second quarter and our commercial plans for PH ILD. As Martine said at the top, we're very pleased with our revenue performance in the second quarter often considered following the achievement of a record high number of U.S. patients on our treprostinil therapy in each of the prior three quarters. We're happy that we're able to maintain relatively stable quarter-over-quarter active patient census in the midst of the COVID pandemic. Our first quarter earnings call, we mentioned that we were seeing some impact of treprostinil prescriptions and starts for the month of April attributable through the pandemic. However, the quarter progressed we saw the number of new patient prescriptions grow and reach close to pre-pandemic levels by the close of the quarter. We're especially pleased with the 40% year-over-year growth of Orenitram in the second quarter which we believe is driven by increased acceptance of FREEDOM-EV label by physicians and patients. We continue to see growth at Orenitram prescribers, including among KOLs at large PAH candidates who have historically not written much for Orenitram. We also observed a decline in discontinuation and an increase in average dose per patient during the second quarter. And we're excited that we've been able to improve formulary access to Orenitram since the start of the year for plans that cover close to 11 million additional lives. According to our payer tracking data sources, Orenitram is now considered covered for around 76% of lives in the U.S. and preferred or non-preferred formulary physicians. This compares to under 72% of the U.S. lives for [indiscernible]. So all-in-all, we believe that physicians and payers and patients are understanding and appreciating the value proposition Orenitram provides. We thought the biggest impact of COVID to Remodulin business, progression during the quarter -- progression from oral therapies such as PDE-5 and ERA with Remodulin, which is typically an in hospital procedure had been delayed early on in the quarter, leading to an inadequate number of new patient prescriptions and starts to offset, Remodulin patient discontinuation that occurred during the quarter. However, as we close out the quarter and clinics started opening back up and physicians became more comfortable starting therapy at home, new prescriptions return to almost near normal levels. In terms of generic competition in the U.S., the story remains the same as prior quarters. There's really been little or no interest on the part of physicians to write generic Remodulin and very little pair of push back. In fact, we've seen zero transitions from Remodulin to generic so far in the month of July. The Tyvaso story during the quarter is more similar to the Orenitram story and that we saw decline in prescriptions early in the quarter, but historically strong rebound in June are getting lean into July. Like Orenitram, we observed newer Tyvaso discontinuations during the quarter and an increase in new prescribers. As we mentioned on our last call, PAH is unfortunately a progressive disease that doesn't shut down for COVID. There is a warehousing of patients that need or will need advanced PAH therapy such as Orenitram, Tyvaso or Remodulin, so we fully expect that we'll make up any ground we lost during Q2 in terms of adding new patients, as more hospitals and clinics open up between patients or physicians become more comfortable prescribing via telemedicine. Finally, I want to spend a minute talking about our commercial launch plans for Tyvaso and PH ILD. The increased data which was added recently at the American Thoracic Society virtual session and we're looking forward to a potential publication in a major medical journal soon. We're very pleased with the positive reception of these important data by those physicians able to attend the ATS presentation, which is consistent with the feedback we've received from increasing investigators, physicians attending our advisory board and our market research. The increased data is roundly considered overwhelmingly positive. And the ILD treating community is very much looking forward to having Tyvaso and treatment [indiscernible] interim for these very sick patients. Following the supplemental NDA submission earlier this year, our launch preparations are well underway. As part of that effort, we're expanding our sales, marketing and medical affairs team by around 30 to 35 people by the end of the year, many of these new hires will focus their efforts on building relationships in the pulmonology community and beginning to share the increased data more broadly subject of course to pharma compliance restrictions. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, Mike. That was a great color and insight on all the different areas of our activities and it's just -- it's so beautiful to see us helping our over 7000 patients so thank you, Mike, so much for your and the entire large team of medical and pharmaceutical professionals that you have working with you. Operator, we now can accept the questions that may like to be directed to either myself, James, Leigh or Michael.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nHartaj Singh: Really nice quarter. Martine, the main question I have is that, most -- almost every other biopharma company reported decreases of 5% to 10% in revenues in the second quarter. You actually, I believe, had a slight increase over the first quarter. So can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics through the rest of the year into the third and the fourth quarter, with the same seasonality hold the United Therapeutics has historically with COVID-19. And then --and just talk a little bit about that in terms of also as you expect sort of near-term growth going forward.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much Hartaj. Great to hear your voice this morning and looking forward to the upcoming conference of your bank. Mike, I think you would be the best placed person on the call to respond to Hartaj's question.\nMike Benkowitz: Sure. Thanks for the question Hartaj. Yes, I mean, I think we haven't seen anything to suggest the seasonality that we typically see in the second half of the year, which change this year versus prior years. The big wild card obviously, is what happens with COVID. And, if things continue to increase, if cases rise and centers are having to shut down, we get as kind of a situation where new prescriptions and new starts kind of wax and wane like we saw throughout the second quarter, but I think we're all learning had a growth and had a deal in this new environment. And I think physicians are no exception to that. So I think, as I said my opening statement, I think they're becoming more comfortable prescribing via telemedicine and a lot of these institutions are allowing their patients to come back in and get the treatment they need. So and plus we have this warehousing effect. So, unless we have another complete shutdown, I think we would expect that we hopefully -- it's not necessarily smooth sailing, but certainly continue to kind of on an upward trajectory as we move into the second half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eun Yang from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nEun Yang: A question on Remodulin. So you mentioned that the reduction in the new patient start assume to have a more negative impact on Remodulin versus a Tyvaso or Orenitram. So question to you that during the pandemic, you think that Tyvaso may have a more impact. So why do you think there is a greater impact on Remodulin versus the others? And then, x-U.S. sales decreased dramatically. So do you think that x-U.S. sales will be stabilized from here? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Eun. I'm going to again ask Mike to respond to that question since he's responsible for all those areas.\nMike Benkowitz: Sure. So I think, in the case of Tyvaso versus Remodulin and the impact there, I think the main issue is, with Remodulin, you're talking about a perennial therapy that some cases --most of the time is starting in a hospital. So patients aren't able to come in during the first half of those second quarter, get into the doctor, get into hospitals because of the pandemic that's what we saw the sharpest decline in new prescriptions and new starts. And then, as we set a rebound towards the end of the second quarter with an inhaler with Tyvaso, while I think physicians would probably prefer to start with that in their clinic. It is more easily started in a home setting. And so our specialty pharmacy nurses are very well trained on how to use a nebulizer and how to start patients on Tyvaso. And it's much more common that Tyvaso is starting to the home. So that's really I think the dynamic there. It's just really I think the familiarity and sort of historical precedents are starting Tyvaso in the home much more regularly than what you would see with Remodulin. But again, I think we're starting to see a little bit of that change as people start to adjust to the current situation. As it relates to x-U.S. yeah, I think that the situation there is that we always see some lumpiness of the ordering. So it's really hard to kind of look at one quarter and project that out over subsequent quarters, because there's not a regular ordering pattern in x-U.S., as we see here in the U.S. But, I think what we've seen there, certainly, the impact of generic entrants and a big reason for that is the payer landscape outside of the U.S., as you know is very different than it is in the U.S. You have a single payer system. And so what happens in a lot of these countries were outside of the U.S. where Remodulin is used is a generic entrant comes into the market and they set their price and there's mandatory price reductions by the governments to meet the generic price. And so, what we've done with our partner Sorrento who's our distributor of a Remodulin outside the U.S. is we've agreed to allow for adjustment, our transfer price of Remodulin to Sorrento. And in order to allow them to compete with generics and retain as much sure they can all be at a lower price. So that's sort of the first piece of it. The second piece of it is since you have two competitors that have been, I would say, successful and making inroads in a couple countries where we had a lot of Remodulin patients. And so that's part of the dynamic there. On the flip side, partner firms looking to expand into other countries and do a lot of the same things that we're doing and doing a lot of the same things that we're doing here in the U.S. to promote the value of the brand over generic. So, my takeaway there is, I wouldn't necessarily intuit that the revenues in the second quarter, you could project forward, for every quarter going forward, because it does vary a little bit based on the lumpiness of the ordering patterns, but I think it's true, that for all the reasons that Martine said in the beginning around growth of Orenitram versus Tyvaso. So both in PAH and the newer indications, all other things that we're bringing to the table for Remodulin and everything else that our development pipeline, that the rest of world Remodulin revenues are going to be increasingly an immaterial part of our overall revenue story.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Martin Auster from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMartin Auster: I'm going to do a no, no and try to sneak in two questions but let…\nMartine Rothblatt: You know what they say for every 10 years somebody has in the field they're entitled at least one question. So you're good for two and soon for three.\nMartin Auster: So the first probably for Mike, you mentioned 30 to 35, kind of new sales marketing liaison reps that support the PH ILD opportunity. I was curious if you could kind of add a little more color to what sort of percent increases as at about 20%, 30% increase to the effort? And can we read into that that you expect to see kind of at least a commensurate type of revenue growth with that? The second question, Martine was for you. There's a competitor in transportation that's out there that I noticed has been kind of hiring up senior staff this year and had a successful financing last year. I was curious if you could comment on kind of competitive positioning for where you see versus the competition in Dino? And any kind of other competitive advantages, you see you guys having? And then secondly, is that company progressive as United giving any thought to potentially seeking to kind of capture value for that program through a spin out or some other kind of effort just because they think it's something that gets overlooked within the [indiscernible] other franchises that are commercial. Thanks.\nMartine Rothblatt: Great questions. A lot of good thought into each of those questions, let me, if it's okay, I will talk about the second one because the first one involves more metrics and give Mike a couple minutes to line up those metrics. So there are a few competitors in the xeno space and there seemed to be more creeping up all the time. It probably has been inspired by the successful financing of one of the companies. And I don't -- I'm going to, I hope it doesn't break with anybody's protocols. I believe you're referring to eGenesis has that company. But if not, feel free to tell me afterwards. But eGenesis is the one that I'm aware of that's completed a financing. And they're a great company. They're spun out by George Church who's one of the geniuses, certainly biological geniuses of our time. And it's based on great genetic engineering work by Luhan Yang, who's absolutely stellar molecular biologist. And now is, I believe running an arm of that company in China. So that company has a lot of -- a lot going for it and very good investors. We at UT are actually very happy to see the progress of eGenesis because for a while, it had been a little bit lonely for us in the xeno field. And we were wondering, like why don't other people see this opportunity? There are 100,000 people, over 100,000 people on kidney dialysis machines and very few of them can survive past 10 years. And yet there are thousands and thousands -- more than 10,000 that are out toward that the number of years So there's no other solution for these patients who are not going to get allograft other than something like xeno transplantation. So we think it's an amazing market. It's a place where we can do a great deal of good. And as mentioned in the introductory remarks, we are now in the pivotal phase of our preclinical development. In other words, conducting the last non-human studies that the FDA requires before going into the human studies. We've completed construction of our what's called a pathogen free breeding facility for the xeno kidneys. That's the GMP or Good Manufacturing Practices equivalent that one needs for something like a xeno kidney. And again, that's pursuant to FDA guidance, if we perceived. We have a tremendous collaboration with the University of Alabama, Birmingham where a lot of this work is going on and Dr. Jayme Locke there she's the principal investigator. Dr. Locke, for those of you who may not know, is the principal person who is responsible for creating massive kidney chain transplants, you may have read how one person donates a kidney to another unknown person to another unknown person and ultimately, a friend or relative of theirs gets a kidney because of this huge chain of over 100 transplants and that's all Dr. Jayme Locke, she's absolutely amazing. And we're so proud to have her as our PI. So we feel that we're in a really, really sweet spot, Martin. And it's, at one time we did explore concepts, such as spinning this out because it wasn't getting enough attention. But when we look more carefully at it we realized that it wasn't getting more attention because it was just too premature. It was just too early. And I think once people see that we have filed for clinical xenograft which, again, is I'm hoping we'll be able to do in 2021. I think attention will spark up very, very rapidly. And this organ manufacturing activity will become one of the multiple pillars that upholds United Therapeutics. So we're really not thinking about spitting it out at all right now, we're very proud and excited to have it intrinsic to our company. And we're really focused on accomplishing enough with our xeno kidney with our 10-Gene gig that we'll be able to go into the clinic and therefore become a major contributor to UT's valuation. Mike, can you provide some of the metrics that Dr. Auster was requesting?\nMike Benkowitz: Sure. So, yes, Martin, I think that your first part of your question was just around the kind of 30 to 35 headcount adds to sales, marketing and medical and what does that look like as a percentage of the current staffing there? So if I think about the current -- of the current group and those three functions that are principally focused on PAH, the 30 to 35, is about a 25% to 30% increase, roughly in terms of headcount. I think it's hard to sort of draw -- sort of extend that out to an expectations around revenue. We certainly think that the revenue opportunity with ILD is tremendous, certainly based on [indiscernible] with the data and what we're hearing from physicians that have seen the data. I think the challenge and trying to draw a correlation between the headcount increase size to the revenue is just there's a lot of variables in the air. So, in PAH, I mean in the variable entity, where are the patients? How concentrated are they at the physician -- at each physician or at each center? How many physicians and centers are there? And if I look at what PAH looks like and what ILD looks like those are different. What's the other variable? What's the overlap between the [indiscernible] in ILD and those that are treating PAH and there's not a lot of overlap there. So, the expansion of the -- in the field sales force and medical teams will be really dedicated to ILD. So it'll be a dedicated team detailing these ILD doc's. And you're also talking about as another variable, the fact that there's really not a lot of competition in ILD and these reps and these MSOs will only be detailing one indication, while those on the PAH either they're carrying three products in the back. So there's a lot of variables that kind of go into sales force sizing. And again, it's just really hard to kind of draw that correlation to what we think the revenue opportunity is and say, okay, because we're increasing by 25%, that we only think that the ILD opportunity is 25% of our current revenues. I think we all believe that given the size of the patient population, the unmet need, the opportunity is significantly greater just with the increased data and then certainly following it all with perfect with the TETON study, it's even greater than that.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Liana Moussatos from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nLiana Moussatos: Congratulations on the strong quarter. Of these two programs, which one is going to provide a cure first, gene therapy or organ manufacturing?\nMartine Rothblatt: Wow! That is a very tough and challenging question. I'm not smart enough to know the answer to that question because both of them are very promising and both of them have kind of come to their time. Gene therapy has been something people have talked about for 20 years. Organ manufacturing, especially xenotransplantation, something people talked about for 20 years. And it's just both of them are finally coming into their own. In all likelihood, there will be different solutions for different patients. I find that the thing that most people gloss over with disease generally and certainly with pulmonary disease is a tremendous heterogeneity of the patient population. And what works for some patients doesn't work for other patients. As you may know, Liana, we've been conducting pharmacogenomics screening of patients coming into our studies. And we've recently seen that there are significant pharmacogenomic differences among patients who respond to two different types of medications for pulmonary hypertension. Those differences we've seen are now correlative. So there are hypotheses that will test in future studies, but it indicates the heterogeneity of the patient population. I think for a patient who pretty much looks like they still have time on their lungs if one could reverse the remodelling process, gene therapy would be a little bit more promising. Although I'd like to note that there is increasing data out there, Liana showing that aggressive upfront treatment with Remodulin with the goal of reducing pulmonary artery pressure below 40 millimeters of mercury is also appears to be associated with a much better long-term horizon. And more and more researchers are publishing articles, where they dose to reducing pulmonary artery pressure rather than dosing to some symptomatic endpoints such as six minute walk. Dr. Matsubara of Japan is one of the leaders of this area. But UT Southwestern, University of Texas [indiscernible] therapeutics and other researchers around the world are also beginning to see that you can effect from remodeling. In other words, you can affect a disease modification, applying hypertension by aggressive upfront treatments with remodulin. That's very exciting because pressure is a kind of thing that you get into a well. And if you get into a well, of very high pressures, it's hard to get out of that well, but if you can get out of that high pressure well and drop down to below 40 millimeters of mercury, you get back to a stabilized situation and the patient can have a much better long term outlook. Now, there will be many patients who've been at super high pressures north of 60, 70, 80 millimeters of mercury for a couple years or more and they began to experience serious fibrotic issues with their pulmonary vasculature. And unfortunately for these patients, the lungs are kind of shot and that's the reason why unfortunately, mean survival is reported as any where from five to 10 years after diagnosis, depending whether the person's diagnosis, functional class three, four, and what their condition is. So if a patient has already experienced, essentially irreversible fibrotic processes in their pulmonary arteries and their pressures are super normal, I think for them, the cure is going to be a lung transplant. And I would like to conclude on this question by pointing out that one thing I always hated about lung transplants was that they were trading one disease for another. They were trading the disease whether it's pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, whatever, that gave rise to the need for a lung transplant for chronic rejection, ultimately resulting in something like bronchiolitis obliterans that destroyed their graft. So whenever you get a transplant, you are kind of trading your previous condition for long-term rejection. But we at United Therapeutics could face some enormous strides in the field of autologous manufactured organs. In other words, we start a with cyber blast of the intended patient and turned it into an IPSC cell and then read differentiated down into endothelial epithelial stroma basal cells and then expand those cells to the five to 10 billion that are needed to pulverize the lungs. So the patients that receive our autologous manufactured lungs will not have to take immunosuppressants and it truly will be a cure for those patients rather than just a bridge to another disease. Thanks so much for those testing questions Liana. And operator last question.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Christopher Zopf from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.\nChristopher Zopf: This is CJ on for Chris Shibutani. Given your interactions with the FDA on the Tyvaso SNDA, what sort of timeline are you expecting for being able to add the PH ILD indication label? And can you give us a sense what fraction of Q2 and maybe current Tyvaso groups might be seeing some off label use there? Are we seeing some transition from their modeling setting or is this purely kind of new patient group?\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. I'm going to kind of chop on the last second part of your question and ask Dr. Peterson, our Head of Product Development and the one who -- she's really the one that made the discovery or led the team that made the discovery in terms of efficacy to confirm of Tyvaso in chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease. But we just before you get on a let me mentioned that, I don't think that there is off label use of Tyvaso in that condition and it's certainly something that we would never suggest, promote, encourage or any of the above. So we are your on label company and with that introduction, Leigh, could you talk about the timeframe that you see for the TETON study?\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. I believe it was for the increase FDA submission timeline.\nMartine Rothblatt: The timeline for the FDA submission. Okay, sure.\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. So, thank you, I love to talk about increase because as you can imagine, it's a really, really exciting --\nMartine Rothblatt: Are you also in-charge to that team?\nLeigh Peterson: And so we submitted that SNDA in June and we are any -- very, very soon we will find out from FDA, whether that receives priority review, which would be a six month turnaround and if it doesn't, it would be 10 months. So that's the timeline for finding out the approval of the increase in the ability to add it onto the label assuming positive response.\nMartine Rothblatt: That's great. That's fantastic. And while we have you on the line, would you give a sketch of when you think that we would likely begin enrolling patients in the TETON study? And about how long do you think that study will take?\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. So again, the TETON study is our study of using Tyvaso in patients that have not been diagnosed with -- also have pulmonary hypertension, as was the case in increase. So we have actually submitted some questions and the protocol to FDA and we're currently finalizing the study design with them as well as with our steering committee and once that happens, we will begin study startup. It's approximately 250 to 300 patients were imagining that we would need to enroll. So that would probably take about two years to enroll, depending on the follow up period. It's either six months or one year for that. And then, we would finish things up, submit, prepare that NDA and submit that for, again, we would submit for priority review, six month timeline, or if we didn't get that it would be 10 months.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Leigh. So much exciting group activity going on in our product development group and really glad to share that with all of the shareholders on the call. Well, operator, thank you so much for doing such a great job of coordinating all the questions today. And I will now turn the line back to you for your wrap up statement.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation Conference Call. A rebroadcast will be available for replay for one week by calling 1-800-585-8367 with international. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Martine. Yes, I'd like to provide some color around physician and patient demand in the second quarter and our commercial plans for PH ILD. As Martine said at the top, we're very pleased with our revenue performance in the second quarter often considered following the achievement of a record high number of U.S. patients on our treprostinil therapy in each of the prior three quarters. We're happy that we're able to maintain relatively stable quarter-over-quarter active patient census in the midst of the COVID pandemic. Our first quarter earnings call, we mentioned that we were seeing some impact of treprostinil prescriptions and starts for the month of April attributable through the pandemic. However, the quarter progressed we saw the number of new patient prescriptions grow and reach close to pre-pandemic levels by the close of the quarter. We're especially pleased with the 40% year-over-year growth of Orenitram in the second quarter which we believe is driven by increased acceptance of FREEDOM-EV label by physicians and patients. We continue to see growth at Orenitram prescribers, including among KOLs at large PAH candidates who have historically not written much for Orenitram. We also observed a decline in discontinuation and an increase in average dose per patient during the second quarter. And we're excited that we've been able to improve formulary access to Orenitram since the start of the year for plans that cover close to 11 million additional lives. According to our payer tracking data sources, Orenitram is now considered covered for around 76% of lives in the U.S. and preferred or non-preferred formulary physicians. This compares to under 72% of the U.S. lives for [indiscernible]. So all-in-all, we believe that physicians and payers and patients are understanding and appreciating the value proposition Orenitram provides. We thought the biggest impact of COVID to Remodulin business, progression during the quarter -- progression from oral therapies such as PDE-5 and ERA with Remodulin, which is typically an in hospital procedure had been delayed early on in the quarter, leading to an inadequate number of new patient prescriptions and starts to offset, Remodulin patient discontinuation that occurred during the quarter. However, as we close out the quarter and clinics started opening back up and physicians became more comfortable starting therapy at home, new prescriptions return to almost near normal levels. In terms of generic competition in the U.S., the story remains the same as prior quarters. There's really been little or no interest on the part of physicians to write generic Remodulin and very little pair of push back. In fact, we've seen zero transitions from Remodulin to generic so far in the month of July. The Tyvaso story during the quarter is more similar to the Orenitram story and that we saw decline in prescriptions early in the quarter, but historically strong rebound in June are getting lean into July. Like Orenitram, we observed newer Tyvaso discontinuations during the quarter and an increase in new prescribers. As we mentioned on our last call, PAH is unfortunately a progressive disease that doesn't shut down for COVID. There is a warehousing of patients that need or will need advanced PAH therapy such as Orenitram, Tyvaso or Remodulin, so we fully expect that we'll make up any ground we lost during Q2 in terms of adding new patients, as more hospitals and clinics open up between patients or physicians become more comfortable prescribing via telemedicine. Finally, I want to spend a minute talking about our commercial launch plans for Tyvaso and PH ILD. The increased data which was added recently at the American Thoracic Society virtual session and we're looking forward to a potential publication in a major medical journal soon. We're very pleased with the positive reception of these important data by those physicians able to attend the ATS presentation, which is consistent with the feedback we've received from increasing investigators, physicians attending our advisory board and our market research. The increased data is roundly considered overwhelmingly positive. And the ILD treating community is very much looking forward to having Tyvaso and treatment [indiscernible] interim for these very sick patients. Following the supplemental NDA submission earlier this year, our launch preparations are well underway. As part of that effort, we're expanding our sales, marketing and medical affairs team by around 30 to 35 people by the end of the year, many of these new hires will focus their efforts on building relationships in the pulmonology community and beginning to share the increased data more broadly subject of course to pharma compliance restrictions. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine. Sure. Thanks for the question Hartaj. Yes, I mean, I think we haven't seen anything to suggest the seasonality that we typically see in the second half of the year, which change this year versus prior years. The big wild card obviously, is what happens with COVID. And, if things continue to increase, if cases rise and centers are having to shut down, we get as kind of a situation where new prescriptions and new starts kind of wax and wane like we saw throughout the second quarter, but I think we're all learning had a growth and had a deal in this new environment. And I think physicians are no exception to that. So I think, as I said my opening statement, I think they're becoming more comfortable prescribing via telemedicine and a lot of these institutions are allowing their patients to come back in and get the treatment they need. So and plus we have this warehousing effect. So, unless we have another complete shutdown, I think we would expect that we hopefully -- it's not necessarily smooth sailing, but certainly continue to kind of on an upward trajectory as we move into the second half of the year. Sure. So I think, in the case of Tyvaso versus Remodulin and the impact there, I think the main issue is, with Remodulin, you're talking about a perennial therapy that some cases --most of the time is starting in a hospital. So patients aren't able to come in during the first half of those second quarter, get into the doctor, get into hospitals because of the pandemic that's what we saw the sharpest decline in new prescriptions and new starts. And then, as we set a rebound towards the end of the second quarter with an inhaler with Tyvaso, while I think physicians would probably prefer to start with that in their clinic. It is more easily started in a home setting. And so our specialty pharmacy nurses are very well trained on how to use a nebulizer and how to start patients on Tyvaso. And it's much more common that Tyvaso is starting to the home. So that's really I think the dynamic there. It's just really I think the familiarity and sort of historical precedents are starting Tyvaso in the home much more regularly than what you would see with Remodulin. But again, I think we're starting to see a little bit of that change as people start to adjust to the current situation. As it relates to x-U.S. yeah, I think that the situation there is that we always see some lumpiness of the ordering. So it's really hard to kind of look at one quarter and project that out over subsequent quarters, because there's not a regular ordering pattern in x-U.S., as we see here in the U.S. But, I think what we've seen there, certainly, the impact of generic entrants and a big reason for that is the payer landscape outside of the U.S., as you know is very different than it is in the U.S. You have a single payer system. And so what happens in a lot of these countries were outside of the U.S. where Remodulin is used is a generic entrant comes into the market and they set their price and there's mandatory price reductions by the governments to meet the generic price. And so, what we've done with our partner Sorrento who's our distributor of a Remodulin outside the U.S. is we've agreed to allow for adjustment, our transfer price of Remodulin to Sorrento. And in order to allow them to compete with generics and retain as much sure they can all be at a lower price. So that's sort of the first piece of it. The second piece of it is since you have two competitors that have been, I would say, successful and making inroads in a couple countries where we had a lot of Remodulin patients. And so that's part of the dynamic there. On the flip side, partner firms looking to expand into other countries and do a lot of the same things that we're doing and doing a lot of the same things that we're doing here in the U.S. to promote the value of the brand over generic. So, my takeaway there is, I wouldn't necessarily intuit that the revenues in the second quarter, you could project forward, for every quarter going forward, because it does vary a little bit based on the lumpiness of the ordering patterns, but I think it's true, that for all the reasons that Martine said in the beginning around growth of Orenitram versus Tyvaso. So both in PAH and the newer indications, all other things that we're bringing to the table for Remodulin and everything else that our development pipeline, that the rest of world Remodulin revenues are going to be increasingly an immaterial part of our overall revenue story. Sure. So, yes, Martin, I think that your first part of your question was just around the kind of 30 to 35 headcount adds to sales, marketing and medical and what does that look like as a percentage of the current staffing there? So if I think about the current -- of the current group and those three functions that are principally focused on PAH, the 30 to 35, is about a 25% to 30% increase, roughly in terms of headcount. I think it's hard to sort of draw -- sort of extend that out to an expectations around revenue. We certainly think that the revenue opportunity with ILD is tremendous, certainly based on [indiscernible] with the data and what we're hearing from physicians that have seen the data. I think the challenge and trying to draw a correlation between the headcount increase size to the revenue is just there's a lot of variables in the air. So, in PAH, I mean in the variable entity, where are the patients? How concentrated are they at the physician -- at each physician or at each center? How many physicians and centers are there? And if I look at what PAH looks like and what ILD looks like those are different. What's the other variable? What's the overlap between the [indiscernible] in ILD and those that are treating PAH and there's not a lot of overlap there. So, the expansion of the -- in the field sales force and medical teams will be really dedicated to ILD. So it'll be a dedicated team detailing these ILD doc's. And you're also talking about as another variable, the fact that there's really not a lot of competition in ILD and these reps and these MSOs will only be detailing one indication, while those on the PAH either they're carrying three products in the back. So there's a lot of variables that kind of go into sales force sizing. And again, it's just really hard to kind of draw that correlation to what we think the revenue opportunity is and say, okay, because we're increasing by 25%, that we only think that the ILD opportunity is 25% of our current revenues. I think we all believe that given the size of the patient population, the unmet need, the opportunity is significantly greater just with the increased data and then certainly following it all with perfect with the TETON study, it's even greater than that."

            "content": "Yes. I believe it was for the increase FDA submission timeline. Yes. So, thank you, I love to talk about increase because as you can imagine, it's a really, really exciting -- And so we submitted that SNDA in June and we are any -- very, very soon we will find out from FDA, whether that receives priority review, which would be a six month turnaround and if it doesn't, it would be 10 months. So that's the timeline for finding out the approval of the increase in the ability to add it onto the label assuming positive response. Yes. So again, the TETON study is our study of using Tyvaso in patients that have not been diagnosed with -- also have pulmonary hypertension, as was the case in increase. So we have actually submitted some questions and the protocol to FDA and we're currently finalizing the study design with them as well as with our steering committee and once that happens, we will begin study startup. It's approximately 250 to 300 patients were imagining that we would need to enroll. So that would probably take about two years to enroll, depending on the follow up period. It's either six months or one year for that. And then, we would finish things up, submit, prepare that NDA and submit that for, again, we would submit for priority review, six month timeline, or if we didn't get that it would be 10 months."

            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thank you, Dewey, and welcome everybody to our second quarter earnings call. I'll be pleased to coordinate the call starting with a brief overview. I'll then turn the call over to our President, Chief Operating Officer, Mike Benkowitz, who provide a more in depth overview, and then he'll bounce the call back to me and we'll open up the lines to questions and take the questions as they come. And I will forward them according to the topic either if it's finance related to James, our CFO, if it's science or clinical related to our Head of Product Development, Leigh Peterson or if it's commercial related or related to other areas of the company's operations to Mike Benkowitz. While I'm really pleased with the quarter because for the products that are material to us that really matter, namely U.S. sales of Remodulin, Tyvaso, Orenitram and Unituxin. It's clear that we are poised to return to revenue growth as our patients are approaching now the levels that we had pre-pandemic. We have previously guided that we believe these products will more than double current revenues for the following reasons. First, we expect net gains from Remodulin patients each year, once we launched the highly differentiated products for Remunity and the implantable system for Remodulin. These launches have been delayed for various supply chain reasons related to the pandemic, for Remunity and for FDA Medtronic coordination reasons for the implantable system for Remodulin, but we think these delays will not carry on very much longer. Also, we expect to contribute to net gains in Remodulin the pending approval of Trevyent, which is in front of the FDA, as a form of subcutaneous Remodulin and our R&D project of the -- with Smiths medical of have a very advanced, smart, pump device for Remodulin that really I think will provide a great amount of convenience and greater certainty to patients, families, physicians and payers. So for all of these differentiated products we expect Remodulin to continue to gain in patients year-after-year. We also expect net gains in Tyvaso patients from our new Dreamboat product which is completing its final stage of clinical development and a pending new market approval for Tyvaso in WHO Group 3 PAH patients. That's one now pending in front of the FDA. We also have very exciting pipeline extensions for Tyvaso in the field of COPD with our perfect study and in a non-pulmonary hypertension field, interstitial lung disease with our new Phase 3 TETON study. Third, we expect net gains in Orenitram patients due to greater familiarity with its powerful new label and greater doctor confidence and appreciation of its unique titrate ability among oral treatments for pulmonary hypertension. Meanwhile, our pipeline is full of new opportunities. These include Phase 3 programs such as Ralinepag for pulmonary hypertension, Tyvaso for interstitial lung disease, Tyvaso for COPD and endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene therapy or heNOS gene therapy for pulmonary hypertension and finally a Phase 3 trial relating to organ manufacturing processes. Beyond these Phase 3 programs, we have pipeline feeder projects, such as a less painful or painless form of Remodulin and regenerative medicine Exosomes, which are a biological product and that could be very helpful in a number of pulmonary and respiratory conditions. So when you take a look at the already existing products, which are being rejuvenated and relaunched with differentiated drug delivery systems, or being advanced significantly due to label expansion, such as in the case of Orenitram, showing ability to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality, or in the case of something like Tyvaso move into a virgin market area such as Group 3 pulmonary hypertension, with some 30,000 patients that are yet then unable to benefit from prostacyclin therapy. I mean, that's a whole new company right there, those three areas, it's like three new companies. So that's what you'd call super low hanging fruit because products which have completed clinical development or virtually done or pending before the FDA. And then, you add-on top of that, these opportunities that are currently in the midst of their Phase 3 strides, such as the Ralinepag program for PAH, the Tyvaso program for COPD, the new TETON study in Phase 3, that again is like a whole new company worth of products. Then you've got these very exciting transformative opportunities such as gene therapy to actually cure or significantly reduce the need of treatment for pulmonary hypertension, and organ manufacturing with some hundred thousand patients hanging out there on dialysis waiting for a kidney transplant. This very month and next month, we move into the pivotal phase of our preclinical development of our xeno kidneys with multiple transplants of our 10-gene xeno kidney, which we hope will pave the way for the first clinical transplants sometime later in 2021. So it is the most exciting of times at United Therapeutics. This company is literally roaring on all thrusters and has the ability to do so for many years to come. With that 30,000 foot view of everything, I'd like to turn the line over to Mike Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer to provide some additional color on where we're at. Mike? Thank you so much, Mike. That was a great color and insight on all the different areas of our activities and it's just -- it's so beautiful to see us helping our over 7000 patients so thank you, Mike, so much for your and the entire large team of medical and pharmaceutical professionals that you have working with you. Operator, we now can accept the questions that may like to be directed to either myself, James, Leigh or Michael. Thanks so much Hartaj. Great to hear your voice this morning and looking forward to the upcoming conference of your bank. Mike, I think you would be the best placed person on the call to respond to Hartaj's question. Thanks, Eun. I'm going to again ask Mike to respond to that question since he's responsible for all those areas. You know what they say for every 10 years somebody has in the field they're entitled at least one question. So you're good for two and soon for three. Great questions. A lot of good thought into each of those questions, let me, if it's okay, I will talk about the second one because the first one involves more metrics and give Mike a couple minutes to line up those metrics. So there are a few competitors in the xeno space and there seemed to be more creeping up all the time. It probably has been inspired by the successful financing of one of the companies. And I don't -- I'm going to, I hope it doesn't break with anybody's protocols. I believe you're referring to eGenesis has that company. But if not, feel free to tell me afterwards. But eGenesis is the one that I'm aware of that's completed a financing. And they're a great company. They're spun out by George Church who's one of the geniuses, certainly biological geniuses of our time. And it's based on great genetic engineering work by Luhan Yang, who's absolutely stellar molecular biologist. And now is, I believe running an arm of that company in China. So that company has a lot of -- a lot going for it and very good investors. We at UT are actually very happy to see the progress of eGenesis because for a while, it had been a little bit lonely for us in the xeno field. And we were wondering, like why don't other people see this opportunity? There are 100,000 people, over 100,000 people on kidney dialysis machines and very few of them can survive past 10 years. And yet there are thousands and thousands -- more than 10,000 that are out toward that the number of years So there's no other solution for these patients who are not going to get allograft other than something like xeno transplantation. So we think it's an amazing market. It's a place where we can do a great deal of good. And as mentioned in the introductory remarks, we are now in the pivotal phase of our preclinical development. In other words, conducting the last non-human studies that the FDA requires before going into the human studies. We've completed construction of our what's called a pathogen free breeding facility for the xeno kidneys. That's the GMP or Good Manufacturing Practices equivalent that one needs for something like a xeno kidney. And again, that's pursuant to FDA guidance, if we perceived. We have a tremendous collaboration with the University of Alabama, Birmingham where a lot of this work is going on and Dr. Jayme Locke there she's the principal investigator. Dr. Locke, for those of you who may not know, is the principal person who is responsible for creating massive kidney chain transplants, you may have read how one person donates a kidney to another unknown person to another unknown person and ultimately, a friend or relative of theirs gets a kidney because of this huge chain of over 100 transplants and that's all Dr. Jayme Locke, she's absolutely amazing. And we're so proud to have her as our PI. So we feel that we're in a really, really sweet spot, Martin. And it's, at one time we did explore concepts, such as spinning this out because it wasn't getting enough attention. But when we look more carefully at it we realized that it wasn't getting more attention because it was just too premature. It was just too early. And I think once people see that we have filed for clinical xenograft which, again, is I'm hoping we'll be able to do in 2021. I think attention will spark up very, very rapidly. And this organ manufacturing activity will become one of the multiple pillars that upholds United Therapeutics. So we're really not thinking about spitting it out at all right now, we're very proud and excited to have it intrinsic to our company. And we're really focused on accomplishing enough with our xeno kidney with our 10-Gene gig that we'll be able to go into the clinic and therefore become a major contributor to UT's valuation. Mike, can you provide some of the metrics that Dr. Auster was requesting? Wow! That is a very tough and challenging question. I'm not smart enough to know the answer to that question because both of them are very promising and both of them have kind of come to their time. Gene therapy has been something people have talked about for 20 years. Organ manufacturing, especially xenotransplantation, something people talked about for 20 years. And it's just both of them are finally coming into their own. In all likelihood, there will be different solutions for different patients. I find that the thing that most people gloss over with disease generally and certainly with pulmonary disease is a tremendous heterogeneity of the patient population. And what works for some patients doesn't work for other patients. As you may know, Liana, we've been conducting pharmacogenomics screening of patients coming into our studies. And we've recently seen that there are significant pharmacogenomic differences among patients who respond to two different types of medications for pulmonary hypertension. Those differences we've seen are now correlative. So there are hypotheses that will test in future studies, but it indicates the heterogeneity of the patient population. I think for a patient who pretty much looks like they still have time on their lungs if one could reverse the remodelling process, gene therapy would be a little bit more promising. Although I'd like to note that there is increasing data out there, Liana showing that aggressive upfront treatment with Remodulin with the goal of reducing pulmonary artery pressure below 40 millimeters of mercury is also appears to be associated with a much better long-term horizon. And more and more researchers are publishing articles, where they dose to reducing pulmonary artery pressure rather than dosing to some symptomatic endpoints such as six minute walk. Dr. Matsubara of Japan is one of the leaders of this area. But UT Southwestern, University of Texas [indiscernible] therapeutics and other researchers around the world are also beginning to see that you can effect from remodeling. In other words, you can affect a disease modification, applying hypertension by aggressive upfront treatments with remodulin. That's very exciting because pressure is a kind of thing that you get into a well. And if you get into a well, of very high pressures, it's hard to get out of that well, but if you can get out of that high pressure well and drop down to below 40 millimeters of mercury, you get back to a stabilized situation and the patient can have a much better long term outlook. Now, there will be many patients who've been at super high pressures north of 60, 70, 80 millimeters of mercury for a couple years or more and they began to experience serious fibrotic issues with their pulmonary vasculature. And unfortunately for these patients, the lungs are kind of shot and that's the reason why unfortunately, mean survival is reported as any where from five to 10 years after diagnosis, depending whether the person's diagnosis, functional class three, four, and what their condition is. So if a patient has already experienced, essentially irreversible fibrotic processes in their pulmonary arteries and their pressures are super normal, I think for them, the cure is going to be a lung transplant. And I would like to conclude on this question by pointing out that one thing I always hated about lung transplants was that they were trading one disease for another. They were trading the disease whether it's pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, whatever, that gave rise to the need for a lung transplant for chronic rejection, ultimately resulting in something like bronchiolitis obliterans that destroyed their graft. So whenever you get a transplant, you are kind of trading your previous condition for long-term rejection. But we at United Therapeutics could face some enormous strides in the field of autologous manufactured organs. In other words, we start a with cyber blast of the intended patient and turned it into an IPSC cell and then read differentiated down into endothelial epithelial stroma basal cells and then expand those cells to the five to 10 billion that are needed to pulverize the lungs. So the patients that receive our autologous manufactured lungs will not have to take immunosuppressants and it truly will be a cure for those patients rather than just a bridge to another disease. Thanks so much for those testing questions Liana. And operator last question. Yes. I'm going to kind of chop on the last second part of your question and ask Dr. Peterson, our Head of Product Development and the one who -- she's really the one that made the discovery or led the team that made the discovery in terms of efficacy to confirm of Tyvaso in chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease. But we just before you get on a let me mentioned that, I don't think that there is off label use of Tyvaso in that condition and it's certainly something that we would never suggest, promote, encourage or any of the above. So we are your on label company and with that introduction, Leigh, could you talk about the timeframe that you see for the TETON study? The timeline for the FDA submission. Okay, sure. Are you also in-charge to that team? That's great. That's fantastic. And while we have you on the line, would you give a sketch of when you think that we would likely begin enrolling patients in the TETON study? And about how long do you think that study will take? Thanks so much, Leigh. So much exciting group activity going on in our product development group and really glad to share that with all of the shareholders on the call. Well, operator, thank you so much for doing such a great job of coordinating all the questions today. And I will now turn the line back to you for your wrap up statement."

Now, I will turn the call over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of our first quarter 2020 financial results and business activities of United Therapeutics. Dr. Rothblatt?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Dewey. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to start providing a overview of how we are at the beginning or toward the end of the first month of the second quarter here looking back on the past quarter. And then I'm going to turn the mike over to Michael Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and he will continue to offer you operating results of the company. Then we'll open up the call to questions and they can be directed either to Mike or I or to our Chief Financial Officer James Edgemond or to our Vice President for Product Development, Dr. Leigh Peterson. So looking back on the past quarter, I think that there were really three key themes that I have to summarize what's gone on in the past quarter. And those three themes I would label as stable, stronger, and sustainable. So let me delve into each of stable, stronger and sustainable for a moment and talk about what those words or concepts mean in the concept of -- in the context of United Therapeutics right in the middle of this COVID pandemic. So what we call the stable, the first theme, I am really glad to share that our drug manufacturing, distribution, and reimbursement have been very stable during this past quarter, notwithstanding the COVID pandemic. Every one of United Therapeutics offices and laboratories from California to North Carolina, from Maryland to Florida, from Massachusetts to Virginia, and New Hampshire have all remained open as essential biomedical research and production facilities. Our staff has continued to operate these facilities on a shift basis to reduce occupancy and to maintain physical distancing in all regards.  As a result, our production numbers this past quarter has enabled us to still maintain more than two years of finished drug inventory even while shipping out the normal and customary amount of drug to our distributors. Indeed, I can report and I'm very happy to report that doctors, pharmacies, patients, they've all reported considerable relief in knowing that United Therapeutics has more than two years of finished drug on inventory. In addition to that, we also have here in the U.S. at our site the chemical precursors on hand for making three additional years' worth of finished drug on top of the two years all in our own laboratories here at United Therapeutics. So all told, we are stable in drug production, distribution for five years all based here in the U.S.A. And I think that the reason provides so much relief to everybody and the reason I start the review with the concept of stability is when you get right down to the core purpose of the United Therapeutics, its core purpose is to provide medicines for life, to provide medicines to our patients, to provide medicines even to patients in the context of our clinical trials. So all of that we've done including with the drug delivery devices that are part and parcel of that. So I'm happy to say that at the end of the first quarter in the middle of the pandemic UT is stable. Second main theme I'd like to talk about is stronger. Here I'm referring to our pipeline. Our pipeline was very strong before this past quarter and it's even stronger as of now. It was strong before because we had great Phase III trials underway. One of them that I think you know most exciting is the Ralinepag trial best-in-class prostacyclin agonist that is undergoing worldwide trials and I should say even during this pandemic while we've not been able to enroll new patients in that trial we have been able to keep the trial going and we continue to provide clinical trial material to the patients. So that's very exciting.  We had -- also we have also underway our Phase III trials of TYVASO for COPD type of pulmonary hypertension. Same story, we're not able to enroll new patients, but we're able to keep it going that will open up a very, very large COPD pulmonary hypertension market for us based on the results of that Phase III trial. Our Phase III trial of gene therapy, the SAPPHIRE study, that could really modify and perhaps turn back the course of pulmonary hypertension. So we had a super strong pipeline before this quarter, but one of the absolute most exciting things that came out of this quarter was the data that came out of our INCREASE trial of TYVASO in the context of interstitial lung disease. Now, as we'd reported, we hit all of our primary and secondary endpoints for that INCREASE trial. And notwithstanding the COVID pandemic, our team as they work full speed we continue to be on schedule to file a supplemental NDA for the expansion of our label of TYVASO into Group 3 pulmonary hypertension specifically the interstitial lung disease variant.  And just some of you who may be new to the story here, this mentions that is larger than the Group 1 types of pulmonary hypertension for which all the current pulmonary hypertension drugs are approved for, but as to which before our INCREASE trial the new drug was proven successful in addressing this Group 3 type of pulmonary hypertension, specifically the interstitial lung disease variant. And the reason for that is that the -- this is a disease involving restriction or obstruction of the airways and the pulmonary vasculature, and so it's not really possible to treat this disease successfully with systemic drugs without giving rise to a very bad side effect consequence called ventilation perfusion mismatch. So there are only really two possibilities for treating this drug without triggering V/Q mismatch. There's the iloprost inhale drug, which is not very practical needing to be inhaled upwards of nine times a day for 15 minutes a shot or TYVASO, which is very practical four times a day, just two minutes a inhalation.  Well, we did that trial and as reported, we had stellar results and we're filing early summer and we expect approval and launch of that product in 2021. But what really made our pipelines stronger was one of the most spectacular results from that INCREASE trial. And that was about a quarter of the patients had a type of interstitial lung disease called pulmonary fibrosis. And with this type of disease the FDA has already, over the years, approved two drugs. And these two drugs, by the way, were not really potent in reversing IPF. What they were able to do was to slow the degradation in the patients forced vital capacity better than the patients who are on placebo. So they didn't improve the patient's condition, they just slowed the rate at which the patients were degrading. Now, our team was prescient I think to have forced vital capacity as the secondary endpoint in the INCREASE trial. Prescient I say because this endpoint is not necessary for approval of a drug in treating pulmonary hypertension but it is the endpoint looked at by the FDA for a drug that would be treating pulmonary fibrosis. We were able to in fact improve the forced vital capacity or the FVC of the patients with the pulmonary fibrosis by a greater amount than the other two approved drugs for pulmonary fibrosis nintedanib and pirfenidone had done in their registration trials. And on top of that are improvement of the patients' FVC was on top of those already approved background drugs because that's just standard of care for patients who have pulmonary fibrosis. So this is for a clinical drug developer, this is like a best case situation for sizing up a registration trial where you've already tested the hypothesis that you want to confirm in a registration trial. And you see here TYVASO actually had a disease modifying effect on these patients with pulmonary fibrosis by improving their FVC on top of the already approved background therapies. And those already approved background therapies had not even approved -- improved the patient's FVC, they just slowed the rate of degradation. And then it was like an icing on the cake, we were able to accomplish all of this in only eight weeks. So eight weeks after the patients were randomized, we already saw this marked improvement in FVC and that improvement was maintained until the end of the clinical trial. This is a much faster onset of improvement than was demonstrated in the nintedanib and pirfenidone studies, which in fact is mentioned, didn't actually show much of an improved at all.\nid : Let me mention one other thing why I'm so excited about this. This is really the -- other than our activities in cancer, this is the first time that United Therapeutics has undertaken an expansion of its franchise beyond pulmonary hypertension. Just so I didn't like confuse somebody here, this CFILD indication, this fibrosis indication will be in patients who don't have pulmonary hypertension. Now I mentioned about a quarter of the patients in INCREASE had the pulmonary hypertension with the pulmonary fibrosis. But in fact, the number of patients who have the pulmonary fibrosis without the pulmonary hypertension is about four times larger, well over 100,000 patients. So this TRITON study that will embark upon in the first quarter of 2021 will be United Therapeutics first on non-cancer Phase III study outside of the field of pulmonary hypertension and in a patient population that is several times larger than the pulmonary hypertension population, and finally with a mechanism of action that appears to us to actually be disease modifying based on the positive improvement in the FVC showing in those patients. So all told, by expanding beyond pulmonary hypertension and doing so with a solidly data-backed hypothesis and then the patient population several times larger than we're addressing in pulmonary hypertension, I think that there really is no doubt that we have emerged from the first quarter of 2020 with a stronger pipeline than we had even before. The third theme that I want to talk about before turning things over to Michael is sustainable. It's very fortunate and I would say that our entire pulmonary hypertension community has been blessed that COVID has not disproportionally impacted the pulmonary hypertension population. There are very various hypothesis of why this is. I think you know the kind of the Occam's Razor for cancer is it's due to the extraordinary care and caution of this population with respect to physical distancing. The patients realize that they have heart lung condition and so they are probably much more careful than other people in maintaining the distancing necessary. But in any event there are some already published articles on that COVID has not adversely impacted the PH population statistically compared to any other populations. So I do believe that we will be able to sustainably continue to help our pulmonary hypertension population as we go through what remains of the COVID pandemic. Another aspect of sustainability is that you'll see in our quarterly financials we released today, our revenues and profit margins are as good as they've been in the past, and for all that we can see, they are quite sustainable. As our Chief Financial Officer I know has talked about many times, we maintain a algorithm to ensure our profitability by setting our maximum budget at 50% of the previous year revenues. And within this budget we are able to continue to invest in all of the transformative technologies that mark our pipeline. Transformative technologies for Remodulin, such as the Remunity Pump which remains on schedule to launch in July. The manufacturing folks have continued manufacturing those pumps all during the pandemic. Again, coming in the shifts, spacing themselves out, everybody is doing the right and proper and safe thing. The implantable system for Remodulin, the ISR system, RemoPro, painless analogues of treprostinil to completely get rid of the issue of site pain. All of this we were able to do sustainably because of the maintenance of the profit margin against the constant level of revenues. We also continue to fund the market expanding products for pulmonary hypertension, like Ralinepag as I mentioned at the beginning. We have this perfect Phase III study of COPD related pulmonary hypertension. The gene therapy work, I mentioned previously. We have a once daily form of Orenitram that will enable us to continue to build on the excellent revenue growth that you've seen in the past quarter. And then, these sustainable cash flow margins that we're fortunate to have also enable us to take on new R&D challenges such as several efforts that we're now directing against that COVID using Exosome product which is an outcome of our region med research run manufacturing to treat the art sequelae of worst case COVID situations. As well as slide organ manufacturing to produce an unlimited supply of transplantable kidneys, for example, that would create literally a new paradigm of organ transplantation.  So stable, stronger, sustainable. I am absolutely full of pride in how well United Therapeutics has demonstrated its nimbleness and adaptiveness to a once in a lifetime change in environment that we're all experiencing. With that overview, I'd like to now turn the mike over to Mike Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Michael?\nIND: Let me mention one other thing why I'm so excited about this.

So stable, stronger, sustainable. I am absolutely full of pride in how well United Therapeutics has demonstrated its nimbleness and adaptiveness to a once in a lifetime change in environment that we're all experiencing. With that overview, I'd like to now turn the mike over to Mike Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Michael?\nMichael Benkowitz: Thanks, Martine. I wanted to spend a few minutes just talking about the commercial side of the business. Overall, we were very pleased with our revenue performance in the first quarter. As we mentioned quite often, our revenues reflect sales of our treprostinil based products to specialty pharmacy distributors who typically place monthly orders based on current patient utilization trends and contractual inventory requirements. Therefore, our sales do not always track the volumes our distributors are dispensing to patients in a given time period. So I'd like to provide some color around physician and patient demand for our products in the first quarter. And then, in addition, I'll touch on some early Q2 data we're seeing as a result of COVID-19. So in the first quarter back to our commercial business as a result of COVID-19 either in terms of distributor ordering patterns, which are represented by our revenues or as measured by active patients on our therapies, new patient starts, and drug expense to patients. In fact Q1 saw us build on the momentum from last year as we once again reached an all time high number of patients using one of our treprostinil medicines.\nread:\nkey:\nPAH: Finally, Unituxin continues to hum along through Q1. Year-over-year revenues grew 7% in Q1, but actual dispenses of Unituxin and the hospitals increased in the 15% to 20% range. So we're pleased with how this product is performing and are looking forward to filing our supplement soon to expand the label to include relapsed refractory neuroblastoma. Now, in terms of potential COVID-19 impact in the second quarter, it's a bit of a mixed bag thus far. On the one hand one of our specialty pharmacy distributors placed a larger than normal order for our treprostinil based products during April to increase its inventory beyond typical levels. And this was done for three reasons. First, they wanted to account for potential increased investigational use for TYVASO for acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting from COVID-19, which is a major cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Second, they wanted to prepare for an anticipated increase in patient requests for 60 to 90-day refills, that's compared to their typical 30-day supply. And third, they wanted to increase their inventory levels across various locations to ensure uninterrupted business continuity during the pandemic. On the other hand, we have seen some softening in new patient prescriptions throughout the month and also a softening in new patient starts in the last couple of weeks. We believe this is due to the inability of patients to visit their physician's office to determine whether our medicines may be appropriate. However, we are starting to hear that some institutions in various parts of the country are gearing up to start allowing patients to come back in for visits very soon. And we are aware of the increased use of telemedicine with PAH physicians. How this impacts revenues over the balance of the quarter of the year remains unclear. We don't know how long the reduction in new patient prescriptions and new patient starts will last, but we certainly expect some pent up demand that should come through in later months once things start to normalize. It's also unclear whether these events will even materially impact orders from specialty pharmacy distributors since they place orders based on current utilization trends and contractual inventory requirements. And so I think just kind of coming back to Martine, Martine's theme around sustainability, we certainly think that the commercial side of the business remains sustainable. The patients are there, they will continue to need our medicines. When they're able to access those is a little bit unclear given the current dynamics of the pandemic. But we expect that once things start to normalize, as I said, there'll be a pent up demand and we'll get those patients started on our medicines appropriately. And so with that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike. Operator, if you could now open up the lines and have on Dewey Steadman -- I think Dewey, did you want to take the calls or you want me to?\nDewey Steadman: Oh, no. You can --\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay.\nDewey Steadman: Operator, go ahead and open the Q&A first --\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Thanks. I just like to say hi to [indiscernible] on the line. Thanks, Dewey. Okay. Operator, can open up the calls.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Shibutani with Cowen. Your line is open.\nChris Shibutani:\nerrors:\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Chris. Interesting question. I'm going to ask Mike if he could please respond to you.\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes, so we get some visibility into the reasons for the switchback. We don't get total visibility, but anecdotally what we hear from physicians and through the channel is that patients are experiencing either adverse events, worsening of symptoms, in some cases hospitalizations when they make the switch over to generic treprostinil. I think we all know that while the FDA considers the generic version to be the same as the brand version they do allow for some variances and because these are very, very sick and very, very fragile patients I think we can hypothesize that those differences become magnified in a very fragile patient population, and so as a result we've seen actually increase in the number of patients that have transitioned back to branded Remodulin.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Mike.\nChris Shibutani: Got it.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Eun Yang with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nEun Yang: Thank you. So because of the COVID-19 impact there are several studies, clinical trials have been positive for new patient enrolment. So one of them is the dry powder inhaler Treprostinil Technosphere. So with that, I guess we are not expanding -- expecting the data by mid this year. Then question is, by when the study has to resume in order for us to see the data this year? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Sure. Very interesting question. And I'm going to ask Dr. Peterson who's in charge of that study to answer it. But just so I want to keep everything in perspective while she's compiling her answer. When the COVID pandemic began to fall down upon us the first thing that we were concerned with of course was to make sure that all of the distribution channels and everybody were set and were solid so everybody could get their medicine. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have done that very, very well.  Now, our clinical trials, they presented a interesting situation in that the default situation would be that you might have to just like stop the clinical trial and then restart it all over again, which would be unfortunate. So we worked very, very hard again to make sure that our clinical trials were not stopped but that just that the enrollment in them of new patients was suspended so that as hospitals are opening up and you heard Mike Benkowitz mention previously that some of these centers are now beginning to open up and see patients again that we could without really missing a beat continue the enrollment of the patients. So even though we've suspended new enrollment, the patients who already in the BREEZE trial that you're referring to the PERFECT trial that I mentioned of our COPD, the Ralinepag trial, which involves patients all over the world that we have to get them their clinical trial material, we have been doing all of that throughout the entire COVID situation without missing a beat. So speaking of beats, Dr. Peterson, she's a drummer. Would you like to provide little more insight on the timeframe around BREEZE right now?\nLeigh Peterson: Yes, sure, thank you. So this BREEZE study as you may already know is a study where patients who are on TYVASO are transitioned over to our trade T formulation with the dry powder and the device that we have with MannKind. And so we had -- so this study was actually 45-patient study. It's not very big. FDA has agreed to this. And we're about a third of the way through enrollment. In fact, the study's primary endpoint is taken at three weeks after the patient starts. And so we were lucky enough to have had all of the patients who are currently enrolled to complete that period so we won't have missing data on the ongoing patients. \nthe:\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Dr. Peterson. Thank you, Eun. Operator, next call, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.\nHartaj Singh: Great, thank you. And thank you for all the work United Therapeutics is doing on behalf of Martine and stay safe. I just had one question on Orenitram. You had I think a 20% growth in the fourth quarter, 18% this quarter. Can you just give us some color on where that's coming from, is that your new patients are getting maybe a little bit of market share from Uptravi, any color there I would really appreciate it. And again, thank you for all the work.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, Hartaj, and thank you for acknowledging our efforts on COVID. We have just heard briefly before a segway over to Mike to address the question on where the Orenitram growth is coming from. We have a cell therapy product in patients with COVID and two parallel arts initiatives for patients who are suffering the worst consequences of COVID as well as an advanced form of our total artificial one device to be an alternative to the intubation and sedation that's necessary with current ventilator. So we have quite a bit of activity going on directly in COVID and most importantly taking care of everybody and making sure everybody's safe. So thanks for that recognition, Hartaj. Mike, can you talk about where the Orenitram growth is coming from?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Thanks, Orenitram. It's kind of wide. Let me just sort of step back and obviously point out the obvious, which is we had the label expansion for Orenitram come through in October, reflecting the FREEDOM-EV data. And so we've had about really about quarter-and-a-half now of being able to promote from a sales and marketing standpoint on the new data. So that is certainly, I think helped because I think as we've said on these calls, and as we talked about in the press release last week, the data really when you look at it in its totality is pretty compelling. And so I think that message is getting through to physicians. And so, when we look at where the growth is coming from, as I said, it's really three areas, it's hard for me to guess at this point to say how much is attributed to each. But I would say first it's coming from patient staying on therapy, increasing their dose. So that's -- that's one piece of that. The second piece of it is just new patient growth generally and that's obviously a big part of it. We're continuing to see really nice -- really nice trends in terms of patients on therapy, and then underlying that is new prescribers. So prescribers that either had never used a Orenitram or had used it early on after the FREEDOM-M trial and for whatever reason stopped using that. I kind of define it as new prescriber as somebody that has not used it at all or has not prescribed within say the 12 months prior to writing. So we certainly see some increases there and particularly among, I think the KOLs, the more experienced PAH physicians that maybe used initially went away from it. I think the ED data has really, I think compelled them to come back and take another look and they're giving it another try.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike. Operator, next call, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJessica Fye: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you please walk through the plan development program and regulatory strategy for your RemoPro candidate the IND for which I believe cleared in the first quarter? Do you need to run efficacy trials there or just show like pain and safety compared to Remodulin, and if I could just follow-up on Hartaj's question, I'm curious about the potential interplay between the new starts on Orenitram and the slight year-over-year decline in Tyvaso? So do you think any of the Orenitram growth came at the expense of new Tyvaso starts?\nMartine Rothblatt: Sure. So why don't we have Mike, since we're already on the Orenitram team answer your second question. And then Mike, if you could pass the call to Dr. Peterson for her to talk a little bit about the anticipated timeline on RemoPro.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Yes, so I don't really -- it's adjusted. At some level, it's hard to know exactly. But what I can tell you in terms of looking at just sort of in terms of whether a doctor saying okay, I want to use Orenitram instead of where I would have otherwise used Tyvaso. So that's a little harder to get insight to. But at a patient trend level in terms of active patients, our active patients on Tyvaso are up about 10% year-over-year. So we're continuing to add to our Tyvaso active patient count as we're adding to our Orenitram count. So I don't -- I mean, so I'm sure those trade-offs are being made on the margins but in general, the front-end module on to the franchise as a whole continues to grow across the three products. So it's hard to say that one is cannibalizing the other. But again, I think at an individual physician model there, yes that that may be entering into their into the calculus but at kind of macro level, we're seeing growth across the board.\nMartine Rothblatt: Absolutely sustainable, I love it. Leigh?\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. So for RemoPro I will say I'll give you the answer of what our statistician always tells me when I ask questions like this, it depends. It depends on the result. And as you probably already know, we are in Phase 1 looking at these, the RemoPro products, the Pro drugs of treprostinil with regard to pain, and also the pharmacokinetics. In the pharmacokinetics, we're looking at are not only of the Pro drug itself, so in that case, it's the parent molecule, but also of treprostinil which is really the metabolite, if you will, of the Pro drugs. And so with as far as the development program goes, it depends on what we see in the PK results. And so but what we're shooting for and we're looking for the compounds that that best show this is a Pro drug that is injected and very quickly converts to treprostinil and has a high treprostinil level relative to the control which would be basically injecting treprostinil, the parent compound as Remodulin. So if we have good conversion of the Pro drug and we reach treprostinil levels comparable to that with the parent drug, we can FDA has said that we don't need to do an efficacy study because we've already shown that treprostinil works and so if we have good conversion to treprostinil, we're good. And then, so what we do have to do is a safety study. And again that also depends on conversion. If there's a lot of the Pro drugs in the patients, we will do a safety study it. We have asked for about a 45 patient safety study for this. And again, this would be to show that the Pro drug that's in the system prior to conversion is safe. And so that's -- that's the plan that we don't have to do an efficacy study. We have feedback from FDA on that. But again, it's providing that we do get what we're expecting, which is a high conversion of the Pro drug to treprostinil and showing comparable treprostinil blood levels from that product.\nMartine Rothblatt: Excellent. Thank you so much, Dr. Peterson. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Liana Moussatos with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nLiana Moussatos: Thank you. What percent of treprostinil prescriptions are new versus refill?\nMartine Rothblatt: Good morning, Liana. Thank you for the question. What percentage of treprostinil prescriptions are new versus refill? I think once again, Mike Benkowitz should be the best person on the call to answer that question.\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes, Liana, that's a good one. I don't know if I have that off the top of my head. Let me well actually think about that for a second. It's --\nLiana Moussatos: Half, more than half, less than half of new.\nMichael Benkowitz: It's less than -- in terms of new prescriptions each day. I think about it each month. It's definitely less than half. It's probably on the order of about 5% to 10%.\nLiana Moussatos: Okay.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks Mike. Thanks, Liana. Next call and this will have to be I believe the last one, operator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Martin Auster with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMartin Auster: Hey Martine, how are you. I'm really, really excited to hear the progress with Tyvaso and the TRITON study that you're planning and so to that effect, I'm super pumped to see the increased data. I know that you're working with ATS on a virtual presentation but I guess from the website need to get clear they're going to have that format available. If that is not available by mid-May, are you planning to just make a separate kind of company sponsored presentation of the data? And then the second one would be just a quick follow-up for Leigh on Jessica's question on RemoPro is that Phase I currently enrolling volunteers and when do you think we might get some data on the PK and the tolerability profile of that product?\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes, thanks, Marty for both questions. I think both are pretty much in Leigh's daily work. So Lee, can you talk about what you're thinking is in terms of TRITON and the ATS on the latest information that we have in terms of what kind of data presentation would be possible there.\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. So we are planning, we've been accepted to ATS for our presentation, it will be a virtual presentation for the increased results, the full results and but we not got the timing on that. So I'm sorry, I can't give you a specific date. They haven't given us one. We just in this summer and we've also submitted those results to a journal. And it's under review right now. And we expect this year anytime now their comment and to publish that full publication this summer as well. So, one way or another, we'll have the results to you very soon, and then we too are very, very excited. So thank you. Thank you for saying that. It's truly a blessing to have those types of results come in our lifetime.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Leigh. James a few, we have our Chief Financial Officer on the phone and it's really important, I think for everybody on the call to appreciate what an amazing job and difficult job it is in the midst of a pandemic to be able to go ahead and closeout the year, complete your year-end audit, gather all the necessary financial information for 10-Q. Not to mention the processing of well over a million dollars a day in account payables to go to all of the right places and none of the wrong places and to do all of this remotely. It's a tremendous testament to the -- really the strength and stability of the United Therapeutics as a business organization to move so smoothly through this pandemic without missing a beat. So, since nobody asked a question specifically for James, I would like to ask him to say a word or two from the topic of our quarterly earnings. James?\nJames Edgemond: Yes, Martine, thank you very much for the opportunity. A couple of things come to mind as you mentioned kind of the processes, the whole organization has in place really to execute, whether it's your end of the quarter, as we all tend to work remotely. So it's certainly within all the groups that we've talked about from the R&D, to manufacturing, the advance teams and all the administrative functions that I think is a real testament. The other thing that's very important is the realization of the strength around the balance sheet. As we entered COVID-19 and as we continue during this pandemic, from a financial stability perspective, we're well-capitalized to be able to continue to execute on our research and development program as we make sure we take care of our patients as well as our fellow Unitarians. And it's really important for people to realize that strength as we continue during this time that we're able to execute as an organization which should be reassuring to many, both listeners on this call and again patients and people in the organization. So I just thought those were two things that I think are very important to mention. And I appreciate the opportunity to allow me to do that. So back to you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, James. Well, operator, we've had a great chance to address most of the people in queue and the line and thank you so much for organizing the call. Everybody on the phones, thank you for your continued support for United Therapeutics. Our hearts go out to those of you who have loved ones or friends that are suffering directly from the COVID pandemic health wise for sure, economic wise, otherwise and for those of you who are related to frontline healthcare workers, our complete admiration and respect for everybody who is out there fighting on the frontline. Operator, you can wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation conference call. A re-broadcast will be available for replay for one week by dialing 1 (800) 585-8367 with international callers dialing 1 (416) 621-4642 and using access code 1984097.",

            "content": "Thanks, Martine. I wanted to spend a few minutes just talking about the commercial side of the business. Overall, we were very pleased with our revenue performance in the first quarter. As we mentioned quite often, our revenues reflect sales of our treprostinil based products to specialty pharmacy distributors who typically place monthly orders based on current patient utilization trends and contractual inventory requirements. Therefore, our sales do not always track the volumes our distributors are dispensing to patients in a given time period. So I'd like to provide some color around physician and patient demand for our products in the first quarter. And then, in addition, I'll touch on some early Q2 data we're seeing as a result of COVID-19. So in the first quarter back to our commercial business as a result of COVID-19 either in terms of distributor ordering patterns, which are represented by our revenues or as measured by active patients on our therapies, new patient starts, and drug expense to patients. In fact Q1 saw us build on the momentum from last year as we once again reached an all time high number of patients using one of our treprostinil medicines. Yes, so we get some visibility into the reasons for the switchback. We don't get total visibility, but anecdotally what we hear from physicians and through the channel is that patients are experiencing either adverse events, worsening of symptoms, in some cases hospitalizations when they make the switch over to generic treprostinil. I think we all know that while the FDA considers the generic version to be the same as the brand version they do allow for some variances and because these are very, very sick and very, very fragile patients I think we can hypothesize that those differences become magnified in a very fragile patient population, and so as a result we've seen actually increase in the number of patients that have transitioned back to branded Remodulin. Sure. Thanks, Orenitram. It's kind of wide. Let me just sort of step back and obviously point out the obvious, which is we had the label expansion for Orenitram come through in October, reflecting the FREEDOM-EV data. And so we've had about really about quarter-and-a-half now of being able to promote from a sales and marketing standpoint on the new data. So that is certainly, I think helped because I think as we've said on these calls, and as we talked about in the press release last week, the data really when you look at it in its totality is pretty compelling. And so I think that message is getting through to physicians. And so, when we look at where the growth is coming from, as I said, it's really three areas, it's hard for me to guess at this point to say how much is attributed to each. But I would say first it's coming from patient staying on therapy, increasing their dose. So that's -- that's one piece of that. The second piece of it is just new patient growth generally and that's obviously a big part of it. We're continuing to see really nice -- really nice trends in terms of patients on therapy, and then underlying that is new prescribers. So prescribers that either had never used a Orenitram or had used it early on after the FREEDOM-M trial and for whatever reason stopped using that. I kind of define it as new prescriber as somebody that has not used it at all or has not prescribed within say the 12 months prior to writing. So we certainly see some increases there and particularly among, I think the KOLs, the more experienced PAH physicians that maybe used initially went away from it. I think the ED data has really, I think compelled them to come back and take another look and they're giving it another try. Sure. Yes, so I don't really -- it's adjusted. At some level, it's hard to know exactly. But what I can tell you in terms of looking at just sort of in terms of whether a doctor saying okay, I want to use Orenitram instead of where I would have otherwise used Tyvaso. So that's a little harder to get insight to. But at a patient trend level in terms of active patients, our active patients on Tyvaso are up about 10% year-over-year. So we're continuing to add to our Tyvaso active patient count as we're adding to our Orenitram count. So I don't -- I mean, so I'm sure those trade-offs are being made on the margins but in general, the front-end module on to the franchise as a whole continues to grow across the three products. So it's hard to say that one is cannibalizing the other. But again, I think at an individual physician model there, yes that that may be entering into their into the calculus but at kind of macro level, we're seeing growth across the board. Yes, Liana, that's a good one. I don't know if I have that off the top of my head. Let me well actually think about that for a second. It's -- It's less than -- in terms of new prescriptions each day. I think about it each month. It's definitely less than half. It's probably on the order of about 5% to 10%."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Leigh Peterson",
            "content": "Yes, sure, thank you. So this BREEZE study as you may already know is a study where patients who are on TYVASO are transitioned over to our trade T formulation with the dry powder and the device that we have with MannKind. And so we had -- so this study was actually 45-patient study. It's not very big. FDA has agreed to this. And we're about a third of the way through enrollment. In fact, the study's primary endpoint is taken at three weeks after the patient starts. And so we were lucky enough to have had all of the patients who are currently enrolled to complete that period so we won't have missing data on the ongoing patients. Yes. So for RemoPro I will say I'll give you the answer of what our statistician always tells me when I ask questions like this, it depends. It depends on the result. And as you probably already know, we are in Phase 1 looking at these, the RemoPro products, the Pro drugs of treprostinil with regard to pain, and also the pharmacokinetics. In the pharmacokinetics, we're looking at are not only of the Pro drug itself, so in that case, it's the parent molecule, but also of treprostinil which is really the metabolite, if you will, of the Pro drugs. And so with as far as the development program goes, it depends on what we see in the PK results. And so but what we're shooting for and we're looking for the compounds that that best show this is a Pro drug that is injected and very quickly converts to treprostinil and has a high treprostinil level relative to the control which would be basically injecting treprostinil, the parent compound as Remodulin. So if we have good conversion of the Pro drug and we reach treprostinil levels comparable to that with the parent drug, we can FDA has said that we don't need to do an efficacy study because we've already shown that treprostinil works and so if we have good conversion to treprostinil, we're good. And then, so what we do have to do is a safety study. And again that also depends on conversion. If there's a lot of the Pro drugs in the patients, we will do a safety study it. We have asked for about a 45 patient safety study for this. And again, this would be to show that the Pro drug that's in the system prior to conversion is safe. And so that's -- that's the plan that we don't have to do an efficacy study. We have feedback from FDA on that. But again, it's providing that we do get what we're expecting, which is a high conversion of the Pro drug to treprostinil and showing comparable treprostinil blood levels from that product. Yes. So we are planning, we've been accepted to ATS for our presentation, it will be a virtual presentation for the increased results, the full results and but we not got the timing on that. So I'm sorry, I can't give you a specific date. They haven't given us one. We just in this summer and we've also submitted those results to a journal. And it's under review right now. And we expect this year anytime now their comment and to publish that full publication this summer as well. So, one way or another, we'll have the results to you very soon, and then we too are very, very excited. So thank you. Thank you for saying that. It's truly a blessing to have those types of results come in our lifetime."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thank you, Dewey. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to start providing a overview of how we are at the beginning or toward the end of the first month of the second quarter here looking back on the past quarter. And then I'm going to turn the mike over to Michael Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and he will continue to offer you operating results of the company. Then we'll open up the call to questions and they can be directed either to Mike or I or to our Chief Financial Officer James Edgemond or to our Vice President for Product Development, Dr. Leigh Peterson. So looking back on the past quarter, I think that there were really three key themes that I have to summarize what's gone on in the past quarter. And those three themes I would label as stable, stronger, and sustainable. So let me delve into each of stable, stronger and sustainable for a moment and talk about what those words or concepts mean in the concept of -- in the context of United Therapeutics right in the middle of this COVID pandemic. So what we call the stable, the first theme, I am really glad to share that our drug manufacturing, distribution, and reimbursement have been very stable during this past quarter, notwithstanding the COVID pandemic. Every one of United Therapeutics offices and laboratories from California to North Carolina, from Maryland to Florida, from Massachusetts to Virginia, and New Hampshire have all remained open as essential biomedical research and production facilities. Our staff has continued to operate these facilities on a shift basis to reduce occupancy and to maintain physical distancing in all regards.  As a result, our production numbers this past quarter has enabled us to still maintain more than two years of finished drug inventory even while shipping out the normal and customary amount of drug to our distributors. Indeed, I can report and I'm very happy to report that doctors, pharmacies, patients, they've all reported considerable relief in knowing that United Therapeutics has more than two years of finished drug on inventory. In addition to that, we also have here in the U.S. at our site the chemical precursors on hand for making three additional years' worth of finished drug on top of the two years all in our own laboratories here at United Therapeutics. So all told, we are stable in drug production, distribution for five years all based here in the U.S.A. And I think that the reason provides so much relief to everybody and the reason I start the review with the concept of stability is when you get right down to the core purpose of the United Therapeutics, its core purpose is to provide medicines for life, to provide medicines to our patients, to provide medicines even to patients in the context of our clinical trials. So all of that we've done including with the drug delivery devices that are part and parcel of that. So I'm happy to say that at the end of the first quarter in the middle of the pandemic UT is stable. Second main theme I'd like to talk about is stronger. Here I'm referring to our pipeline. Our pipeline was very strong before this past quarter and it's even stronger as of now. It was strong before because we had great Phase III trials underway. One of them that I think you know most exciting is the Ralinepag trial best-in-class prostacyclin agonist that is undergoing worldwide trials and I should say even during this pandemic while we've not been able to enroll new patients in that trial we have been able to keep the trial going and we continue to provide clinical trial material to the patients. So that's very exciting.  We had -- also we have also underway our Phase III trials of TYVASO for COPD type of pulmonary hypertension. Same story, we're not able to enroll new patients, but we're able to keep it going that will open up a very, very large COPD pulmonary hypertension market for us based on the results of that Phase III trial. Our Phase III trial of gene therapy, the SAPPHIRE study, that could really modify and perhaps turn back the course of pulmonary hypertension. So we had a super strong pipeline before this quarter, but one of the absolute most exciting things that came out of this quarter was the data that came out of our INCREASE trial of TYVASO in the context of interstitial lung disease. Now, as we'd reported, we hit all of our primary and secondary endpoints for that INCREASE trial. And notwithstanding the COVID pandemic, our team as they work full speed we continue to be on schedule to file a supplemental NDA for the expansion of our label of TYVASO into Group 3 pulmonary hypertension specifically the interstitial lung disease variant.  And just some of you who may be new to the story here, this mentions that is larger than the Group 1 types of pulmonary hypertension for which all the current pulmonary hypertension drugs are approved for, but as to which before our INCREASE trial the new drug was proven successful in addressing this Group 3 type of pulmonary hypertension, specifically the interstitial lung disease variant. And the reason for that is that the -- this is a disease involving restriction or obstruction of the airways and the pulmonary vasculature, and so it's not really possible to treat this disease successfully with systemic drugs without giving rise to a very bad side effect consequence called ventilation perfusion mismatch. So there are only really two possibilities for treating this drug without triggering V/Q mismatch. There's the iloprost inhale drug, which is not very practical needing to be inhaled upwards of nine times a day for 15 minutes a shot or TYVASO, which is very practical four times a day, just two minutes a inhalation.  Well, we did that trial and as reported, we had stellar results and we're filing early summer and we expect approval and launch of that product in 2021. But what really made our pipelines stronger was one of the most spectacular results from that INCREASE trial. And that was about a quarter of the patients had a type of interstitial lung disease called pulmonary fibrosis. And with this type of disease the FDA has already, over the years, approved two drugs. And these two drugs, by the way, were not really potent in reversing IPF. What they were able to do was to slow the degradation in the patients forced vital capacity better than the patients who are on placebo. So they didn't improve the patient's condition, they just slowed the rate at which the patients were degrading. Now, our team was prescient I think to have forced vital capacity as the secondary endpoint in the INCREASE trial. Prescient I say because this endpoint is not necessary for approval of a drug in treating pulmonary hypertension but it is the endpoint looked at by the FDA for a drug that would be treating pulmonary fibrosis. We were able to in fact improve the forced vital capacity or the FVC of the patients with the pulmonary fibrosis by a greater amount than the other two approved drugs for pulmonary fibrosis nintedanib and pirfenidone had done in their registration trials. And on top of that are improvement of the patients' FVC was on top of those already approved background drugs because that's just standard of care for patients who have pulmonary fibrosis. So this is for a clinical drug developer, this is like a best case situation for sizing up a registration trial where you've already tested the hypothesis that you want to confirm in a registration trial. And you see here TYVASO actually had a disease modifying effect on these patients with pulmonary fibrosis by improving their FVC on top of the already approved background therapies. And those already approved background therapies had not even approved -- improved the patient's FVC, they just slowed the rate of degradation. And then it was like an icing on the cake, we were able to accomplish all of this in only eight weeks. So eight weeks after the patients were randomized, we already saw this marked improvement in FVC and that improvement was maintained until the end of the clinical trial. This is a much faster onset of improvement than was demonstrated in the nintedanib and pirfenidone studies, which in fact is mentioned, didn't actually show much of an improved at all. Thanks so much, Mike. Operator, if you could now open up the lines and have on Dewey Steadman -- I think Dewey, did you want to take the calls or you want me to? Okay. Okay. Thanks. I just like to say hi to [indiscernible] on the line. Thanks, Dewey. Okay. Operator, can open up the calls. Thanks, Chris. Interesting question. I'm going to ask Mike if he could please respond to you. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question. Sure. Very interesting question. And I'm going to ask Dr. Peterson who's in charge of that study to answer it. But just so I want to keep everything in perspective while she's compiling her answer. When the COVID pandemic began to fall down upon us the first thing that we were concerned with of course was to make sure that all of the distribution channels and everybody were set and were solid so everybody could get their medicine. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have done that very, very well.  Now, our clinical trials, they presented a interesting situation in that the default situation would be that you might have to just like stop the clinical trial and then restart it all over again, which would be unfortunate. So we worked very, very hard again to make sure that our clinical trials were not stopped but that just that the enrollment in them of new patients was suspended so that as hospitals are opening up and you heard Mike Benkowitz mention previously that some of these centers are now beginning to open up and see patients again that we could without really missing a beat continue the enrollment of the patients. So even though we've suspended new enrollment, the patients who already in the BREEZE trial that you're referring to the PERFECT trial that I mentioned of our COPD, the Ralinepag trial, which involves patients all over the world that we have to get them their clinical trial material, we have been doing all of that throughout the entire COVID situation without missing a beat. So speaking of beats, Dr. Peterson, she's a drummer. Would you like to provide little more insight on the timeframe around BREEZE right now? Thank you so much, Hartaj, and thank you for acknowledging our efforts on COVID. We have just heard briefly before a segway over to Mike to address the question on where the Orenitram growth is coming from. We have a cell therapy product in patients with COVID and two parallel arts initiatives for patients who are suffering the worst consequences of COVID as well as an advanced form of our total artificial one device to be an alternative to the intubation and sedation that's necessary with current ventilator. So we have quite a bit of activity going on directly in COVID and most importantly taking care of everybody and making sure everybody's safe. So thanks for that recognition, Hartaj. Mike, can you talk about where the Orenitram growth is coming from? Thanks so much, Mike. Operator, next call, please. Sure. So why don't we have Mike, since we're already on the Orenitram team answer your second question. And then Mike, if you could pass the call to Dr. Peterson for her to talk a little bit about the anticipated timeline on RemoPro. Absolutely sustainable, I love it. Leigh? Excellent. Thank you so much, Dr. Peterson. Operator, next question. Good morning, Liana. Thank you for the question. What percentage of treprostinil prescriptions are new versus refill? I think once again, Mike Benkowitz should be the best person on the call to answer that question. Thanks Mike. Thanks, Liana. Next call and this will have to be I believe the last one, operator. Yes, thanks, Marty for both questions. I think both are pretty much in Leigh's daily work. So Lee, can you talk about what you're thinking is in terms of TRITON and the ATS on the latest information that we have in terms of what kind of data presentation would be possible there. Thanks so much, Leigh. James a few, we have our Chief Financial Officer on the phone and it's really important, I think for everybody on the call to appreciate what an amazing job and difficult job it is in the midst of a pandemic to be able to go ahead and closeout the year, complete your year-end audit, gather all the necessary financial information for 10-Q. Not to mention the processing of well over a million dollars a day in account payables to go to all of the right places and none of the wrong places and to do all of this remotely. It's a tremendous testament to the -- really the strength and stability of the United Therapeutics as a business organization to move so smoothly through this pandemic without missing a beat. So, since nobody asked a question specifically for James, I would like to ask him to say a word or two from the topic of our quarterly earnings. James? Thanks so much, James. Well, operator, we've had a great chance to address most of the people in queue and the line and thank you so much for organizing the call.

Now I'll turn the call over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of the fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results and business activities of United Therapeutics. Dr. Rothblatt?\nMartine Rothblatt: Good morning, and thank you, Dewey, for that great introduction. We are very excited about this 2021 annual results call. It's -- 2021, I think, beyond the doubt, has been the most exciting year in our company's history. There are a couple of big picture observations here that I'd like to start with, and then I'll go into some more details. From the big picture standpoint, first of all, we grew both patient count and revenues by double-digit percentages in 2021, as we had forecast we would do at the start of the year. Generics have not impacted our treprostinil growth trajectory because patients, physicians, payers, they all recognize our outstanding commitment and track record for customer service and supply chain reliability. Our continued double-digit percentage patient growth is how we get to our announced goal of 25,000 patients by 2025, and we remain right on target to make that goal. In fact, we expect double-digit patient growth again this year in 2022. The second grow big picture item is that our organ manufacturing products made a dramatic and highly successful debut with one 10 gene UHeart, two, 10 gene UKidneys and 2 UThymoKidneys transplanted. Of course, the focus of everybody is on our living UHeart recipient, Mr. David Bennett Sr. So I'm very pleased to report that he is doing well at almost two-months post-transplant. Specifically, his cardiovascular function at 7 weeks is excellent, and there's no sign of rejection even after a 30-day postoperative biopsy.  Although he has a lot of non-heart serious health challenges, he said last night, \"Thank you for this chance to live. And my response to Mr. Bennett was, thank you, Mr. Bennett for giving us this chance to let countless thousands of others also live. I believe our clear cut successes in 2021 with xeno products coupled with our core competencies in this area, our GalSafe meat, for example, was approved by the FDA in December 2020, and our core competencies in GMP manufacturing and product development, all show that our organ manufacturing pipeline is now more credible than ever and of truly momentous potential. Now beyond these big picture headlines, there has been a great deal of progress in advancing our pharmaceutical pipeline as well. Some highlights are: first, our once-daily treatment for PAH, ralinepag, is progressing nicely toward wrapping up its Phase III enrollment. Second, our Phase III PERFECT trial, which is testing a first-ever treatment for COPD-related pulmonary hypertension is steadily racking up more patient randomizations month-by-month toward completion of its Phase III trial.  Our revolutionary disease-modifying effort of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, which we call the TETON trial is doing so well in its U.S. Phase III enrollment that we opened up a TETON 2 Phase III trial outside the U.S. so that we could hopefully offer this product worldwide. Our super convenient Tyvaso DPI product remains well positioned for its summer 2022 launch. The FDA did just delay its approval decision from this month to May, but that 3-month detour is not important compared to the product's blockbuster revenue potential and patent life well into the 2030s. Three-months delay to start on a billion-dollar revenue trajectory is no big deal. Mike will now brief you on our commercial progress. But in summary, for 2021, I can say we hit our patient growth and revenue growth targets. We validated three new xeno-organ product candidates. And in so doing, we've launched a whole new category of biotechnology. We have 7 Phase III trials underway with multiple new product candidates. And most important of all, in this past year, I'd like to say we saved the life of Mr. Bennett with a 10 gene xenoheart. We saved the life -- the live, sorry, we saved the lives of at least 100 children stricken with neuroblastoma, thanks to our Unituxin medicine. We have now saved over 200 lives of lung transplant patients by increasing the usable donor lung supply with our lung bioengineering technology. And we have saved or improved the lives of thousands of pulmonary hypertension patients in the past year with our Remodulin, Remunity, Tyvaso and Orenitram products. From the headline saving of one life to the kind of like prayers granted saving of 100 children's lives to the now almost routine saving and improving of thousands of lives, I can most confidently report that UT's first year as a public benefit company has been super true to our public benefit purpose. Mike, can you lead us off now with commercial operations?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Thanks, Martine, and good morning, everybody. As Martine said, we're very pleased to have posted double-digit revenue and patient growth for the full year of 2021, ending the year with more than 10,000 patients on one of our treprostinil therapies. This quarter, I'd like to dive into the underlying performance of our three treprostinil products, Tyvaso, Remodulin and Orenitram. As usual, I'm going to focus more on our patient metrics, and I'll remind everyone that our quarterly treprostinil revenue does not always track exactly with quarterly underlying patient demand due to our specialty pharmacy partner ordering patterns. So I'll begin with Tyvaso. As you may recall, in early 2021, we established a goal to double the number of patients on Tyvaso from approximately 3,000 when the PH-ILD indication was added to the label to 6,000 by the end of 2022. This assumes no COVID-related impacts to physician access and patient initiation of therapy and importantly recognizes that our path to doubling may not be linear. The fourth quarter was our third quarter of the PH-ILD launch. And in this quarter, we had the highest number of Tyvaso referrals, which is what we call prescriptions since launch, and we added close to 300 patients to our Tyvaso active patient census. Our new patient starts were less than Q3, which is common in the fourth quarter as many patients opt to wait until after the holidays to begin advanced therapies. Our specialty pharmacy partners are working to clear this backlog and get these patients started on therapy during the current quarter. We continue to anticipate a CMS coverage decision regarding Medicare reimbursement for Tyvaso and PH-ILD any time between now and May of this year. All the necessary steps have been completed, including the close of a public comment period last year. We can't predict the timing of this coverage decision, but in the meantime, federal health care patients still have the opportunity to apply to our patient assistance program to access Tyvaso therapy prior to the coverage decision if they are eligible. We anticipate three core drivers for continued Tyvaso work over the next several quarters. I think I mentioned these on the last call. First, we think the CMS coverage decision in PH-ILD will be a driver for Tyvaso growth through the middle of this year. Even though federal health care patients may apply for our patient assistance program, we are hearing through the channel that many physicians are simply waiting for CMS coverage before prescribing Tyvaso in their PH-ILD patients. Second, we continue to grow the Tyvaso prescriber base, particularly among ILD treaters, and expect to see continued growth in prescriptions from these physicians over the next two quarters and beyond as we continue our outreach and educational efforts in this space. Up until now, the vast majority of Tyvaso prescribing has come from historical PAH trial. So there is a lot of as yet untapped potential in this area. And finally, we view the upcoming Tyvaso DPI approval as an additional catalyst to Tyvaso growth. While we would have been thrilled with an FDA approval for Tyvaso DPI this week, as we said on our Q3 call, we've been assuming a launch by summer of this year. So nothing's really changed in that regard. In the meantime, we are completing our launch preparations, and we will be ready to launch immediately upon approval. Moving to Orenitram. We saw yet another quarter of record patient accounts during the fourth quarter. As we've discussed before, we believe this uptick is driven by the FREEDOM-EV label expansion now that we're able to have more robust interactions with prescribers about the data. And finally, we're pleased with the continued strong performance of Remodulin despite the launch of a generic form of subcutaneous treprostinil last year. That generic launch has continued to play out closely with what we saw with the IV generic launch in 2019, with an initial bolus of patients, primarily those dual-eligible Medicare Medicaid patients transitioning to the generic treprostinil trickling down to an immaterial number of generic transitions in recent months. The feedback we've received on our Remunity pump has been quite positive in our early launch efforts. As part of that feedback, we learned that the pump's alarms, can, in some cases, be overly sensitive. To be clear, the issues we're seeing with the alarms are not safety issues. But to ensure that physicians and patients have an awesome experience with the pump, we recently paused the introduction of new patients Remunity, while we work with our partner, DEKA, to optimize the alarm profile. We just completed final testing of the new alarm system. Everything is working as expected, and we will recommence our Remunity rollout next week. To wrap up, we're pleased with the progress with Tyvaso in PH-ILD. We look forward to a CMS coverage decision in May or earlier. Likewise, we're on track to achieve our 6,000 patients on Tyvaso by the end of the year, and we're pleased with the continued momentum for Orenitram. Finally, we think that our Remodulin revenues will remain robust despite generic competition, especially once we recommence the introduction of new patients to the Remunity pump. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike. Super exciting about the Remunity breakout next week. Awesome. So operator, I understand that you probably have some people in queue and feel free to bring them on.\nOperator:  Your first question today comes from the line of Joseph Thome with Cowen and Co. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Thome: Good morning and thank you for taking my question and congrats on the progress. Maybe just on the Tyvaso DPI request by the FDA. Are you able to provide a little bit more information as to the type of information that you submitted? And then in terms of the safety profile you've seen with Tyvaso DPI to date, some high-level thoughts there, especially as it relates to potential for bronchospasm? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. Thanks Joe. We've really had some absolutely great experience with the Tyvaso DPI to date, and we have not experienced those bronchospasm side effects that you referred to. So we really don't believe that that's going to be an issue at all. The -- there is some more information in the press release if you look down towards the second-or-so page of the press release. Be a little bit more information there about the submission and what was admitted and not submitted. So I think it's all really quite routine and the FDA doing their job as best that they can. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks and as Mike emphasized in his remarks, three-months is really meaningless in the context of this product's life. This product has a very long patent life. It is an amazing product. I mean it's so convenient and easy for the patients to use. We have the great results of the BREEZE trial.  It's going to end up being used, I'm confident, by thousands and thousands. And over the course of its life, like, 10,000 more or more patients. It's just an amazing product. So it will get out there. Everybody just has to make sure that, like all the boxes are checked and the Is are dotted and the Ts are crossed. And as Mike said, we feel confident with the launch by the time frames that we've previously guided everyone to.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks for the question and operator you can bring up the next one.\nOperator: Your next question today comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nEun Yang: Thank you. Another question on DPI. Once it's approved, does it need to go through a CMS approval process similar to the PH-ILD indication for Medicare coverage?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Eun. So nice to hear your voice this morning. I think we have a lot of experts on our call, but I think Mike Benkowitz would be the best person to respond to your question. Mike, if that's okay?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Happy to take that question. So there is a seamless approval process that will need to happen or review process that will need to happen with Tyvaso DPI, but it's different than what we're experiencing with PH-ILD. So for PHI -- sorry, for PH-ILD. So right now, PH-ILD is approved for use with our TD-300 nebulizer, and it's covered in the medical benefit or Part B side -- B as a boy side of Medicare. The DPI will be a pharmacy benefit product, so covered in Part D. So the process is a little different. So while Medicare is reviewing the data, reviewing the product for coverage, patients can still access -- federal health care patients can still access DPI. The physician simply has to go through an appeal process, and they're accustomed to doing this. They have to do this often with products that aren't on Medicare formulary, and it's just an extra step they have to go through it and then it gets approved. So we won't see this -- we won't see the same issue we're seeing with PH-ILD where we have this hold up with the DPI. Those will continue to go through with doctors, like I said, doing this additional step of a dealing.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect, thank you so much Mike. \nOperator: Your next question today comes from the line of Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJessica Fye: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Curious what proportion of Tyvaso patients are currently on free drug and what are the next clinical or manufacturing milestones we should look out for in the organ transplant business? And what results in your mind would justify ungating the potential investment in the first GMP or GMP-like manufacturing facilities for those products?\nMartine Rothblatt: Great, Jess. So happy to hear you on the call. We think of you as one of the KOLs of pharmaceutical analyst. So it's always exciting to hear your voice here. I think the first part of your question is probably best answered by Mike. And then, Mike, if you bounce it back over to me, I'll then talk about the xeno aspects of Jess question.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. This question has come up, I think, a couple of times over the last year. So as a baseline, -- there's always a small percentage, I would say, kind of low to mid-single-digit percentage of patients that are in our patient assistance program at any point in time. What's the -- we need to wait for the CMS coverage decision on PH-ILD, that has continued to increase. And so I think on the last call, I had reported that it was getting up into kind of the higher single digits about to cross over into double digits. We've now crossed over into double digits. So it's in -- it's double-digit percentage of patients, but it's on the low end of double-digit percentage. \nJessica Fye: Perfect. \nMartine Rothblatt: That's great, Mike. Jess, it's really interesting, the launch of these new xeno products. And we have in our call, in fact, Dr. Peterson. She is our Senior Vice President for Product Development, and she will be leading the effort now to take those products through their clinical development process.  We also have on the call, Pat Poisson, who is our Executive VP for Technical Operations; and then people underneath him, who right now are responsible for our manufacturing on biologic called -- our biologic products such as Unituxin. They will be responsible for manufacturing this new type of biologic, the xenografts, be they the UHearts, the UKidneys or the UThymoKidneys. So all of that is very much moving into the clinical development phase. And it's super exciting doing the things like identifying the clinical trial centers, identifying the clinical investigators, putting together the necessary protocol having the meetings with the FDA to get buy into the protocol, the clinical development, our biostatisticians are already computing the necessary clinical trial parameters.  So everybody is kind of rolling their oars in the same direction toward those clinical development and gating milestones for those products. So I think you're going to see all of that in the near term. And in between, you may hear of certain kind of expanded access opportunities that arise, such as with the case of Mr. Bennett where there's a possibility for a leading surgeon at a leading hospital to uniquely save somebody's life through the unique advantages of these Xenografts. So I think you'll see some of that as well. In the case of Mr. Bennett, there were no other alternatives, and here he is almost two months out, no sign of rejection. I just could not be more proud of all of the efforts of our group at Revivicor how they were able to carefully splice in all of these different 10 genes to make that heart -- in the words of Dr. Griffith, the transplant surgeon, he keeps telling me, Martine, this heart is a rock star. And this is the guy who's like did the second Jarvik heart. I mean, he really knows his stuff. And in the words of, for example, Dr. Montgomery at NYU. He is just so impressed with the -- it's hard to get a little bit graphic here, but like the urine produced by the xeno kidney, super, super impressed with it. Dr. Locke, the Head of transplant down at UAB, she's placed her xeno kidneys into Mr. Parson was one of the seeking donors, orthotopic positions for the kidneys. She's done another similar type of xeno kidney transplant, and in both cases, is just super, super pleased with the outcome. So this xenotransplantation train has definitely, definitely, definitely just left the station. And I think you're going to see some really exciting ungating of the clinical development and production spending, capital expansion opportunities right up ahead. Operator it looks like we have one more question in line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Argyrides with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nAndreas Argyrides: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Before I get into questions, just congrats on the quarter and all the life-saving progress that you've made. It's a true testament to your dedication to it. So we appreciate that, too. So just continuing on the xenotransplantation, could you maybe give us a little bit more color around how you think? Or what the next kind of major milestone would be in these programs? Is it 6 months out? And then looking at DPI approval, how are you looking at that launch contributing to -- or the potential launch contributing to growth of patients on Tyvaso this year and next year as well. Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, Andreas, for the questions. And thank you for the recognition of us doing our best with our public benefit purpose. Mike, if I could call on you again to answer first the DPI-related question, and then I'll follow up with the xeno-related question?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. On the DPI launch, as I said in my opening remarks, we'll hear back from the FDA in May, assuming that's an approval and we're ready to go, ready to launch. We have everything in place and ready to go. We'll have inventory, plenty of inventory. We actually had our launch meeting with our sales team this week.  So they're prepped and ready to go, and so we'll be able to really press play on our launch once we hear back from the FDA. And we do think that there's opportunities in both PH-ILD, as I mentioned, to accelerate growth there as well as PAH. So there's really, I think, a lot of excitement and enthusiasm around the Tyvaso DPI.  And I think it really is going to create an opportunity for us to expand the number of patients that we're able to help with prostacyclin therapy and PAH as well as PH-ILD, as I said. So we look at that as being a significant contributor to our March to 25,000 patients by the end of 2025. As Martine said, it should be a blockbuster drug, that's certainly how we view it, and how we're planning to approach it from a launch perspective.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike. Andreas, with regard to the next thing that you might hear about, it's I think that there is a pretty good likelihood that there will be some sort of an announcement, and again, knock on wood and cross my fingers, Mr. David Bennett Sr. continues to do well at the 90-day and the 6-months mark. And the reason I call those out is when the FDA looks at clinical transplantation milestones, they put a lot of emphasis on sort of like two weeks, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and maybe one year. And we know this because one of our Phase III trials, for example, which relates to the over 200 lives we've saved with our Lung Bioengineering technology relates to getting clinical FDA approval for our second Lung Bioengineering technology, which is in its wrapping up its last couple of patients of its Phase III trial. And with this type of technology, which is kind of techno speak, it's called ex-vivo lung perfusion technology. The FDA wants to see that the patients who are on our Lung Bioengineering technology do as well at two weeks, four weeks, three months, six months, et cetera, as the patients who don't have the advantage of a Lung Bioengineering technology. So that same kind of milestone metrics, I think, are going to apply in the xeno context. And our goal would be to show that our xenograft patients, of course, separately for kidneys and hearts, do as well at two weeks, four weeks, three months, six months and the year as would patients who are otherwise similarly matched but have allografts. Now depending on the organ, the slope is pretty severe, even with something that has been done for decades, like allo heart transplants, you're looking at 80% to 90% survival at one year, which depending on -- if you are looking at the glass half full or half empty, it's like amazing, these lives were saved. But oh my god, can't we do better and not lose 10% to 20% of the people. And for things like lungs, for example, unfortunately, the curve is worse; for kidneys, it's better. Another advantage with kidneys is you can always back up to have the patient on dialysis. So that's an advantage, a huge advantage for xeno is that there's pretty much consensus agreement around the experts in the fields that people who are -- who have rejected a previous kidney transplant and have a lot of reactive antibodies in their blood that those do not cross-react with xeno antigens.  So a person who has already had a kidney transplant would have a much, much tougher climb to try to get another kidney transplant but would not likely have the same aggressive reaction to another allotransplant as -- I mean, to another xenotransplant as they would have had a very aggressive reaction to another allotransplant. So that's kind of a favorable patient category. There's also about 80% of the people who are on dialysis in the U.S. who do not even qualify to be on the kidney transplant list. So that's another huge patient population. Then there are patients who have been on dialysis for so long that they have actually pretty much run out of access ports in their body for dialysis, and that becomes increasingly problematic for those patients.  So there are just many, many different opportunities to insert xenotransplantation into the transplant paradigm. And we are going to do it, and we're going to follow the same clinical milestones that you've seen. The FDA previously required such as two weeks, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, et cetera, as for allotransplantation. While I see that we're at the half-hour market -- half-hour mark here. So thank you, Andreas, very much for your questions. Thanks, everybody. Operator -- or thank you, Dewey. And do you want me to turn it back to you or to the operator?\nDewey Steadman : Turn it to the operator.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Operator, it's all yours.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation Earnings Webcast.

            "name": "Michael Benkowitz",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Martine, and good morning, everybody. As Martine said, we're very pleased to have posted double-digit revenue and patient growth for the full year of 2021, ending the year with more than 10,000 patients on one of our treprostinil therapies. This quarter, I'd like to dive into the underlying performance of our three treprostinil products, Tyvaso, Remodulin and Orenitram. As usual, I'm going to focus more on our patient metrics, and I'll remind everyone that our quarterly treprostinil revenue does not always track exactly with quarterly underlying patient demand due to our specialty pharmacy partner ordering patterns. So I'll begin with Tyvaso. As you may recall, in early 2021, we established a goal to double the number of patients on Tyvaso from approximately 3,000 when the PH-ILD indication was added to the label to 6,000 by the end of 2022. This assumes no COVID-related impacts to physician access and patient initiation of therapy and importantly recognizes that our path to doubling may not be linear. The fourth quarter was our third quarter of the PH-ILD launch. And in this quarter, we had the highest number of Tyvaso referrals, which is what we call prescriptions since launch, and we added close to 300 patients to our Tyvaso active patient census. Our new patient starts were less than Q3, which is common in the fourth quarter as many patients opt to wait until after the holidays to begin advanced therapies. Our specialty pharmacy partners are working to clear this backlog and get these patients started on therapy during the current quarter. We continue to anticipate a CMS coverage decision regarding Medicare reimbursement for Tyvaso and PH-ILD any time between now and May of this year. All the necessary steps have been completed, including the close of a public comment period last year. We can't predict the timing of this coverage decision, but in the meantime, federal health care patients still have the opportunity to apply to our patient assistance program to access Tyvaso therapy prior to the coverage decision if they are eligible.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you, Dewey, for that great introduction. We are very excited about this 2021 annual results call. It's -- 2021, I think, beyond the doubt, has been the most exciting year in our company's history. There are a couple of big picture observations here that I'd like to start with, and then I'll go into some more details. From the big picture standpoint, first of all, we grew both patient count and revenues by double-digit percentages in 2021, as we had forecast we would do at the start of the year. Generics have not impacted our treprostinil growth trajectory because patients, physicians, payers, they all recognize our outstanding commitment and track record for customer service and supply chain reliability. Our continued double-digit percentage patient growth is how we get to our announced goal of 25,000 patients by 2025, and we remain right on target to make that goal. In fact, we expect double-digit patient growth again this year in 2022. The second grow big picture item is that our organ manufacturing products made a dramatic and highly successful debut with one 10 gene UHeart, two, 10 gene UKidneys and 2 UThymoKidneys transplanted. Of course, the focus of everybody is on our living UHeart recipient, Mr. David Bennett Sr. So I'm very pleased to report that he is doing well at almost two-months post-transplant. Specifically, his cardiovascular function at 7 weeks is excellent, and there's no sign of rejection even after a 30-day postoperative biopsy.  Although he has a lot of non-heart serious health challenges, he said last night, \"Thank you for this chance to live. And my response to Mr. Bennett was, thank you, Mr. Bennett for giving us this chance to let countless thousands of others also live. I believe our clear cut successes in 2021 with xeno products coupled with our core competencies in this area, our GalSafe meat, for example, was approved by the FDA in December 2020, and our core competencies in GMP manufacturing and product development, all show that our organ manufacturing pipeline is now more credible than ever and of truly momentous potential. Now beyond these big picture headlines, there has been a great deal of progress in advancing our pharmaceutical pipeline as well. Some highlights are: first, our once-daily treatment for PAH, ralinepag, is progressing nicely toward wrapping up its Phase III enrollment. Second, our Phase III PERFECT trial, which is testing a first-ever treatment for COPD-related pulmonary hypertension is steadily racking up more patient randomizations month-by-month toward completion of its Phase III trial.  Our revolutionary disease-modifying effort of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, which we call the TETON trial is doing so well in its U.S. Phase III enrollment that we opened up a TETON 2 Phase III trial outside the U.S. so that we could hopefully offer this product worldwide. Our super convenient Tyvaso DPI product remains well positioned for its summer 2022 launch. The FDA did just delay its approval decision from this month to May, but that 3-month detour is not important compared to the product's blockbuster revenue potential and patent life well into the 2030s. Three-months delay to start on a billion-dollar revenue trajectory is no big deal. Mike will now brief you on our commercial progress. But in summary, for 2021, I can say we hit our patient growth and revenue growth targets. We validated three new xeno-organ product candidates. And in so doing, we've launched a whole new category of biotechnology. We have 7 Phase III trials underway with multiple new product candidates. And most important of all, in this past year, I'd like to say we saved the life of Mr. Bennett with a 10 gene xenoheart. We saved the life -- the live, sorry, we saved the lives of at least 100 children stricken with neuroblastoma, thanks to our Unituxin medicine. We have now saved over 200 lives of lung transplant patients by increasing the usable donor lung supply with our lung bioengineering technology. And we have saved or improved the lives of thousands of pulmonary hypertension patients in the past year with our Remodulin, Remunity, Tyvaso and Orenitram products. From the headline saving of one life to the kind of like prayers granted saving of 100 children's lives to the now almost routine saving and improving of thousands of lives, I can most confidently report that UT's first year as a public benefit company has been super true to our public benefit purpose. Mike, can you lead us off now with commercial operations? Thanks so much, Mike. Super exciting about the Remunity breakout next week. Awesome. So operator, I understand that you probably have some people in queue and feel free to bring them on. Yes. Thanks Joe. We've really had some absolutely great experience with the Tyvaso DPI to date, and we have not experienced those bronchospasm side effects that you referred to. So we really don't believe that that's going to be an issue at all. The -- there is some more information in the press release if you look down towards the second-or-so page of the press release. Be a little bit more information there about the submission and what was admitted and not submitted. So I think it's all really quite routine and the FDA doing their job as best that they can. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks and as Mike emphasized in his remarks, three-months is really meaningless in the context of this product's life. This product has a very long patent life. It is an amazing product. I mean it's so convenient and easy for the patients to use. We have the great results of the BREEZE trial.  It's going to end up being used, I'm confident, by thousands and thousands. And over the course of its life, like, 10,000 more or more patients. It's just an amazing product. So it will get out there. Everybody just has to make sure that, like all the boxes are checked and the Is are dotted and the Ts are crossed. And as Mike said, we feel confident with the launch by the time frames that we've previously guided everyone to. Thanks for the question and operator you can bring up the next one. Thank you, Eun. So nice to hear your voice this morning. I think we have a lot of experts on our call, but I think Mike Benkowitz would be the best person to respond to your question. Mike, if that's okay?

They will be responsible for manufacturing this new type of biologic, the xenografts, be they the UHearts, the UKidneys or the UThymoKidneys. So all of that is very much moving into the clinical development phase. And it's super exciting doing the things like identifying the clinical trial centers, identifying the clinical investigators, putting together the necessary protocol having the meetings with the FDA to get buy into the protocol, the clinical development, our biostatisticians are already computing the necessary clinical trial parameters.  So everybody is kind of rolling their oars in the same direction toward those clinical development and gating milestones for those products. So I think you're going to see all of that in the near term. And in between, you may hear of certain kind of expanded access opportunities that arise, such as with the case of Mr. Bennett where there's a possibility for a leading surgeon at a leading hospital to uniquely save somebody's life through the unique advantages of these Xenografts. So I think you'll see some of that as well. In the case of Mr. Bennett, there were no other alternatives, and here he is almost two months out, no sign of rejection. I just could not be more proud of all of the efforts of our group at Revivicor how they were able to carefully splice in all of these different 10 genes to make that heart -- in the words of Dr. Griffith, the transplant surgeon, he keeps telling me, Martine, this heart is a rock star. And this is the guy who's like did the second Jarvik heart. I mean, he really knows his stuff. And in the words of, for example, Dr. Montgomery at NYU. He is just so impressed with the -- it's hard to get a little bit graphic here, but like the urine produced by the xeno kidney, super, super impressed with it. Dr. Locke, the Head of transplant down at UAB, she's placed her xeno kidneys into Mr. Parson was one of the seeking donors, orthotopic positions for the kidneys. She's done another similar type of xeno kidney transplant, and in both cases, is just super, super pleased with the outcome. So this xenotransplantation train has definitely, definitely, definitely just left the station. And I think you're going to see some really exciting ungating of the clinical development and production spending, capital expansion opportunities right up ahead. Operator it looks like we have one more question in line. Thank you so much, Andreas, for the questions. And thank you for the recognition of us doing our best with our public benefit purpose. Mike, if I could call on you again to answer first the DPI-related question, and then I'll follow up with the xeno-related question? Thanks so much, Mike. Andreas, with regard to the next thing that you might hear about, it's I think that there is a pretty good likelihood that there will be some sort of an announcement, and again, knock on wood and cross my fingers, Mr. David Bennett Sr. continues to do well at the 90-day and the 6-months mark. And the reason I call those out is when the FDA looks at clinical transplantation milestones, they put a lot of emphasis on sort of like two weeks, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and maybe one year. And we know this because one of our Phase III trials, for example, which relates to the over 200 lives we've saved with our Lung Bioengineering technology relates to getting clinical FDA approval for our second Lung Bioengineering technology, which is in its wrapping up its last couple of patients of its Phase III trial. And with this type of technology, which is kind of techno speak, it's called ex-vivo lung perfusion technology. The FDA wants to see that the patients who are on our Lung Bioengineering technology do as well at two weeks, four weeks, three months, six months, et cetera, as the patients who don't have the advantage of a Lung Bioengineering technology. So that same kind of milestone metrics, I think, are going to apply in the xeno context. And our goal would be to show that our xenograft patients, of course, separately for kidneys and hearts, do as well at two weeks, four weeks, three months, six months and the year as would patients who are otherwise similarly matched but have allografts. Now depending on the organ, the slope is pretty severe, even with something that has been done for decades, like allo heart transplants, you're looking at 80% to 90% survival at one year, which depending on -- if you are looking at the glass half full or half empty, it's like amazing, these lives were saved. But oh my god, can't we do better and not lose 10% to 20% of the people. And for things like lungs, for example, unfortunately, the curve is worse; for kidneys, it's better. Another advantage with kidneys is you can always back up to have the patient on dialysis. So that's an advantage, a huge advantage for xeno is that there's pretty much consensus agreement around the experts in the fields that people who are -- who have rejected a previous kidney transplant and have a lot of reactive antibodies in their blood that those do not cross-react with xeno antigens.  So a person who has already had a kidney transplant would have a much, much tougher climb to try to get another kidney transplant but would not likely have the same aggressive reaction to another allotransplant as -- I mean, to another xenotransplant as they would have had a very aggressive reaction to another allotransplant. So that's kind of a favorable patient category. There's also about 80% of the people who are on dialysis in the U.S. who do not even qualify to be on the kidney transplant list. So that's another huge patient population. Then there are patients who have been on dialysis for so long that they have actually pretty much run out of access ports in their body for dialysis, and that becomes increasingly problematic for those patients.  So there are just many, many different opportunities to insert xenotransplantation into the transplant paradigm. And we are going to do it, and we're going to follow the same clinical milestones that you've seen. The FDA previously required such as two weeks, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, et cetera, as for allotransplantation. While I see that we're at the half-hour market -- half-hour mark here. So thank you, Andreas, very much for your questions. Thanks, everybody. Operator -- or thank you, Dewey. And do you want me to turn it back to you or to the operator? Okay. Operator, it's all yours."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of the third quarter 2021 financial results and business activities of United Therapeutics. Dr. Rothblatt?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you very much, Dewey. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2021 financial results call. We've had an absolutely fantastic quarter and I really have only great news to share with you this morning. For example, we have experienced double-digit growth in revenues, double-digit growth in non-GAAP earnings. Within our revenues, we've experienced double-digit growth in Tyvaso, double-digit growth in Orenitram, double-digit growth in Unituxin. It's just amazing all the way across the board, we've had a fantastic quarter. In fact, in no product category have sales decreased from last year. So like I said, all good news to date. In addition to these operating results, we also are making really great progress with all of our Phase III clinical trials. We have a number of Phase III clinical trials going on. We've got in the area of pulmonary hypertension, our gene therapy trial called Sapphire. We also have our ralinepag two trials, all those in pulmonary hypertension. In pulmonary fibrosis, we have two Phase III trials. We call them TETON 1 and TETON 2. And in COPD, at least a type of COPD associated with pulmonary hypertension. We have another Phase III clinical trial going on called Perfect. We also are just now wrapping up a Phase III trial in our organ transplantation area dealing with ex-vivo lung perfusion. So really, just huge amount of pipeline activity going on. In addition to all of that, we have some very exciting earlier-stage activity, where we are developing next-generation forms of our parenteral, inhaled and oral products. So all the way across the board. The one which we expect to launch the soonest will be the next-generation product for our inhaled product, that's our dry powder inhaler. We just recently launched our next-generation product for Remodulin which is Remunity and in our pipeline, we have even next-generation improvements on that product. And we are working on our next-generation better-dosing product for our Orenitram PO. And then following that, as noted earlier, we expect ralinepag to make a huge difference in the oral treatment of pulmonary hypertension. So it's kind of like a best case situation here at United Therapeutics. We love what we're doing. We love that we're doing it all so well. And on that note, let me turn the podium over to our President and Chief Operating Officer; Mike Benkowitz, who is responsible for so much of this great news.\nMichael Benkowitz: Thanks, Martine and good morning, everyone. As Martine said, we're very pleased to have posted a strong third quarter highlighted by year-over-year double-digit growth for total revenue, treprostinil revenue and three of our products, Tyvaso, Orenitram and Unituxin. At the same time, we continue to progress toward our 25x25 goal which is to reach 25,000 patients with our therapies by the end of 2025. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 9,000 patients on our treprostinil products in the U.S. which when coupled with the approximately 1,000 patients on our treprostinil products outside the U.S., puts us at about 10,000 patients toward our 25,000-patient goal. This quarter, I'd like to dive into the underlying performance of our three treprostinil products, Tyvaso, Remodulin and Orenitram. So I'll begin with Tyvaso. Earlier this year, in anticipation of the PH-ILD approval that we ultimately received last April, we established a goal to double the number of patients on Tyvaso from 3,000 to 6,000 by the end of next year. This assumes no COVID-related impact to health care practitioner access and a patient initiation of therapy and importantly, recognizes that the path to doubling may not be linear. The third quarter was our second quarter of the PH-ILD launch and we're very pleased with the progress thus far. We continued growing the number of Tyvaso-active patients during the quarter, ending with approximately 4,000 patients on Tyvaso putting us 1/3 of the way toward our goal of doubling the number of patients on Tyvaso by the end of 2022. I also want to mention that during the third quarter, the CMS comment period regarding Medicare reimbursement for Tyvaso in PH-ILD commenced and is open through mid-November. We can't predict the timing of a coverage decision. But in the meantime, federal health care patients can apply to our patient assistance program to access Tyvaso prior to the coverage decision if they are eligible. Once we obtain CMS coverage, we will be able to transition these patients to a reimbursement model over time. To that end, we anticipate three near-term drivers for Tyvaso growth over the next few quarters. The first driver is the approval of Medicare reimbursement of Tyvaso and PH-ILD. Even though federal health care patients may be eligible for patient assistance, we are hearing through the channel that many physicians are waiting for CMS coverage before prescribing Tyvaso on their PH-ILD patients. The second driver and somewhat related to the first is that we expect to see growth in prescriptions from ILD treaters. To date, the vast majority of prescriptions have been from our historical PAH writers. And then the final growth driver is the approval of Tyvaso DPI which we expect no later than the summer of 2022. Moving on to Remodulin, last quarter, we learned that a generic form of subcutaneous treprostinil became available. This launch so far has played out almost exactly like the IV generic launch we saw in 2019. There has been an initial bolus of subcu Remodulin patients, similar in quantity to what we saw with IV and which are primarily these dual eligible Medicare and Medicaid patients that have been forced switch to generic treprostinil. Since the generic subcu launch, generic transitions have tapered off to a negligible amount as we enter Q4 and in fact, our new patient starts remain at or above our long-term trend levels and we are now adding back patients to our active patient census. Finally, I'll provide some color around Orenitram. We've mentioned in previous calls and investor conferences that while we saw an uptick on Orenitram following the FREEDOM-EV label expansion, the launch trajectory was blunted by COVID. In the second quarter of this year and continuing into the third quarter, we were able to have consistently more robust interactions with prescribers about the FREEDOM-EV data. And we're receiving positive feedback from these physicians about the Orenitram value proposition, especially regarding its efficacy. And this has translated into strong new patient start momentum over the last two quarters and the highest number of patients on Orenitram as of the end of the third quarter. So in conclusion, we're pleased with the progress we're making in the ongoing Tyvaso launch in PH-ILD and that we're on track to achieve 6,000 patients on Tyvaso by the end of next year, the continued momentum around Orenitram and appreciation of its value proposition and returning to Remodulin patient growth. And so with that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Martine.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Mike. Amazing details and amazing progress and kudos to you and the entire sales and marketing team. Operator, we can now take the callers.\nOperator:  We'll go first to Joseph Thome at Cowen and Company.\nJoseph Thome: Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the progress. Just on the continued growth for Tyvaso, one of the points mentioned was increasing the number of physicians that are predominantly ILD writers. Can you just dive a little bit more into how this will happen? Are you experiencing any consideration for this physician population thus far that you're working through?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks for the question, Joe. And Mike, would you be able to answer that question?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Thanks, Joe. Yes, no concerns thus far. I think it's just taking some time to bring these treaters online. So keep in mind that the diagnosis process for these physicians is very different than I think what they're used to. They have to screen the patients. They have to do echocardiograms, those things I think they're accustomed to doing. The right heart cath is new to them. I wouldn't say it's a barrier, I just think it tends to slow things down. So a couple of things are happening there. In some cases, referring these patients to PAH clinics even though they have said over the long term, they intend to treat these patients. They are in some - in a lot of cases, these patients are - reside with physicians and community practices and so they don't have a right heart cath readily accessible. So they're having to figure out where to send these patients to get a right heart cath. I think the third thing to keep in mind is a lot of these physicians are the same physicians that are also on the front line of treating COVID patients. And then finally, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I do think that there is a little bit of waiting for CMS coverage before really kind of diving in and digging in and starting to write for Tyvaso. So we are adding new prescribers. It's not like we're not adding. They're starting to come on online. I think we probably would have expected that it would have been a little bit faster than what we're seeing but they are coming in and I think that will continue to come as we move into next year.\nMartine Rothblatt: Fantastic, Mike. Thanks so much for that answer. And operator, you can now call up the next questioner.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jessica Fye with JPMorgan.\nJessica Fye: Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about how many of the now, I guess, 1,000 PH-ILD patients you've added since the launch. How many of those are on Medicare and basically getting free drug until that coverage is finalized?\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. It's good to hear you this morning, Jessica. Mike, I think that question would also be in your bailiwick.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. So, thanks, Jess. So even prior to PH-ILD, I mean we've always had a patient assistance program that has, let's say, some small percentage of patients in it so receiving free drug. I think with the PH-ILD launch and not having the CMS covered, we have seen that tick up I would say in the grand scheme of things, it's still a relatively small percentage. So you've gone from like a small percentage that's effectively doubled but it's still - you're talking about low single digit - or sorry, low double-digit percentages of patients that are in the patient assistance program right now. As I said, I think - and we continue to kind of really hear this anecdotally in talking with physicians, I think there is this sort of warehousing effect that's going on, particularly, like I said, with the ILD treaters where I think they're waiting for the CMS coverage to go through the process of writing the referral because even if you're going through the patient assistance program, there is still a process that you have to go through to see if the patient is eligible and apply and our sense is that a lot of these physicians don't want to have to go through that process twice and like I said, are waiting until we get the CMS coverage.\nMartine Rothblatt: Super, Mike, thanks so much for that answer and Jess, for your question. Operator, who would be the next analyst on the call?\nOperator: Next, we have Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer.\nHartaj Singh: Thank you for the question today and the really nice update. Just a question on - this is the first time I've heard you provide actual number of patients ex-U.S. Martine, Mike, the 1,000, you also are now starting a Phase III study with TETON ex-U.S. So have there been any thoughts on kind of the use of business model ex-U.S. and how interesting that market is to you?\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. Thanks a lot for the question, Hartaj and good hearing your voice this morning. I think we are more interested in the ex-U.S. opportunity for IPF and possibly as well for ILD. There seems to be a much greater unmet medical need, especially with regard to IPF, where we believe we can have a disease-modifying agent. So we definitely are opening up our bandwidth, if you will, to look at more activities ex-U.S. We also have a terrific partner in Europe, Grupo Ferrer which we've been working with and other partners in other parts of the world. So your intuition, Hartaj as always, is right on target and we are ramping up activities outside the U.S. Thanks. Operator, you can bring on the next analyst.\nOperator: We'll go to Eun Yang with Jefferies.\nEun Yang: Thank you. A quick question on Tyvaso DPI, so when you address the single deficiency that was identified in the complete response letter. Would that be the resubmission that we classified as a Class 1 or Class 2?\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. Eun, nice to hear you this morning and very, very interesting question. Fortunately, we have Dr. Peterson on the call and she is our expert in matters that kind of transcend scientific and regulatory affairs. So Dr. Peterson, could you provide some insight?\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. So basically, we do have some meetings that we will be having with FDA to address your specific question on the resubmission and the time line. But again, we're very confident that we will get approval by the summer of '22 or earlier to address, again, the single deficiency.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Leigh. Well, that seems to be the end of the Q&A questions. And once again I'd like to say that it's just super, super, exciting for me as a person who likes to sort of set goals that set everybody up for winning and then see such really strong progress towards those goals. For example, it was all plus or minus like a year ago that Mike and I set up these goals of doubling the number of Tyvaso patients by the end of '22, 25,000 treprostinil patients by the end of '25 and as you heard from the numbers we shared today, we're making amazing progress on both of those goals with the double-digit growth in revenues and obviously, on patient count as well and now 40% of the way already to the 2025 goal. So it's just - it's really, really gratifying for me as CEO to see our company delivering so strongly on the forecast that we had made. Thanks again to everybody joining us this morning. I believe Mike will be speaking at Credit Suisse very shortly. So feel free to attend that conference and learn more. Operator, you can now wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation Earnings Webcast. A rebroadcast of this webcast will be available for replay for one week by visiting the Events & Presentations section of the United Therapeutics' Investor Relations website at ir.unither.com.",

Amazing details and amazing progress and kudos to you and the entire sales and marketing team. Operator, we can now take the callers. Thanks for the question, Joe. And Mike, would you be able to answer that question? Fantastic, Mike. Thanks so much for that answer. And operator, you can now call up the next questioner. Yes. It's good to hear you this morning, Jessica. Mike, I think that question would also be in your bailiwick. Super, Mike, thanks so much for that answer and Jess, for your question. Operator, who would be the next analyst on the call? Yes. Thanks a lot for the question, Hartaj and good hearing your voice this morning. I think we are more interested in the ex-U.S. opportunity for IPF and possibly as well for ILD. There seems to be a much greater unmet medical need, especially with regard to IPF, where we believe we can have a disease-modifying agent. So we definitely are opening up our bandwidth, if you will, to look at more activities ex-U.S. We also have a terrific partner in Europe, Grupo Ferrer which we've been working with and other partners in other parts of the world. So your intuition, Hartaj as always, is right on target and we are ramping up activities outside the U.S. Thanks. Operator, you can bring on the next analyst. Yes. Eun, nice to hear you this morning and very, very interesting question. Fortunately, we have Dr. Peterson on the call and she is our expert in matters that kind of transcend scientific and regulatory affairs. So Dr. Peterson, could you provide some insight? Thanks so much, Leigh. Well, that seems to be the end of the Q&A questions. And once again I'd like to say that it's just super, super, exciting for me as a person who likes to sort of set goals that set everybody up for winning and then see such really strong progress towards those goals. For example, it was all plus or minus like a year ago that Mike and I set up these goals of doubling the number of Tyvaso patients by the end of '22, 25,000 treprostinil patients by the end of '25 and as you heard from the numbers we shared today, we're making amazing progress on both of those goals with the double-digit growth in revenues and obviously, on patient count as well and now 40% of the way already to the 2025 goal. So it's just - it's really, really gratifying for me as CEO to see our company delivering so strongly on the forecast that we had made. Thanks again to everybody joining us this morning. I believe Mike will be speaking at Credit Suisse very shortly. So feel free to attend that conference and learn more. Operator, you can now wrap up the call."

Now, I will turn the webcast over to Dr. Rothblatt for a review of our second quarter 2021 financial results and business activities of United Therapeutics. Martine?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Dewey. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our quarterly earnings call. We have a lot of good news to share today. So, it’s going to be a very fun call. You have read in the press release the outstanding financial results. And in a moment, I am going to turn the mic over to Mike Benkowitz, who will speak a little bit more about the commercial success that we are experiencing. I would like to talk a little bit about our pipeline, which is quite robust and doing very well. We have a number of studies in Phase 3. I’d like to highlight a few of them. Two of our studies are outside of Group 1 PAH, the PERFECT study in COPD, specifically a form of COPD that’s associated with pulmonary hypertension and another Phase 3 study in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, also known as IPF. That study is called the TETON study within United Therapeutics. In addition to those Phase 3 studies, we have additional Phase 3 studies within Group 1 pulmonary hypertension. Two of those Phase 3 studies are using our once a day drug called ralinepag and both of those studies are going quite nicely. In addition, we have a lot of next-generation treprostinil development activity that will be in – some of its in Phase 1 and then moving into bioequivalence testing over the next year or two. So, that will provide an ongoing pipeline of next-generation treprostinil products for Group 1 and possibly also Group 3 pulmonary hypertension. Looking a little bit at the longer term, we are working on cures for pulmonary hypertension, either through gene therapy. And we do have a gene therapy trial also in Phase 3 or actually manufactured lungs, lungs that are manufactured in our laboratories and then transplanted into patients to completely cure either their pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, or many other end-stage lung diseases. In the meantime, on the clinical side, there is increasing evidence that current medicines dosed appropriately may in fact convert pulmonary hypertension into a lifelong manageable condition. And a lot of these data are coming from Europe and Japan. I think you are going to soon see more reports from the United States, but it’s really startling to see reports with patients, more than 90% of the patients in the cohort living 20 years, over 10 years with the current medications, but dosed differently than kind of the traditional dosing, dosing – dosed according to a very specific protocol. So, that’s tremendously exciting for us in the pulmonary hypertension field, to be able to convert pulmonary hypertension into a lifelong manageable condition. And indeed, the goal of our next-generation treprostinil products is to make these kind of lifelong, manageable protocols as easy as possible for the patients because they will be on them for literally decades. Well, with that introduction to our pipeline and clinical development activities, I’d like to pass the microphone over to Mike Benkowitz to talk about the commercial operations. Mike?\nMichael Benkowitz: Thanks, Martine and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was a very exciting quarter for United Therapeutics on the commercial front as we began our push into new rare lung disease indications outside of pulmonary arterial hypertension. I am pleased to report that we achieved several milestones in the second quarter at a treprostinil franchise level. First, we ended the second quarter with a record number of U.S. patients on our treprostinil therapies marking the fourth consecutive quarter of total treprostinil patient growth. Second, we achieved an all-time high in two of our key underlying U.S. demand metrics, total treprostinil prescriptions and total treprostinil actual patient starts. Finally, while we always caution that revenues don’t necessarily reflect underlying demand for our products due to the ordering patterns of our specialty pharmacy and distribution partners, we are excited to have achieved record treprostinil revenue in the quarter. Now, I’d like to spend a few minutes talking about individual product performance. Of course, we are very excited to have launched Tyvaso into pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease at the beginning of the second quarter. Earlier this year, we established a goal to double the number of patients on Tyvaso by the end of next year, assuming no COVID-related impact to HCP access and patient initiation of therapy, and importantly, recognizing that the path to doubling may not be linear. In the first quarter of the launch, we have established strong momentum and as of the end of Q2, we are already more than one-sixth of the way to our goal of doubling the number of patients on Tyvaso through the PH-ILD label expansion. We are also very encouraged by the prescription and start patterns in Q2, which are double or more than double the quarterly referral and start levels in 2020. On the reimbursement front, we continue to work with CMS to update their policy to cover Tyvaso for the treatment of PH-ILD. We remain confident that this update will happen, but cannot predict its timing due to the government’s processes and procedures. In the meantime, Medicare Medicaid patients can apply and have been applying to our patient assistance program. If they meet our patient assistance program eligibility criteria, they can initiate Tyvaso therapy immediately. Once CMS updates their coverage policy, Medicare Medicaid patients will be able to start on commercial drug. Moving on to Remodulin, we were very pleased to see in Q2 the highest number of prescriptions and starts for Remodulin in the past 12 years. We believe there are several factors contributing to this. First, as we mentioned last year, Remodulin therapy initiation was most impacted by the pandemic for a period of time as many patients were unable to come into the hospital to start on Remodulin. We believe this created a so-called warehousing of patients that started to open up in Q3 of last year and continued into Q2. In addition, there is renewed appreciation of the clinical benefits of Remodulin for PAH patients, for example, the ability to move patients to a low-risk status and then potentially transition to oral prostacyclin, such as Orenitram and as Martine mentioned, recently published retrospective data showing that use of Remodulin can reduce mPAP or mean pulmonary arterial pressure and if mPAP is reduced below 40 millimeters of mercury, there can be a dramatic improvement in long-term survival. The competitive landscape did change in the second quarter for Remodulin as the generic form of subcutaneous treprostinil became available. At this point, the subcu generic launch looks very similar to the IV generic launch we saw in 2019. There has been an initial bolus of subcu Remodulin patients, similar in quantity to what we saw with IV and primarily these dual-eligible Medicare Medicaid patients that have been switched to generic treprostinil. However, the base of patients we have now is higher than when IV generic launched, we still see that PAH docs prefer branded Remodulin over the generic alternative when they are filling out their prescriptions and we have yet to see widespread payer management of these patients. It’s also important to note some of the potential limitations around generic subcu availability. It’s our understanding that this product is only being offered by one of the specialty pharmacies that distribute PAH medicines. It’s also our understanding that the subcu pumps that are currently being used with generic treprostinil are limited in supply. Meanwhile, we have invested in the supply of pumps and disposables, including the new Remunity pump and believe that we are well positioned to serve Remodulin patients for the long-term. Orenitram also had a strong quarter, posting new prescriptions with starts in the second quarter that were one of the highest since the product’s launch and total patients on therapy that were the highest ever. As mentioned in previous calls and investor conferences that while we saw an uptick on Orenitram following the FREEDOM-EV label expansion, the launch trajectory was blunted by COVID. In the second quarter of this year, we were able to have consistently more robust interactions with prescribers about FREEDOM-EV and the total Orenitram value proposition. And we believe that translated into the underlying demand performance we are seeing. If we can maintain this momentum going forward, we expect this to show up on the revenue line in subsequent quarters as patients titrate to an efficacious dose and ordering by specialty pharmacies, which often lags underlying demand catches up. With respect to Unituxin, we are extremely pleased to see second quarter demand continue at a similar pace to the first quarter. We have limited visibility into how the drug is being used, but we know use has increased in the U.S. Moreover, Unituxin was approved in Japan in the second quarter with an indication that’s actually broader than the U.S. label. Consequently, our Japanese distribution partner, Ohara ordered a larger than expected amount of Unituxin in the quarter. Finally, we are excited about our pending applications at FDA for Tyvaso DPI. We’re pleased that the PAI and general facility inspection at our partner, MannKind’s Danbury, Connecticut facility has commenced as scheduled and is ongoing. Our PDUFA action date is in October of this year, and we’re working hard to build launch quantities and mobilizing our commercial teams to support a launch soon after approval. So there is a lot of positive things happening on the commercial front. We remain focused on executing against our plans through the second half of the year and importantly, making progress toward our near-term goal of doubling the number of patients on Tyvaso by the end of 2022. With that, Martine, I’ll turn the call back over to you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike. Great review. So operator, we can now open up the lines for any questions. And whatever questions come in, I’ll direct them either to James, our CFO, to Mike, our President or any questions of a scientific medical technical nature to Dr. Peterson. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you.  And your first question is from the line of Jessica Fye with JPMorgan.\nJessica Fye: Hey, nice quarter this morning. You guys said you’re well on your way to the goal of doubling the number of patients on Tyvaso, but also said the path may not be linear. So can you share the latest thinking on the shape of the curve to get to that year-end ‘22 goal? And related to that, you also mentioned that ordering patterns can factor into revenue, not perfectly aligning with patient demand. So how should we think about that dynamic going forward in the back half of the year? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Jess. Nice to hear your voice this morning. Both of those questions seem to be squarely in Mike’s daily work.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. I think on the first part of the question around the shape of the curve, I think we’re still trying to get better visibility into what that looks like. And I think the question that we’re still trying to get some insight into is the patients that are residing with the PH-ILD treaters and how quickly those patients are getting referred – either getting referred over to PAH clinic or these PH-ILD treaters are starting to activate and treat patients on their own and so that – we’re still getting insights on that. We don’t have perfect clarity. I think I’m hoping to get through Q3 into Q4, we will get a better sense of that. So that’s still why I’m still thinking that it’s maybe not going to necessarily be a linear and maybe potentially more hockey stick as we get into 2022, but I think we will have a little bit better visibility on that as we get into – later into the second half of the year. On the ordering patterns, I mean it’s – this is always an issue we’ve always had. The specialty pharmacies have days on inventory requirements for our contracts that they have to keep on hand. They have an algorithm they look at that takes into account historical shipment data as well as prospective estimated demand. And with that, we’ve got and agree upon level of wording that has to happen. And so beyond that, it’s really just sort of kind of normal course of business. And so as we start to kind of see referrals start on the Tyvaso side of things pick up, I would expect the orders to pick up as we go on.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect. Thanks so much, Mike. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer & Company.\nMartine Rothblatt: Hi, good morning.\nHartaj Singh: Hey, good morning, Martine. Good to hear your voice. Thank you for the question and nice quarter. The question I had was on COPD and IPF, Martine, you pointed those out at the beginning in terms of the prepared script. Could you just talk a little bit about the scientific rationale behind Tyvaso inhaler for COPD and IPF? And then specifically, when do you expect the readouts for both the patient enrollment to complete and readouts to happen for COPD and IPF? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. Great question, Hartaj, I’ll speak for a moment or two about the Group 3 COPD pulmonary hypertension and let – while I’m doing that, Dr. Peterson, if you could queue up your thoughts on the scientific rationale in IPF, which is unique in the sense that it has nothing to do with pulmonary hypertension at all. And Dr. Peterson has studied that scientific rationale quite a bit. So with regard to the COPD, we’re not treating the COPD per se, but we’re treating only the pulmonary hypertension that those patients have who also have COPD. We’re doing this based on previous work from Dr. Waxman and others that showed that when Group 3 patients with COPD were treated off label with Tyvaso, they have dramatically improved 6-minute walk test, Hartaj. And it was based on that data that we were able to size our PERFECT study. It’s about roughly 100 patients, a bit more than 100 patients and felt very confident with that sizing because of the very dramatic data that had come out earlier. So it is the mechanism of action is the same as it would be for treating any other type of pulmonary hypertension. We’ve got the ability of treprostinil to, for example, dilate the smooth muscles in the pulmonary arteries, which are causing the vasal constriction. And we also have the ability of Tyvaso inhaled to reduce the platelet aggregation in those tiny arterials, which also contribute to ultimately a afterload in the right heart and actually spells a worse morbidity and mortality picture for the COPD patients who have pulmonary hypertension than for those who don’t. There are a lot of patients Hartaj, with the COPD form of pulmonary hypertension, in fact, over 100,000 in the U.S. alone. So there is a real great opportunity for us to do good there. And I think the scientific rationale, the empirical data upon which we sized and based the PERFECT study was very solid, and we have high expectations for success. Dr. Peterson, would you like to talk about the scientific rationale in pulmonary fibrosis because that’s something really very new.\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. Yes, sure. Thanks, Martine, and thanks for the question. So really what came – one of the things that came out of the INCREASE study in addition to meeting our primary endpoints and everything that’s been published so far, including New England Journal, is that we published a paper in the Lancet recently, and it describes the surprise sort of that we saw, which was that we saw an improvement in FVC, which is forced vital capacity. And this indicated that Tyvaso might not only work on the pulmonary hypertension component of the disease, but it might actually work on the fibrotic disease in patients with PH-ILD. And that’s actually supported by – so we saw this clinically, and that’s actually supported by non-clinical evidence where there is been several studies that have shown the anti-fibrotic effect of treprostinil. So that together made a design, think about what’s going on, and think that possibly this could also work in patients with IPF without pulmonary hypertension, so again, evidenced an increase and evidence in non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo. And just to reiterate what Martine just said. So for PH-ILD and PH-COPD, obviously, as mentioned, there is a common pathogenesis for the PH component. But in fact, due to these other effects of treprostinil, treprostinil binds multiple receptors on multiple cell types and has multiple mechanisms of action. There are additional actions such as the fibrosis that can work specifically in patients with fibrotic lung disease. And there is even a bronchodilation effect that could also help the patients with obstructive lung conditions, such as COPD.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect. Thanks so much, Dr. Peterson. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joseph Thome with Cowen & Company.\nJoseph Thome: Good morning and thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on the great progress. Maybe one more just a little bit on the reimbursement environment for PH-ILD, if you can comment a little bit more on that, how many kind of patients are prescribed therapy, are they able to actually get Tyvaso right now for the most part? And obviously, we know this is essentially the first, they are formally approved in this indication. Are you seeing any sort of considerations for prior therapies that patients have seen or specific levels of disease burden?\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. Thanks for the question. It’s all of our strategic operations and managed markets activities report into Mike. So Mike, if you could provide some insight on that question?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Joe, so in terms of disease severity or prior therapies, we’re not seeing any requirements there. As I think you know this is really the first and only treatment that’s on the market to treat the pulmonary hypertension associated with the ILD, the other drugs are treating underlying lung disease. So we’re not seeing any issues there. I would say on the kind of the private payer side of things, those prescriptions that are coming in for PAH, ILD patients are going through with little to no issue. And then on the – like I said, on the CMS side, we’re waiting for the CMS approval, which that process is ongoing that accepted our application, they are just going through there, like I said, their policies and procedures, and we’re optimistic and hopeful that that’s coming shortly. So those patients, like I said, are eligible to apply for a patient assistance program. And then if they are eligible, they can come in and start and then once we have CMS approval, presumably, they could become a commercial patient.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect. Thanks so much, Mike. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Eun Yang of Jefferies.\nEun Yang: Thank you. Great quarter. Congrats. Recently, J&J received approval of intravenous UPTRAVI. So I want to ask you how do you see this might or might not impact your marketing franchise? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks for the question, Eun. Nice to hear your voice this morning and thanks for the congratulations. We, at present, really would have no idea to comment about what kind of impact intravenous UPTRAVI might have. We do feel that the intravenous route is important, although the same amount of efficacy can be achieved with the subcutaneous route. And that’s, of course, ordinarily much easier on the patient and certainly much easier on their ongoing lifestyle. So, that’s really the question to be assessed there. In terms of over the longer term, I think what Mike was referring to and I was referring to earlier is that the patients tend to have the best experience according to these recent reports from both Europe and Japan, when they are on the parenteral route for relatively short period of time, in order to aggressively reduce their pressures down below 40 millimeters of mercury and relieve the after load on the right heart. So, whatever goes on there is, I would say, not part of the biggest picture of pulmonary hypertension because the total amount of time on the parenteral therapy is relatively short compared to the total amount of time on Orenitram or another oral therapy. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight into what might be going on in the parenteral optionality space. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could comment at all about the breadth of prescribing you are seeing in the PH-ILD side, are you seeing a mix of both new prescribers or existing prescribers? And then the second part of the question is just how should we think about the treatment duration for the PH-ILD setting relative to PAH for Tyvaso? Thanks so much.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. Great question. Mike, do you like to handle that one?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. On the prescribing breadth, I mean, as it stands right now, I am not surprising and I think this got a little bit, I think looking into Jess’s question around whether the uptick is linear or not, if it’s more heavily weighted. So, the answer is, we are getting both PAH and PH-ILD. I would say, as we sit here today, it’s more constant. The weight is more towards the PAH side. But we fully expect that as the launch evolves, as we continue to engage with physicians that will start to even out and maybe even potentially shift to the PH-ILD. I think it’s really going to depend on the center where the physicians are. Do they have a PAH clinic and do those PH-ILD physicians want to actually treat versus refer. From our standpoint, we don’t really care who treats. We do want to make sure that those patients were getting caught earlier in their disease because we think that and this gets into the second part of your question, we think that the earlier they start on Tyvaso the more and the longer they can benefit. And so from a timing standpoint, in terms of duration of therapy, it’s really going to, I think be a question of where they are in their disease progression and what’s sort of the dominant part of the disease, is it the ILD, is it the pulmonary hypertension. And so if you have got really severe ILD, less on the PAH, they go on Tyvaso. I think those patients probably won’t be on as long versus patients that are – it’s really more PAH, less on the ILD, where I think we would expect to see duration of treatment along the lines of what we see in, if not longer in PAH.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect. Thanks so much, Mike. Excellent response and very comprehensive. So operator, we have got time for just one more question.\nOperator: Your final question is from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nJason Zemansky: Good morning. This is Jason on for Geoff. Thanks so much for taking our question and congratulations on the quarter. Just thinking ahead in terms of the second half of the year, I know you were projecting growth, but there were some, obviously, some one-time benefits, including Unituxin, the Japanese order and OUS Remodulin. And just wanted to get your sense of how confident you are in kind of moving forward on the trajectory for the second half of the year? Thanks so much.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay, Geoff. So basically, you are just asking what we expect to see from here towards the end of the year?\nJason Zemansky: Well, sure. I was looking at the 10-Q, that the continued revenue growth in the second half of 2021 compared to 2020, given the one-time benefits of this quarter, the confidence in growth trajectory of the second half of 2021.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. I don’t think – I wouldn’t really buy into the hypothesis about a huge amount of one-time growth benefits this quarter. I know Mike kind of referred to the warehousing of the Remodulin patients, but I wouldn’t like translate that into being a one-time benefit, because those patients have to book their appointments with the doctors and come in and there is going to be a continual upward swell coming from patients who were pushed back due to COVID. So, I don’t see this as a one-time event. I really see it more as what Mike has been talking about, and we have been talking about that we are building steadily toward our goals of doubling the number of Tyvaso patients by the end of next year and having 25,000 patients by the end of 2025. And any given quarter, there is of course, always ups and downs. But what you are seeing, I think, in this quarter is the new revenue track for United Therapeutics going forward, a revenue track, which is consistent with doubling the number of Tyvaso patients by the end of next year and a revenue track that’s consistent with having 25,000 patients by the end of 2025.\nJason Zemansky: Got it. Thanks so much for the color.\nMartine Rothblatt: Excellent. Mike, did you want to add something about Unituxin on that last question?\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes. I would just say – I would just add maybe two maybe granular points. So, the Unituxin, I wouldn’t look as necessarily being a one-time event, as Martine mentioned. The larger – when I referenced the larger order from Japan, that really was a function of the fact that we have larger than what we were forecasting because we weren’t expecting a broader label of what we got. So, now that we have the broader label, I think the orders that we expect from Japan would be on par with what we saw in this quarter over time. I would also say on the international side, we always see some lumpiness there. Part of what we saw last year with the generic entrant into Europe was Ferrer, our partner having to draw down their inventory. So, that’s been gone down. And I think we will still see lumpy orders internationally, but over the course of a year, I think that will level out.\nMartine Rothblatt: Exactly, Mike. Totally agree. Operator, you can please now wrap up, and we would like to thank everybody for participating in our second quarter earnings call. It’s been an extremely exciting quarter with all of the top level results that Mike reported on, best in numerous different categories, solidly on track for our announced goals and a very exciting pipeline to continue propelling our growth through the balance of the 2020s. Operator, you can now wrap up.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for participating in today’s United Therapeutics Corporation Earnings Webcast. A rebroadcast of the webcast will be available for replay for one week by visiting the Events and Presentations section of the United Therapeutics Investor Relations website at ir.unither.com.",

The second quarter was a very exciting quarter for United Therapeutics on the commercial front as we began our push into new rare lung disease indications outside of pulmonary arterial hypertension. I am pleased to report that we achieved several milestones in the second quarter at a treprostinil franchise level. First, we ended the second quarter with a record number of U.S. patients on our treprostinil therapies marking the fourth consecutive quarter of total treprostinil patient growth.

Finally, while we always caution that revenues don't necessarily reflect underlying demand for our products due to the ordering patterns of our specialty pharmacy and distribution partners, we are excited to have achieved record treprostinil revenue in the quarter. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about individual product performance.

There has been an initial bolus of subcu Remodulin patients, similar in quantity to what we saw with IV and primarily these dual-eligible Medicare Medicaid patients that have been switched to generic treprostinil. However, the base of patients we have now is higher than when IV generic launched, we still see that PAH docs prefer branded Remodulin over the generic alternative when they are filling out their prescriptions and we have yet to see widespread payer management of these patients. It's also important to note some of the potential limitations around generic subcu availability. It's our understanding that this product is only being offered by one of the specialty pharmacies that distribute PAH medicines. It's also our understanding that the subcu pumps that are currently being used with generic treprostinil are limited in supply. Meanwhile, we have invested in the supply of pumps and disposables, including the new Remunity pump and believe that we are well positioned to serve Remodulin patients for the long-term. Orenitram also had a strong quarter, posting new prescriptions with starts in the second quarter that were one of the highest since the product's launch and total patients on therapy that were the highest ever. As mentioned in previous calls and investor conferences that while we saw an uptick on Orenitram following the FREEDOM-EV label expansion, the launch trajectory was blunted by COVID. In the second quarter of this year, we were able to have consistently more robust interactions with prescribers about FREEDOM-EV and the total Orenitram value proposition. And we believe that translated into the underlying demand performance we are seeing. If we can maintain this momentum going forward, we expect this to show up on the revenue line in subsequent quarters as patients titrate to an efficacious dose and ordering by specialty pharmacies, which often lags underlying demand catches up. With respect to Unituxin, we are extremely pleased to see second quarter demand continue at a similar pace to the first quarter. We have limited visibility into how the drug is being used, but we know use has increased in the U.S. Moreover, Unituxin was approved in Japan in the second quarter with an indication that's actually broader than the U.S. label. Consequently, our Japanese distribution partner, Ohara ordered a larger than expected amount of Unituxin in the quarter. Finally, we are excited about our pending applications at FDA for Tyvaso DPI. We're pleased that the PAI and general facility inspection at our partner, MannKind's Danbury, Connecticut facility has commenced as scheduled and is ongoing. Our PDUFA action date is in October of this year, and we're working hard to build launch quantities and mobilizing our commercial teams to support a launch soon after approval. So there is a lot of positive things happening on the commercial front. We remain focused on executing against our plans through the second half of the year and importantly, making progress toward our near-term goal of doubling the number of patients on Tyvaso by the end of 2022. With that, Martine, I'll turn the call back over to you. Sure. I think on the first part of the question around the shape of the curve, I think we're still trying to get better visibility into what that looks like. And I think the question that we're still trying to get some insight into is the patients that are residing with the PH-ILD treaters and how quickly those patients are getting referred – either getting referred over to PAH clinic or these PH-ILD treaters are starting to activate and treat patients on their own and so that – we're still getting insights on that. We don't have perfect clarity. I think I'm hoping to get through Q3 into Q4, we will get a better sense of that. So that's still why I'm still thinking that it's maybe not going to necessarily be a linear and maybe potentially more hockey stick as we get into 2022, but I think we will have a little bit better visibility on that as we get into – later into the second half of the year. On the ordering patterns, I mean it's – this is always an issue we've always had. The specialty pharmacies have days on inventory requirements for our contracts that they have to keep on hand. They have an algorithm they look at that takes into account historical shipment data as well as prospective estimated demand. And with that, we've got and agree upon level of wording that has to happen. And so beyond that, it's really just sort of kind of normal course of business. And so as we start to kind of see referrals start on the Tyvaso side of things pick up, I would expect the orders to pick up as we go on. Sure. Joe, so in terms of disease severity or prior therapies, we're not seeing any requirements there. As I think you know this is really the first and only treatment that's on the market to treat the pulmonary hypertension associated with the ILD, the other drugs are treating underlying lung disease. So we're not seeing any issues there. I would say on the kind of the private payer side of things, those prescriptions that are coming in for PAH, ILD patients are going through with little to no issue. And then on the – like I said, on the CMS side, we're waiting for the CMS approval, which that process is ongoing that accepted our application, they are just going through there, like I said, their policies and procedures, and we're optimistic and hopeful that that's coming shortly. So those patients, like I said, are eligible to apply for a patient assistance program. And then if they are eligible, they can come in and start and then once we have CMS approval, presumably, they could become a commercial patient. Sure. On the prescribing breadth, I mean, as it stands right now, I am not surprising and I think this got a little bit, I think looking into Jess's question around whether the uptick is linear or not, if it's more heavily weighted. So, the answer is, we are getting both PAH and PH-ILD. I would say, as we sit here today, it's more constant. The weight is more towards the PAH side. But we fully expect that as the launch evolves, as we continue to engage with physicians that will start to even out and maybe even potentially shift to the PH-ILD. I think it's really going to depend on the center where the physicians are. Do they have a PAH clinic and do those PH-ILD physicians want to actually treat versus refer. From our standpoint, we don't really care who treats. We do want to make sure that those patients were getting caught earlier in their disease because we think that and this gets into the second part of your question, we think that the earlier they start on Tyvaso the more and the longer they can benefit. And so from a timing standpoint, in terms of duration of therapy, it's really going to, I think be a question of where they are in their disease progression and what's sort of the dominant part of the disease, is it the ILD, is it the pulmonary hypertension. And so if you have got really severe ILD, less on the PAH, they go on Tyvaso. I think those patients probably won't be on as long versus patients that are – it's really more PAH, less on the ILD, where I think we would expect to see duration of treatment along the lines of what we see in, if not longer in PAH. Yes. I would just say – I would just add maybe two maybe granular points. So, the Unituxin, I wouldn't look as necessarily being a one-time event, as Martine mentioned. The larger – when I referenced the larger order from Japan, that really was a function of the fact that we have larger than what we were forecasting because we weren't expecting a broader label of what we got. So, now that we have the broader label, I think the orders that we expect from Japan would be on par with what we saw in this quarter over time. I would also say on the international side, we always see some lumpiness there. Part of what we saw last year with the generic entrant into Europe was Ferrer, our partner having to draw down their inventory. So, that's been gone down. And I think we will still see lumpy orders internationally, but over the course of a year, I think that will level out."

            "name": "Leigh Peterson",
            "content": "Yes. Yes, sure. Thanks, Martine, and thanks for the question. So really what came – one of the things that came out of the INCREASE study in addition to meeting our primary endpoints and everything that's been published so far, including New England Journal, is that we published a paper in the Lancet recently, and it describes the surprise sort of that we saw, which was that we saw an improvement in FVC, which is forced vital capacity. And this indicated that Tyvaso might not only work on the pulmonary hypertension component of the disease, but it might actually work on the fibrotic disease in patients with PH-ILD. And that's actually supported by – so we saw this clinically, and that's actually supported by non-clinical evidence where there is been several studies that have shown the anti-fibrotic effect of treprostinil. So that together made a design, think about what's going on, and think that possibly this could also work in patients with IPF without pulmonary hypertension, so again, evidenced an increase and evidence in non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo. And just to reiterate what Martine just said. So for PH-ILD and PH-COPD, obviously, as mentioned, there is a common pathogenesis for the PH component. But in fact, due to these other effects of treprostinil, treprostinil binds multiple receptors on multiple cell types and has multiple mechanisms of action. There are additional actions such as the fibrosis that can work specifically in patients with fibrotic lung disease. And there is even a bronchodilation effect that could also help the patients with obstructive lung conditions, such as COPD."

            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thanks, Dewey. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our quarterly earnings call. We have a lot of good news to share today. So, it's going to be a very fun call. You have read in the press release the outstanding financial results. And in a moment, I am going to turn the mic over to Mike Benkowitz, who will speak a little bit more about the commercial success that we are experiencing. I would like to talk a little bit about our pipeline, which is quite robust and doing very well. We have a number of studies in Phase 3. I'd like to highlight a few of them. Two of our studies are outside of Group 1 PAH, the PERFECT study in COPD, specifically a form of COPD that's associated with pulmonary hypertension and another Phase 3 study in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, also known as IPF. That study is called the TETON study within United Therapeutics. In addition to those Phase 3 studies, we have additional Phase 3 studies within Group 1 pulmonary hypertension. Two of those Phase 3 studies are using our once a day drug called ralinepag and both of those studies are going quite nicely. In addition, we have a lot of next-generation treprostinil development activity that will be in – some of its in Phase 1 and then moving into bioequivalence testing over the next year or two. So, that will provide an ongoing pipeline of next-generation treprostinil products for Group 1 and possibly also Group 3 pulmonary hypertension. Looking a little bit at the longer term, we are working on cures for pulmonary hypertension, either through gene therapy. And we do have a gene therapy trial also in Phase 3 or actually manufactured lungs, lungs that are manufactured in our laboratories and then transplanted into patients to completely cure either their pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, or many other end-stage lung diseases. In the meantime, on the clinical side, there is increasing evidence that current medicines dosed appropriately may in fact convert pulmonary hypertension into a lifelong manageable condition. And a lot of these data are coming from Europe and Japan. I think you are going to soon see more reports from the United States, but it's really startling to see reports with patients, more than 90% of the patients in the cohort living 20 years, over 10 years with the current medications, but dosed differently than kind of the traditional dosing, dosing – dosed according to a very specific protocol. So, that's tremendously exciting for us in the pulmonary hypertension field, to be able to convert pulmonary hypertension into a lifelong manageable condition. And indeed, the goal of our next-generation treprostinil products is to make these kind of lifelong, manageable protocols as easy as possible for the patients because they will be on them for literally decades. Well, with that introduction to our pipeline and clinical development activities, I'd like to pass the microphone over to Mike Benkowitz to talk about the commercial operations. Mike? Thanks so much, Mike. Great review. So operator, we can now open up the lines for any questions. And whatever questions come in, I'll direct them either to James, our CFO, to Mike, our President or any questions of a scientific medical technical nature to Dr. Peterson. Operator? Thanks, Jess. Nice to hear your voice this morning. Both of those questions seem to be squarely in Mike's daily work. Perfect. Thanks so much, Mike. Next question, please? Hi, good morning. Yes. Great question, Hartaj, I'll speak for a moment or two about the Group 3 COPD pulmonary hypertension and let – while I'm doing that, Dr. Peterson, if you could queue up your thoughts on the scientific rationale in IPF, which is unique in the sense that it has nothing to do with pulmonary hypertension at all. And Dr. Peterson has studied that scientific rationale quite a bit. So with regard to the COPD, we're not treating the COPD per se, but we're treating only the pulmonary hypertension that those patients have who also have COPD. We're doing this based on previous work from Dr. Waxman and others that showed that when Group 3 patients with COPD were treated off label with Tyvaso, they have dramatically improved 6-minute walk test, Hartaj. And it was based on that data that we were able to size our PERFECT study. It's about roughly 100 patients, a bit more than 100 patients and felt very confident with that sizing because of the very dramatic data that had come out earlier. So it is the mechanism of action is the same as it would be for treating any other type of pulmonary hypertension. We've got the ability of treprostinil to, for example, dilate the smooth muscles in the pulmonary arteries, which are causing the vasal constriction. And we also have the ability of Tyvaso inhaled to reduce the platelet aggregation in those tiny arterials, which also contribute to ultimately a afterload in the right heart and actually spells a worse morbidity and mortality picture for the COPD patients who have pulmonary hypertension than for those who don't. There are a lot of patients Hartaj, with the COPD form of pulmonary hypertension, in fact, over 100,000 in the U.S. alone. So there is a real great opportunity for us to do good there. And I think the scientific rationale, the empirical data upon which we sized and based the PERFECT study was very solid, and we have high expectations for success. Dr. Peterson, would you like to talk about the scientific rationale in pulmonary fibrosis because that's something really very new. Perfect. Thanks so much, Dr. Peterson. Operator, next question, please. Yes. Thanks for the question. It's all of our strategic operations and managed markets activities report into Mike. So Mike, if you could provide some insight on that question? Perfect. Thanks so much, Mike. Operator, next question, please. Thanks for the question, Eun. Nice to hear your voice this morning and thanks for the congratulations. We, at present, really would have no idea to comment about what kind of impact intravenous UPTRAVI might have. We do feel that the intravenous route is important, although the same amount of efficacy can be achieved with the subcutaneous route. And that's, of course, ordinarily much easier on the patient and certainly much easier on their ongoing lifestyle. So, that's really the question to be assessed there. In terms of over the longer term, I think what Mike was referring to and I was referring to earlier is that the patients tend to have the best experience according to these recent reports from both Europe and Japan, when they are on the parenteral route for relatively short period of time, in order to aggressively reduce their pressures down below 40 millimeters of mercury and relieve the after load on the right heart. So, whatever goes on there is, I would say, not part of the biggest picture of pulmonary hypertension because the total amount of time on the parenteral therapy is relatively short compared to the total amount of time on Orenitram or another oral therapy. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight into what might be going on in the parenteral optionality space. Next question, please. Yes. Great question. Mike, do you like to handle that one? Perfect. Thanks so much, Mike. Excellent response and very comprehensive. So operator, we have got time for just one more question. Okay, Geoff. So basically, you are just asking what we expect to see from here towards the end of the year? Yes. I don't think – I wouldn't really buy into the hypothesis about a huge amount of one-time growth benefits this quarter. I know Mike kind of referred to the warehousing of the Remodulin patients, but I wouldn't like translate that into being a one-time benefit, because those patients have to book their appointments with the doctors and come in and there is going to be a continual upward swell coming from patients who were pushed back due to COVID. So, I don't see this as a one-time event. I really see it more as what Mike has been talking about, and we have been talking about that we are building steadily toward our goals of doubling the number of Tyvaso patients by the end of next year and having 25,000 patients by the end of 2025. And any given quarter, there is of course, always ups and downs. But what you are seeing, I think, in this quarter is the new revenue track for United Therapeutics going forward, a revenue track, which is consistent with doubling the number of Tyvaso patients by the end of next year and a revenue track that's consistent with having 25,000 patients by the end of 2025. Excellent. Mike, did you want to add something about Unituxin on that last question? Exactly, Mike. Totally agree. Operator, you can please now wrap up, and we would like to thank everybody for participating in our second quarter earnings call. It's been an extremely exciting quarter with all of the top level results that Mike reported on, best in numerous different categories, solidly on track for our announced goals and a very exciting pipeline to continue propelling our growth through the balance of the 2020s. Operator, you can now wrap up."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the United Therapeutics Corporation First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. My name is Phyllis, and I will be your conference operator today.  I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Dewey Steadman, Head of Investor Relations at the United Therapeutics.\nDewey Steadman: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome you to the United Therapeutics Corporation first quarter 2021 earnings call. Accompanying me on today's call are Dr. Martine Rothblatt, our Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Michael Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Mr. James Edgemond, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Dr. Leigh Peterson, our Senior Vice President of Product Development.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Dewey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm going to start off with a sort of 30,000-foot overview. And then after that, I'll open the line for any questions. If there are business questions, I'll refer them to our President, Michael Benkowitz. If there are financial questions, I'll refer them to our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond. And any scientific questions, I'll refer to our Senior Vice President, Dr. Leigh Peterson. I may even pass the odd legal question to Dewey. Well, I think from a 30,000-foot viewpoint, the main quantitative goal at United Therapeutics is what we call 25/25. This means increasing the number of patients that we are helping with our main medicine from over 8,000 patients today to over 25,000 patients by 2025. This quantitative metric is an especially important one to call out today because today is World Pulmonary Hypertension Day. It's the one day in the whole calendar that countries throughout the world have agreed to focus their thoughts, attention and for many patients and families' prayers on the hopes for getting better therapies and treatments for people with pulmonary hypertension.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.\nEun Yang: Thank you. I have a couple of questions. One is on Group three PH-ILD. So we heard from physicians that they see their patients every three to six months. And I know, Martine just mentioned that Group three is a more difficult disease to diagnose and quantify compared to PAH. But is it like aside from targeting physicians, do you plan to target patient so that patients are actually seeking treatment with Tyvaso? And the second question is on subcutaneous Remodulin. I understand that you may be limited to what you can say, but in 10-Q, the trial with Sandoz and Liquidia, you don't expect to begin before mid-2022 at the earliest. Does that mean that Liquidia could not - cannot launch the product until the trial is over? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you for your question, Eun. Nice to hear your voice this morning. Due to the shortage of time on the call, we're only going to be able to allow one question per inquisitor, if I could say that. So I'm going to just take the first question and refer it to Michael because it's really in the domain of a business question. Mike, can you help Eun with understanding what our strategy is with regard to ILD-PH?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. So let me - before I get to the specific question around the patient, maybe give a little bit of color around the PH-ILD launch. So Martine, I think, gave a great overview of sort of our 5-year vision of growing from roughly 8,000 total patients to 25,000 patients and roughly half of those being Tyvaso patients for various indications. So with respect to the PH-ILD piece of that, I just want to reiterate what we've been saying since January. And that with this launch, we expect the number of patients on Tyvaso to approximately double by the end of next year. And the other thing that we've been saying is that it's probably not going to be a straight line from here to that doubling. There'll be a little bit of a ramp and then something looks a little bit more hockey stick-ish as we get later into the year and certainly into next year. And that's due to various things around the fact that, and Eun touched on this, we have a new group of ILD treaters. So they're having to go through the process of getting their patients in, screen those patients, diagnose those patients and then clear the - get that cleared with payers. So that process is ongoing. I will say, in the first three to four weeks of the launch, it's very early days. We're incredibly pleased with what we've seen in terms of referral activity, in terms of the number of referrals that have come in. We actually have patients that have started since the launch on Tyvaso.\nMartine Rothblatt: Awesome, Mike. Thanks so much. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Liana Moussatos with Wedbush Securities.\nLiana Moussatos: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on all the progress. How are you going to commercialize Tyvaso solution versus Tyvaso DPI at the end of the year, presuming approval?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Liana. So great to hear your voice again as well. So that's, again, squarely a business question. So Mike, can you help describe the differential launch plans?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. So we're really excited about the prospect of bringing - being able to bring the DPI to market. We think that it certainly provides a more convenient, easier way to deliver Tyvaso. But if you kind of step back and really kind of look at the history of United Therapeutics and what our objective and missions has been or have been, and that is the right patient options. Patients with options - different ways to take our medicines in a way that is - meets kind of where they are in their disease, and that's most convenient to them. So we started with Remodulin and then we developed two versions of Remodulin. We developed Tyvaso, which was an easier way to take treprostinil inhaled, and then eventually got to Orenitram, which is obviously the simplest version of all of them. And so I look at DPI as really kind of fitting in. It's fitting kind of into that strategy of providing patient options. And so I would expect that with the DPI, you're going to have a significant number or majority of patients that are going to want to transition to the dry powder inhaler, and that's fantastic. You will have other patients that, for various reasons, may choose to stay on the nebulizer. And that's great. We're going to continue to support that product. It's a great product. There is going to - I do think that there is going to be a patient type that is maybe better suited for that product over the DPI. Don't hold me to this. I think when the dust settles, you're probably looking at something of around a 70-30 split between dry powder and nebulizer. So we're going to continue to provide both options, support both options. And I think they're both great delivery devices for the right patient.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect. Thanks so much, Mike. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer & Company.\nHartaj Singh: Great, thank you for the question and great work. Got a question on Orenitram. So since the approval of the FREEDOM-EV, the addition to the label, the study, FREEDOM-EV study, Martine, it has - the growth trajectory of the product has definitely increased substantially in the last two years. Johnson & Johnson with Uptravi, the old Actelion drug, indicates about 20% on average growth every quarter. Some of that from market share, some of that from an increase of the overall market size. Can you give us color there and also help walk us through how you see Orenitram adding those additional 3,000 patients, as you had mentioned earlier in your prepared commentary? Thank you for the question.\nMartine Rothblatt: Great. Hartaj, so awesome to hear your voice this morning as well. Very interesting question. Very much in the range of what we call business and market strategy. So Mike, if I can ask you to provide Hartaj with some more insight into the business ramp plans for Orenitram?\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes. Happy to do that. Yes. So I think with Orenitram, I think you have to kind of, again, kind of step back and look at the timing of the launch and kind of where that kind of fit with COVID, right? So I will say, at a high level, I think as a company, we continue to be very pleased with the physician reaction to the EV data. I think our underlying patient trends continue to be very solid. And I would say, in particular, I think, in late Q1 and even heading into Q2, if you look at referrals and starts, we've seen actually a nice uptick over the prior months. I will say, I mean, hindsight to 2020, as I kind of look back over the last 18 months and think about when we received the label expansion, which was October of 2019, when the publication came out, which was in March, like literally two days, I think, before the world shut down, to your point, Hartaj, we did see a nice uptick in that kind of initial 4 to 6-month period. And then it did get sort of muted. So we had a nice ramp and then it just kind of plateaued a little bit there for a little while. And I think, obviously, as I look at it, I think it's a function of kind of COVID shutting down, the lack of access that we had to physicians and just impacting our ability to really kind of get out and continue to communicate the EV data. I mean we certainly had some access during COVID virtually, but nowhere near the axis that we had pre-COVID. So I think that we're starting to come out of this a little bit. We're getting that access again. We're able to get in and have really, I think, fruitful discussions with physicians and really kind of talk about the Orenitram value proposition. I think the doctors are seeing that. And like I said, I think we're starting to see that uptick. And so I think as we look into the future, I think, long-term, as Martine said, I think we do have a lot of runway there with Orenitram as we continue to educate the physicians on the value proposition. I also think with some of the data that we've talked about in prior calls around this idea of treating patients to pressure. So putting - starting them on Remodulin, really trying to drive down their pulmonary arterial pressure and then switching them over to Orenitram, I think that is continuing to get a little bit of - certainly a lot of attention by physicians. And I think over the long-term, that's going to give us, I think, another - sort of another leverage point with Orenitram. And then I think the third one that we see in sort of the latter half of the 25/25 plan that Martine laid out is OreniPro, the once daily. So that provides, as we're talking about Tyvaso, a more convenient way to take Orenitram and potentially with a better tolerability and an ability to dose faster. So maybe some additional attributes there. So I think it's really sort of a combination of building on and restarting - build on the momentum we've seen in the last quarter and continuing to leverage the EV data, leverage this treat to pressure idea that's getting some attention and then the once-daily formulation that's coming in kind of the back end of the 25/25 time frame.\nMartine Rothblatt: Excellent, Mike. Thank you so much. Operator, I believe we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Thome with Cowen & Company.\nJoe Thome: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one on the TETON program. As you start thinking about adding more trials here and expanding Tyvaso's opportunity, is it possible to study the DPI alone in some of these trials, maybe the increased adherence or ease of use would maybe drive better treatment outcomes? Or do you have to start with the nebulized version and maybe do a PK study to show equivalents there?\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. Just that is, I would say, that was close to a scientific question as we've got so far this morning. I'd like to bounce that one over to Dr. Peterson to discuss.\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. Thank you for the call or the question. So we have been told or actually we have, in writing, that once we receive approval for Tyvaso for new indications and once we receive approval for the Tyvaso DPI for PAH, really, then the approval will automatically be granted for the additional indications for DPI as they come along. So given that, it really depends on what we decided at the time with regard to supply, ease of use, where patients are with wanting to be on our DPI versus the inhaler, the Tyvaso inhaler, we don't exactly know. I mean we have studied the DPI - the Tyvaso DPI in - for human factors in all different indications, whether it's PAH or PH-ILD or even some ILDs without diagnosed PH. So as far as that goes, they're quite similar. But there is some question, and I can't say one way or the other, that some patients with different indications might actually prefer a nebulized form. It might be a little bit easier for them to take and get a good dose versus the dry powder inhaler because they actually breathe in for the dry powder inhaler versus the nebulizer is a little bit more passive. So we're going to - as soon as we continue to do additional studies, we'll investigate that. But right now, TETON one is already in the work. The sites are open, and we have a protocol. We should have the enrollment any day now, and that's with Tyvaso.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Dr. Peterson. Really appreciate it. Well, we really have been happy to have an opportunity to share our business, scientific and our financial progress with everybody during this first quarter earnings call. We've been happy to share with everybody on this World Pulmonary Hypertension Day that by the end of next year, we expect to be able to double the number of patients that we have on Tyvaso. And by 2025, we expect to be able to help roughly three times as many patients with our treprostinil suite of products that we're currently helping today. It is a fact that based on the Kaplan-Meier curves of all of the main approved therapies that about 15% to 20% of the patients progress in their disease signs and symptoms each year. And just to make the math easy at 50,000 patients, 15% a year progressing is 7,500 a year, 20% progressing is 10,000 a year. So whether the number of patients needing a new therapy is 1,500 a year or - I'm sorry, is 7,500 a year or 10,000 a year, both of those numbers are well above the growth that United Therapeutics requires to go from 8,000 patients that we're helping today to 25,000 patients that we will be helping by 2025. So I believe that the goal is realistic. The need is real. And our capabilities are strong, impressive and ever growing. Thank you so much, everybody, for joining us on this call and look forward to seeing you at least virtually at an upcoming healthcare conference. Operator, you can wrap it up.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today’s United Therapeutics Corporation Conference Call.

            "name": "Michael Benkowitz",
            "content": "Sure. So let me - before I get to the specific question around the patient, maybe give a little bit of color around the PH-ILD launch. So Martine, I think, gave a great overview of sort of our 5-year vision of growing from roughly 8,000 total patients to 25,000 patients and roughly half of those being Tyvaso patients for various indications. So with respect to the PH-ILD piece of that, I just want to reiterate what we've been saying since January. And that with this launch, we expect the number of patients on Tyvaso to approximately double by the end of next year. And the other thing that we've been saying is that it's probably not going to be a straight line from here to that doubling. There'll be a little bit of a ramp and then something looks a little bit more hockey stick-ish as we get later into the year and certainly into next year. And that's due to various things around the fact that, and Eun touched on this, we have a new group of ILD treaters. So they're having to go through the process of getting their patients in, screen those patients, diagnose those patients and then clear the - get that cleared with payers. So that process is ongoing. I will say, in the first three to four weeks of the launch, it's very early days. We're incredibly pleased with what we've seen in terms of referral activity, in terms of the number of referrals that have come in. We actually have patients that have started since the launch on Tyvaso. Sure. So we're really excited about the prospect of bringing - being able to bring the DPI to market. We think that it certainly provides a more convenient, easier way to deliver Tyvaso. But if you kind of step back and really kind of look at the history of United Therapeutics and what our objective and missions has been or have been, and that is the right patient options. Patients with options - different ways to take our medicines in a way that is - meets kind of where they are in their disease, and that's most convenient to them. So we started with Remodulin and then we developed two versions of Remodulin. We developed Tyvaso, which was an easier way to take treprostinil inhaled, and then eventually got to Orenitram, which is obviously the simplest version of all of them. And so I look at DPI as really kind of fitting in. It's fitting kind of into that strategy of providing patient options. And so I would expect that with the DPI, you're going to have a significant number or majority of patients that are going to want to transition to the dry powder inhaler, and that's fantastic. You will have other patients that, for various reasons, may choose to stay on the nebulizer. And that's great. We're going to continue to support that product. It's a great product. There is going to - I do think that there is going to be a patient type that is maybe better suited for that product over the DPI. Don't hold me to this. I think when the dust settles, you're probably looking at something of around a 70-30 split between dry powder and nebulizer. So we're going to continue to provide both options, support both options. And I think they're both great delivery devices for the right patient. Yes. Happy to do that. Yes. So I think with Orenitram, I think you have to kind of, again, kind of step back and look at the timing of the launch and kind of where that kind of fit with COVID, right? So I will say, at a high level, I think as a company, we continue to be very pleased with the physician reaction to the EV data. I think our underlying patient trends continue to be very solid. And I would say, in particular, I think, in late Q1 and even heading into Q2, if you look at referrals and starts, we've seen actually a nice uptick over the prior months. I will say, I mean, hindsight to 2020, as I kind of look back over the last 18 months and think about when we received the label expansion, which was October of 2019, when the publication came out, which was in March, like literally two days, I think, before the world shut down, to your point, Hartaj, we did see a nice uptick in that kind of initial 4 to 6-month period. And then it did get sort of muted. So we had a nice ramp and then it just kind of plateaued a little bit there for a little while. And I think, obviously, as I look at it, I think it's a function of kind of COVID shutting down, the lack of access that we had to physicians and just impacting our ability to really kind of get out and continue to communicate the EV data. I mean we certainly had some access during COVID virtually, but nowhere near the axis that we had pre-COVID. So I think that we're starting to come out of this a little bit. We're getting that access again. We're able to get in and have really, I think, fruitful discussions with physicians and really kind of talk about the Orenitram value proposition. I think the doctors are seeing that. And like I said, I think we're starting to see that uptick. And so I think as we look into the future, I think, long-term, as Martine said, I think we do have a lot of runway there with Orenitram as we continue to educate the physicians on the value proposition. I also think with some of the data that we've talked about in prior calls around this idea of treating patients to pressure. So putting - starting them on Remodulin, really trying to drive down their pulmonary arterial pressure and then switching them over to Orenitram, I think that is continuing to get a little bit of - certainly a lot of attention by physicians. And I think over the long-term, that's going to give us, I think, another - sort of another leverage point with Orenitram. And then I think the third one that we see in sort of the latter half of the 25/25 plan that Martine laid out is OreniPro, the once daily. So that provides, as we're talking about Tyvaso, a more convenient way to take Orenitram and potentially with a better tolerability and an ability to dose faster. So maybe some additional attributes there. So I think it's really sort of a combination of building on and restarting - build on the momentum we've seen in the last quarter and continuing to leverage the EV data, leverage this treat to pressure idea that's getting some attention and then the once-daily formulation that's coming in kind of the back end of the 25/25 time frame."

            "name": "Leigh Peterson",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you for the call or the question. So we have been told or actually we have, in writing, that once we receive approval for Tyvaso for new indications and once we receive approval for the Tyvaso DPI for PAH, really, then the approval will automatically be granted for the additional indications for DPI as they come along. So given that, it really depends on what we decided at the time with regard to supply, ease of use, where patients are with wanting to be on our DPI versus the inhaler, the Tyvaso inhaler, we don't exactly know. I mean we have studied the DPI - the Tyvaso DPI in - for human factors in all different indications, whether it's PAH or PH-ILD or even some ILDs without diagnosed PH. So as far as that goes, they're quite similar. But there is some question, and I can't say one way or the other, that some patients with different indications might actually prefer a nebulized form. It might be a little bit easier for them to take and get a good dose versus the dry powder inhaler because they actually breathe in for the dry powder inhaler versus the nebulizer is a little bit more passive. So we're going to - as soon as we continue to do additional studies, we'll investigate that. But right now, TETON one is already in the work. The sites are open, and we have a protocol. We should have the enrollment any day now, and that's with Tyvaso."

            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thank you, Dewey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm going to start off with a sort of 30,000-foot overview. And then after that, I'll open the line for any questions. If there are business questions, I'll refer them to our President, Michael Benkowitz. If there are financial questions, I'll refer them to our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond. And any scientific questions, I'll refer to our Senior Vice President, Dr. Leigh Peterson. I may even pass the odd legal question to Dewey. Well, I think from a 30,000-foot viewpoint, the main quantitative goal at United Therapeutics is what we call 25/25. This means increasing the number of patients that we are helping with our main medicine from over 8,000 patients today to over 25,000 patients by 2025. This quantitative metric is an especially important one to call out today because today is World Pulmonary Hypertension Day. It's the one day in the whole calendar that countries throughout the world have agreed to focus their thoughts, attention and for many patients and families' prayers on the hopes for getting better therapies and treatments for people with pulmonary hypertension. Thank you for your question, Eun. Nice to hear your voice this morning. Due to the shortage of time on the call, we're only going to be able to allow one question per inquisitor, if I could say that. So I'm going to just take the first question and refer it to Michael because it's really in the domain of a business question. Mike, can you help Eun with understanding what our strategy is with regard to ILD-PH? Awesome, Mike. Thanks so much. Operator, next question. Thanks so much, Liana. So great to hear your voice again as well. So that's, again, squarely a business question. So Mike, can you help describe the differential launch plans? Perfect. Thanks so much, Mike. Operator, next question, please. Great. Hartaj, so awesome to hear your voice this morning as well. Very interesting question. Very much in the range of what we call business and market strategy. So Mike, if I can ask you to provide Hartaj with some more insight into the business ramp plans for Orenitram? Excellent, Mike. Thank you so much. Operator, I believe we have time for one last question. Yes. Just that is, I would say, that was close to a scientific question as we've got so far this morning. I'd like to bounce that one over to Dr. Peterson to discuss. Thanks so much, Dr. Peterson. Really appreciate it. Well, we really have been happy to have an opportunity to share our business, scientific and our financial progress with everybody during this first quarter earnings call. We've been happy to share with everybody on this World Pulmonary Hypertension Day that by the end of next year, we expect to be able to double the number of patients that we have on Tyvaso. And by 2025, we expect to be able to help roughly three times as many patients with our treprostinil suite of products that we're currently helping today. It is a fact that based on the Kaplan-Meier curves of all of the main approved therapies that about 15% to 20% of the patients progress in their disease signs and symptoms each year. And just to make the math easy at 50,000 patients, 15% a year progressing is 7,500 a year, 20% progressing is 10,000 a year. So whether the number of patients needing a new therapy is 1,500 a year or - I'm sorry, is 7,500 a year or 10,000 a year, both of those numbers are well above the growth that United Therapeutics requires to go from 8,000 patients that we're helping today to 25,000 patients that we will be helping by 2025. So I believe that the goal is realistic. The need is real. And our capabilities are strong, impressive and ever growing. Thank you so much, everybody, for joining us on this call and look forward to seeing you at least virtually at an upcoming healthcare conference. Operator, you can wrap it up."

Now I will turn the call over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of the fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results and business activities of United Therapeutics. Dr. Rothblatt?\nMartine Rothblatt : Thank you, Dewey, and good morning, everyone. I feel very excited to lead this call because we have so much positive news to report about 2022. In fact, reflecting back on the past few years, this is actually the best year United Therapeutics has ever had. And it augurs even more, I think, positively to what we're going to see coming up in 2023, 2024 and 2025. Let me hit a few highlights. First, 2022 was our highest revenue year ever. Second, 2022 was our most profitable year ever. Third, 2022 was our highest operational cash flow year ever. And fourth, we ended 2022 with more patients on our treprostinil medicines than ever before. I think you have to agree with me that these are fantastic results. And now I'd like to give a few indications of why I think that as great as these results are, they are not laurels for us to rest upon but instead a launching pad for yet greater results in 2023, 2024 and 2025. In fact, the patient uptake of our new Tyvaso DPI medicine has been so rapid that we can project a doubling of our revenues by 2025. This doubling of revenues is helped by the unique nature of each of our medicines including Tyvaso DPI. For example, Tyvaso DPI is the only inhaled treprostinil product that enables deep lung penetration via high-resistance low-flow device. Another example, our Remodulin product is the only parenteral prostacyclin delivered by the small, easy, super accurate Remunity device. The differentiated aspects of Remodulin has allowed us revenues to remain steady at about $0.5 billion a year through the past 3 years running. Our Orenitram product is also very unique because it is the only titratable oral prostacyclin product. We currently expect it's 1/3 of $1 billion a year revenue to continue growing as physicians become aware of the results of our recently released EXPEDITE study. That study showed Remodulin patients can be switched directly to Orenitram. And Orenitram will soon be joined by new products from our pipeline. In the field of pulmonary arterial hypertension, we expect to complete our Phase III trials of ralinepag by 2025. That will enable the first once-daily dosing of a prostacyclin pill in the pulmonary hypertension field. In the field of pulmonary fibrosis, we expect to complete our Phase III trials of Tyvaso by 2025 as well. That will, we hope, create the first disease-modifying treatment for pulmonary fibrosis, a true landmark in the field. And in the area of transplantation we hope to commence clinical trials of manufactured organs within the next few years. That would be a major contribution to ending so many deaths on the organ transplant list and unfortunately, even more deaths from end-stage organ disease off the transplant list. In summary, our business, our patient count, our pipeline is growing longer and faster than ever before. 2022 marked the continuation of that growth factor into 2023. We have achieved a very nice balance of growth and strength. We intend to continue building on this platform in the years to come. To provide now some additional, very median I think, extremely exciting details of how we are continuing to build on this platform, I'd like to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Benkowitz. Mike?\nMichael Benkowitz : Thanks, Martine, and good morning, everyone. From a commercial standpoint, as Martine said, 2022 was a phenomenal year for us. We're extremely pleased with the progress of the Tyvaso DPI launch as referrals starts and active patients for both Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI are among the best that we've seen to date. We were also very excited to achieve our goal of doubling the number of Tyvaso patients following the PH-ILD approval in early 2021. This was a goal that Unitarians across the organization rallied around and supported. So we're really proud and appreciative of everyone's hard work over the last couple of years to help us reach this milestone. Importantly, reaching this goal reinforces to us the impact that Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI are having not only in helping patients with PH-ILD treat this serious progressive disease for which there are no other available options, but also the impact Tyvaso DPI will have in PAH. With the simple convenience of a small inhaler that fits in the palm of the patient's hand and an elegant ease of use following the simple mantra of open, load, inhale. We believe Tyvaso DPI will meaningfully expand the use of inhaled treprostinil in both indications. The Tyvaso DPI inhaler device developed by our partner, MannKind, is able to efficiently deliver treprostinil deep into the lung and one breadth per cartridge using less active ingredient to the nebulizer reference. The convenience and efficacy of our DPI device, coupled with Tyvaso's known tolerability profile has us well positioned to expand our reach in PH-ILD and to move the use of treprostinil therapies like Tyvaso DPI and PAH even earlier than IP receptor agonist like selexipag. We're seeing this play out with our prescribers as evidenced by several positive trends. Since the PH-ILD launch, we've increased the total number of Tyvaso prescribers by about 70%, an increase by almost 60%, the number of prescribers with 3 or more patients in their practice. This last point is an intra marker we look at to gauge product support. We have found that once a physician has at least 3 patients on one of our products, they tend to become what we call supporters and start using the product much more frequently and regularly. We're also making headway with traditionally loyal selexipag prescribers. Of the top 100 selexipag prescribers, 70% have now written Tyvaso DPI and 50% of those have written 5 or more prescriptions. From a revenue standpoint, we're very pleased with how the quarter and the year wrapped up for Tyvaso, but there are a few key points I want to highlight. First and most relevant to the fourth quarter of 2022 is that we're still in a launch mode for Tyvaso DPI and even for the PH-ILD indication for that matter. As such, our specialty pharmacy distributors are still rightsizing product orders based on estimated underlying patient demand, both in total and between Tyvaso nebulized and Tyvaso DPI. Therefore, our distributors are placing orders more frequently than their once or twice a month historical cadence. And these new ordering patterns did impact the timing and size of product orders and thus our product revenues during the quarter. Second, we're also building Tyvaso DPI inventory as we're launching a product. So our distributors are not yet able to order a sufficient product to reach contractual inventory levels per their usual practice. We expect over the next several quarters, these 2 factors will normalize, and our specialty pharmacy distributors will shift back to a more historical type cadence of product orders. For these reasons and the usual historical seasonality to our business that we have discussed on prior calls, we think annual revenue trends are a better lens through which to view and evaluate our business. The last thing I want to touch on with Tyvaso is our patient assistance program or PAP. Patient utilization of our program -- of our PAP program for Tyvaso DPI which is covered under Medicare Part D and has high patient co-pays, has been higher than anticipated, including by many PH-ILD patients who were on the nebulizer and nPAP last year and has since transitioned to DPI. We anticipate that this will be a short-term phenomenon and that many of these patients will be covered under their Medicare Part D plan starting in 2024 and continuing into 2025, once changes to the Part D provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act begin to go into effect. Turning to Orenitram. We see continued momentum for Orenitram as we ended the fourth quarter with the highest number of patients on therapy since its launch. We're also excited about the recent top line EXPEDITE data we press released in October of last year that demonstrated that prostacyclin induction with Remodulin can lead to double the average Orenitram dose when patients shift to oral therapy compared to patients who do not have a Remodulin induction. Following up on this top line data, we plan to present additional details on EXPEDITE at scientific meetings this year, along with a peer-reviewed manuscript detailing the study in the second quarter. And finally, we continue to be pleased with the performance of Remodulin in the U.S. as the fourth quarter was one of our highest referral quarters ever. The Remunity pump for Remodulin is gaining momentum with approximately 1/3 of subcutaneous patients now on Remunity especially as Remunity is the only subcu pump widely available for any patients to treprostinil therapy. So to wrap up, after reaching our goal of doubling the number of Tyvaso patients, we're confident in our ability to double our annual revenue run rate for approximately $2 billion today to $4 billion by the end of 2025. We expect continued Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI uptake in both PAH and PH-ILD to drive most of our near-term revenue growth, supplemented by Orenitram growth through the expedite protocol and other research and supported by continued Remodulin resilience.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine.\nMartine Rothblatt : Michael, thank you so much for providing that wealth of detailed information supporting this great growth vector we have going here from 2022 into 2023, '24, '25. Operator, feel free to open up the lines to any questions now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan.\nJessica Fye : I have two, if that's okay. First, can you provide some of the assumptions, specifically around Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI to help underpin your target to roughly double your revenue run rate for the overall company by the end of 2025. And then second, just following up on Michael's comments in prepared remarks, I was hoping if you could elaborate a little bit more on that comment about the utilization of the PAP program for DPI being higher than anticipated among PH-ILD patients who transitioned to DPI. Is that to say that because of the higher out-of-pocket in Part D in the short term that they're receiving free drug? And how should we reconcile that with, I think, what was anticipated to be a bit of a tailwind in 2023 from PAP patients transitioning on to reimbursed product this year?\nMartine Rothblatt : Yes. Thank you, Jess, and good morning. Good to hear your voice this morning. Generally, we try to like limit to one question for questioner because there are so many people in queue. But because your two questions are in a sense kind of like a tag team question, one way close into the next, Mike, I'll kind of ask if you can handle both questions.\nMichael Benkowitz : Yes. So I think, Jess, your first question around the assumption, the underlying assumptions for our confidence in the growth of Tyvaso in both PAH and PH-ILD is, in some ways, it's a little bit of a math -- kind of a math exercise, but also just I think -- I think just the excitement and enthusiasm we're seeing around DPI. So if you think about in the PAH or the WHO Group 1 market, there's about, I mean, roughly 50,000 patients in the U.S. diagnosed with PAH, still and shockingly and sadly, it's probably only about, I would say, about 30% to 35% of those patients are on a prostacyclin. And there's a lot of reasons for that, and a lot of it comes down to the fact that the delivery mechanisms for prostacyclin are -- they're not terribly convenient. But I think that is changing on Tyvaso DPI. So we feel very confident that we will be able to -- with the convenience of the DPI inhaler to be able to expand the use of prostacyclins in the PAH market meaningfully. So I think we feel like even though it's a crowded market, even though Tyvaso has been out there, we still think that there's a lot of opportunity within the WHO Group 1 market to grow the use of prostacyclin and particularly Tyvaso. And then a similar story, but maybe a little bit easier on the PH-ILD side because there, you have a market that's conservatively 30,000 patients with no other approved therapy. And so we've roughly tapped into about 10% of that over the last couple of years, and we think we have another other 90% available to us. So we still feel like we have a lot of runway there to grow with Tyvaso. And again, I think just with the convenience of DPI, it's going to get easier for doctors to prescribe that drug for those patients that have PH-ILD. And then shifting to your second point on the PAP. So yes, so the issue is that we had patients in PH-ILD, patients on Medicare and our PAP program for 2021, 2022, expected a lot of those to roll over starting in 2023. And a lot of those have started to roll over in 2023. It's not as high as -- the number that are rolled over, it's not as high as we expected for a couple of reasons. One is I think at the end of the third quarter, I think we reported that there were about 700-ish patients in the PAP program. So some of those discontinued which we expected. Some of those even after becoming -- even with the CMS coverage, still qualified for PAP. And so they stayed in PAP. And then as I said in my prepared remarks, we did have a number of patients that transition to DPI between the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the first quarter. And so with the higher co-pays and Part D, they were then eligible to remain in PAP. So I think we still had about half, slightly more than half of those patients convert over. I think they're still -- they're kind of working through the system, but it's a little bit less than we were expecting, I think, when we had the call in the third quarter.\nMartine Rothblatt : Those are great answers. Jess, one just additional shade of color I could add on top of Mike's remarks with regard to your question as to what kind of parameters can I provide to provide greater assurance about the doubling of revenues by the end of '25 is the uptake of Tyvaso DPI has been dramatic. And as Mike mentioned, he provided some metrics, for example, the very high number of selexipag prescribers who have not previously prescribed on Tyvaso now prescribing Tyvaso DPI. So when we achieve the doubling of our patients on Tyvaso over a period of just 18 months, I can't really overemphasize what an important metric that is. Just to give you kind of a sense, Tyvaso was approved 10 years ago. So it took like 10 years to get up to a certain level of patient penetration for this drug and then in under two years, it doubles. I mean that's -- it's an unmistakable sign in addition to the steps that Mike shared with you that this product is going to penetrate very, very rapidly. Now while one might think that in an area such as PH Group III, which has been penetrated by no pulmonary hypertension medicines like, oh, these are all just like people dying of thirst and just going to just slap up this new medicine right away, the reality in a disease like pulmonary hypertension is that it just doesn't happen like that. Instead, it's a very kind of blocking and tackling exercise of physician by physician, center by center working through all of the rigorous of talking to the right payers and getting the payers to understand the right procedures and going through all the procedures and the pre-approval, diagnoses, requirements, the catheterizations and all of these things. So while we did create like special teams focused on PH Group III before we launched into that indication, in the field of pulmonary hypertension, one year of kind of preparation is sort of like nothing compared to how much activity is needed to build a bulk of patients. So now that one year is more than two years behind us, we've now had a year of actual practice, okay, you can actually put these patients on medicines. As Mike referred to, the payer aspects, especially with regard to Medicare, we're just very, very recently resolved favorably in our direction. And so the -- it's just you have to like first have not just one year and not just like there wasn't like a waiting bolus of patients in Group III just waiting for a launch, you have to like develop this market and really kind of till the soil for a number of years. We've now done that, and we're experienced in those clinics and it's this reason why we think out of those 30,000 PH Group III patients. Fortunately, none of them have been touched by pulmonary hypertension treatment that we can rapidly grow our numbers of patients at the same rate that we've been growing them for the past year with this doubling of the number of patients on Tyvaso and thereby reach a number of total treprostinil patients, something that would be in the 20,000 that would correlate when you multiply that times the reimbursement per patient to the $4 billion per year. And of course, it's important. In addition to this, not to be losing revenue from Remodulin or Orenitram. But not only are we not losing revenue, we're solidifying our hold on the Remodulin revenues as Mike referred to the very rapid penetration that the Remunity pump has made and we're growing our revenues in Remodulin -- in Orenitram as a result of the EXPEDITE study that Mike described. So we feel that doubling revenues in three years is really a very doable too. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nJustin Phillips : This is Justin Phillips on for Terence. Just one question for me. I was wondering if you could provide any details today on the Tyvaso trends for January and February.\nMartine Rothblatt : Sure. Mike, would you like to take that?\nMichael Benkowitz : Sure. I'm not going to get into too much detail in terms of previewing the quarter. I mean, I think what I can tell you is and really I have got about a month of data behind us, but I can tell you that the trends in terms of referrals, that's what we call prescriptions for Tyvaso in January are very strong, had like a record level for January. So -- and at least what I'm seeing through kind of there's a lag on the February data, but February is continuing that. So again, I think we're really pleased, just to echo what Martine said, I think we're really pleased with the uptake of generally and specifically with DPI.\nMartine Rothblatt : Thank you, Mike. That's so nice to hear. Record January referrals after a record year, fantastic. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer & Company.\nHartaj Singh : Just a quick question on a slightly different topic with your plan to potentially double revenues by 2025, you still got the Tyvaso IPF Phase III trial reading out around then which is positive. Martine sense another nice little runway there. Could you maybe just go over -- remind us again if Gil is on the call, the data behind that, your certainty around that project? And then just some basic sizing of the market.\nMartine Rothblatt : Sure, Dr. Singh, so happy to hear your voice this morning, and thank you for asking a science question. We love those questions best of all. We have on our call, Dr. Leigh Peterson, and she is our Chief Scientist for the program, and she's also running the TETON clinical trials. People often wonder why they are named TETON, and it's because Dr. Peterson is from Wyoming. So it makes perfect sense. And Leigh, if you could provide Hartaj with some of the scientific reasons why we feel very confident that the Phase III trials of Tyvaso in IPF are rightly sized and that the endpoints are rightly chosen.\nLeigh Peterson: Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. As you know from the results of our INCREASE study, we had an exploratory endpoint, which was forced vital capacity. And that was really -- for the PH-ILD population, it was really a safety assessment in the study but it turned out, we actually saw an improvement of that endpoint in patients on Tyvaso and so -- relative to placebo. And so between the results of this study, increase in PH-ILD patients as well as quite a few -- quite a bit of evidence in the literature of in vitro in nonclinical studies that Tyvaso or treprostinil does have an impact on fibrosis. It's very reasonable that we would be able to have a positive impact in an IPF population. And so using the statistics and the treatment effect that we saw, an increase in specifically IPF patients, we were able to do sample size calculations in order to predict that we would have a successful study with a sufficient p-value to get approval. And we're actually doing 2 studies, one TETON 1 study in the U.S. and Canada as well as TETON 2, which is outside of U.S. and Canada in order to -- in each of those studies, about 400 patients -- almost 400 patients, and enrollment is going well as expected. And as Martine -- that we expect to read out in around the 2025 time frame of both of those studies. They both have an FVC endpoint again, same as what we saw, a positive sense in INCREASE. And we have a year-long follow-up period. We've also had some published results of the INCREASE. You might remember that the randomized part of the study an INCREASE was 16 weeks, but we continue to follow patients -- those patients in a long-term open-label extension study. And so we've been collecting long-term FVC data as well, which looks promising and also gives us confidence that the TETON studies will be successful, but to be determined in 2025 time frame.\nMartine Rothblatt : Well, thank you so much, Leigh. And I just want to and toot your horn just for a moment to the hundreds of people on the call that there was similar skepticism as to whether or not Tyvaso could work in Group III patients and you proved that it could. And I believe your results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. So congratulations again. Next caller, please.\nLeigh Peterson: Thank you. Yes, they were.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ash Verma with UBS.\nAshwani Verma : I have one. So for Tyvaso, was there any inventory buildup in 3Q that bind you down mostly in 4Q or do you think inventory is still at an elevated level during 4Q? I think you mentioned that specialty distributors are still rightsizing the orders.\nMartine Rothblatt : Thank you, Ash. Thank you for that question. Fortunately, we have our Chief Financial Officer, on the phone, James Edgemond. And James, if you could perhaps help Ash with the inventory question.\nJames Edgemond : Yes. Thank you, Martine. Thank you for your question. I think there's kind of 2 ways to answer. One is Michael addressed and talked about the Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI ordering patterns in his prepared remarks. And I think if you look at B as part of the answer, the other products there was no unusual ordering or inventory activity and our specialty pharmaceutical distributors were in line with their contractual requirements on inventory. So hopefully, that provides you insight in terms of your question this morning. So thank you, and back to you, Martine.\nMartine Rothblatt : Thank you, James. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Thome with Cowen and Company.\nJoseph Thome : We're going to be seeing the full mark of sotatercept Phase III data at ACC in about 11 days. And I was just curious how you see a potential future sotatercept launch impacting the PAH market broadly and maybe how this is reflected in that 2025 revenue run rate guidance that you announced.\nMartine Rothblatt : Yes. Thanks for the question. So it's really like super speculative to provide any kind of a meaningful answer to the question because we don't know what the regulatory time frame is going to be for sotatercept. So it's all but impossible to give you any kind of accurate sense. I will say that our revenue forecast is agnostic with regard to whether or not sotatercept is approved or not. In other words, we will remain confident about achieving the doubling of our revenues by 2025 without regard to its launch. There -- it's a very large and diversely treated patient population. Changes in treatment patterns are relatively slow and cautious especially other than frontline treatments such as like ETRAs or PD5s. So I'd be very, very skeptical that you would see an impact of sotatercept on United Therapeutics revenue profile or product uptake across the board, whether it's Remodulin, Tyvaso, Tyvaso DPI or Orenitram. More broadly, the experience has been that when new agents have been introduced into the market, it has grown the market for all of the existing patients. It's kind of like a market growth thing. You saw this with, for example, back in the day when we launched Remodulin and J&J's precursor Actelion launched bosentan, the treprostinil revenues did not shrink. In fact, they grew and then later on, when PD5s were introduced, the market for ETRAs, and treprostinil did not shrink. In fact, it grew, it grew quite a bit. And this has been just a continuous process, and it harkens back to the landmark number that you should keep in your mind that Michael Benkowitz mentioned in his remarks was 50,000, that's 5-0 thousand. That's the number of patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. And all of these drugs have just like scratched the surface of being able to really treat the patients and get them back to a New York Heart Association Functional Class I or even Functional Class II level. So there is so much robust room for growth and improvement in pulmonary hypertension. We at United Therapeutics, welcome any new agent that can help the health of the pulmonary hypertension patient population. And by the way, all that is with respect to WHO Group I pulmonary hypertension. So everything I just said, then you've got this other huge pool that Dr. Peterson opened up with her New England Journal article, WHO Group III, 30,000 patients, that's 3-0 thousand, of which the only approved treatment right now is our Tyvaso drug. And I think sotatercept, I would love to see another good drug to help people with pulmonary hypertension. I don't think it's going to have any effect on our revenue growth. Next question, operator, and we'll have to cut it after that due to coming to the end of time.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Andreas Argyrides with Wedbush Securities.\nAndreas Argyrides : Congrats on a great year. Just a quick one here on Tyvaso DPI. Are you still seeing more rapid up taking new patients versus transition? And what is the split between new and transition patients?\nMartine Rothblatt : A very good question. Mike, can you give us our final answer on the call?\nMichael Benkowitz : Sure. Yes. So it's -- I think it's -- I have to go back to look, I haven't look at it in a couple of weeks, but I think it's still weighted towards new patients in terms of DPI. I mean the transitions are coming. It's just as I think I said on the last call, I think what physicians are doing is they're waiting until patients come in for the regular checkup. So they're kind of coming -- they are coming in at a healthy clip, healthier than what we were seeing and I think that will continue through the course of the year. And so I fully expect at the end of the year, those patients that want to transition to DPI will transition to DPI. So it's certainly a kind of a point of emphasis for our sales team. And certainly, as I said -- certainly, I think the physicians are aware of it and as those patients come in and they decide that the patient is eligible to transition, they'll move them over.\nMartine Rothblatt : Thank you, Mike. Well, to wrap up the call, we are tremendously excited about 2022. This is the year that we hit our $2 billion revenue run rate that has been our goal for really much of the past several years. And we are even more jazzed and more pumped by the fact that the $2 billion level, makes it very clear to us that $4 billion is achievable with all of the products that we are currently marketing and explaining to physicians, the scientific and medical benefits of. And then beyond that, as Hartaj indicated in his question, we have a whole another slew of type -- of products coming out of our Phase III pipeline, particularly a whole new disease indication, pulmonary fibrosis and then on top of that, a best-in-class treatment for pulmonary hypertension, which would be Ralinepag. So 2022 was amazing, a huge kudos to everybody on the team for achieving it. 2023 is looking even better. And with that, operator, you can close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation Earnings Webcast. A rebroadcast of this webcast will be available for one week by visiting the Events and Presentations section of the United Therapeutics Investor Relations website at ir.unither.com.

            "name": "Michael Benkowitz",
            "content": "Thanks, Martine, and good morning, everyone. From a commercial standpoint, as Martine said, 2022 was a phenomenal year for us. We're extremely pleased with the progress of the Tyvaso DPI launch as referrals starts and active patients for both Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI are among the best that we've seen to date. We were also very excited to achieve our goal of doubling the number of Tyvaso patients following the PH-ILD approval in early 2021. This was a goal that Unitarians across the organization rallied around and supported. So we're really proud and appreciative of everyone's hard work over the last couple of years to help us reach this milestone. Importantly, reaching this goal reinforces to us the impact that Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI are having not only in helping patients with PH-ILD treat this serious progressive disease for which there are no other available options, but also the impact Tyvaso DPI will have in PAH. With the simple convenience of a small inhaler that fits in the palm of the patient's hand and an elegant ease of use following the simple mantra of open, load, inhale. We believe Tyvaso DPI will meaningfully expand the use of inhaled treprostinil in both indications. The Tyvaso DPI inhaler device developed by our partner, MannKind, is able to efficiently deliver treprostinil deep into the lung and one breadth per cartridge using less active ingredient to the nebulizer reference. The convenience and efficacy of our DPI device, coupled with Tyvaso's known tolerability profile has us well positioned to expand our reach in PH-ILD and to move the use of treprostinil therapies like Tyvaso DPI and PAH even earlier than IP receptor agonist like selexipag. We're seeing this play out with our prescribers as evidenced by several positive trends. Since the PH-ILD launch, we've increased the total number of Tyvaso prescribers by about 70%, an increase by almost 60%, the number of prescribers with 3 or more patients in their practice. This last point is an intra marker we look at to gauge product support. We have found that once a physician has at least 3 patients on one of our products, they tend to become what we call supporters and start using the product much more frequently and regularly. We're also making headway with traditionally loyal selexipag prescribers. Of the top 100 selexipag prescribers, 70% have now written Tyvaso DPI and 50% of those have written 5 or more prescriptions. From a revenue standpoint, we're very pleased with how the quarter and the year wrapped up for Tyvaso, but there are a few key points I want to highlight. First and most relevant to the fourth quarter of 2022 is that we're still in a launch mode for Tyvaso DPI and even for the PH-ILD indication for that matter. As such, our specialty pharmacy distributors are still rightsizing product orders based on estimated underlying patient demand, both in total and between Tyvaso nebulized and Tyvaso DPI. Therefore, our distributors are placing orders more frequently than their once or twice a month historical cadence. And these new ordering patterns did impact the timing and size of product orders and thus our product revenues during the quarter. Second, we're also building Tyvaso DPI inventory as we're launching a product. So our distributors are not yet able to order a sufficient product to reach contractual inventory levels per their usual practice. We expect over the next several quarters, these 2 factors will normalize, and our specialty pharmacy distributors will shift back to a more historical type cadence of product orders. For these reasons and the usual historical seasonality to our business that we have discussed on prior calls, we think annual revenue trends are a better lens through which to view and evaluate our business. The last thing I want to touch on with Tyvaso is our patient assistance program or PAP. Patient utilization of our program -- of our PAP program for Tyvaso DPI which is covered under Medicare Part D and has high patient co-pays, has been higher than anticipated, including by many PH-ILD patients who were on the nebulizer and nPAP last year and has since transitioned to DPI. We anticipate that this will be a short-term phenomenon and that many of these patients will be covered under their Medicare Part D plan starting in 2024 and continuing into 2025, once changes to the Part D provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act begin to go into effect. Turning to Orenitram. We see continued momentum for Orenitram as we ended the fourth quarter with the highest number of patients on therapy since its launch. We're also excited about the recent top line EXPEDITE data we press released in October of last year that demonstrated that prostacyclin induction with Remodulin can lead to double the average Orenitram dose when patients shift to oral therapy compared to patients who do not have a Remodulin induction. Following up on this top line data, we plan to present additional details on EXPEDITE at scientific meetings this year, along with a peer-reviewed manuscript detailing the study in the second quarter. And finally, we continue to be pleased with the performance of Remodulin in the U.S. as the fourth quarter was one of our highest referral quarters ever. The Remunity pump for Remodulin is gaining momentum with approximately 1/3 of subcutaneous patients now on Remunity especially as Remunity is the only subcu pump widely available for any patients to treprostinil therapy. So to wrap up, after reaching our goal of doubling the number of Tyvaso patients, we're confident in our ability to double our annual revenue run rate for approximately $2 billion today to $4 billion by the end of 2025. We expect continued Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI uptake in both PAH and PH-ILD to drive most of our near-term revenue growth, supplemented by Orenitram growth through the expedite protocol and other research and supported by continued Remodulin resilience.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine. Yes. So I think, Jess, your first question around the assumption, the underlying assumptions for our confidence in the growth of Tyvaso in both PAH and PH-ILD is, in some ways, it's a little bit of a math -- kind of a math exercise, but also just I think -- I think just the excitement and enthusiasm we're seeing around DPI. So if you think about in the PAH or the WHO Group 1 market, there's about, I mean, roughly 50,000 patients in the U.S. diagnosed with PAH, still and shockingly and sadly, it's probably only about, I would say, about 30% to 35% of those patients are on a prostacyclin. And there's a lot of reasons for that, and a lot of it comes down to the fact that the delivery mechanisms for prostacyclin are -- they're not terribly convenient. But I think that is changing on Tyvaso DPI. So we feel very confident that we will be able to -- with the convenience of the DPI inhaler to be able to expand the use of prostacyclins in the PAH market meaningfully. So I think we feel like even though it's a crowded market, even though Tyvaso has been out there, we still think that there's a lot of opportunity within the WHO Group 1 market to grow the use of prostacyclin and particularly Tyvaso. And then a similar story, but maybe a little bit easier on the PH-ILD side because there, you have a market that's conservatively 30,000 patients with no other approved therapy. And so we've roughly tapped into about 10% of that over the last couple of years, and we think we have another other 90% available to us. So we still feel like we have a lot of runway there to grow with Tyvaso. And again, I think just with the convenience of DPI, it's going to get easier for doctors to prescribe that drug for those patients that have PH-ILD. And then shifting to your second point on the PAP. So yes, so the issue is that we had patients in PH-ILD, patients on Medicare and our PAP program for 2021, 2022, expected a lot of those to roll over starting in 2023. And a lot of those have started to roll over in 2023. It's not as high as -- the number that are rolled over, it's not as high as we expected for a couple of reasons. One is I think at the end of the third quarter, I think we reported that there were about 700-ish patients in the PAP program. So some of those discontinued which we expected. Some of those even after becoming -- even with the CMS coverage, still qualified for PAP. And so they stayed in PAP. And then as I said in my prepared remarks, we did have a number of patients that transition to DPI between the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the first quarter. And so with the higher co-pays and Part D, they were then eligible to remain in PAP. So I think we still had about half, slightly more than half of those patients convert over. I think they're still -- they're kind of working through the system, but it's a little bit less than we were expecting, I think, when we had the call in the third quarter. Sure. I'm not going to get into too much detail in terms of previewing the quarter. I mean, I think what I can tell you is and really I have got about a month of data behind us, but I can tell you that the trends in terms of referrals, that's what we call prescriptions for Tyvaso in January are very strong, had like a record level for January. So -- and at least what I'm seeing through kind of there's a lag on the February data, but February is continuing that. So again, I think we're really pleased, just to echo what Martine said, I think we're really pleased with the uptake of generally and specifically with DPI. Sure. Yes. So it's -- I think it's -- I have to go back to look, I haven't look at it in a couple of weeks, but I think it's still weighted towards new patients in terms of DPI. I mean the transitions are coming. It's just as I think I said on the last call, I think what physicians are doing is they're waiting until patients come in for the regular checkup. So they're kind of coming -- they are coming in at a healthy clip, healthier than what we were seeing and I think that will continue through the course of the year. And so I fully expect at the end of the year, those patients that want to transition to DPI will transition to DPI. So it's certainly a kind of a point of emphasis for our sales team. And certainly, as I said -- certainly, I think the physicians are aware of it and as those patients come in and they decide that the patient is eligible to transition, they'll move them over."

            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thank you, Dewey, and good morning, everyone. I feel very excited to lead this call because we have so much positive news to report about 2022. In fact, reflecting back on the past few years, this is actually the best year United Therapeutics has ever had. And it augurs even more, I think, positively to what we're going to see coming up in 2023, 2024 and 2025. Let me hit a few highlights. First, 2022 was our highest revenue year ever. Second, 2022 was our most profitable year ever. Third, 2022 was our highest operational cash flow year ever. And fourth, we ended 2022 with more patients on our treprostinil medicines than ever before. I think you have to agree with me that these are fantastic results. And now I'd like to give a few indications of why I think that as great as these results are, they are not laurels for us to rest upon but instead a launching pad for yet greater results in 2023, 2024 and 2025. In fact, the patient uptake of our new Tyvaso DPI medicine has been so rapid that we can project a doubling of our revenues by 2025. This doubling of revenues is helped by the unique nature of each of our medicines including Tyvaso DPI. For example, Tyvaso DPI is the only inhaled treprostinil product that enables deep lung penetration via high-resistance low-flow device. Another example, our Remodulin product is the only parenteral prostacyclin delivered by the small, easy, super accurate Remunity device. The differentiated aspects of Remodulin has allowed us revenues to remain steady at about $0.5 billion a year through the past 3 years running. Our Orenitram product is also very unique because it is the only titratable oral prostacyclin product. We currently expect it's 1/3 of $1 billion a year revenue to continue growing as physicians become aware of the results of our recently released EXPEDITE study. That study showed Remodulin patients can be switched directly to Orenitram. And Orenitram will soon be joined by new products from our pipeline. In the field of pulmonary arterial hypertension, we expect to complete our Phase III trials of ralinepag by 2025. That will enable the first once-daily dosing of a prostacyclin pill in the pulmonary hypertension field. In the field of pulmonary fibrosis, we expect to complete our Phase III trials of Tyvaso by 2025 as well. That will, we hope, create the first disease-modifying treatment for pulmonary fibrosis, a true landmark in the field. And in the area of transplantation we hope to commence clinical trials of manufactured organs within the next few years. That would be a major contribution to ending so many deaths on the organ transplant list and unfortunately, even more deaths from end-stage organ disease off the transplant list. In summary, our business, our patient count, our pipeline is growing longer and faster than ever before. 2022 marked the continuation of that growth factor into 2023. We have achieved a very nice balance of growth and strength. We intend to continue building on this platform in the years to come. To provide now some additional, very median I think, extremely exciting details of how we are continuing to build on this platform, I'd like to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Benkowitz. Mike? Michael, thank you so much for providing that wealth of detailed information supporting this great growth vector we have going here from 2022 into 2023, '24, '25. Operator, feel free to open up the lines to any questions now. Yes. Thank you, Jess, and good morning. Good to hear your voice this morning. Generally, we try to like limit to one question for questioner because there are so many people in queue. But because your two questions are in a sense kind of like a tag team question, one way close into the next, Mike, I'll kind of ask if you can handle both questions. Those are great answers. Jess, one just additional shade of color I could add on top of Mike's remarks with regard to your question as to what kind of parameters can I provide to provide greater assurance about the doubling of revenues by the end of '25 is the uptake of Tyvaso DPI has been dramatic. And as Mike mentioned, he provided some metrics, for example, the very high number of selexipag prescribers who have not previously prescribed on Tyvaso now prescribing Tyvaso DPI. So when we achieve the doubling of our patients on Tyvaso over a period of just 18 months, I can't really overemphasize what an important metric that is. Just to give you kind of a sense, Tyvaso was approved 10 years ago. So it took like 10 years to get up to a certain level of patient penetration for this drug and then in under two years, it doubles. I mean that's -- it's an unmistakable sign in addition to the steps that Mike shared with you that this product is going to penetrate very, very rapidly. Now while one might think that in an area such as PH Group III, which has been penetrated by no pulmonary hypertension medicines like, oh, these are all just like people dying of thirst and just going to just slap up this new medicine right away, the reality in a disease like pulmonary hypertension is that it just doesn't happen like that. Instead, it's a very kind of blocking and tackling exercise of physician by physician, center by center working through all of the rigorous of talking to the right payers and getting the payers to understand the right procedures and going through all the procedures and the pre-approval, diagnoses, requirements, the catheterizations and all of these things. So while we did create like special teams focused on PH Group III before we launched into that indication, in the field of pulmonary hypertension, one year of kind of preparation is sort of like nothing compared to how much activity is needed to build a bulk of patients. So now that one year is more than two years behind us, we've now had a year of actual practice, okay, you can actually put these patients on medicines. As Mike referred to, the payer aspects, especially with regard to Medicare, we're just very, very recently resolved favorably in our direction. And so the -- it's just you have to like first have not just one year and not just like there wasn't like a waiting bolus of patients in Group III just waiting for a launch, you have to like develop this market and really kind of till the soil for a number of years. We've now done that, and we're experienced in those clinics and it's this reason why we think out of those 30,000 PH Group III patients. Fortunately, none of them have been touched by pulmonary hypertension treatment that we can rapidly grow our numbers of patients at the same rate that we've been growing them for the past year with this doubling of the number of patients on Tyvaso and thereby reach a number of total treprostinil patients, something that would be in the 20,000 that would correlate when you multiply that times the reimbursement per patient to the $4 billion per year. And of course, it's important. In addition to this, not to be losing revenue from Remodulin or Orenitram. But not only are we not losing revenue, we're solidifying our hold on the Remodulin revenues as Mike referred to the very rapid penetration that the Remunity pump has made and we're growing our revenues in Remodulin -- in Orenitram as a result of the EXPEDITE study that Mike described. So we feel that doubling revenues in three years is really a very doable too. Operator, next question, please? Sure. Mike, would you like to take that? Thank you, Mike. That's so nice to hear. Record January referrals after a record year, fantastic. Next question, please. Sure, Dr. Singh, so happy to hear your voice this morning, and thank you for asking a science question. We love those questions best of all. We have on our call, Dr. Leigh Peterson, and she is our Chief Scientist for the program, and she's also running the TETON clinical trials. People often wonder why they are named TETON, and it's because Dr. Peterson is from Wyoming. So it makes perfect sense. And Leigh, if you could provide Hartaj with some of the scientific reasons why we feel very confident that the Phase III trials of Tyvaso in IPF are rightly sized and that the endpoints are rightly chosen. Well, thank you so much, Leigh. And I just want to and toot your horn just for a moment to the hundreds of people on the call that there was similar skepticism as to whether or not Tyvaso could work in Group III patients and you proved that it could. And I believe your results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. So congratulations again. Next caller, please. Thank you, Ash. Thank you for that question. Fortunately, we have our Chief Financial Officer, on the phone, James Edgemond. And James, if you could perhaps help Ash with the inventory question. Thank you, James. Operator, next question please. Yes. Thanks for the question. So it's really like super speculative to provide any kind of a meaningful answer to the question because we don't know what the regulatory time frame is going to be for sotatercept. So it's all but impossible to give you any kind of accurate sense. I will say that our revenue forecast is agnostic with regard to whether or not sotatercept is approved or not. In other words, we will remain confident about achieving the doubling of our revenues by 2025 without regard to its launch. There -- it's a very large and diversely treated patient population. Changes in treatment patterns are relatively slow and cautious especially other than frontline treatments such as like ETRAs or PD5s. So I'd be very, very skeptical that you would see an impact of sotatercept on United Therapeutics revenue profile or product uptake across the board, whether it's Remodulin, Tyvaso, Tyvaso DPI or Orenitram. More broadly, the experience has been that when new agents have been introduced into the market, it has grown the market for all of the existing patients. It's kind of like a market growth thing. You saw this with, for example, back in the day when we launched Remodulin and J&J's precursor Actelion launched bosentan, the treprostinil revenues did not shrink. In fact, they grew and then later on, when PD5s were introduced, the market for ETRAs, and treprostinil did not shrink. In fact, it grew, it grew quite a bit. And this has been just a continuous process, and it harkens back to the landmark number that you should keep in your mind that Michael Benkowitz mentioned in his remarks was 50,000, that's 5-0 thousand. That's the number of patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. And all of these drugs have just like scratched the surface of being able to really treat the patients and get them back to a New York Heart Association Functional Class I or even Functional Class II level. So there is so much robust room for growth and improvement in pulmonary hypertension. We at United Therapeutics, welcome any new agent that can help the health of the pulmonary hypertension patient population. And by the way, all that is with respect to WHO Group I pulmonary hypertension. So everything I just said, then you've got this other huge pool that Dr. Peterson opened up with her New England Journal article, WHO Group III, 30,000 patients, that's 3-0 thousand, of which the only approved treatment right now is our Tyvaso drug. And I think sotatercept, I would love to see another good drug to help people with pulmonary hypertension. I don't think it's going to have any effect on our revenue growth. Next question, operator, and we'll have to cut it after that due to coming to the end of time. A very good question. Mike, can you give us our final answer on the call? Thank you, Mike. Well, to wrap up the call, we are tremendously excited about 2022. This is the year that we hit our $2 billion revenue run rate that has been our goal for really much of the past several years. And we are even more jazzed and more pumped by the fact that the $2 billion level, makes it very clear to us that $4 billion is achievable with all of the products that we are currently marketing and explaining to physicians, the scientific and medical benefits of. And then beyond that, as Hartaj indicated in his question, we have a whole another slew of type -- of products coming out of our Phase III pipeline, particularly a whole new disease indication, pulmonary fibrosis and then on top of that, a best-in-class treatment for pulmonary hypertension, which would be Ralinepag. So 2022 was amazing, a huge kudos to everybody on the team for achieving it. 2023 is looking even better. And with that, operator, you can close out the call."

One is Michael addressed and talked about the Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI ordering patterns in his prepared remarks. And I think if you look at B as part of the answer, the other products there was no unusual ordering or inventory activity and our specialty pharmaceutical distributors were in line with their contractual requirements on inventory.

All participants on the call portion of the webcast will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of this earnings call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the webcast over to Dewey Steadman, Head of Investor Relations at United Therapeutics.\nDewey Sedman: Good morning. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to the United Therapeutics Corporation third quarter 2022 earnings webcast. Accompanying me on today’s call are Dr. Martine Rothblatt, our Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer; James Edgemond, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Pat Poisson, our Executive Vice President of Technical Operations; and Dr. Leigh Peterson, our Senior Vice President of Product Development. Remarks today will include forward-looking statements representing our expectations or beliefs regarding future events. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Our latest SEC filings, including Forms 10-K and 10-Q, contain additional information on these risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements. After today’s remarks may discuss the progress and results of clinical trials or other developments with respect to our products. These remarks are intended solely to educate investors and are not intended to serve as the basis for medical decision-making or to suggest that any products are safe and effective for any unapproved or investigational uses. A full prescribing information for these products are available on our website. Now, I’ll turn the webcast over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of the third quarter 2022 financial results and business activities of United Therapeutics. Martine?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Dewey. Good morning, everyone. Currently, we are helping about 12,000 patients, including over 10,000 treprostinil patients, a high mark for our company. And we are making great progress on our goal of 25/25, meaning helping 25,000 patients by the year 2025. Now, achieving that goal will require annual growth in patient adds per quarter. Over the past year, we have increased our patient adds per quarter by about 66% from our historic rate of around 300 per quarter in 2021 to around 500 per quarter in 2022. Of course, there are monthly ups and downs and quarterly variability, but maintaining even half our current growth rate for the next three years seems eminently doable and will allow us to nail 25,000 patients by 2025. Further supporting the achievability of continued growth in quarterly patient add rate is that we have really just begun with multiple new products and new product information. For example, we have just started our Remunity relaunch. We have just released our EXPEDITE top line results for Orenitram, and we have just commenced our WHO Group 3 penetration of ILD with Tyvaso. Then on top of all of this, we are at the very beginning stages of a truly warm embrace by physicians, patients, and payers of Tyvaso DPI. Hence, with three years to go to 2025 and a 30,000 patient Group 3 market waiting to be penetrated with Tyvaso. We feel confident that year-after-year we can increase our quarterly patient adds at the rate needed to meet our announced goals. Now, upon getting even close to 25/25, we expect our revenues will be about double what they are now, since right now we have about half that number of patients. I believe that level of double PAH revenues will be sustainable well into the 2030s due to our expected launch of once daily ralinepag and continued patient focused improvements in delivery systems and in protocols for Remunity, Tyvaso and Orenitram. Now, on top of all of that, we expect soon after 2025 a successful outcome of our two TETON Phase 3 trials in pulmonary fibrosis, also known as IPF. That new indication for us with about a 100,000 U.S. patients will enable our revenues to grow so rapidly that by the end of this decade, I expect our IPF revenues will actually be even greater than our PAH revenues. In other words, by around 2030, I’d expect to see something like a 60/40 split of $10 billion in revenues between IPF and PAH. Meanwhile, I believe this past year we have proven that genetically modified xenografts and lab cellularized organ scaffolds are practically doable. These achievements are the technology from which we plan to produce an unlimited supply of hearts, lungs, and kidneys. We will use the next few years of rapid growth in PAH and IPF revenues to flesh out the numerous aspects of turning our technological accomplishments into the preclinical, clinical and commercial manufacturing precursors of an exciting new transplant business. As our PAH revenues start to plateau in the 2030s, we should be ready to ship thousands of life saving manufactured organs each year. In summary, UT has a pragmatic step-by-step business plan of evermore unique and important products that produce evermore value for patients, physicians, and payers. Furthermore, this business is resilient against generic products due to our unique drug delivery technologies, and it is resilient against MCE [ph] such as sotatercept or existing drugs such as nintedanib or pirfenidone due to our additive or therapy stacking approach to treatment. We all feel extraordinarily fortunate to work at UT for multi-year goals, as is evidence by industry leading retention rates and multiple best places to work awards. With that high level overview, let me now turn things over to our President, Mike Benkowitz, for a whole raft of really great news. Mike?\nMichael Benkowitz: Thanks, Martine, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we’re extremely pleased with our third quarter commercial performance. We set a number of records on an overall and product-by-product basis during the quarter. But I want to highlight three of these milestones that we’re particularly excited about. First, for the last couple of quarters, we have been saying that we’re effectively at a $2 billion revenue run rate. In the third quarter, our total revenues crossed $500 million for the first time in our history, which puts us in fact on a $2 billion run rate. Second, as Martine mentioned, we exceeded 10,000 U.S. patients and approached 12,000 patients worldwide on one of our treprostinil therapies, Tyvaso, Tyvaso DPI, Remodulin, and Orenitram. Finally, Tyvaso revenues exceeded $250 million for the quarter, which puts that product on a $1 billion annual revenue run rate. As many of you know, a drug that generates $1 billion in annual sales is widely considered to be a “blockbuster product.” So the first – for the first time in the United Therapeutics history, we have a product that has reached blockbuster status, at least on a run rate basis. These results are due to the efforts of our commercial and medical affairs teams who have been working hard all year, but have been particularly effective the last two quarters to help get us to this point. Now, I’ll provide a little bit of color at the product level, starting with Tyvaso. As I said, we reported a really strong quarter for Tyvaso, which was driven by a number of factors. First, the third quarter was our first full quarter with CMS or Medicare coverage for patients with PH-ILD, so that prescribing obstacle has been removed. Second, our continuing efforts to educate prescribers, particularly those ILD specialists, to screen their ILD patients for PAH is having an impact. Third, we continue to grow our prescriber base. Since the beginning of 2021, the number of Tyvaso prescribers has grown by approximately 50%. And finally, the big driver was a launch of Tyvaso DPI. As a result of these things, we added 500 Tyvaso patients during the quarter. Regarding the Tyvaso DPI launch, physician engagement enthusiasm around this new product is extremely high. Often in the PAH space, we see and hear enthusiasm around a new product launch, but it takes some time for that to translate into referrals, which is our term for prescriptions and then patient starts. Fortunately, the Tyvaso DPI launch has bucked that trend as referral activity has been very strong from the beginning. For some context, we’ve said in the past that we expect the patient mix between Tyvaso DPI and Tyvaso delivered via the TD-300 nebulizer to eventually settle out around 50/50 over time, while our Tyvaso new patient referral mix is already at around 50/50. Meanwhile, transitions from the TD-300 to DPI are occurring as expected. Also, while still very early, we’re really encouraged by the low discontinuation rate of patients using Tyvaso DPI as compared to other prostacyclin class therapies. Turning to Remodulin. In the third quarter, we saw continuation of the strong referral patterns we’ve seen throughout 2022 and relative resilience and stability of the business, despite the availability of generic competitors. The relaunch of the Remunity pump is proceeding well, and we expect Remunity starts and total patients on Remunity to grow over the balance of the year and into 2023. In September, we launched a patient filled version of Remunity pump that complements our pre-filled pharmacy distribution option. The patient filled option is being introduced for patients who prefer to fill their own cassettes and receive Remodulin shipments on a monthly basis rather than weekly shipments of pre-filled cassettes. Offering both pre-filled and patient filled options is expected to broaden and accelerate uptake for the Remunity pump. Continued adoption of the Remunity pump is becoming increasingly important to ensure that PAH patients do not experience a delay or disruption in their Remodulin therapy. One of the prior pumps used for subcutaneous Remodulin delivery, the Smiths Medical CADD-MS 3 pump was discontinued by the manufacturer in 2015. At that time, United Therapeutics funded the manufacturer of several thousand additional pumps, and in parallel pursued development of the Remunity pump to ensure Remodulin and patients would have a pump for their therapy. Earlier this year, we sold our remaining inventory of CADD-MS 3 pumps to our specialty pharmacy partners and hospitals. And it is our understanding that the available inventory of MS 3 pumps at those specialty pharmacy partners and in hospitals for both the pumps that we funded, as well as other MS 3 pumps that may have been on the market is winding down. Fortunately, the Remunity pump is on the market and available as an alternative for subcutaneous Remodulin patients. Moving to Orenitram. We released top line data from the recent Phase IV EXPEDITE study investigating the rapid titration and transition of functional Class 2 and Class 3 PAH patients from Remodulin to Orenitram. This study demonstrated that with this treatment approach, a patient can reach a therapeutic dose of Orenitram faster, and with fewer side effects than starting de novo. Over the long term, we expect Orenitram will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio and the PAH treatment armamentarium in patients that either prefer oral medications have failed on Tyvaso, or want to transition from Remodulin after the right ventricular function has normalized. The EXPEDITE protocol provides physicians with a roadmap to effectively use Orenitram in these patients. To wrap up, as many of you know, we established a goal last year to double the number of Tyvaso patients from 3,000 to around 6,000 by the end of 2022. We established this goal to address questions around and to frame the existence of one PH-ILD market, two, the size of that market, and three, how quickly we could tap into it. As at the end of October, we have around 5,600 patients on Tyvaso. We added – more than 250 patients in October alone. Specialty pharmacy has around 500 pending referrals for new patients that are making their way through the insurance approval process and then can be scheduled for patient start. Those 500 referrals exclude referrals to transition from the TD-300 Tyvaso DPI. Our average monthly Tyvaso referrals in each of the last three months are around 75% greater than the average monthly referrals pre DPI launch. I’m sure that might that may drop in November, December with holidays, but they should remain above the pre DPI average. So I think it’s fair to say today we’re demonstrating that there is a PH-ILD market, and we’ve tapped into it relatively quickly. Thus, the objectives of setting the 6,000 patient goal have been accomplished. Typically, the fourth quarter can be a little challenging for us because of the holidays, which reduces selling days, clinician days, and shipping days. Not to mention that new patients, especially once we get between Thanksgiving and Christmas, sometimes choose to delay therapy initiation until after the holidays. Having said that, and based on the stats that I just provided, we’re well positioned as it relates to our goal of around 6,000 patients – 6,000 Tyvaso patients by the end of the year, and we’re continuing to build really good momentum heading into next year. So with that, I’ll turn the call over to Martine to lead the Q&A session.\nMartine Rothblatt: Mike, that was a raft of really great news. So I was totally accurate than that to tee up, I'll say. [ph] Operator, would you please open up the phone lines for any questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eun Yang with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nEun Yang: Thank you. Great quarter. So if I hold you correctly, you added additional 500 patients to Tyvaso this quarter. That’s the same number as in the second quarter, but sales are a lot higher, because I guess it’s according to your comment DPI patients got on pretty early on. But at the same time, given, the tremendous sales growth in quarter-over-quarter, is it fair to assume that patients get on Tyvaso, so that DPI, would that be more from the new patients instead of a switcher from nebulizer? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Oh, thank you, Eun. We appreciate your question and Mike, I think you got the most context to answer.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Yes. I think on the revenue, I think the other thing to keep in mind in terms of comparing the number of patient adds versus the revenue growth is that in the third quarter the vast majority of those patients were commercial patients, whereas in Q1 and Q2, we did not have the CMS coverage. So you still had a number of patients that were going through our patient assistance program are receiving free drugs. So, again, those patients will stay in there through the end of the year and start to transition to commercial drug after the first of the year. But that I think, explains some of the difference in the revenue between Q2, Q3, even though the patient adds were about the same. In terms of the DPI – in terms of the patients coming on, I will say that the DPI uptake, the uptakes have been faster on de novo than transitions, and I think that’s just a function of as we’re out talking with physicians they’re not proactively calling their existing Tyvaso patients and to transition them to DPI. They’re just waiting for the next regular scheduled appointment. And so, as I said in my opening remarks, those transitions are occurring. They’re just going to – they’re going to occur over a little bit of time as physicians are waiting for the patients to come in for their next appointment.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect, Mike. Perfect. Thank you. Operator, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.\nHartaj Singh: Great. Thank you. Really nice update all. Thanks, Martine. Just one question. I was lucky enough to be at European Respiratory Society in Barcelona a few weeks ago, and it was interesting to hear some of the excitement around the DPI pump. I mean, you have essentially a third generation pump, there second or I guess, versus potential competitors that could launch on the market whenever, whether it’s this year or next year or the year after that. But can you just speak to that a little bit about how advanced the DPI pump is and why that should be a competitive advantage regardless of competition in the future? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much Hartaj. It’s so great to hear your voice right at the top of the call. And I am not surprised that you would be at the ERS, you are the person in the industry who’s got I think, nobody above them in terms of your going into the deep scientific research at all of the different medical conferences. But in terms of the details of answering your question, I think maybe again, Mike I might ask you to hit on that since you’ve really shepherded that DPI along the way.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Happy to. So I think, we agree with you Hartaj. We do think that the DPI does position us well against any current or future competitors. Certainly, I think the convenience the size the fact that it’s one breath four times a day instead of nine to 12 provides, again, a convenience advantage over the nebulizer. So, that certainly helps in that regard. And then I think as we get into looking at potentially other competitors for DPI that come on the market, I think there’s a couple things that work in our favor. One is, one, just I think the – just the United Therapeutics support services, the fact that we’ve been in the market for 25 years, Physicians know us, they know that we’re committed to the patients. I mean, that stuff, that actually matters to physicians. And then as it relates to the pump, I mean, one of the things that we’re particularly proud of and think is really a good thing for patients is that the DPI is what we call a low flow high resistance device. And so that may sound a little counter intuitive, but that’s actually an advantage because with a low flow, high resistance device, you’re relying more on the pump to do the work and less on the patient. So what that does it means that a strong breath is not required to deliver a consistent dose to the distal airways. It’s only one breath per cartridge in under three seconds. And it allows the device to deliver the drug more efficiently. So target dose of Tyvaso nine to 12 breaths. That’s equal to about 54 micrograms to 72 micrograms via the nebulizer. Tyvaso DPI delivers that same equivalent dose with 48 micrograms to 64 micrograms. So it’s actually takes less drug to deliver the same amount of drug. And it also ensures that the delivery that the medications delivered evenly in the airways, as I said and deep into the lung. So, we do think that combined with just kind of the easy kind of open load inhaled administration positions us very well in the marketplace.\nMartine Rothblatt: Totally. Perfect response, very insightful question. Operator, next up?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a two part for me on Tyvaso. So I was wondering if you can tell us anything about the current Medicare mix. I think in some real world studies in ILD, it’s about 50% of patients overall would be eligible. So just wondering if you’re seeing something similar there. And then, if that will as we think about kind of the step up and coverage in 2023, maybe you could speak through that Mike. And then just wondering any early read on the duration of therapy with Tyvaso for PH-ILD and how that compares or how that you expect that to compare to the PAH setting? Thank you so much.\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes, sure. So the first question on the Medicare, on the mix of Medicare and commercial, that’s essentially what we see is it’s roughly a 50/50 mix and it varies month to month, but I think 50/50 is a good to kind of model off of. In terms of what to expect next year with respect to the Medicare patients that are in our patient assistance program transitioning to commercial. So as of right now, I think we have around 700 patients to 800 patients in our PAT [ph] program that are PH-ILD patients with Medicare insurance. So we think a majority, probably not all, but a majority of those will transition over beginning in Q1. So that’ll obviously, I think help from a revenue standpoint as we head into next year. What was the second part of the question?\nTerence Flynn: Duration of therapy for ILD?\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes, I think, yes, sorry. So on duration of therapy, it’s I think it’s still a little early to tell. I would say early on what we were seeing is I think that physicians were taking their I would say their more advanced stage patients transitioning over to – putting them on Tyvaso. They weren’t staying on as long. I think as the physicians are starting to understand the increased data better, understand how to use Tyvaso, understand how to dose, particularly in the newer treaters that’s starting to improve. So it’s still really, I think, too early to tell whether there’s a distinct difference between PAH patients and ILD patients, because I think, again, we’re still sort of I think, kind of ramping up these ILD treaters on when’s the right time to put these patients on Tyvaso. So I think that’ll play out over time. We would – we’re sort of expecting that once the dust settles, it’s going to be roughly the same.\nMartine Rothblatt: Great. Mike, thank you very much. Terence, great to hear your new platform there at Morgan Stanley. Operator, next call?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Thome with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.\nJoseph Thome: Hi, there. Good morning. Congrats on the progress, and thank you for taking my question. In terms of penetration into that PH-ILD market, now that Medicare is behind us, is it really just patient identification that is key here? Or if there are any physicians that do have identified PH-ILD patients, maybe what are they waiting for before placing their patients on Tyvaso? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes, very interesting question Joe, and Mike will be able to address it. But just as a tee up as, Mike’s gathering his thoughts here, just to mention that we are talking about 30,000 patients in this ILD market. It is almost like PAH was reborn as ILD. But from the standpoint of United Therapeutics, it’s actually a lot better, because while there are, I’ve actually lost track of how many drugs are approved for PAH 12, as a reasonable guess, 14, almost none of them can be used in ILD because of the very real problem of V/Q mismatch, which I was talking with a physician the other day and they were telling me directly that one time for a patient who they were trying to transplant and gave them a little bit of [indiscernible] to try to help bring down their pressures before transplant saw horrible V/Q mismatch right away, when to inhaled prostacyclin and were able to successfully bridge the patient over to transplant. So V/Q mismatch is a horrible problem. So that basically eliminates all these systemic drugs, either oral or parenteral from the story of penetrating these 30,000 patients. Now due to the amazing work of Dr. Peterson and her team who are on the call and produce the stellar increase results demonstrating the strong safety and efficacy of Tyvaso for ILD. And then you couple that with the wisdom of the FDA in enabling, whether it’s nebulized Tyvaso or DPI to be used in ILD. You have like just a very sweet situation from a pharmaceutical company standpoint of being able to rapidly help upwards of 30,000 patients who were had no previous treatment whatsoever. And this is why you heard the astounding numbers Mike was giving in terms of quarterly and monthly adds, and the big step up that we’ve had from 21 to 22, why very conservatively, we think that that kind of step up averaged across 23 and then average across 24 and average across 25 will sync up with what we need to achieve 25/25. So basically everything is in the right place and it’s up to us to execute expertly. And Mike, maybe if you can just give a few insights on our execution there.\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes, sure. So I don’t think it’s the case that you’ve got physicians that have diagnosed their patients with their ILD patients with pulmonary hypertension and are just sitting back and not prescribing Tyvaso. I think the name of the game here is actually screening for pulmonary hypertension. And in my opening remarks, I made a comment about the fact that typically when you have a new product or a new indication, there’s a lot of enthusiasm, but then it just kind of takes time for kind of traction to build. And we haven’t seen that with DPI, but I think PH-ILD is probably an example of the norm where there’s a lot of enthusiasm, but then actual call to action and getting people to move and change behaviors has been, I mean, it’s been good. It’s probably been a little bit slower than what we would have expected. But it’s starting to happen. And I think part of that in the case of PH-ILD is the fact that you’ve got, particularly with these ILD treaters there’s this term that I continue to hear called like therapeutic nihilism. So these are like typically really, really sick patient, and I think the doctors are really just unless the patients are going to get a transplant there, their long-term outcome is not good. So there’s this behavior modification, behavior shift that we have to undertake and execute with these doctors to educate them on the fact that the prognosis for these patients, if they have pulmonary hypertension, is like twice as worse than if they just have ILD. That’s sort of the first thing. And then the second thing is that we have an indication to treat the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension and so we’re starting to – we’re starting, we have been making inroads there. I think we’re – there’s still a lot of opportunity ahead of us. I do think at some point, and I’m not sure what the quarterly patient number is, but there’s got to be a tipping point here where I think the floodgates are going to open, as these ILD treaters become more accustom to screening their patients. And then once the patients are started on Tyvaso, they see the benefits. And I think once that happens, like I said, I think we’re going to see just a – I think another kind of step function in our growth.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect, Mike. Thank you so much. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJessica Fye: Hey guys. Good morning. Great results today. Martine, at the beginning of the call, you were talking about your expectation for quarterly patient adds, even if they were sort of half of what they’ve been in 2022 to put you on track for your long-term targets. I guess in the near to medium term, do you see those adds as largely Tyvaso driven? And maybe just kind of a housekeeping question, beyond the 4Q factors you mentioned like the holidays, were there any favorable ordering patterns in the third quarter that helped the Tyvaso number that we should keep in mind when trying to project 4Q revenue? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes, thanks Jessica, great to hear your voice this morning. And also once again, just want to having the chance to talk with you here on the call. Thank you for JPMorgan inviting us to speak at the major event that you had in New York honoring women entrepreneurs and women in business and focusing on the importance of that and pass on our thanks to Jamie Dimon. It was really exciting to be with him there at that conference. So, going on to the particulars of your question, I do believe that I’ll answer like the first part, and Mike, if you can answer the second part. So I do believe that Tyvaso will be the big driver of this growth that we anticipate in quarterly adds during 2023, 2024 and 2025. However, as I mentioned my opening remarks, we do also believe there will be contributions from our other products. And at one time, it might have seemed like hopeful thinking that Tyvaso could become a blockbuster. I think we’re there and we’ll continue to grow on that. Right now, it might seem a little bit hopeful to think that Orenitram could become a blockbuster. But with the type of results that you’re seeing in EXPEDITE and we have another even stronger study going on called ARTISAN, which will show the same sort of thing that physicians throughout the world. And you’ve seen these posters, no doubt that ERS and other conferences that physicians have shown that if they aggressively dose Remodulin over a short period of time, bring pulmonary artery pressures down below 35 millimeters of mercury, and then fast switch their patients to a high dose of oral equivalent prostacyclin that they are reporting pretty much like Kaplan-Meier survival level close to a 100% at 10 years and even 15 years out. So it’s like a way to manage pulmonary hypertension as a lifelong disease that you use Remodulin for a relatively short period of time, three months, six months, maybe up to a year. And then as EXPEDITE showed, we could fast switch the patients to double the dose of Orenitram that they were out on previously. And also they already acclimated to the process cycle and side effects this way from the parenteral experience. So now you get like the best of Orenitram right up front rather than the previous couple of years since launch, they had kind of the worst effects of Orenitram upfront and maybe gave up before they got to the best effects. So this is what I mean by the new prescribing data. With regard to Orenitram, I think, Orenitram will be also a major contributor, not as big as Tyvaso and not as big certainly as Tyvaso DPI. Tyvaso DPI is the star of the show. And that's why I say there was a warm embrace by physicians, patients payers, is going to be the star of the show. But very important, are like best supporting actress, best supporting actor, all of these people are very important too. And I also mentioned new delivery technologies that we're working on remodeling. Not enough time to go into all of those. But there are a lot of supporting actors and actresses that are going to get us to this 25 by 25. Mike, do you want to provide a little bit more granularity to the backend of this.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. So I think just to your second part of your question was just around any anomalies in quarterly patterns in Q3. Short answer is no. That's something that we try to manage pretty tightly because – I mean, yes, I think we've always talked about the fact that there is variability quarter-to-quarter. And that's true. And to a certain extent there is not a whole lot we can do about that. But we do try and track pretty closely with our specialty pharmacy what they are dispensing against what they are ordering. And so one of the metrics that I always kind of look at is what is the value of what we're selling to specialty pharmacy versus the value of what they are dispensing to patients. And so, generally speaking there is about a 5% to 10% difference and that can go either way. So it could be we're 5% higher on sales versus dispenses, or it could be we're 5% lower, than typically what we see as that smooths out over the course of 12 months or four quarters. So, in the third quarter we were kind of within that range. So, nothing unusual there in terms of dispenses and sales. So, anomalies there. And like I said, we continue to monitor that pretty closely because we do want to have – we want to minimize that variability.\nMartine Rothblatt: Awesome, awesome. Awesome. Are there time – Dewey says there is time for one more question and he is the boss. So next question, operator.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andreas Argyrides with Wedbush. Your line is open.\nAndreas Argyrides: Good morning and congrats on the quarter. And thanks Dewey for taking my question here. So taking a look, at the evolving PAH treatment landscape, how are you thinking about the commercial dynamics over the next several years between your treprostinil products and therapies with novel mechanism of action that could be coming onto the market in the near future? Thanks.\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes. So thanks for the question. And I referred to this a little bit in the opening remarks in that UT has a long taken what I would call a therapy stacking approach to our pharmacopedia if you will. We have a number of drugs and they help a lot of patients. But in most instances they are stacked on top of other drugs. And they are stacked on top of other drugs, first of all, because that's how we did the clinical trial. Now what we did is we showed our drugs had such an effect on top of background therapy. Why did we do it that way? Well, first of all, it's a lot easier to enroll a clinical trial on top of a background therapy, which is generally used. If you go in there and you say, there is a background therapy that's already approved and already generally used and you say you have got a clinical trial that the patients have to be naive to all therapy. So first of all, you have a little bit of an ethical issue. I'm not saying it's a definite, hard ethical issue, but I don't often get to say that my degree is in medical ethics, so I'm going to say it. So it is a little bit of a medical ethics issue that it's better to be able to show your treatment works on top of background therapy than to take a patient who has a bad disease. There are approved therapies and you kind of condemn them to placebo only. And what is really the beneficence of that for that patient. It's kind of hard to argue. So we've done Orenitram on top of background therapy and other companies, and for example, in our IPF trial we're on top of nintedanib and pirfenidone as background therapy. So other companies see the wisdom of this too. And a lot of the studies of sotatercept are also on top of background therapy. So I think this is the complexion of, of things in the future. Pulmonary hypertension is a multifactorial disease. There are at least six different pathological pathways that have been identified, plus a cyclin pathway, nitric oxide pathway, even serotonin pathways and thromboxane pathways. So all these different pathways. So when you have a multifactorial disease like this, it calls for a therapy stacking approach because different drugs can help address different pathways. I hope that's responsive to your question. And with that, Dewey, feel free to wrap up the call.\nDewey Sedman: Operator, can you go ahead and wrap up the call? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation’s earning webcast.

            "name": "Michael Benkowitz",
            "content": "Thanks, Martine, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our third quarter commercial performance. We set a number of records on an overall and product-by-product basis during the quarter. But I want to highlight three of these milestones that we're particularly excited about. First, for the last couple of quarters, we have been saying that we're effectively at a $2 billion revenue run rate. In the third quarter, our total revenues crossed $500 million for the first time in our history, which puts us in fact on a $2 billion run rate. Second, as Martine mentioned, we exceeded 10,000 U.S. patients and approached 12,000 patients worldwide on one of our treprostinil therapies, Tyvaso, Tyvaso DPI, Remodulin, and Orenitram. Finally, Tyvaso revenues exceeded $250 million for the quarter, which puts that product on a $1 billion annual revenue run rate. As many of you know, a drug that generates $1 billion in annual sales is widely considered to be a “blockbuster product.” So the first – for the first time in the United Therapeutics history, we have a product that has reached blockbuster status, at least on a run rate basis. These results are due to the efforts of our commercial and medical affairs teams who have been working hard all year, but have been particularly effective the last two quarters to help get us to this point. Now, I'll provide a little bit of color at the product level, starting with Tyvaso. As I said, we reported a really strong quarter for Tyvaso, which was driven by a number of factors. First, the third quarter was our first full quarter with CMS or Medicare coverage for patients with PH-ILD, so that prescribing obstacle has been removed. Second, our continuing efforts to educate prescribers, particularly those ILD specialists, to screen their ILD patients for PAH is having an impact. Third, we continue to grow our prescriber base. Since the beginning of 2021, the number of Tyvaso prescribers has grown by approximately 50%. And finally, the big driver was a launch of Tyvaso DPI. As a result of these things, we added 500 Tyvaso patients during the quarter. Regarding the Tyvaso DPI launch, physician engagement enthusiasm around this new product is extremely high. Often in the PAH space, we see and hear enthusiasm around a new product launch, but it takes some time for that to translate into referrals, which is our term for prescriptions and then patient starts. Fortunately, the Tyvaso DPI launch has bucked that trend as referral activity has been very strong from the beginning. For some context, we've said in the past that we expect the patient mix between Tyvaso DPI and Tyvaso delivered via the TD-300 nebulizer to eventually settle out around 50/50 over time, while our Tyvaso new patient referral mix is already at around 50/50. Meanwhile, transitions from the TD-300 to DPI are occurring as expected. Also, while still very early, we're really encouraged by the low discontinuation rate of patients using Tyvaso DPI as compared to other prostacyclin class therapies. Turning to Remodulin. In the third quarter, we saw continuation of the strong referral patterns we've seen throughout 2022 and relative resilience and stability of the business, despite the availability of generic competitors. The relaunch of the Remunity pump is proceeding well, and we expect Remunity starts and total patients on Remunity to grow over the balance of the year and into 2023. In September, we launched a patient filled version of Remunity pump that complements our pre-filled pharmacy distribution option. The patient filled option is being introduced for patients who prefer to fill their own cassettes and receive Remodulin shipments on a monthly basis rather than weekly shipments of pre-filled cassettes. Offering both pre-filled and patient filled options is expected to broaden and accelerate uptake for the Remunity pump. Continued adoption of the Remunity pump is becoming increasingly important to ensure that PAH patients do not experience a delay or disruption in their Remodulin therapy. One of the prior pumps used for subcutaneous Remodulin delivery, the Smiths Medical CADD-MS 3 pump was discontinued by the manufacturer in 2015. At that time, United Therapeutics funded the manufacturer of several thousand additional pumps, and in parallel pursued development of the Remunity pump to ensure Remodulin and patients would have a pump for their therapy. Earlier this year, we sold our remaining inventory of CADD-MS 3 pumps to our specialty pharmacy partners and hospitals. And it is our understanding that the available inventory of MS 3 pumps at those specialty pharmacy partners and in hospitals for both the pumps that we funded, as well as other MS 3 pumps that may have been on the market is winding down. Fortunately, the Remunity pump is on the market and available as an alternative for subcutaneous Remodulin patients. Moving to Orenitram. We released top line data from the recent Phase IV EXPEDITE study investigating the rapid titration and transition of functional Class 2 and Class 3 PAH patients from Remodulin to Orenitram. This study demonstrated that with this treatment approach, a patient can reach a therapeutic dose of Orenitram faster, and with fewer side effects than starting de novo. Over the long term, we expect Orenitram will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio and the PAH treatment armamentarium in patients that either prefer oral medications have failed on Tyvaso, or want to transition from Remodulin after the right ventricular function has normalized. The EXPEDITE protocol provides physicians with a roadmap to effectively use Orenitram in these patients. To wrap up, as many of you know, we established a goal last year to double the number of Tyvaso patients from 3,000 to around 6,000 by the end of 2022. We established this goal to address questions around and to frame the existence of one PH-ILD market, two, the size of that market, and three, how quickly we could tap into it. As at the end of October, we have around 5,600 patients on Tyvaso. We added – more than 250 patients in October alone. Specialty pharmacy has around 500 pending referrals for new patients that are making their way through the insurance approval process and then can be scheduled for patient start. Those 500 referrals exclude referrals to transition from the TD-300 Tyvaso DPI. Our average monthly Tyvaso referrals in each of the last three months are around 75% greater than the average monthly referrals pre DPI launch. I'm sure that might that may drop in November, December with holidays, but they should remain above the pre DPI average. So I think it's fair to say today we're demonstrating that there is a PH-ILD market, and we've tapped into it relatively quickly. Thus, the objectives of setting the 6,000 patient goal have been accomplished. Typically, the fourth quarter can be a little challenging for us because of the holidays, which reduces selling days, clinician days, and shipping days. Not to mention that new patients, especially once we get between Thanksgiving and Christmas, sometimes choose to delay therapy initiation until after the holidays. Having said that, and based on the stats that I just provided, we're well positioned as it relates to our goal of around 6,000 patients – 6,000 Tyvaso patients by the end of the year, and we're continuing to build really good momentum heading into next year. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Martine to lead the Q&A session. Sure. Yes. I think on the revenue, I think the other thing to keep in mind in terms of comparing the number of patient adds versus the revenue growth is that in the third quarter the vast majority of those patients were commercial patients, whereas in Q1 and Q2, we did not have the CMS coverage. So you still had a number of patients that were going through our patient assistance program are receiving free drugs. So, again, those patients will stay in there through the end of the year and start to transition to commercial drug after the first of the year. But that I think, explains some of the difference in the revenue between Q2, Q3, even though the patient adds were about the same. In terms of the DPI – in terms of the patients coming on, I will say that the DPI uptake, the uptakes have been faster on de novo than transitions, and I think that's just a function of as we're out talking with physicians they're not proactively calling their existing Tyvaso patients and to transition them to DPI. They're just waiting for the next regular scheduled appointment. And so, as I said in my opening remarks, those transitions are occurring. They're just going to – they're going to occur over a little bit of time as physicians are waiting for the patients to come in for their next appointment. Sure. Happy to. So I think, we agree with you Hartaj. We do think that the DPI does position us well against any current or future competitors. Certainly, I think the convenience the size the fact that it's one breath four times a day instead of nine to 12 provides, again, a convenience advantage over the nebulizer. So, that certainly helps in that regard. And then I think as we get into looking at potentially other competitors for DPI that come on the market, I think there's a couple things that work in our favor. One is, one, just I think the – just the United Therapeutics support services, the fact that we've been in the market for 25 years, Physicians know us, they know that we're committed to the patients. I mean, that stuff, that actually matters to physicians. And then as it relates to the pump, I mean, one of the things that we're particularly proud of and think is really a good thing for patients is that the DPI is what we call a low flow high resistance device. And so that may sound a little counter intuitive, but that's actually an advantage because with a low flow, high resistance device, you're relying more on the pump to do the work and less on the patient. So what that does it means that a strong breath is not required to deliver a consistent dose to the distal airways. It's only one breath per cartridge in under three seconds. And it allows the device to deliver the drug more efficiently. So target dose of Tyvaso nine to 12 breaths. That's equal to about 54 micrograms to 72 micrograms via the nebulizer. Tyvaso DPI delivers that same equivalent dose with 48 micrograms to 64 micrograms. So it's actually takes less drug to deliver the same amount of drug. And it also ensures that the delivery that the medications delivered evenly in the airways, as I said and deep into the lung. So, we do think that combined with just kind of the easy kind of open load inhaled administration positions us very well in the marketplace. Yes, sure. So the first question on the Medicare, on the mix of Medicare and commercial, that's essentially what we see is it's roughly a 50/50 mix and it varies month to month, but I think 50/50 is a good to kind of model off of. In terms of what to expect next year with respect to the Medicare patients that are in our patient assistance program transitioning to commercial. So as of right now, I think we have around 700 patients to 800 patients in our PAT [ph] program that are PH-ILD patients with Medicare insurance. So we think a majority, probably not all, but a majority of those will transition over beginning in Q1. So that'll obviously, I think help from a revenue standpoint as we head into next year. What was the second part of the question? Yes, I think, yes, sorry. So on duration of therapy, it's I think it's still a little early to tell. I would say early on what we were seeing is I think that physicians were taking their I would say their more advanced stage patients transitioning over to – putting them on Tyvaso. They weren't staying on as long. I think as the physicians are starting to understand the increased data better, understand how to use Tyvaso, understand how to dose, particularly in the newer treaters that's starting to improve. So it's still really, I think, too early to tell whether there's a distinct difference between PAH patients and ILD patients, because I think, again, we're still sort of I think, kind of ramping up these ILD treaters on when's the right time to put these patients on Tyvaso. So I think that'll play out over time. We would – we're sort of expecting that once the dust settles, it's going to be roughly the same. Yes, sure. So I don't think it's the case that you've got physicians that have diagnosed their patients with their ILD patients with pulmonary hypertension and are just sitting back and not prescribing Tyvaso. I think the name of the game here is actually screening for pulmonary hypertension. And in my opening remarks, I made a comment about the fact that typically when you have a new product or a new indication, there's a lot of enthusiasm, but then it just kind of takes time for kind of traction to build. And we haven't seen that with DPI, but I think PH-ILD is probably an example of the norm where there's a lot of enthusiasm, but then actual call to action and getting people to move and change behaviors has been, I mean, it's been good. It's probably been a little bit slower than what we would have expected. But it's starting to happen. And I think part of that in the case of PH-ILD is the fact that you've got, particularly with these ILD treaters there's this term that I continue to hear called like therapeutic nihilism. So these are like typically really, really sick patient, and I think the doctors are really just unless the patients are going to get a transplant there, their long-term outcome is not good. So there's this behavior modification, behavior shift that we have to undertake and execute with these doctors to educate them on the fact that the prognosis for these patients, if they have pulmonary hypertension, is like twice as worse than if they just have ILD. That's sort of the first thing. And then the second thing is that we have an indication to treat the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension and so we're starting to – we're starting, we have been making inroads there. I think we're – there's still a lot of opportunity ahead of us. I do think at some point, and I'm not sure what the quarterly patient number is, but there's got to be a tipping point here where I think the floodgates are going to open, as these ILD treaters become more accustom to screening their patients. And then once the patients are started on Tyvaso, they see the benefits. And I think once that happens, like I said, I think we're going to see just a – I think another kind of step function in our growth. Sure. So I think just to your second part of your question was just around any anomalies in quarterly patterns in Q3. Short answer is no. That's something that we try to manage pretty tightly because – I mean, yes, I think we've always talked about the fact that there is variability quarter-to-quarter. And that's true. And to a certain extent there is not a whole lot we can do about that. But we do try and track pretty closely with our specialty pharmacy what they are dispensing against what they are ordering. And so one of the metrics that I always kind of look at is what is the value of what we're selling to specialty pharmacy versus the value of what they are dispensing to patients. And so, generally speaking there is about a 5% to 10% difference and that can go either way. So it could be we're 5% higher on sales versus dispenses, or it could be we're 5% lower, than typically what we see as that smooths out over the course of 12 months or four quarters. So, in the third quarter we were kind of within that range. So, nothing unusual there in terms of dispenses and sales. So, anomalies there. And like I said, we continue to monitor that pretty closely because we do want to have – we want to minimize that variability. Yes. So thanks for the question. And I referred to this a little bit in the opening remarks in that UT has a long taken what I would call a therapy stacking approach to our pharmacopedia if you will. We have a number of drugs and they help a lot of patients. But in most instances they are stacked on top of other drugs. And they are stacked on top of other drugs, first of all, because that's how we did the clinical trial. Now what we did is we showed our drugs had such an effect on top of background therapy. Why did we do it that way? Well, first of all, it's a lot easier to enroll a clinical trial on top of a background therapy, which is generally used. If you go in there and you say, there is a background therapy that's already approved and already generally used and you say you have got a clinical trial that the patients have to be naive to all therapy. So first of all, you have a little bit of an ethical issue. I'm not saying it's a definite, hard ethical issue, but I don't often get to say that my degree is in medical ethics, so I'm going to say it. So it is a little bit of a medical ethics issue that it's better to be able to show your treatment works on top of background therapy than to take a patient who has a bad disease. There are approved therapies and you kind of condemn them to placebo only. And what is really the beneficence of that for that patient. It's kind of hard to argue. So we've done Orenitram on top of background therapy and other companies, and for example, in our IPF trial we're on top of nintedanib and pirfenidone as background therapy. So other companies see the wisdom of this too. And a lot of the studies of sotatercept are also on top of background therapy. So I think this is the complexion of, of things in the future. Pulmonary hypertension is a multifactorial disease. There are at least six different pathological pathways that have been identified, plus a cyclin pathway, nitric oxide pathway, even serotonin pathways and thromboxane pathways. So all these different pathways. So when you have a multifactorial disease like this, it calls for a therapy stacking approach because different drugs can help address different pathways. I hope that's responsive to your question. And with that, Dewey, feel free to wrap up the call."

            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thanks, Dewey. Good morning, everyone. Currently, we are helping about 12,000 patients, including over 10,000 treprostinil patients, a high mark for our company. And we are making great progress on our goal of 25/25, meaning helping 25,000 patients by the year 2025. Now, achieving that goal will require annual growth in patient adds per quarter. Over the past year, we have increased our patient adds per quarter by about 66% from our historic rate of around 300 per quarter in 2021 to around 500 per quarter in 2022. Of course, there are monthly ups and downs and quarterly variability, but maintaining even half our current growth rate for the next three years seems eminently doable and will allow us to nail 25,000 patients by 2025. Further supporting the achievability of continued growth in quarterly patient add rate is that we have really just begun with multiple new products and new product information. For example, we have just started our Remunity relaunch. We have just released our EXPEDITE top line results for Orenitram, and we have just commenced our WHO Group 3 penetration of ILD with Tyvaso. Then on top of all of this, we are at the very beginning stages of a truly warm embrace by physicians, patients, and payers of Tyvaso DPI. Hence, with three years to go to 2025 and a 30,000 patient Group 3 market waiting to be penetrated with Tyvaso. We feel confident that year-after-year we can increase our quarterly patient adds at the rate needed to meet our announced goals. Now, upon getting even close to 25/25, we expect our revenues will be about double what they are now, since right now we have about half that number of patients. I believe that level of double PAH revenues will be sustainable well into the 2030s due to our expected launch of once daily ralinepag and continued patient focused improvements in delivery systems and in protocols for Remunity, Tyvaso and Orenitram. Now, on top of all of that, we expect soon after 2025 a successful outcome of our two TETON Phase 3 trials in pulmonary fibrosis, also known as IPF. That new indication for us with about a 100,000 U.S. patients will enable our revenues to grow so rapidly that by the end of this decade, I expect our IPF revenues will actually be even greater than our PAH revenues. In other words, by around 2030, I'd expect to see something like a 60/40 split of $10 billion in revenues between IPF and PAH. Meanwhile, I believe this past year we have proven that genetically modified xenografts and lab cellularized organ scaffolds are practically doable. These achievements are the technology from which we plan to produce an unlimited supply of hearts, lungs, and kidneys. We will use the next few years of rapid growth in PAH and IPF revenues to flesh out the numerous aspects of turning our technological accomplishments into the preclinical, clinical and commercial manufacturing precursors of an exciting new transplant business. As our PAH revenues start to plateau in the 2030s, we should be ready to ship thousands of life saving manufactured organs each year. In summary, UT has a pragmatic step-by-step business plan of evermore unique and important products that produce evermore value for patients, physicians, and payers. Furthermore, this business is resilient against generic products due to our unique drug delivery technologies, and it is resilient against MCE [ph] such as sotatercept or existing drugs such as nintedanib or pirfenidone due to our additive or therapy stacking approach to treatment. We all feel extraordinarily fortunate to work at UT for multi-year goals, as is evidence by industry leading retention rates and multiple best places to work awards. With that high level overview, let me now turn things over to our President, Mike Benkowitz, for a whole raft of really great news. Mike? Mike, that was a raft of really great news. So I was totally accurate than that to tee up, I'll say. [ph] Operator, would you please open up the phone lines for any questions? Oh, thank you, Eun. We appreciate your question and Mike, I think you got the most context to answer. Perfect, Mike. Perfect. Thank you. Operator, we are ready for the next question. Thank you so much Hartaj. It's so great to hear your voice right at the top of the call. And I am not surprised that you would be at the ERS, you are the person in the industry who's got I think, nobody above them in terms of your going into the deep scientific research at all of the different medical conferences. But in terms of the details of answering your question, I think maybe again, Mike I might ask you to hit on that since you've really shepherded that DPI along the way. Totally. Perfect response, very insightful question. Operator, next up? Great. Mike, thank you very much. Terence, great to hear your new platform there at Morgan Stanley. Operator, next call? Yes, very interesting question Joe, and Mike will be able to address it. But just as a tee up as, Mike's gathering his thoughts here, just to mention that we are talking about 30,000 patients in this ILD market. It is almost like PAH was reborn as ILD. But from the standpoint of United Therapeutics, it's actually a lot better, because while there are, I've actually lost track of how many drugs are approved for PAH 12, as a reasonable guess, 14, almost none of them can be used in ILD because of the very real problem of V/Q mismatch, which I was talking with a physician the other day and they were telling me directly that one time for a patient who they were trying to transplant and gave them a little bit of [indiscernible] to try to help bring down their pressures before transplant saw horrible V/Q mismatch right away, when to inhaled prostacyclin and were able to successfully bridge the patient over to transplant. So V/Q mismatch is a horrible problem. So that basically eliminates all these systemic drugs, either oral or parenteral from the story of penetrating these 30,000 patients. Now due to the amazing work of Dr. Peterson and her team who are on the call and produce the stellar increase results demonstrating the strong safety and efficacy of Tyvaso for ILD. And then you couple that with the wisdom of the FDA in enabling, whether it's nebulized Tyvaso or DPI to be used in ILD. You have like just a very sweet situation from a pharmaceutical company standpoint of being able to rapidly help upwards of 30,000 patients who were had no previous treatment whatsoever. And this is why you heard the astounding numbers Mike was giving in terms of quarterly and monthly adds, and the big step up that we've had from 21 to 22, why very conservatively, we think that that kind of step up averaged across 23 and then average across 24 and average across 25 will sync up with what we need to achieve 25/25. So basically everything is in the right place and it's up to us to execute expertly. And Mike, maybe if you can just give a few insights on our execution there. Perfect, Mike. Thank you so much. Operator, next question, please? Yes, thanks Jessica, great to hear your voice this morning. And also once again, just want to having the chance to talk with you here on the call. Thank you for JPMorgan inviting us to speak at the major event that you had in New York honoring women entrepreneurs and women in business and focusing on the importance of that and pass on our thanks to Jamie Dimon. It was really exciting to be with him there at that conference. So, going on to the particulars of your question, I do believe that I'll answer like the first part, and Mike, if you can answer the second part. So I do believe that Tyvaso will be the big driver of this growth that we anticipate in quarterly adds during 2023, 2024 and 2025. However, as I mentioned my opening remarks, we do also believe there will be contributions from our other products. And at one time, it might have seemed like hopeful thinking that Tyvaso could become a blockbuster. I think we're there and we'll continue to grow on that. Right now, it might seem a little bit hopeful to think that Orenitram could become a blockbuster. But with the type of results that you're seeing in EXPEDITE and we have another even stronger study going on called ARTISAN, which will show the same sort of thing that physicians throughout the world. And you've seen these posters, no doubt that ERS and other conferences that physicians have shown that if they aggressively dose Remodulin over a short period of time, bring pulmonary artery pressures down below 35 millimeters of mercury, and then fast switch their patients to a high dose of oral equivalent prostacyclin that they are reporting pretty much like Kaplan-Meier survival level close to a 100% at 10 years and even 15 years out. So it's like a way to manage pulmonary hypertension as a lifelong disease that you use Remodulin for a relatively short period of time, three months, six months, maybe up to a year. And then as EXPEDITE showed, we could fast switch the patients to double the dose of Orenitram that they were out on previously. And also they already acclimated to the process cycle and side effects this way from the parenteral experience. So now you get like the best of Orenitram right up front rather than the previous couple of years since launch, they had kind of the worst effects of Orenitram upfront and maybe gave up before they got to the best effects. So this is what I mean by the new prescribing data. With regard to Orenitram, I think, Orenitram will be also a major contributor, not as big as Tyvaso and not as big certainly as Tyvaso DPI. Tyvaso DPI is the star of the show. And that's why I say there was a warm embrace by physicians, patients payers, is going to be the star of the show. But very important, are like best supporting actress, best supporting actor, all of these people are very important too. And I also mentioned new delivery technologies that we're working on remodeling. Not enough time to go into all of those. But there are a lot of supporting actors and actresses that are going to get us to this 25 by 25. Mike, do you want to provide a little bit more granularity to the backend of this. Awesome, awesome. Awesome. Are there time – Dewey says there is time for one more question and he is the boss. So next question, operator."

Now I'll turn the webcast over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of the second quarter 2022 financial results and business activities of United Therapeutics. Martine?\nDr. Martine Rothblatt: Thanks, Dewey. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. We've hammered all of our numbers this past quarter, and the 31% growth reported in our Tyvaso sales is truly impressive, actually for me even eye-popping, and very comforting because we continue at this 30-plus percent growth rate. Year-over-year, we will have achieved our stated goal of 25,000 patients while we double our numbers every 2.5 years at that percentage growth rate, so we will be able to achieve our 25,000 patient goal on target. Rather than have me read the entire release, why don't we take a kind of 30,000-foot strategic overview of where we are and where we are going. We are now at nearly a $2 billion per year revenue run rate. And that really puts us on the cusp of 3 new generations of revenue at United Therapeutics. So I'm going to expand at this, where we are right now at a $2 billion revenue run rate and look out and see where are we going to go from here. And I think that there are 3 peaks coming in the years ahead. The first generation or the first next peak of revenue will be to double our $2 billion of revenue to around 2025 by expansion of our oral, inhaled, incredible products in pulmonary hypertension. These products include our launched products such as Orenitram, Tyvaso, Tyvaso DPI and Remunity, as well as our late-stage pipeline products such as ralinepag and Tyvaso for COPD. The launched products alone get us to a revenue doubling, as I just described in the beginning of my presentation, largely just by penetration of WHO Group 3 pulmonary hypertension by Tyvaso, the type of results that you see so outstandingly presented in this quarter's numbers. All of the pipeline products are actually just additional gravy to getting us to that goal. Now at that point, this second generation of revenue kicks in above $4 billion. So going from the $2 billion revenue run rate that we are right now to the $4 billion is accomplished overwhelmingly with just our launched products. The second generation of revenue kicks in above and beyond that $4 billion threshold, which we should achieve around 2025 with approval of our TETON study as the basis of a disease-modifying treatment and the first disease-modifying treatment for IPF. Here, we forecast an additional $4 billion in revenue coming from about 40,000 patients at roughly speaking, $100,000 per year. With those kind of numbers, we should be able to close out the 2020s with about $8 billion in revenue annually, roughly half from pulmonary hypertension and half from pulmonary fibrosis. By that time, we will be ready to monetize our organ manufacturing business with thousands of kidneys, hearts and lungs, bringing us well over $10 billion in revenue in the 2030s. So that organ manufacturing business is the third peak that we would achieve in the years ahead. In summary, at the 30,000-foot level, we expect greater than fivefold growth in 8-or-so years. Now as I've shared where we are and where we are going and where after that, let me now turn the podium over to Michael Benkowitz, our President, for more of a deep dive. Mike?\nMichael Benkowitz: Thanks, Martine, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to have achieved double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in our treprostinil business. And not only that, but we reached all-time high quarterly revenues for both Tyvaso and the total treprostinil business. As usual, I'll provide some additional commercial color for each of our 4 main products, focusing primarily on our patient metrics. I remind everyone that our quarterly treprostinil revenue does not always track exactly with quarterly underlying patient demand due to specialty pharmacy ordering patterns, which can be seasonal. I'll start with Tyvaso, which saw 3 similar events in the second quarter. First, we were thrilled to receive FDA approval for Tyvaso DPI in May. This is the culmination of years of work by teams at United Therapeutics and our partners at MannKind. We were able to make our first shipments to specialty pharmacies in June, and the first patient started on therapy shortly thereafter. Physician engagement and enthusiasm around this new product is extremely high, which has translated into strong referrals or prescriptions and starts in the third quarter. Secondly, the CMS coverage update to include Tyvaso for PH-ILD that went into effect in early June had a positive impact on new referrals late in the quarter, which like Tyvaso DPI continues into the third quarter. As a reminder, CMS patients who started in our patient access programs before the coverage decision took effect will remain in those programs through the close of the calendar year and then will convert to commercial patients next year. However, we have been aware that many physicians waiting for a CMS -- were waiting for a CMS coverage decision before referring their Medicare patients for Tyvaso therapy, so it has been nice to see an uptick here. Finally, after two quarters of modest patient growth relative to Q2 and Q3 of last year, we added approximately 500 patients to our Tyvaso total active patient census in the second quarter. And I should note, we accomplished this without the benefit of the CMS coverage decision or the Tyvaso DPI approval because these events occurred so late in the quarter. Consequently, we think the momentum in patient adds we saw in the second quarter, coupled with Tyvaso DPI approval and the CMS coverage decision and continued growth in new prescribers leave us well positioned for a strong second half of the year and to achieve our goal of 6,000 Tyvaso patients by the end of the year. Moving to Orenitram, we saw yet another quarter of record patient counts as of the end of the second quarter. As we've discussed before, we believe this uptick is driven by the FREEDOM-EV label expansion now that we're able to have more robust interactions with prescribers about this data. Over the long term, Orenitram will continue to be an important part of the PAH treatment armamentarium in patients that either prefer oral medications, have failed on Tyvaso or want to transition from Remodulin after their RV function has normalized. Turning to Remodulin. In the second quarter, we saw the second highest level of Remodulin referrals ever and relative resilience and stability in the business despite the availability of generic competitors. The relaunch of the Remunity pump is proceeding well, and we expect Remunity starts and total patients on Remunity to grow over the balance of the year and into 2023. Finally, Unituxin demand remains strong as quarterly shipments from our distributors to hospitals remain consistent with the past few quarters. Our second quarter revenue was impacted by a decline in international ordering as well as order timing and patterns in the U.S. market. Overall, we're very pleased with each of our products' performance in the second quarter, and we look forward to a strong second half of the year, particularly for Tyvaso. So Martine, I'll turn it back to you.\nDr. Martine Rothblatt: Thanks, Mike. Those are superb results so nicely reviewed by you. Operator, can you please open the lines? And any questions that come in, I'll be happy to refer them to the executive on the call whose area best fits with.\nOperator:  And your first question is from the line of Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer & Co.\nHartaj Singh: Really nice results, everyone, so congratulations. Just now that DPI is approved, just a question on generally United Therapeutics' sort of IP portfolio. I mean could you, Martine, generate more IP over from DPI that we would -- we could hope to see over the next few months? And then maybe just talk a little bit about just your -- the IP that you're generating through innovation with drug delivery like Remunity and potentially future ralinepag, et cetera. I really appreciate the questions.\nDr. Martine Rothblatt: Yes. Thanks so much, Hartaj, and so nice to hear your voice this morning. It's a really great question. We have a robust IP program at UT. We are very, very fortunate to have in-house IP Counsel, who is an expert in the field and who works directly for our General Counsel, Paul Mahon. His name is Shaun Snader. And fortunately, he is extremely knowledgeable and proficient in the area of biotechnology, biochemistry, pharmacology as well as drug device technology. So he constantly engages in kind of like a round-robin set of discussions with members of our product development team, drug device team, chemistry team, organ manufacturing team and ends up with a continuous stream of new patent filings, especially here in the U.S., but also overseas. So I feel we're very confident that we will have a major new IP that we will be able to benefit from coming out throughout the balance of this decade in every area of our business, whether it is pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, organ manufacturing. Wherever we are able to demonstrate something that is unique and innovative and meets all of the criteria for patenting, Sean is going to be on that. And I think going forward, the core competency ultimately of UT is going to be its intellectual property portfolio. Thanks so much, Hartaj, for the question.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.\nEun Yang: Great quarter. I have a question on Phase III PERFECT trial in COPD patients. So you modified the trial with the increased number of patients and shouldered single-treatment period over 12 weeks. So can you give us -- kind of elaborate on the reason why you changed the study protocol and with this, when we might expect the data?\nDr. Martine Rothblatt: Yes. Thank you, Eun, for your question this morning, and thanks for joining the call. So we modified the trial from -- we actually just triggered a part of the trial as filed, which we had a preplanned opportunity to switch from the crossover design to a parallel design. And we were able to make that decision according to the preapproved protocol design with the FDA and as preapproved by all the IRBs at 2 or 3 different points during the trial. So at each of those points, we would ask ourselves, would switching from a crossover to a parallel design increase our probability even higher of having a successful outcome? And of course, always what we are obsessed with is having the highest possible probability of a successful outcome. And when this opportunity arose, I guess, it was like 2 months ago now, we decided collectively that if we switched from the crossover to the parallel design, we would be able to increase our odds of having a successful outcome. Even though we probably would have been successful with the crossover, but why rest on probably when you can do it even higher level of assurance? We're all about success here at UT. So we went ahead and triggered the preapproved switch from the crossover over to the parallel. In terms of when, it's -- we're continuing to enroll that study quite aggressively. All of the patients from the crossover, they flip over into the N for the parallel design. So I think that the study will read out in time to produce the additional patients. Like I said in my introductory remarks, these pipeline patients are -- I mean, the product pipeline patients are not necessary for us doubling our revenues in the next few years, but they're gravy on top of that. So over the next -- it's in the middle of the Phase III. So within the normal and customary time frame, we're completing these Phase III studies -- we'll be able to complete that study as a parallel side study.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joe Thome with Cowen.\nJoe Thome: Congrats on the excellent progress this quarter. Maybe just in terms of Tyvaso, can you comment on the penetration that you're seeing into more traditional ILD physicians in that PH-ILD launch for Tyvaso? And should this new CMS Medicare coverage decision and the DPI launch fuel uptake at these physician centers?\nDr. Martine Rothblatt: Yes. Thank you, Joe. Super like the question, getting really right to the marrow of what's going on in the very exciting growth figures that we have for Tyvaso. And I'm going to refer that question over to Mike Benkowitz to do a deep dive on the answer.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Thanks, Martine. Thanks, Joe, for the question. Yes, in terms of penetration with the PH-ILD prescriber base, we have seen an uptick there in the second quarter. And I think the inflection point or the tipping point for us with respect to those physicians was really towards the end of the first quarter of this year when it just seemed that access to our sales reps opened up, coupled with the return to in-person health care conferences. So we have the ISHLT conference in Boston. We had the ATS conference in San Francisco. Both conferences well attended, really gave us an opportunity, our teams -- a big opportunity to get back out in front of physicians and continue to talk about PH-ILD and Tyvaso in that indication, both on a one-on-one basis but also in terms of publications, presentations, poster presentations, what have you. And I think really since then, we're starting to see, like I said, a nice uptick. I think I'd have to go back to confirm this. But I believe we added somewhere -- we increased our prescriber base by about 15% to 20% just in the second quarter alone, and a lot of that coming from the typical ILD treaters. So we definitely see some momentum there. And then the second part of your question, we absolutely believe the CMS coverage decision and a DPI will help us continue to penetrate in that prescriber base. I think as we've said for multiple quarters, we have heard anecdotally that physicians have been waiting for the coverage decision just to make it easier to get the patients through the reimbursement process. And then obviously, with Tyvaso DPI, you have a more convenient delivery mechanism. So we think both of those things will continue to add and allow us to continue to grow our prescriber base as we move through the second half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jessica Fye with JPMorgan.\nJessica Fye: I was hoping you could elaborate on where you see near-term DPI starts coming from. Like how much use over the coming months do you think will come from new starts versus switches from nebulized Tyvaso? And also, has there been any evolution to your thinking about the potential eventual mix between nebulized Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI since you commented on that last quarter? And can you just remind us of your thinking there?\nDr. Martine Rothblatt: Thank you, Jess, and really interesting questions, back to like kind of the heart of the business here. So, so cool. I'm going to maybe comment on your second question, and then I'm going to bounce it over to Mike on your first question. Our view is that there's going to be a, kind of, a leveling out at about 50-50 between nebulized and Tyvaso DPI. And you -- it's really very comparable to what we've seen over the years between subcu and IV in terms of parenteral. I mean, of course, most people would think -- hello? Yes. Of course, most people would think that subcu was so much more convenient than IV that everybody would go on subcu, but it doesn't really work that way. And the fact of the matter is, depending on people's particular medical conditions, IV is a better solution for them than subcu. And while we are super excited about DPI and confident that it is the most convenient way imaginable to take Tyvaso, I think because of people's particular medical conditions, long term, you're going to see about a 50-50 mix between the nebulized and DPI form of Tyvaso. But with those comments on your second question, I think really the much more exciting information will come from Mike on your first question. Mike?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Thanks, Martine. Jess, yes, I think in terms of the mix between transitions and starts, it's -- there's not really -- we're not really preferring or going after one versus the other. When we launched in June -- when you get an approval, there's some logistical things that have to happen. You have to print the -- print the final label, you have to get packaging, you have to get kitting, et cetera, et cetera. And so -- this is just, I guess, more for your information, we started off by printing the maintenance kits for those patients that were already on the nebulizer. So those were sort of the kits that kind of came off the line first. And then a couple of weeks behind that, we have the titration packs for new patients. So at this point, whether you're on the nebulizer with the TD-300 and want to transition, you're able to do that. Whether you're a de novo patient and want to start -- need to start on the prostacyclin, we're able to do that as well. So I think as we move through the balance of the year, I think we're going to see -- I would expect a roughly equal mix of both transitions and new patients.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andreas Argyrides with Wedbush Securities.\nAndreas Argyrides: I'm going to piggyback off Jessica's last one. And we recently conducted a care well call with a PHA expert. And he noted that there's a big opportunity for DPI and PH-ILD. So if you can provide that mix that you mentioned about 50-50 for DPI specifically, that would be great. And then maybe to focus on the pipeline a bit, what can we expect next from the organ transplantation programs?\nDr. Martine Rothblatt: Sure. So yes, that 50-50 split, approximately, obviously, it's not exactly, is across the board for PAH, whether Group 1 or Group 3. And with regard to your organ question, we have 2 executives on the call. We have Pat Poisson, who is our Executive Vice President for Technical Operations, which includes the construction of our pathogen-free facility. And we have Dr. Leigh Peterson, who is in charge of product development, which includes our xeno-kidney and xenoheart programs. So maybe Pat first, if you could say a word or 2 about the manufacturing aspects of the organ business. And then, Leigh, if you could say a word or 2 about the product development aspects.\nPat Poisson: Yes, sure. Thanks, Martine. So we've made really great progress over the last 3 months or so with the DPI facility. In Q2, we completed design of that facility. At the very end of the quarter, at least, we're anticipating substantial completion of the facility by the end of '23 and being prepared to support any xeno trials that will start in '24.\nDr. Martine Rothblatt: Thanks, Pat. Dr. Peterson?\nDr. Leigh Peterson: Yes. So thanks for the question. We're continuing to dialogue with the FDA about a clinical path forward. And in the meantime, we're working with our academic partners and continuing to conduct nonhuman primate studies. And when appropriate, the academic partners will also be conducting the xeno donor studies, like those previously conducted and reported at NYU and UAB. And it's also up to the academic partners, but we expect that there might be additional living on a compassionate use basis recipients before we actually start the formal clinical trial.\nDr. Martine Rothblatt: Thanks, Dr. Peterson. So it was really a great set of questions that we had this morning, and it's amazing, really because they kind of align very well with the 30,000-foot overview that I gave at the beginning. Hartaj's and Eun's question emphasize the ability of our current business to grow from our $2 billion revenue run rate to a $4 billion revenue run rate based on continued expansion of Tyvaso in particular, but also Remodulin and Orenitram in the existing approved indications, which are PAH, be it WHO Group 1 or Group 3. Then building on that, I think that Joe and Jess' questions cast really -- a really nice spotlight on DPI. And ultimately, DPI is going to be so important as we move into pulmonary fibrosis, which is our TETON study. And that study is now enrolling very strongly. And I just could not be more excited about the fact that I really believe we are going to prove our hypothesis that we have a disease-modifying treatment for pulmonary fibrosis. U.S. alone, 100,000 patients already being treated or diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. So those patients are easy to touch and identify. The other current prescriptions -- we are testing our drug to come on top of their current medications. So no need for physicians to do a switch decision or anything like that, just layer it on top. And I believe that business will double up again, some $4 billion up to $8 billion, even with just a 40% penetration of that market, notwithstanding it being a disease-modifying treatment based on the results of the study. And then finally, we have the really good question from Andreas about the organ manufacturing activity. And as Pat and Leigh pointed out, we are doing all of the strong platform work for that with our belief that we'll be able to monetize all of that IP. Again, a very good question raised by Hartaj about the IP. We'll be able to monetize all of that IP by the end of this decade and providing a super strong,  large building, upon which we can build and build and build as we go from kidneys to heart to lungs, livers and other organs with our, really, portfolio of organ manufacturing activities, the xenotransplantation capability, the decell/recell activity and then the 3D bioprinting. So could not be more happy about United Therapeutics, and we really appreciate everybody joining us on this second quarter earnings call. Have a great day, everyone. Operator, you can wrap it up.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation earnings webcast.

            "name": "Dr. Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thanks, Dewey. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. We've hammered all of our numbers this past quarter, and the 31% growth reported in our Tyvaso sales is truly impressive, actually for me even eye-popping, and very comforting because we continue at this 30-plus percent growth rate. Year-over-year, we will have achieved our stated goal of 25,000 patients while we double our numbers every 2.5 years at that percentage growth rate, so we will be able to achieve our 25,000 patient goal on target. Rather than have me read the entire release, why don't we take a kind of 30,000-foot strategic overview of where we are and where we are going. We are now at nearly a $2 billion per year revenue run rate. And that really puts us on the cusp of 3 new generations of revenue at United Therapeutics. So I'm going to expand at this, where we are right now at a $2 billion revenue run rate and look out and see where are we going to go from here. And I think that there are 3 peaks coming in the years ahead. The first generation or the first next peak of revenue will be to double our $2 billion of revenue to around 2025 by expansion of our oral, inhaled, incredible products in pulmonary hypertension. These products include our launched products such as Orenitram, Tyvaso, Tyvaso DPI and Remunity, as well as our late-stage pipeline products such as ralinepag and Tyvaso for COPD. The launched products alone get us to a revenue doubling, as I just described in the beginning of my presentation, largely just by penetration of WHO Group 3 pulmonary hypertension by Tyvaso, the type of results that you see so outstandingly presented in this quarter's numbers. All of the pipeline products are actually just additional gravy to getting us to that goal. Now at that point, this second generation of revenue kicks in above $4 billion. So going from the $2 billion revenue run rate that we are right now to the $4 billion is accomplished overwhelmingly with just our launched products. The second generation of revenue kicks in above and beyond that $4 billion threshold, which we should achieve around 2025 with approval of our TETON study as the basis of a disease-modifying treatment and the first disease-modifying treatment for IPF. Here, we forecast an additional $4 billion in revenue coming from about 40,000 patients at roughly speaking, $100,000 per year. With those kind of numbers, we should be able to close out the 2020s with about $8 billion in revenue annually, roughly half from pulmonary hypertension and half from pulmonary fibrosis. By that time, we will be ready to monetize our organ manufacturing business with thousands of kidneys, hearts and lungs, bringing us well over $10 billion in revenue in the 2030s. So that organ manufacturing business is the third peak that we would achieve in the years ahead. In summary, at the 30,000-foot level, we expect greater than fivefold growth in 8-or-so years. Now as I've shared where we are and where we are going and where after that, let me now turn the podium over to Michael Benkowitz, our President, for more of a deep dive. Mike? Thanks, Mike. Those are superb results so nicely reviewed by you. Operator, can you please open the lines? And any questions that come in, I'll be happy to refer them to the executive on the call whose area best fits with. Yes. Thanks so much, Hartaj, and so nice to hear your voice this morning.

And I think going forward, the core competency ultimately of UT is going to be its intellectual property portfolio. Thanks so much, Hartaj, for the question. Yes. Thank you, Eun, for your question this morning, and thanks for joining the call. So we modified the trial from -- we actually just triggered a part of the trial as filed, which we had a preplanned opportunity to switch from the crossover design to a parallel design. And we were able to make that decision according to the preapproved protocol design with the FDA and as preapproved by all the IRBs at 2 or 3 different points during the trial. So at each of those points, we would ask ourselves, would switching from a crossover to a parallel design increase our probability even higher of having a successful outcome? And of course, always what we are obsessed with is having the highest possible probability of a successful outcome. And when this opportunity arose, I guess, it was like 2 months ago now, we decided collectively that if we switched from the crossover to the parallel design, we would be able to increase our odds of having a successful outcome. Even though we probably would have been successful with the crossover, but why rest on probably when you can do it even higher level of assurance? We're all about success here at UT. So we went ahead and triggered the preapproved switch from the crossover over to the parallel. In terms of when, it's -- we're continuing to enroll that study quite aggressively. All of the patients from the crossover, they flip over into the N for the parallel design. So I think that the study will read out in time to produce the additional patients. Like I said in my introductory remarks, these pipeline patients are -- I mean, the product pipeline patients are not necessary for us doubling our revenues in the next few years, but they're gravy on top of that. So over the next -- it's in the middle of the Phase III. So within the normal and customary time frame, we're completing these Phase III studies -- we'll be able to complete that study as a parallel side study. Yes. Thank you, Joe. Super like the question, getting really right to the marrow of what's going on in the very exciting growth figures that we have for Tyvaso. And I'm going to refer that question over to Mike Benkowitz to do a deep dive on the answer. Thank you, Jess, and really interesting questions, back to like kind of the heart of the business here. So, so cool. I'm going to maybe comment on your second question, and then I'm going to bounce it over to Mike on your first question. Our view is that there's going to be a, kind of, a leveling out at about 50-50 between nebulized and Tyvaso DPI. And you -- it's really very comparable to what we've seen over the years between subcu and IV in terms of parenteral. I mean, of course, most people would think -- hello? Yes. Of course, most people would think that subcu was so much more convenient than IV that everybody would go on subcu, but it doesn't really work that way. And the fact of the matter is, depending on people's particular medical conditions, IV is a better solution for them than subcu. And while we are super excited about DPI and confident that it is the most convenient way imaginable to take Tyvaso, I think because of people's particular medical conditions, long term, you're going to see about a 50-50 mix between the nebulized and DPI form of Tyvaso. But with those comments on your second question, I think really the much more exciting information will come from Mike on your first question. Mike? Sure. So yes, that 50-50 split, approximately, obviously, it's not exactly, is across the board for PAH, whether Group 1 or Group 3. And with regard to your organ question, we have 2 executives on the call. We have Pat Poisson, who is our Executive Vice President for Technical Operations, which includes the construction of our pathogen-free facility. And we have Dr. Leigh Peterson, who is in charge of product development, which includes our xeno-kidney and xenoheart programs. So maybe Pat first, if you could say a word or 2 about the manufacturing aspects of the organ business. And then, Leigh, if you could say a word or 2 about the product development aspects. Thanks, Pat. Dr. Peterson? Thanks, Dr. Peterson. So it was really a great set of questions that we had this morning, and it's amazing, really because they kind of align very well with the 30,000-foot overview that I gave at the beginning. Hartaj's and Eun's question emphasize the ability of our current business to grow from our $2 billion revenue run rate to a $4 billion revenue run rate based on continued expansion of Tyvaso in particular, but also Remodulin and Orenitram in the existing approved indications, which are PAH, be it WHO Group 1 or Group 3. Then building on that, I think that Joe and Jess' questions cast really -- a really nice spotlight on DPI. And ultimately, DPI is going to be so important as we move into pulmonary fibrosis, which is our TETON study. And that study is now enrolling very strongly. And I just could not be more excited about the fact that I really believe we are going to prove our hypothesis that we have a disease-modifying treatment for pulmonary fibrosis. U.S. alone, 100,000 patients already being treated or diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. So those patients are easy to touch and identify. The other current prescriptions -- we are testing our drug to come on top of their current medications. So no need for physicians to do a switch decision or anything like that, just layer it on top. And I believe that business will double up again, some $4 billion up to $8 billion, even with just a 40% penetration of that market, notwithstanding it being a disease-modifying treatment based on the results of the study. And then finally, we have the really good question from Andreas about the organ manufacturing activity. And as Pat and Leigh pointed out, we are doing all of the strong platform work for that with our belief that we'll be able to monetize all of that IP. Again, a very good question raised by Hartaj about the IP. We'll be able to monetize all of that IP by the end of this decade and providing a super strong,  large building, upon which we can build and build and build as we go from kidneys to heart to lungs, livers and other organs with our, really, portfolio of organ manufacturing activities, the xenotransplantation capability, the decell/recell activity and then the 3D bioprinting. So could not be more happy about United Therapeutics, and we really appreciate everybody joining us on this second quarter earnings call. Have a great day, everyone. Operator, you can wrap it up."

And I will now turn the webcast over to Dewey Steadman, Head of Investor Relations at United Therapeutics.\nDewey Steadman : Thanks, Abby, and good morning. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to the United Therapeutics Corporation First Quarter 2022 Earnings Webcast. Accompanying me on today’s call are Dr. Martine Rothblatt, our Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer; James Edgemond, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Pat Poisson, our Executive Vice President of Technical Operations; and Dr. Leigh Peterson, Senior Vice President of Product Development.

Full prescribing information for the products are available on our website. Now I’ll turn the webcast over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of the first quarter 2022 financial results and business activities of United Therapeutics. Dr. Rothblatt?\nMartine Rothblatt : Thank you, Dewey, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2022 financial results call. In my opinion, this is the best quarter we have ever reported, considering not only profits, patients and our contributions to our planetary community. At $462 million in revenues, we are now on the cusp of a $2 billion revenue run rate. This is a major milestone achievement for us. This $2 billion revenue run rate is what we expect based on the strong trends that are evidenced in this quarter as well as what we expect in coming quarters. Importantly, we see strength across our entire product portfolio. As a public benefit company, we focus on 3 Ps, profitable cash flow, patient care and planetary community. With respect to profits, that approximately $2 billion revenue run rate was accompanied by nearly $0.25 billion in quarterly profits. We are making more money than we spend, which is 1 of our key financial metrics. But with respect to patient care, we are spending a lot. Seven Phase III studies are underway. A new Phase I study in RemoPro is just starting and an exciting Phase IV study called ARTISAN designed to prove that strong dosing on Remodulin, followed by a rapid switch to Orenitram allows patients long-term good results for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. They will be able to live with pulmonary hypertension more than die from pulmonary hypertension. Finally, with respect to our planetary community, we continue to lead by example with 0 carbon health care facilities that are amongst the best in our entire industry. For example, our clinical development operations work in the world’s largest site 0 carbon building in Silver Spring, Maryland. We are now building a first of its kind, 0 carbon footprint pharmaceutical inventory warehouse in North Carolina to store our ever-expanding production of pharmaceutical intermediates and pharmaceutical products. Speaking of products, I think that is a good opportunity for me to pass the baton to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Benkowitz.\nMichael Benkowitz : Thanks, Martine, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we continued our trend of year-over-year revenue growth, and we saw the highest quarterly revenue for Tyvaso as well as our overall Treprostinil business. I’d like to dive into the underlying performance of our 3 treprostinil products, Tyvaso, Remodulin and Orenitram. As usual, I’m going to focus on – more on our patient metrics, and I’ll remind everyone that our quarterly treprostinil revenue does not always track exactly with quarterly underlying patient demand due to specialty pharmacy ordering patterns. Starting with Tyvaso. We increased our active patients to about 4,400 as of the end of the first quarter, putting this approximately halfway toward the goal we set last year of doubling the number of Tyvaso patients from 3,000 to 6,000 by the end of this year. As I do in every setting like this, I want to remind everyone that achieving this goal assumes no COVID-related impact to health care practitioner access and patient initiation of therapy and the path to doubling will not be linear. Uptake in January and February was a little more gradual than in prior months, but this is not atypical for a serious chronic life-threatening condition where doctors want to be extra cautious about adding therapies. Having said that, in March, we saw a nice acceleration of patient additions with historically strong referrals and new starts along the lines of what we saw in Q2 and Q3 of last year, and this momentum has continued into April. Our continued path to 6,000 patients will be aided by 3 factors. First, assuming approval later this month, the launch of Tyvaso DPI, which we believe will expand Tyvaso’s use in both Group 1 and Group 3 pulmonary hypertension for the reasons I mentioned earlier. The recent CMS coverage update to include Tyvaso for PH-ILD, that’s our second factor. Despite the availability of our patient access programs for Medicare patients, before a coverage decision, we are aware that many physicians were waiting for a CMS coverage decision before referring their PH-ILD patients on Medicare for Tyvaso therapy. And third, continued growth in the Tyvaso prescriber base, particularly among ILD treaters. As I’ve mentioned on prior calls, many of these physicians have been on the front lines treating COVID patients. Now that COVID cases and hospitalization hopefully seem to be on the decline and with Tyvaso DPI and a CMS coverage decision, we expect to see more growth in prescriptions from these physicians over the next few quarters and beyond. Moving to Orenitram, we saw yet another quarter of record patient count as of the end of the first quarter. As we’ve discussed before, we believe this uptick is driven by the FREEDOM-EV label expansion now that we’re able to have more robust interactions with prescribers about the data. Finally, moving on to Remodulin. In the first quarter, we saw the highest level of our module referrals since 2014 and relative resilience and stability in the business despite the launch of a subcutaneous form of generic aprotinin last year. The relaunch of the Remunity pump is proceeding well, and we’re accepting referrals for starting patients on Remunity, and we’ve been doing that since about mid-March. We expect Remunity starts to pick up through the balance of the year and into 2023. To wrap up, we’re pleased with the continued momentum in the Orenitram modular business and progress with Tyvaso and PH-ILD, expected second quarter events such as CMS coverage and PH-ILD, the Tyvaso DPI launch approval, not to mention the increased buzz around PH-ILD we’re seeing at HCP conferences, particularly now that these are in person again, have us well positioned to achieve our 6,000-patient goal by the end of the year. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Martine to answers to your questions.\nMartine Rothblatt : Thanks so much, Mike. That was perfect. Operator, you may open the lines.\nOperator:  And we will take our first question from Eun Yang with Jefferies.\nEun Yang: Great quarter. Question on Tyvaso DPI side, we await FDA approval. Once approved on time, what do you think the conversion rate to DPI from Tyvaso would be? Whether you think that it will just help to expand into new patients?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Eun. Nice to hear your voice after – it’s been a while since we’ve been able to see each other face-to-face. So thanks for dialing in. That question is something that I think on this call, Mike would be the – have the most detailed and ability to address. So Mike, can you give us a response on that one?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure, happy to. Yes, I think what you’ll see is you’ll see this play out over a little bit of time. As I said in my opening remarks, we’re dealing with chronic life-threatening diseases here. And I think patients – or I’m sorry, physicians and patients can be a little bit cautious in terms of switching therapy, switching delivery devices, what have you. We do see and we hear a lot of excitement among both physicians and patients for the Tyvaso DPI. So we do believe that there will be a lot of interest in switching over to Tyvaso DPI. I think as this plays out, as we expand the use of Tyvaso into Group 1 and Group 3, over time, my estimate is that we’ll probably see somewhere around 60% of the patients on Tyvaso DPI and about 40% on the nebulizer. I’d say that’s – I think that’s a pretty good estimate for Group 1. I think Group 3 may be a little bit more 50-50 just because of the disease we’re talking about and the severity and some patients for whatever reason, they decide that the nebulizer is a better option for them than the DPI.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Mike. Eun, just to give you a little bit more color, as you know, my daughter has pulmonary hypertension. So I meet with a lot of parents and even their adult children with pulmonary hypertension. And I’m astonished that when I have a lunch or something with them, one of them will tell me that their daughter or their son is still taking Flolan from the old legacy pump, which weighs as much as maybe a small brick, not a brick, but small brick. And we’re just talking, and I’m obviously not selling.  I’m just talking parent to parent, but I say like there are much smaller devices available and ones that can go subcutaneously. And I’m just – I know you’re aware of this, I’m just curious why your daughter or son has never transitioned. And they always give the same answer, which is very resonant with what Mike just said, they said, “this has kept our child alive.” This legacy Flolan brick, if you will, has kept our daughter alive or kept our son alive. And we just don’t – if it’s not broken, we don’t want to fix it. And so that just gives you a little bit more color on what Mike was saying that when patients have this type of condition, if the nebulizer is – I don’t want to say keeping them alive because I don’t think that’s in the label. But if the nebulizers, what they feel, has made their pulmonary hypertension livable, it’s just human nature to be very cautious about flipping that to a different therapeutic coral. Now for new patients, totally different story. If you tell somebody you want a big thing or a small thing, almost everybody will take a small thing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Thome with Cowen & Company.\nJoseph Thome: Congratulations on the quarter. It was interesting that you mentioned there was an uptick in PH-ILD, either patients to referrals figure what you mentioned in March and continuing into April. Just a little bit of color in terms of why do you think maybe this was the case? And are you seeing an increased number of conventional ILD physicians using the therapy?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Joseph. Mike, hand off to you.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Yes, great question. I think there's a number of factors at play, Joe. I mean 1 is, yes, we are continuing to, day by day, week by week, continuing to grow our Tyvaso prescriber base in the ILD community. And that will just continue to play out over really, I think, years -- this year into next year and beyond. And so we're really focused on the breadth of the prescribing community. And so that is certainly a contributing factor to that. I think the other things that have into that are I know Martine talked a little bit about the impact of COVID on clinical trial enrollment in the market generally. I think in hindsight, looking at Omicron and the impact, I think it had an impact more than maybe we realized at the time just in terms of us being able to get in and talk to physicians and physicians willing to really take the time to understand PH-ILD, think about Tyvaso, think about their patients and move them to Tyvaso. And I think what we've seen really in the last, I would say, 6 to 8 weeks is, as I said, with the cases coming down, hospitalization is coming down, there's just -- I think the physicians have a lot more time to really dig into this, and so we're starting -- I think that's contributing to the increase in the referral and the starts that we've seen in the last 2 months. I think the third factor too is, I mentioned this in my opening remarks about the conferences. And I think -- but again, none of these are just by themselves, I think, driving it. It's a combination of a number of things, but I was at the ISHLT conference last week, which was very well attended in person. And I think just the fact that physicians were there, they were able to attend presentations live in person, there were a lot of really nice discussions around PH-ILD, around the use of Tyvaso in PH-ILD. You're able to have those hallway or coffee conversations. We're able to get out in front of these positions and have really, I think, detailed conversations with them about the state and the drug I think helps. I think the peer-to-peer interactions, our interactions, that will continue into the into the balance of the spring and the summer. I think ATS is, from what I understand, going to be even better attendant at ISHLT, and we've got a lot of, I think, great presentations going on there. So I think it's just really a combination of all of those things have led to kind of the return to where we -- to return to the kind of strong deferral and start patterns that we saw in the middle of last year. And then you layer on top of the factors that I mentioned in my opening remarks, particularly this coverage, which everybody I talked to that that's really important and that is going to increase through use of Tyvaso along with the DPI, as I said, I think, have us really well positioned to hit our goal by the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Fye with JP Morgan.\nJessica Fye: And I have a backup if you can't answer this. But with the Tyvaso DPI PDUFA approaching, can you say if you've seen an updated draft label at this point?\nMartine Rothblatt: And what's your backup so we have them all queued up.\nJessica Fye: What are your latest expectations for enrollment completion and data for the PERFECT AMT-TON trials?\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. So first, Jess, and nice to hear your voice again. And I'm excited speaking further about what Mike mentioned on the in-person presence. I'm excited to hear that JPMorgan will be fully in person this year. So congratulations on meeting our industry back to face-to-face health care conferences. So we really try to stay away from talking about decisions within the FDA and even decisions which are imminent. So we'll just leave it at that, and we'll issue the press release as soon as we get the good news. We are successfully enrolling all of our different clinical trials. It's really not possible to predict when any given trial will be completely enrolled. They are all enrolling, as we mentioned in the beginning of the remarks. And maybe just to provide a little bit of color around your question of what kind of factors are affecting enrollment in our clinical trials, I'd like to turn the microphone over to our Head of Product Development, Dr. Leigh Peterson. Leigh?\nLeigh Peterson: Thank you for the question. So we do have -- actually, we were able to progress. We do -- as Michael said, we were probably impacted by COVID for enrollment of the trials a little bit more than we had realized as we learn more and more about sites we're closing due to the pandemic. But they're opening now. We're getting more and more. We're getting boluses of patients coming in that we hadn't had before. And so we're really looking forward to completing the enrollment. Again, we can't really give you a specific time line. But we're really -- we haven't been inhibited to following our patients either. I mean there's a little bit of -- once we get the patients in the study, it's obviously critical that we continue to watch what happens follow and make sure that the sites are open, have access to the medicine and everything. And we've actually had no problems with that. And we even have a site in the Ukraine that has active patients that we're able to continue to follow and get medicine to in our study. So I hope that's the type of color you're looking for. Again, apologies, we can't really give you the specific enrollment dates as isn't possible for any clinical study.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Dr. Peterson. And just to provide a little more color to your question, Jess, I think it has been proven over and over that clinical trial enrollment is a core competency at United Therapeutics. It's something that we do very, very well. Two examples that are out of many I could give, I myself am blown away at how our team successfully during COVID, early days, delivered our medicines to patients in Wuhan, China, the ground zero of COVID, yet we continue delivering medicines. We were able to have local clinical trial monitors, continue to take all the measurements like Dr. Peterson said.  And then a more recent example, as Dr. Peterson just said, we have the center in the Ukraine, and it's part of our outcome study. And it's a -- fortunately, they are not in the part that's actively under bombardment from the Russians, but it's not far from there. And I just -- it's just amazing to me that our team is able to work to conduct these studies even in places of very, very difficult circumstances. Of course, here in the U.S., we're able to do much better. Things are peaceful, and we've even worked out -- backed up measures with the FDA, for example, in PERFECT, where we can take endpoint measurements using things like I can't remember the exact like altimetric. It's a kind of thing that measures how much you're walking, and it's an analogy. It's a 6-minute walk endpoint studies.  So we have adapted to doing clinical trials during COVID. And I think we've adapted very, very well, as you can see from, for example, the outcomes of the INCREASE trial and the FDA approval of INCREASE and our ongoing -- all 7 of our trials are Phase III trials are enrolling. As I mentioned, we're now beginning to enroll a new Phase I trial for RemoPro. We're enrolling a Phase IV trial, Artisan. So it's a core competency of our company to carry these things out even during difficult times. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andreas Argyrides with Wedbush Securities.\nAndreas Argyrides: Assuming approval, can you elaborate on the initial launch dynamics for DPI, given that it will be a first to market product? Also, what the time frame is to achieve the previously described breakdown between DPI and nebulizer? And then lastly, just an update on the xeno programs?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Andreas. While Mike is queuing up some answers to the first 2 questions that you asked, I'd like to have the xeno question addressed by Dr. Peterson because she is now also in charge of our xeno heart and xeno kidney clinical development. So she can give you a general overview of the type of things that we're doing on xeno. And before I leave the introductory part of your answer, please give our best to Already, Leigh, would you -- while you're thinking about the xeno response, so Mike, do you want to start with the first 2 questions he asked?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. So I think in terms of launch dynamics or launch timing, our expectation is that if we receive an approval this month, in accordance with our action date, we'll be able to commence promotional activities immediately. So we have all of our promotional materials queued up and ready to go and our sales reps trade. And so they'll be able to go out and start talking to physicians immediately. There'll be a little bit of a lag just in terms of getting product to specialty pharmacy and be able to start patients, but we would expect that patients will be able to start off therapy sometime in June. So you're just talking about a few weeks lag there, which is actually faster than normal between an approval and a lot. So -- and then for us, it's doing what we do from a sales and marketing standpoint and going out and communicating with physicians and communicating with patients and getting to understand the benefits of DPI and helping physicians with patients to identify the appropriate patient to either start to novo or transition over to the DPI. In terms of the timing for the breakdown that I mentioned earlier, sort of like the clinical trial question. I hesitate to put a time line on that because it always seems to move a little bit slower than what we think for the reasons that Martine -- the example that Martine gave because of the types of patients we're dealing with. I am optimistic that this will happen maybe quicker than what we typically see in this space just because of all of the prelaunch or preapproval buzz and excitement that is around this product.\nMartine Rothblatt: Awesome, Mike. Totally, totally awesome. All right. Leigh, people are interested about what we can expect next on xeno.\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. So as everyone knows, the world has -- is very, very excited on what's going on here. And we have reports of institutions doing work in humans. One case that's coming out where the xeno heart was placed into a human patient, and that work -- the case study of that's coming out in a major medical journal. So please look for those details in that report. We're excited for that to come out soon. But what we do is we are really interested in doing the clinical studies that prove if a product is efficacious as we expect. And so in order to do the very -- the more formal Phase I sponsored clinical studies, we're required to continue to do some preclinical work and per FDA and we're working with FDA to understand specifically what we should do in order to prepare ourselves for the IND and prepare them.  As everyone knows, this is an entirely new field and so we're working really closely together to make sure that we do this right. So we're spending time now working with our academic partners and doing the nonclinical work and making sure everything is in order for our Phase I and everything being the specific immunosuppression regimen that will be used, the specific product and all of the procedures that are associated with that. So once we have that completed, we will be submitting our IND to start the Phase I studies with the xeno organs.\nMartine Rothblatt: Excellent. Thank you so much, Leigh. I'm going to call on 1 more person, Pat Poisson, who is our Executive Vice President for Technical Operations. Those of you who know me know that I kind of geek out on pharma biologic manufacturing things. I just really love it. And it's amazing to manufacture a xeno kidney and xeno heart. That is a -- it's a biologic, obviously. But it requires manufacturing facilities, really the likes of which have not existed before. And it is under Pat Poisson, who is our EVP, Technical Operations, that we are building the manufacturing facility for the clinical trials that Dr. Peterson just referred to because for a clinical trial whether it's a small molecule or a biologic or a whole organ, you have to have a higher level of attention and care to GMP type of processes. So Pat, would you just have like about a minute left in the call, but if you could kind of give us an overview of the kind of stuff that you're overseeing in terms of preparing a clinical trial, if I could say, material, or organ for Dr. Peterson's trial?\nPatrick Poisson: Yes. Thanks, Martine. So certainly, us and operations are very excited about the prospects of xeno. And we are undertaking building a clinical, call it, manufacturing facility that will produce organs for the trials that Dr. Peterson will run. And this is going to be a first-in-kind greenfield facility in Western Virginia, and it will be state-of-the-art as we do with all of our facilities working closely with FDA. So we are taking that program off. It's underway and design work is happening as we speak. So we will be prepared to supply organs when these trials start.\nMartine Rothblatt : Thank you so much, Pat. Operator, it's been a wonderful call. Like I said at the beginning, in my opinion, the best quarter we've ever had the pleasure to share with everybody considering revenues, pipeline, even these amazing manufacturing activities. So operator, you may now wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation Earnings Webcast.

In the first quarter, we continued our trend of year-over-year revenue growth, and we saw the highest quarterly revenue for Tyvaso as well as our overall Treprostinil business. I'd like to dive into the underlying performance of our 3 treprostinil products, Tyvaso, Remodulin and Orenitram. As usual, I'm going to focus on – more on our patient metrics, and I'll remind everyone that our quarterly treprostinil revenue does not always track exactly with quarterly underlying patient demand due to specialty pharmacy ordering patterns. Starting with Tyvaso. We increased our active patients to about 4,400 as of the end of the first quarter, putting this approximately halfway toward the goal we set last year of doubling the number of Tyvaso patients from 3,000 to 6,000 by the end of this year. As I do in every setting like this, I want to remind everyone that achieving this goal assumes no COVID-related impact to health care practitioner access and patient initiation of therapy and the path to doubling will not be linear. Uptake in January and February was a little more gradual than in prior months, but this is not atypical for a serious chronic life-threatening condition where doctors want to be extra cautious about adding therapies. Having said that, in March, we saw a nice acceleration of patient additions with historically strong referrals and new starts along the lines of what we saw in Q2 and Q3 of last year, and this momentum has continued into April. Our continued path to 6,000 patients will be aided by 3 factors. First, assuming approval later this month, the launch of Tyvaso DPI, which we believe will expand Tyvaso's use in both Group 1 and Group 3 pulmonary hypertension for the reasons I mentioned earlier. The recent CMS coverage update to include Tyvaso for PH-ILD, that's our second factor. Despite the availability of our patient access programs for Medicare patients, before a coverage decision, we are aware that many physicians were waiting for a CMS coverage decision before referring their PH-ILD patients on Medicare for Tyvaso therapy. And third, continued growth in the Tyvaso prescriber base, particularly among ILD treaters. As I've mentioned on prior calls, many of these physicians have been on the front lines treating COVID patients. Now that COVID cases and hospitalization hopefully seem to be on the decline and with Tyvaso DPI and a CMS coverage decision, we expect to see more growth in prescriptions from these physicians over the next few quarters and beyond. Moving to Orenitram, we saw yet another quarter of record patient count as of the end of the first quarter. As we've discussed before, we believe this uptick is driven by the FREEDOM-EV label expansion now that we're able to have more robust interactions with prescribers about the data. Finally, moving on to Remodulin. In the first quarter, we saw the highest level of our module referrals since 2014 and relative resilience and stability in the business despite the launch of a subcutaneous form of generic aprotinin last year. The relaunch of the Remunity pump is proceeding well, and we're accepting referrals for starting patients on Remunity, and we've been doing that since about mid-March. We expect Remunity starts to pick up through the balance of the year and into 2023. To wrap up, we're pleased with the continued momentum in the Orenitram modular business and progress with Tyvaso and PH-ILD, expected second quarter events such as CMS coverage and PH-ILD, the Tyvaso DPI launch approval, not to mention the increased buzz around PH-ILD we're seeing at HCP conferences, particularly now that these are in person again, have us well positioned to achieve our 6,000-patient goal by the end of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Martine to answers to your questions. Sure, happy to. Yes, I think what you'll see is you'll see this play out over a little bit of time. As I said in my opening remarks, we're dealing with chronic life-threatening diseases here. And I think patients – or I'm sorry, physicians and patients can be a little bit cautious in terms of switching therapy, switching delivery devices, what have you. We do see and we hear a lot of excitement among both physicians and patients for the Tyvaso DPI. So we do believe that there will be a lot of interest in switching over to Tyvaso DPI. I think as this plays out, as we expand the use of Tyvaso into Group 1 and Group 3, over time, my estimate is that we'll probably see somewhere around 60% of the patients on Tyvaso DPI and about 40% on the nebulizer. I'd say that's – I think that's a pretty good estimate for Group 1. I think Group 3 may be a little bit more 50-50 just because of the disease we're talking about and the severity and some patients for whatever reason, they decide that the nebulizer is a better option for them than the DPI. Sure. Yes, great question. I think there's a number of factors at play, Joe. I mean 1 is, yes, we are continuing to, day by day, week by week, continuing to grow our Tyvaso prescriber base in the ILD community. And that will just continue to play out over really, I think, years -- this year into next year and beyond. And so we're really focused on the breadth of the prescribing community. And so that is certainly a contributing factor to that. I think the other things that have into that are I know Martine talked a little bit about the impact of COVID on clinical trial enrollment in the market generally. I think in hindsight, looking at Omicron and the impact, I think it had an impact more than maybe we realized at the time just in terms of us being able to get in and talk to physicians and physicians willing to really take the time to understand PH-ILD, think about Tyvaso, think about their patients and move them to Tyvaso. And I think what we've seen really in the last, I would say, 6 to 8 weeks is, as I said, with the cases coming down, hospitalization is coming down, there's just -- I think the physicians have a lot more time to really dig into this, and so we're starting -- I think that's contributing to the increase in the referral and the starts that we've seen in the last 2 months. I think the third factor too is, I mentioned this in my opening remarks about the conferences. And I think -- but again, none of these are just by themselves, I think, driving it. It's a combination of a number of things, but I was at the ISHLT conference last week, which was very well attended in person. And I think just the fact that physicians were there, they were able to attend presentations live in person, there were a lot of really nice discussions around PH-ILD, around the use of Tyvaso in PH-ILD. You're able to have those hallway or coffee conversations. We're able to get out in front of these positions and have really, I think, detailed conversations with them about the state and the drug I think helps. I think the peer-to-peer interactions, our interactions, that will continue into the into the balance of the spring and the summer. I think ATS is, from what I understand, going to be even better attendant at ISHLT, and we've got a lot of, I think, great presentations going on there. So I think it's just really a combination of all of those things have led to kind of the return to where we -- to return to the kind of strong deferral and start patterns that we saw in the middle of last year. And then you layer on top of the factors that I mentioned in my opening remarks, particularly this coverage, which everybody I talked to that that's really important and that is going to increase through use of Tyvaso along with the DPI, as I said, I think, have us really well positioned to hit our goal by the end of the year. Sure. So I think in terms of launch dynamics or launch timing, our expectation is that if we receive an approval this month, in accordance with our action date, we'll be able to commence promotional activities immediately. So we have all of our promotional materials queued up and ready to go and our sales reps trade. And so they'll be able to go out and start talking to physicians immediately. There'll be a little bit of a lag just in terms of getting product to specialty pharmacy and be able to start patients, but we would expect that patients will be able to start off therapy sometime in June. So you're just talking about a few weeks lag there, which is actually faster than normal between an approval and a lot. So -- and then for us, it's doing what we do from a sales and marketing standpoint and going out and communicating with physicians and communicating with patients and getting to understand the benefits of DPI and helping physicians with patients to identify the appropriate patient to either start to novo or transition over to the DPI. In terms of the timing for the breakdown that I mentioned earlier, sort of like the clinical trial question. I hesitate to put a time line on that because it always seems to move a little bit slower than what we think for the reasons that Martine -- the example that Martine gave because of the types of patients we're dealing with. I am optimistic that this will happen maybe quicker than what we typically see in this space just because of all of the prelaunch or preapproval buzz and excitement that is around this product."

            "content": "Thank you for the question. So we do have -- actually, we were able to progress. We do -- as Michael said, we were probably impacted by COVID for enrollment of the trials a little bit more than we had realized as we learn more and more about sites we're closing due to the pandemic. But they're opening now. We're getting more and more. We're getting boluses of patients coming in that we hadn't had before. And so we're really looking forward to completing the enrollment. Again, we can't really give you a specific time line. But we're really -- we haven't been inhibited to following our patients either. I mean there's a little bit of -- once we get the patients in the study, it's obviously critical that we continue to watch what happens follow and make sure that the sites are open, have access to the medicine and everything. And we've actually had no problems with that. And we even have a site in the Ukraine that has active patients that we're able to continue to follow and get medicine to in our study. So I hope that's the type of color you're looking for. Again, apologies, we can't really give you the specific enrollment dates as isn't possible for any clinical study. Yes. So as everyone knows, the world has -- is very, very excited on what's going on here. And we have reports of institutions doing work in humans. One case that's coming out where the xeno heart was placed into a human patient, and that work -- the case study of that's coming out in a major medical journal. So please look for those details in that report. We're excited for that to come out soon. But what we do is we are really interested in doing the clinical studies that prove if a product is efficacious as we expect. And so in order to do the very -- the more formal Phase I sponsored clinical studies, we're required to continue to do some preclinical work and per FDA and we're working with FDA to understand specifically what we should do in order to prepare ourselves for the IND and prepare them.  As everyone knows, this is an entirely new field and so we're working really closely together to make sure that we do this right. So we're spending time now working with our academic partners and doing the nonclinical work and making sure everything is in order for our Phase I and everything being the specific immunosuppression regimen that will be used, the specific product and all of the procedures that are associated with that. So once we have that completed, we will be submitting our IND to start the Phase I studies with the xeno organs."

            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thank you, Dewey, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2022 financial results call. In my opinion, this is the best quarter we have ever reported, considering not only profits, patients and our contributions to our planetary community. At $462 million in revenues, we are now on the cusp of a $2 billion revenue run rate. This is a major milestone achievement for us. This $2 billion revenue run rate is what we expect based on the strong trends that are evidenced in this quarter as well as what we expect in coming quarters. Importantly, we see strength across our entire product portfolio. As a public benefit company, we focus on 3 Ps, profitable cash flow, patient care and planetary community. With respect to profits, that approximately $2 billion revenue run rate was accompanied by nearly $0.25 billion in quarterly profits. We are making more money than we spend, which is 1 of our key financial metrics. But with respect to patient care, we are spending a lot. Seven Phase III studies are underway. A new Phase I study in RemoPro is just starting and an exciting Phase IV study called ARTISAN designed to prove that strong dosing on Remodulin, followed by a rapid switch to Orenitram allows patients long-term good results for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. They will be able to live with pulmonary hypertension more than die from pulmonary hypertension. Finally, with respect to our planetary community, we continue to lead by example with 0 carbon health care facilities that are amongst the best in our entire industry. For example, our clinical development operations work in the world's largest site 0 carbon building in Silver Spring, Maryland. We are now building a first of its kind, 0 carbon footprint pharmaceutical inventory warehouse in North Carolina to store our ever-expanding production of pharmaceutical intermediates and pharmaceutical products. Speaking of products, I think that is a good opportunity for me to pass the baton to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Benkowitz. Thanks so much, Mike. That was perfect. Operator, you may open the lines. Thanks so much, Eun. Nice to hear your voice after – it's been a while since we've been able to see each other face-to-face. So thanks for dialing in. That question is something that I think on this call, Mike would be the – have the most detailed and ability to address. So Mike, can you give us a response on that one? Thanks, Mike. Eun, just to give you a little bit more color, as you know, my daughter has pulmonary hypertension. So I meet with a lot of parents and even their adult children with pulmonary hypertension. And I'm astonished that when I have a lunch or something with them, one of them will tell me that their daughter or their son is still taking Flolan from the old legacy pump, which weighs as much as maybe a small brick, not a brick, but small brick. And we're just talking, and I'm obviously not selling.  I'm just talking parent to parent, but I say like there are much smaller devices available and ones that can go subcutaneously. And I'm just – I know you're aware of this, I'm just curious why your daughter or son has never transitioned. And they always give the same answer, which is very resonant with what Mike just said, they said, “this has kept our child alive.” This legacy Flolan brick, if you will, has kept our daughter alive or kept our son alive. And we just don't – if it's not broken, we don't want to fix it. And so that just gives you a little bit more color on what Mike was saying that when patients have this type of condition, if the nebulizer is – I don't want to say keeping them alive because I don't think that's in the label. But if the nebulizers, what they feel, has made their pulmonary hypertension livable, it's just human nature to be very cautious about flipping that to a different therapeutic coral. Now for new patients, totally different story. If you tell somebody you want a big thing or a small thing, almost everybody will take a small thing. Thanks, Joseph. Mike, hand off to you. And what's your backup so we have them all queued up. Okay. So first, Jess, and nice to hear your voice again. And I'm excited speaking further about what Mike mentioned on the in-person presence. I'm excited to hear that JPMorgan will be fully in person this year. So congratulations on meeting our industry back to face-to-face health care conferences. So we really try to stay away from talking about decisions within the FDA and even decisions which are imminent. So we'll just leave it at that, and we'll issue the press release as soon as we get the good news. We are successfully enrolling all of our different clinical trials. It's really not possible to predict when any given trial will be completely enrolled. They are all enrolling, as we mentioned in the beginning of the remarks. And maybe just to provide a little bit of color around your question of what kind of factors are affecting enrollment in our clinical trials, I'd like to turn the microphone over to our Head of Product Development, Dr. Leigh Peterson. Leigh? Thanks so much, Dr. Peterson. And just to provide a little more color to your question, Jess, I think it has been proven over and over that clinical trial enrollment is a core competency at United Therapeutics. It's something that we do very, very well. Two examples that are out of many I could give, I myself am blown away at how our team successfully during COVID, early days, delivered our medicines to patients in Wuhan, China, the ground zero of COVID, yet we continue delivering medicines. We were able to have local clinical trial monitors, continue to take all the measurements like Dr. Peterson said.  And then a more recent example, as Dr. Peterson just said, we have the center in the Ukraine, and it's part of our outcome study. And it's a -- fortunately, they are not in the part that's actively under bombardment from the Russians, but it's not far from there. And I just -- it's just amazing to me that our team is able to work to conduct these studies even in places of very, very difficult circumstances. Of course, here in the U.S., we're able to do much better. Things are peaceful, and we've even worked out -- backed up measures with the FDA, for example, in PERFECT, where we can take endpoint measurements using things like I can't remember the exact like altimetric. It's a kind of thing that measures how much you're walking, and it's an analogy. It's a 6-minute walk endpoint studies.  So we have adapted to doing clinical trials during COVID. And I think we've adapted very, very well, as you can see from, for example, the outcomes of the INCREASE trial and the FDA approval of INCREASE and our ongoing -- all 7 of our trials are Phase III trials are enrolling. As I mentioned, we're now beginning to enroll a new Phase I trial for RemoPro. We're enrolling a Phase IV trial, Artisan. So it's a core competency of our company to carry these things out even during difficult times. Next question, please. Thanks, Andreas. While Mike is queuing up some answers to the first 2 questions that you asked, I'd like to have the xeno question addressed by Dr. Peterson because she is now also in charge of our xeno heart and xeno kidney clinical development. So she can give you a general overview of the type of things that we're doing on xeno. And before I leave the introductory part of your answer, please give our best to Already, Leigh, would you -- while you're thinking about the xeno response, so Mike, do you want to start with the first 2 questions he asked? Awesome, Mike. Totally, totally awesome. All right. Leigh, people are interested about what we can expect next on xeno. Excellent. Thank you so much, Leigh. I'm going to call on 1 more person, Pat Poisson, who is our Executive Vice President for Technical Operations. Those of you who know me know that I kind of geek out on pharma biologic manufacturing things. I just really love it. And it's amazing to manufacture a xeno kidney and xeno heart. That is a -- it's a biologic, obviously. But it requires manufacturing facilities, really the likes of which have not existed before. And it is under Pat Poisson, who is our EVP, Technical Operations, that we are building the manufacturing facility for the clinical trials that Dr. Peterson just referred to because for a clinical trial whether it's a small molecule or a biologic or a whole organ, you have to have a higher level of attention and care to GMP type of processes. So Pat, would you just have like about a minute left in the call, but if you could kind of give us an overview of the kind of stuff that you're overseeing in terms of preparing a clinical trial, if I could say, material, or organ for Dr. Peterson's trial? Thank you so much, Pat. Operator, it's been a wonderful call. Like I said at the beginning, in my opinion, the best quarter we've ever had the pleasure to share with everybody considering revenues, pipeline, even these amazing manufacturing activities. So operator, you may now wrap up the call."

And now, I will turn the call or the webcast over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of our fourth quarter 2023 financial results and the business activities of United Therapeutics. Martine?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Dewey. Good morning, everyone and a good day to those who are on the other side of the oceans. Congratulations to the 1,200 Unitherians who worked tirelessly every day to help us achieve our third straight quarter of record revenue and our second straight year of record revenue. We yet again achieved 20% plus quarterly and annual revenue growth for the fourth quarter and the full year 2023. On top of our record performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 earlier this year, we received important external validation of the value of our Tyvaso DPI business through a royalty transaction executed by our partners at MannKind Corporation. To put it simply, MannKind sold a-tenth of their 10% royalty payment stream from us, which equates to 1% of Tyvaso DPI sales and they sold it to Sagard Healthcare Partners for $150 million, plus other milestones. That implies an external valuation of the entirety of the Tyvaso DPI revenue stream of $15 billion before even factoring in the additional potential milestones. That's well above the current market cap for our entire business. And importantly, this transaction valuation is far above The Wall Street valuation of our entire company as a whole, and is for only one of our many products. At United Therapeutics, we talk about being positioned for three waves of growth and let's dive into the many reasons why we're so confident in our business. Our first wave of growth will come through our existing commercial business, led by Tyvaso in PH-ILD. We continue to post solid growth in our current business with our third consecutive quarter of record revenues for Tyvaso and revenue growth for our US Remodulin business, despite the presence of competition in the market for the past five years. Our growth in PH-ILD and continued leadership in pulmonary arterial hypertension also known as PAH has led our nebulized Tyvaso and our Tyvaso DPI products combining to become the most prescribed prostacyclin therapy in the United States. Michael will go into detail on these -- this exciting aspect of our commercial business. Our second wave of growth will come from our near-term pipeline led by the TETON studies in pulmonary fibrosis and the ADVANCE OUTCOMES study of ralinepag in PAH. These programs should enable us to continue our double-digit annual growth trend through the second half of the decade. I will provide updates on the TETON and ralinepag programs shortly. Of course, both our first and second waves of growth are subject to clinical trial outcomes, regulatory approvals, new competitive entrants and the potential impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act, but we feel good about our prospects for meeting these revenue growth targets. Our third wave of sustainable growth will come through the development manufacture and widespread use of manufactured organs and organ technologies to provide a solution to patients suffering from end-stage kidney, lung, heart and liver disease. Now moving to our near-term pipeline and second wave of growth. We have four key registration trials underway. Three, TETON studies for pulmonary fibrosis and the ADVANCE OUTCOMES study for ralinepag and oral therapy for Group 1 PAH. We also advanced our MiroliverELAP program towards the clinic with a recent and historic IND clearance by the FDA. Moving to TETON. We believe IPF represents a 100,000 patient opportunity in the United States with only two approved therapies that nearly slow lung function decline. Both TETON 1 and TETON 2 are enrolling patients. And at this time, we are aiming for full enrollment in both studies with 576 patients each by the end of this calendar year. Likewise, we believe PPF or progressive pulmonary fibrosis represents a 60,000-patient opportunity in the US alone. And this disease is quite distinct from IPF or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. One of the two FDA approved IPF therapies is also approved for PPF and as in IPF, it only slows the decline of lung function in these fragile patients. The TETON PPF study dosed its first patients in the fourth quarter of 2023 right on schedule and we expect this trial to enroll 698 patients. We believe there is a high probability of success in the three TETON studies based on the IPF subset analysis of the INCREASE study of nebulized Tyvaso in PH-ILD patients. Unlike the two IPF studies that are already on the market, nebulized Tyvaso in a safety endpoint showed an improvement -- an actual improvement of lung function in the subset of patients that had IPF along with their pulmonary hypertension. That just gives so many people so much hope. Now let's move on to ralinepag and our ADVANCE OUTCOMES study in Group I PAH, which continues to enroll patients and we expect completion of the study in 2025. We are in fact targeting 700 to 1,000 patients in this study depending on the pace of accruing clinical worsening events. Ralinepag is a next-generation selective and potent prostacyclin receptor agonist which we are developing as a once-daily oral therapy for PAH. We believe ralinepag's once-daily dosing, sustained release profile, and titratability could position it favorably against the other oral prostacyclin receptor agonists on the market as well as other therapies for PAH patients. Ralinepag provides 24-hour coverage with higher potency than the other oral prostacyclin agonists as demonstrated by in-vitro assays and ralinepag significantly demonstrated more than 20% improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance in a Phase 2 study. A long-term Phase 2 open-label study of ralinepag also showed sustained improvement in six-minute walk distance out to more than two years. A manuscript recently published in the journal Advances in Therapy describes these exciting findings. Now, while we and others have made progress at extending lives and improving patient outcomes through treprostinil and other therapies, the only known cure for PAH remains a lung transplant. That also is the case for IPF. The problem for PAH, IPF, and many other patients with end-stage organ disease is that there aren't enough donors and transplantable organs available to address the need. And for many organ donations, one life sadly must be lost to save another. We believe the best solution to this problem is to create a supply -- an unlimited supply of tolerable transplantable manufactured organs even better with an unlimited supply of organs transplant can become a consideration for therapy in countless end-stage organ diseases for which there are few good treatment options. Accordingly, we have been developing several investigational approaches using multiple technologies with different organs all with this same goal in mind. The first is our ex vivo lung perfusion service or EVLP, which has led to over 380 lives saved with lungs that have undergone EVLP in our facilities in Silver Spring, Maryland and at the Mayo Clinic Jacksonville campus. Beyond EVLP, we have four platforms xenotransplantation, regenerative medicine, 3D bioprinting, and bioartificial organs. These four platforms cover four key organs lung, heart, kidney, and liver. Starting with xenotransplantation, we continue to work with the FDA on the clinical path forward. We're underway with what we call pivotal preclinical studies in baboons at the request of the agency. Specifically, for our 10-gene program, we expect the last preclinical xeno-kidney transplant to occur in the first half of 2024. We expect to meet with the agency later this year to discuss the IND and clinical protocol for human studies for 10-gene xeno organs. In parallel with the pivotal preclinical studies, the construction of our clinical scale Designated Pathogen-Free facility or DPF in Virginia is complete and we dedicated the facility earlier this month. We expect the facility to begin receiving pigs this quarter and for the facility to grow its population through the balance of 2024 in preparation for clinical studies in humans for both xeno-kidneys and xeno-hearts. Super, super exciting and wow, just breathing so much hope into the entire transplant space. Last month, we received FDA clearance of our investigational new drug application that allows the miroliverELAP system to enter human clinical trials. By the way this non-registration study will be the first ever clinical study of a bioengineered organ. MiroliverELAP is an external liver-assist product or ELAP that is designed to provide liver support to -- in the critical care setting. Acute liver failure is a devastating condition with no approved therapies. A liver transplant is often the only way to save these patients. The ELAP is intended to give the patient's liver a chance to heal itself, possibly reducing the need for liver transplantation. We look forward to providing more details on this program in the coming quarters. I'm thrilled that we're in such a great position at United Therapeutics. We have a solid commercial business, posting record results with continued strong growth ahead, a pipeline of novel therapies that continue our strong double-digit revenue growth and a long-term plan to address one of the largest, critical, unmet medical needs in medicine all while helping our patients, employees and shareholders succeed. I'll now turn the call over to our President, Michael Benkowitz, who will give an overview of our commercial performance and expectations for potential competition this year. Michael?\nMichael Benkowitz: Thank you, Martine, and good morning everyone. As Martine noted, today we reported our highest revenue quarter ever at $615 million, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2022 and record annual revenues of more than $2.3 billion, up 20% over 2022. Importantly, we saw meaningful growth across our entire suite of products, like the Tyvaso franchise, Remodulin in the US, Orenitram and Unituxin. Starting with Orenitram, revenue of $84 million during the quarter was up 11% from the prior year. This growth reflects increases in volume, price and average dose. Following the publication of two peer-reviewed manuscripts in 2023, our medical affairs teams began providing education on data from the EXPEDITE study, which assessed the Orenitram dose achieved, after a rapid Remodulin titration and then transition to Orenitram. Worldwide Remodulin revenue of $115 million for the fourth quarter was down 6% from last year, primarily impacted by International order timing. However U.S. Remodulin revenue of $106 million was up 9%, from the fourth quarter of 2022. Remodulin both intravenous and subcutaneous remains the most prescribed Parenteral Prostacyclin in the U.S. We expect this momentum to continue in the U.S., as we had a near record number of referrals and starts during the fourth quarter, driven in part by interest in the EXPEDITE study results. Worldwide Unituxin revenue of $54 million in the fourth quarter was up 48% from the prior year quarter and U.S. Unituxin revenue of $49 million was up 34%. U.S. growth was driven by pricing volume and these volume gains were driven primarily through a modest inventory build at our distributor. International ordering driven by our partner in Japan, was strong over a comparably soft quarter in 2022. Finally, TYVASO, Worldwide TYVASO revenue was up 45% to $351 million, our highest quarter ever. U.S. revenue was up 40% to $337 million and was the highest quarter ever. U.S. growth in TYVASO was led by the continued uptake of TYVASO DPI. TYVASO nebulizer and TYVASO DPI remain the number one prescribed, prostacyclin treatment in the U.S. and they remain the only approved therapies for PH-ILD. We're pleased to report that there were no material changes in inventories of TYVASO DPI, at our Specialty Pharmacy distributors during the fourth quarter and that both distributors remain within their contracted inventory levels. The expansion of our partner MannKind's production capacity over the summer of 2023, continues to be sufficient to meet current demand and a further expansion at MannKind is expected to come online in the coming months, which will allow us to reach as many as 25,000 patients per year with TYVASO DPI. Assuming normal production operations at MannKind, we do not expect any supply constraints moving forward. Interestingly after the launch of TYVASO DPI in May of 2022, and the subsequent expected decline in revenue for Nebulizer TYVASO, we are starting to see modest sequential growth in U.S. Nebulizer TYVASO revenue, a key reminder of the importance of the Nebulizer for patients with Pulmonary Hypertension. Some physicians and patients continue to prefer the Nebulizer, because of its use profile or for reimbursement reasons. In addition, we are aware that some Pulmonologists, prefer to start and titrate their PH-ILD patients, using the Nebulizer before switching to TYVASO DPI. This allows more precise titration, in one-breath increments, compared to the three-breath equivalent increments of TYVASO DPI. We expect this platform strategy to emerge, as a competitive advantage over other potential DPI products should they reach the market. Now we've heard a lot about potential competition for TYVASO DPI and I'd like to share several reasons why we're confident, we will have the preferred dry powder inhaler for patients with PAH and PH-ILD. First, TYVASO DPI requires only one-breath per cartridge, compared to two-breaths for the potential competitor. On top of that, our low flow design requires less patient breath than potential high flow devices that may reach the market. In patients with compromised lungs, we think that the less breath required through a low-flow device will be seen as a fundamental benefit by both patients and prescribers. Next, the low flow design of Tyvaso DPI allows for consistent deep lung delivery. This means, we can achieve similar blood levels as the nebulizer with less treprostinil than high flow devices. The Dreamboat device for Tyvaso DPI requires no cleaning or maintenance, saving patients' time and effort compared to other potential devices that may reach the market. Also Tyvaso DPI is labeled for room temperature storage by patients another important convenience point. There's no maximum label dose for Tyvaso or Tyvaso DPI despite claims to the contrary by our potential competitors. And finally the BREEZE study also demonstrated 98% patient satisfaction with Tyvaso DPI. These factors coupled with the experience physicians have gained through the rapid uptake of Tyvaso DPI since launch lead us to believe that Tyvaso DPI will compete as effectively with similar product offerings in the inhaled market as Remodulin has competed with similar offerings in the parenteral market. Moving to the other potential competitor this year, the PAH community is anticipating the March FDA action date for the first potential activin signaling inhibitor for the treatment of Group 1 PAH. While we understand that there is some excitement for this new pathway and we've seen this in the past with new offerings, it's important to remember that PAH is a complex multi-factorial disease where polytherapy is the norm not the exception and treating multiple pathways of the disease aggressively and early is critical to patient outcomes. Based on the result of this new product's clinical trial and our conversations with prescribers, it is not -- it does not appear that an activin signaling inhibitor is either a cure for PAH or a replacement for prostacyclin therapy. In fact in their pivotal trial, 70% of patients were on prostacyclin therapy with 40% on a parenteral prostacyclin Remodulin. Therefore, we see this therapy as additive to our existing prostacyclin patients. And if the activin signaling inhibitor helps further improve outcomes then these patients should stay on our therapies longer. For those patients not yet on a prostacyclin therapy, PAH is a progressive disease and the vast majority of these patients will eventually need a prostacyclin. Whether that's before or after initiating activin signaling inhibitor will be case dependent. But given that polytherapy is becoming the norm, we believe Tyvaso DPI offers patients and prescribers a convenient way to cover the prostacyclin pathway earlier in a patient's disease journey. Finally, we want to remind investors that this launch will only be in Group 1 PAH and will not affect our growing PH-ILD business where the activin signaling pathway has not been studied. That brings us to the profile of treprostinil-based prostacyclins like Tyvaso Remodulin and Orenitram. We have over two decades of use and safety data to support the use of treprostinil in PAH patients. There's a correlation between prostacyclin dose and patient outcomes. Treprostinil has demonstrated improvement across a wide array of key hemodynamic parameters and no regular blood testing is required for prostacyclin use. To wrap-up, while we're entering a year of potentially increasing competition, we remain confident that we have the product portfolio, clinical data, support structures and expertise to succeed in the emerging competitive landscape. We're extremely proud of our continued record performance in this past quarter and the entire year and we think we're in the early stages of sustainable growth for our current commercial portfolio. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine to run the Q&A.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Mike. And congratulations again to you and your entire sales, commercialization, marketing, strategic operations and allied health teams that have achieved sequential record on quarters and years of growth in these products. It's just really beyond awesome. Thank you so much. Operator, you could now open up the lines for any questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Roanna Ruiz with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nRoanna Ruiz: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, I was curious if you could talk a bit about the underlying patient demand in the quarter for Tyvaso, both the DPI and the nebulizer, and any other key drivers that you're seeing. And I was curious, in terms of big picture, are you seeing anything interesting in the inventory dynamics going into first quarter this year?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks Roanna for your question. It seems Mike would be the best person on the call to answer those questions. He did touch upon those points in his introductory remarks, but Mike maybe if you can provide a little bit more color.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Yes. I think from a demand standpoint for the Tyvaso franchise, we were really happy with the demand metrics in the fourth quarter. Referrals came in at or above I can say a record fourth quarter. New patient start, which is unusual given we talk a lot about the cyclicality or the seasonality, particularly in the fourth quarter with the holidays and the fewer shipping days. So, it's really nice to see that we were able to really kind of buck that trend on the referral side. On the start side, we're pulling those through. One of the phenomenon that I had -- I've talked about in past years with respect to the fourth quarter is that, when referrals come in sometimes between -- particularly between that Thanksgiving and really end of year time period as people are settling into their holiday routines, patients are sometimes reluctant to start therapy. And so, they delay the start of the therapy until after the first of the year. And so, we did see a little bit of that on the start side, so record referrals but the percentage of those that converted to starts within the quarter as compared to prior quarters was maybe down a little bit, but we're starting to see those pull through in the first quarter. So again, that's not uncommon and we see that typically every year. So, from a demand standpoint just really, really happy with how the commercial teams are performing, the continued uptake of Tyvaso DPI, in both PAH and PH-ILD, and then generally the continued growth in the PH-ILD business. From an inventory standpoint, as Martine alluded to and as I said in my opening remarks, I think we feel really good about where we are from an inventory standpoint. MannKind is -- with the process and increased capacity improvements they made over the summer, they seem to be humming along. And so, we're able to ensure that specialty pharmacy is staying within those contractual orders. And so that's been true, I think for the last couple of quarters now. And with more capacity coming on later this year, as I said earlier, we don't really expect there to be any type of supply constraints or anomalies on the inventory side.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect. Michael, thank you so much. Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ash Verma with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAsh Verma: Hi. Congrats on the progress. Thanks for taking our questions. So, maybe just like starting off with the middle lever. Can you elaborate a little bit like what would the clinical study design look like? And then second, in terms of the DPI out-of-pocket cost with this year, with the IRA catastrophic limit implementation, would that normalize the out-of-pocket costs compared to the nebulizer? Or would we start to see more of that benefit in 2025? Thanks.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Ash, it sounds to me like you had one question on the clinical trial design for the Xeno program, and then flipped to a completely different topic on the IRA aspect. So, why don't we start with Dr. Peterson, sharing her thoughts on the clinical development way forward for Xeno. And then, Mike can share some more thoughts about reimbursement issues. Dr. Peterson?\nLeigh Peterson: Yes, sure. Yes, for the Xeno program, with regard to our 10-gene xenokidney and 10-gene xenoheart, we are continuing to conduct our IND-enabling studies with our partners at University of Maryland and John Hopkins. And we expect that these studies will finish and we will start having meetings with FDA to actually discuss the specific clinical protocols for those programs with the intent of starting the -- at least the 10-gene xenokidney study in 2025 and as well as possibility of 10-gene xenoheart.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Thanks Dr. Peterson. And Ash, I think maybe I misheard a little bit on your trial question was with regard to the ELAP study. And there I would refer you to what's posted at clinicaltrials.gov. It is the first time ever that the FDA has approved a bioengineered organ in clinical trials. That's a humongous achievement and great credit goes to Jeff Ross and his team at Miromatrix for getting us to this point. So the details that's a Phase 1 safety study you could read it on the FDA's website. But we're really excited too with so many pathways and platforms in our organ transplantation business to have the miroELAP to serve in some ways as a pathfinder, as we bring more and more types of manufactured organs into the clinic. Mike, do you want to chat on the IRA thing?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure, happy to. So Ash I think your question was with the changes to the IRA, the elimination of the catastrophic phase for patients and lowering of out-of-pocket costs, does that level the playing field from – at least from patient standpoint as – between DPI and nebulizer? And so there's still some differences between DPI and nebulizer – between Part D and Part B in terms of out-of-pocket, whether a patient has supplemental insurance in Part B, et cetera. But I think what we feel comfortable saying is that to the extent that reimbursement was a barrier to starting DPI that will largely go away with the changes to the patient out-of-pocket in Part D. And we're actually starting to see the benefit of that. And so just as a – maybe a little bit of a quick backgrounder for everybody, the 5% out-of-pocket in the catastrophic phase goes away starting this year for the patients. So the out-of-pocket for a patient right now is I think it's between around $3,000 to $3,500. And that covers all drugs. So that's not per drug, that's across all and any medications they are on. So that's their out-of-pocket for this year. That – they have to spend that before Medicare kicks in in 2024. The nice thing about 2025 is that the patients are able to spread that spend out over the 12 months and that $3500 drops to $2000. So lower amount and they can spread it out over 12 months. So because of all of those factors lower out-of-pocket, eventually able to spread it out over 12 months and covers all of the drugs, I think what we're going to see is a reduction in the utilization of our patient assistance program. And in fact we're already starting to see that. We had a surprising number of patients that were able to switch over from patient assistance to commercial drug in the first quarter. And I think once we get past the first quarter because many of our patients are on multiple therapies, I think the vast majority of these patients will have spent their out-of-pocket limit at moving into the second quarter. And so we would expect that as the year goes on fewer and fewer patients will need to come into our patient assistance program. And therefore, our PAP utilization will continue to decline over the balance of this year and then into 2025.\nMartine Rothblatt: That's great, Mike. So again, we have been well prepared for the IRA years ahead of time and all that great groundwork and preparation is certainly paying off. Is there a next question from the operator?\nOperator: Yes, the next question comes from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJessica Fye: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. You mentioned sotatercept not coming to market in PH-ILD. And I know it's sort of tough to tell but just given the investor questions we get about the pending competition in PAH, can you give us your latest thinking on the mix of Tyvaso patients being treated for PAH versus PH-ILD and how that mix might evolve going forward as PH-ILD use continues to ramp? And then if that mix is not answerable, can you elaborate on which of your treprostinil products you see as perhaps least likely to see any disruption from sotatercept? And why? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. Thanks, Jess. Good to hear your voice this morning and Mike will take your question.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Yes. So I think in terms of mix of PAH and PH-ILD with Tyvaso, we talked at your conference earlier this quarter we had said that we believe it's around 50-50. And it's not a perfectly knowable answer just because of the way that the information comes in through the referral forms, but I think it's reasonable and we feel pretty confident it's in that 50-50 mix. And that should continue to -- it should continue to increase in favor of PH-ILD as we continue to just get out and talk to prescribers. We've talked about the fact that we expanded our sales force in the second half of last year. That process is complete. Those sales representatives are training they're out in the field. And so I think as we move into the rest of 2024, we'll start to realize the benefits of the greater share of voice in PH-ILD. Those subscribers becoming more I think diligent and comfortable in screening patients and either referring them to PAH clinics or starting to treat those patients themselves with Tyvaso nebulizer or DPI. So over time I think we continue to see PH-ILD as our big growth opportunity and that mix will trend in favor of PH-ILD as we move forward. I think in terms of the -- your question on the drugs -- on which drug in PAH is least likely to be impacted. Again, as I said, I have conviction that over the long-term really there's not going to be much impact at all because all patients will need a prostacyclin at some point. So really I think it's a question of sequencing and that's going to be kind of case dependent on the patient. But coming out of the gate so to speak I would say Remodulin is probably the least likely to be impacted because patients that are on Remodulin tend to be more advanced patients more severe patients. And if the patient is either presenting with severe pulmonary hypertension I think the vast, vast majority of physicians are going to reach for Remodulin first. And as I said in my opening remarks there's really no evidence to suggest that patients are going to be switched off of a prostacyclin first to sotatercept.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Mike. Great, great answers in fact a lot of insight. Thank you. Operator next question please?\nOperator: Yes. The next question comes from Joseph Thome with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. \nJoseph Thome: Hi, there. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Maybe if you could tell us a little bit about how you expect to disclose some of the pivotal preclinical nonhuman primate data from the 10-gene transplantation program? Can you maybe talk a little bit about the translatability from the experience in baboons in humans or [Technical Difficulty] performance could be a little bit better in humans or I guess [Technical Difficulty]. Thank you. \nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. Thanks for the question. Looking forward to speaking with at our conference. Ordinarily we -- at UT we publish as much as we possibly can in the top journals in the field and as soon as we have new scientific data available to share. And for example there is going to be a review article covering all of our xenotransplantation activities in physiological reviews which is like a top five impact journal in the field coming out in just a month or two. And that will answer I think a great number of your questions in terms of the translatability of the data in the baboons, why the pig, why the 10-gene pig and how all of this will extend into human development. So you'll be seeing that publication very shortly. And like I said it's a comprehensive review that includes a number of the leading experts in the field as well as our top experts such as Dr. Peterson. Beyond that every time the FDA clears us to move to the next stage in clinical development -- we consider that as an important thing to share just like we shared in this call. The first time in the FDA's 100-or-so year history that they cleared a bioengineered organ to be into I assume in human clinical trial was our Miromatrix ELAP and we shared that at the very next call afterwards. So as the FDA shares guidance with us in terms of how to move our xenokidney and xenoheart into the clinical trials we'll positively share that with everybody in our SEC filings and on this call. And the exact protocols will as I mentioned earlier to Ash that will of course be listed on clinicaltrials.gov. Next question operator?\nOperator: The next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nHartaj Singh: Great. Thank you. Good morning everybody. Really nice quarter Martine and team, and just keep it going. I've got a question slightly differently. Martine you talked about enrolling the ralinepag studies by the end of this year, and a pretty comprehensive pipeline that seems to be filling out even more and more. Can you just talk a little bit about the cadence of events from ralinepag and the other programs through this year and next year? Not looking for any guidance, but can you just the cadence of events for enrollment potential readouts, et cetera, over the next essentially 12 to 24 months? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you for that great question, Hartaj good to hear your voice this morning. I really like the question, because a CEO probably shouldn't have favorites among their drugs anymore than among their kids. But I would say that ralinepag is unbeatable in my view, as an amazing medicine. For somebody who has a family member with pulmonary hypertension, it's pretty much of a dream drug, subject to the clinical trial outcomes, the regulatory approval, and whatever is supposed to be put on the label. But in terms of its -- the dream characteristics pills are best. I think everybody in the industry would agree with that. Secondly, once a day is better than two times a day or three times a day, I think, everybody would agree with that. Third, titratability is better than non-titratability. Everybody would agree with that. From a drug development standpoint, when you're following in on a pathway that's already been validated by the FDA that reduces risk tremendously. And then what we have is a more potent member of that same pathway. So I think everything is in favor of ralinepag. And in terms of the specifics of your question, Hartaj, of a time frame kind of expected events in terms of enrollment readout, et cetera, during 2024 and 2025, I'd like to turn the mic over to the head of the ralinepag program, our Executive Vice President for Product Development, Dr. Peterson. Leigh?\nLeigh Peterson: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. We're expecting to complete enrollment where -- I mean, as you well know this study is based on the accumulation of outcome events with regard to clinical worsening. And so what how the study is designed is that we complete enrollment and then we follow the patients for a six-month period for a standard follow-up time frame as well as until the pre-specified number of events are accumulated, which gives the best statistical significance to determine the difference between the active group and the placebo. So, given all of that, we are targeting enrollment to be completed this year. And -- but really the driver for the study completion is accumulation of the required number of events. Now these patients are on dual back -- most of them are on dual background therapy. And so we're tracking that very, very carefully as to the accumulation of these events. And again, we're targeting that our events will be accumulated as well as completion of the six-month follow-up period during 2025.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect. Thank you so much Dr. Peterson. Operator, are there any more questions?\nOperator: Yes. One more question, Andreas Argyrides with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndreas Argyrides : Good morning and thanks for squeezing our questions. And again, congrats on all the progress this quarter. Just two from us here. On the competitor front, how are you seeing safety playing a key role in adoption for new therapies? And then also as we get closer to TETON readouts, how are you thinking about the opportunity for Tyvaso in IPF and where it fits in the treatment landscape? And then just one more to squeeze in. You have quite a bit of cash. You were busy on the BD front last quarter. How are you thinking about business development opportunities and areas you pursue going forward? Thanks so much.\nMartine Rothblatt: All right. Well, let's see last and also the most questions. Okay. So, we're going to have a kind of a roundtable talking about here. So we're going to go back to front. Our -- all capital allocation questions at United Therapeutics are under the management and guidance of our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond. So, I'm going to have him speak, first. And then with regard to, the competitive product positioning Mike, will have a few words to say. And finally, third and wrap up hitter here, Dr. Peterson, if you could share some thoughts about monitoring safety aspects in clinical trials. So that – maybe, you could share a little bit about the amazing job our clinical operations team does, in terms of ensuring safety and our stellar pharmaco vigilance and drug safety group. I think at United Therapeutics safety is I would say, our only priority. Nothing ever bumps safety. So James, can you speak about the capital allocation?\nJames Edgemond: Yes. Thank you, Martine. Andreas, it's good to hear your voice this morning. I think you had two questions kind of weaved in, and I'll start with capital allocation, and then corporate development. But our capital allocation priorities Andreas, are still unchanged. We have three priorities in order, which are internal research and development, business and corporate development and then return of capital to shareholders. And we see ample opportunities to invest in ourselves in complementary businesses, at this time. And at the JPMorgan conference in January, Martine laid out the need to quickly access and deploy capital to support the potential commercial scale build-out of DPS facilities. And this could be several billions of dollars of CapEx over the next several years. And so, there was a good discussion at the conference, with respect to capital allocation and specifically looking at manufactured organs. Now with respect to business and corporate development, we are constantly looking for potential acquisitions and also in-license opportunities. We tend to be most interested in complementary products and platforms that focus on rare lung and other cardiovascular diseases. But as you've also seen recently, that we disclosed in the 10-K, we did a couple of acquisitions being IVIVA and Miromatrix. They were focused on organ manufacturing. So we're looking across the board, and things that really complement the strengths of Unitherians internally and add to the research and development we're doing. So thank you for the question. And Martine, back to you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. I'm going to bounce it over to Mike, to talk about the...\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes. So I think Andreas, your first question was leading to sort of safety questions, with new therapies and how that's -- how we think about that and how that's typically handled. And really I think it's a question, as it relates to competitors, I think it's really a question for prescribers and for those manufacturers, to be honest. I think there is a safety profile that's presented as part of the clinical efficacy, and I think the physicians have to kind of look at that and the way the benefit/risk of that product, relative to the patient's disease other products that are available. And then as I said at the very beginning, it really kind of comes down to a case dependent decision. So, we'll just kind of see, how that plays out over time.\nJames Edgemond: Great. All right. Well, Leigh I think you're off the hook, because I think Mike commented enough on the safety question. And operator, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation Earnings Webcast. A rebroadcast of this webcast will be available for replay for one week by visiting the Events and Presentations section of the United Therapeutics Investor Relations website at ir.unither.com. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Benkowitz",
            "content": "Thank you, Martine, and good morning everyone. As Martine noted, today we reported our highest revenue quarter ever at $615 million, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2022 and record annual revenues of more than $2.3 billion, up 20% over 2022. Importantly, we saw meaningful growth across our entire suite of products, like the Tyvaso franchise, Remodulin in the US, Orenitram and Unituxin. Starting with Orenitram, revenue of $84 million during the quarter was up 11% from the prior year. This growth reflects increases in volume, price and average dose. Following the publication of two peer-reviewed manuscripts in 2023, our medical affairs teams began providing education on data from the EXPEDITE study, which assessed the Orenitram dose achieved, after a rapid Remodulin titration and then transition to Orenitram. Worldwide Remodulin revenue of $115 million for the fourth quarter was down 6% from last year, primarily impacted by International order timing. However U.S. Remodulin revenue of $106 million was up 9%, from the fourth quarter of 2022. Remodulin both intravenous and subcutaneous remains the most prescribed Parenteral Prostacyclin in the U.S. We expect this momentum to continue in the U.S., as we had a near record number of referrals and starts during the fourth quarter, driven in part by interest in the EXPEDITE study results. Worldwide Unituxin revenue of $54 million in the fourth quarter was up 48% from the prior year quarter and U.S. Unituxin revenue of $49 million was up 34%. U.S. growth was driven by pricing volume and these volume gains were driven primarily through a modest inventory build at our distributor. International ordering driven by our partner in Japan, was strong over a comparably soft quarter in 2022. Finally, TYVASO, Worldwide TYVASO revenue was up 45% to $351 million, our highest quarter ever. U.S. revenue was up 40% to $337 million and was the highest quarter ever. U.S. growth in TYVASO was led by the continued uptake of TYVASO DPI. TYVASO nebulizer and TYVASO DPI remain the number one prescribed, prostacyclin treatment in the U.S. and they remain the only approved therapies for PH-ILD. We're pleased to report that there were no material changes in inventories of TYVASO DPI, at our Specialty Pharmacy distributors during the fourth quarter and that both distributors remain within their contracted inventory levels. The expansion of our partner MannKind's production capacity over the summer of 2023, continues to be sufficient to meet current demand and a further expansion at MannKind is expected to come online in the coming months, which will allow us to reach as many as 25,000 patients per year with TYVASO DPI. Assuming normal production operations at MannKind, we do not expect any supply constraints moving forward. Interestingly after the launch of TYVASO DPI in May of 2022, and the subsequent expected decline in revenue for Nebulizer TYVASO, we are starting to see modest sequential growth in U.S. Nebulizer TYVASO revenue, a key reminder of the importance of the Nebulizer for patients with Pulmonary Hypertension. Some physicians and patients continue to prefer the Nebulizer, because of its use profile or for reimbursement reasons. In addition, we are aware that some Pulmonologists, prefer to start and titrate their PH-ILD patients, using the Nebulizer before switching to TYVASO DPI. This allows more precise titration, in one-breath increments, compared to the three-breath equivalent increments of TYVASO DPI. We expect this platform strategy to emerge, as a competitive advantage over other potential DPI products should they reach the market. Now we've heard a lot about potential competition for TYVASO DPI and I'd like to share several reasons why we're confident, we will have the preferred dry powder inhaler for patients with PAH and PH-ILD. First, TYVASO DPI requires only one-breath per cartridge, compared to two-breaths for the potential competitor. On top of that, our low flow design requires less patient breath than potential high flow devices that may reach the market. In patients with compromised lungs, we think that the less breath required through a low-flow device will be seen as a fundamental benefit by both patients and prescribers. Next, the low flow design of Tyvaso DPI allows for consistent deep lung delivery. This means, we can achieve similar blood levels as the nebulizer with less treprostinil than high flow devices. The Dreamboat device for Tyvaso DPI requires no cleaning or maintenance, saving patients' time and effort compared to other potential devices that may reach the market. Also Tyvaso DPI is labeled for room temperature storage by patients another important convenience point. There's no maximum label dose for Tyvaso or Tyvaso DPI despite claims to the contrary by our potential competitors. And finally the BREEZE study also demonstrated 98% patient satisfaction with Tyvaso DPI. These factors coupled with the experience physicians have gained through the rapid uptake of Tyvaso DPI since launch lead us to believe that Tyvaso DPI will compete as effectively with similar product offerings in the inhaled market as Remodulin has competed with similar offerings in the parenteral market. Moving to the other potential competitor this year, the PAH community is anticipating the March FDA action date for the first potential activin signaling inhibitor for the treatment of Group 1 PAH. While we understand that there is some excitement for this new pathway and we've seen this in the past with new offerings, it's important to remember that PAH is a complex multi-factorial disease where polytherapy is the norm not the exception and treating multiple pathways of the disease aggressively and early is critical to patient outcomes. Based on the result of this new product's clinical trial and our conversations with prescribers, it is not -- it does not appear that an activin signaling inhibitor is either a cure for PAH or a replacement for prostacyclin therapy. In fact in their pivotal trial, 70% of patients were on prostacyclin therapy with 40% on a parenteral prostacyclin Remodulin. Therefore, we see this therapy as additive to our existing prostacyclin patients. And if the activin signaling inhibitor helps further improve outcomes then these patients should stay on our therapies longer. For those patients not yet on a prostacyclin therapy, PAH is a progressive disease and the vast majority of these patients will eventually need a prostacyclin. Whether that's before or after initiating activin signaling inhibitor will be case dependent. But given that polytherapy is becoming the norm, we believe Tyvaso DPI offers patients and prescribers a convenient way to cover the prostacyclin pathway earlier in a patient's disease journey. Finally, we want to remind investors that this launch will only be in Group 1 PAH and will not affect our growing PH-ILD business where the activin signaling pathway has not been studied. That brings us to the profile of treprostinil-based prostacyclins like Tyvaso Remodulin and Orenitram. We have over two decades of use and safety data to support the use of treprostinil in PAH patients. There's a correlation between prostacyclin dose and patient outcomes. Treprostinil has demonstrated improvement across a wide array of key hemodynamic parameters and no regular blood testing is required for prostacyclin use. To wrap-up, while we're entering a year of potentially increasing competition, we remain confident that we have the product portfolio, clinical data, support structures and expertise to succeed in the emerging competitive landscape. We're extremely proud of our continued record performance in this past quarter and the entire year and we think we're in the early stages of sustainable growth for our current commercial portfolio. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine to run the Q&A. Sure. Yes. I think from a demand standpoint for the Tyvaso franchise, we were really happy with the demand metrics in the fourth quarter. Referrals came in at or above I can say a record fourth quarter. New patient start, which is unusual given we talk a lot about the cyclicality or the seasonality, particularly in the fourth quarter with the holidays and the fewer shipping days. So, it's really nice to see that we were able to really kind of buck that trend on the referral side. On the start side, we're pulling those through. One of the phenomenon that I had -- I've talked about in past years with respect to the fourth quarter is that, when referrals come in sometimes between -- particularly between that Thanksgiving and really end of year time period as people are settling into their holiday routines, patients are sometimes reluctant to start therapy. And so, they delay the start of the therapy until after the first of the year. And so, we did see a little bit of that on the start side, so record referrals but the percentage of those that converted to starts within the quarter as compared to prior quarters was maybe down a little bit, but we're starting to see those pull through in the first quarter. So again, that's not uncommon and we see that typically every year. So, from a demand standpoint just really, really happy with how the commercial teams are performing, the continued uptake of Tyvaso DPI, in both PAH and PH-ILD, and then generally the continued growth in the PH-ILD business. From an inventory standpoint, as Martine alluded to and as I said in my opening remarks, I think we feel really good about where we are from an inventory standpoint. MannKind is -- with the process and increased capacity improvements they made over the summer, they seem to be humming along. And so, we're able to ensure that specialty pharmacy is staying within those contractual orders. And so that's been true, I think for the last couple of quarters now. And with more capacity coming on later this year, as I said earlier, we don't really expect there to be any type of supply constraints or anomalies on the inventory side. Sure, happy to. So Ash I think your question was with the changes to the IRA, the elimination of the catastrophic phase for patients and lowering of out-of-pocket costs, does that level the playing field from – at least from patient standpoint as – between DPI and nebulizer? And so there's still some differences between DPI and nebulizer – between Part D and Part B in terms of out-of-pocket, whether a patient has supplemental insurance in Part B, et cetera. But I think what we feel comfortable saying is that to the extent that reimbursement was a barrier to starting DPI that will largely go away with the changes to the patient out-of-pocket in Part D. And we're actually starting to see the benefit of that. And so just as a – maybe a little bit of a quick backgrounder for everybody, the 5% out-of-pocket in the catastrophic phase goes away starting this year for the patients. So the out-of-pocket for a patient right now is I think it's between around $3,000 to $3,500. And that covers all drugs. So that's not per drug, that's across all and any medications they are on. So that's their out-of-pocket for this year. That – they have to spend that before Medicare kicks in in 2024. The nice thing about 2025 is that the patients are able to spread that spend out over the 12 months and that $3500 drops to $2000. So lower amount and they can spread it out over 12 months. So because of all of those factors lower out-of-pocket, eventually able to spread it out over 12 months and covers all of the drugs, I think what we're going to see is a reduction in the utilization of our patient assistance program. And in fact we're already starting to see that. We had a surprising number of patients that were able to switch over from patient assistance to commercial drug in the first quarter. And I think once we get past the first quarter because many of our patients are on multiple therapies, I think the vast majority of these patients will have spent their out-of-pocket limit at moving into the second quarter. And so we would expect that as the year goes on fewer and fewer patients will need to come into our patient assistance program. And therefore, our PAP utilization will continue to decline over the balance of this year and then into 2025. Sure. Yes. So I think in terms of mix of PAH and PH-ILD with Tyvaso, we talked at your conference earlier this quarter we had said that we believe it's around 50-50. And it's not a perfectly knowable answer just because of the way that the information comes in through the referral forms, but I think it's reasonable and we feel pretty confident it's in that 50-50 mix. And that should continue to -- it should continue to increase in favor of PH-ILD as we continue to just get out and talk to prescribers. We've talked about the fact that we expanded our sales force in the second half of last year. That process is complete. Those sales representatives are training they're out in the field. And so I think as we move into the rest of 2024, we'll start to realize the benefits of the greater share of voice in PH-ILD. Those subscribers becoming more I think diligent and comfortable in screening patients and either referring them to PAH clinics or starting to treat those patients themselves with Tyvaso nebulizer or DPI. So over time I think we continue to see PH-ILD as our big growth opportunity and that mix will trend in favor of PH-ILD as we move forward. I think in terms of the -- your question on the drugs -- on which drug in PAH is least likely to be impacted. Again, as I said, I have conviction that over the long-term really there's not going to be much impact at all because all patients will need a prostacyclin at some point. So really I think it's a question of sequencing and that's going to be kind of case dependent on the patient. But coming out of the gate so to speak I would say Remodulin is probably the least likely to be impacted because patients that are on Remodulin tend to be more advanced patients more severe patients. And if the patient is either presenting with severe pulmonary hypertension I think the vast, vast majority of physicians are going to reach for Remodulin first. And as I said in my opening remarks there's really no evidence to suggest that patients are going to be switched off of a prostacyclin first to sotatercept. Yes. So I think Andreas, your first question was leading to sort of safety questions, with new therapies and how that's -- how we think about that and how that's typically handled. And really I think it's a question, as it relates to competitors, I think it's really a question for prescribers and for those manufacturers, to be honest. I think there is a safety profile that's presented as part of the clinical efficacy, and I think the physicians have to kind of look at that and the way the benefit/risk of that product, relative to the patient's disease other products that are available. And then as I said at the very beginning, it really kind of comes down to a case dependent decision. So, we'll just kind of see, how that plays out over time."

Yes, for the Xeno program, with regard to our 10-gene xenokidney and 10-gene xenoheart, we are continuing to conduct our IND-enabling studies with our partners at University of Maryland and John Hopkins. And we expect that these studies will finish and we will start having meetings with FDA to actually discuss the specific clinical protocols for those programs with the intent of starting the -- at least the 10-gene xenokidney study in 2025 and as well as possibility of 10-gene xenoheart. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. We're expecting to complete enrollment where -- I mean, as you well know this study is based on the accumulation of outcome events with regard to clinical worsening. And so what how the study is designed is that we complete enrollment and then we follow the patients for a six-month period for a standard follow-up time frame as well as until the pre-specified number of events are accumulated, which gives the best statistical significance to determine the difference between the active group and the placebo. So, given all of that, we are targeting enrollment to be completed this year. And -- but really the driver for the study completion is accumulation of the required number of events. Now these patients are on dual back -- most of them are on dual background therapy. And so we're tracking that very, very carefully as to the accumulation of these events. And again, we're targeting that our events will be accumulated as well as completion of the six-month follow-up period during 2025."

            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thank you, Dewey. Good morning, everyone and a good day to those who are on the other side of the oceans. Congratulations to the 1,200 Unitherians who worked tirelessly every day to help us achieve our third straight quarter of record revenue and our second straight year of record revenue. We yet again achieved 20% plus quarterly and annual revenue growth for the fourth quarter and the full year 2023. On top of our record performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 earlier this year, we received important external validation of the value of our Tyvaso DPI business through a royalty transaction executed by our partners at MannKind Corporation. To put it simply, MannKind sold a-tenth of their 10% royalty payment stream from us, which equates to 1% of Tyvaso DPI sales and they sold it to Sagard Healthcare Partners for $150 million, plus other milestones. That implies an external valuation of the entirety of the Tyvaso DPI revenue stream of $15 billion before even factoring in the additional potential milestones. That's well above the current market cap for our entire business. And importantly, this transaction valuation is far above The Wall Street valuation of our entire company as a whole, and is for only one of our many products. At United Therapeutics, we talk about being positioned for three waves of growth and let's dive into the many reasons why we're so confident in our business. Our first wave of growth will come through our existing commercial business, led by Tyvaso in PH-ILD. We continue to post solid growth in our current business with our third consecutive quarter of record revenues for Tyvaso and revenue growth for our US Remodulin business, despite the presence of competition in the market for the past five years. Our growth in PH-ILD and continued leadership in pulmonary arterial hypertension also known as PAH has led our nebulized Tyvaso and our Tyvaso DPI products combining to become the most prescribed prostacyclin therapy in the United States. Michael will go into detail on these -- this exciting aspect of our commercial business. Our second wave of growth will come from our near-term pipeline led by the TETON studies in pulmonary fibrosis and the ADVANCE OUTCOMES study of ralinepag in PAH. These programs should enable us to continue our double-digit annual growth trend through the second half of the decade. I will provide updates on the TETON and ralinepag programs shortly. Of course, both our first and second waves of growth are subject to clinical trial outcomes, regulatory approvals, new competitive entrants and the potential impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act, but we feel good about our prospects for meeting these revenue growth targets. Our third wave of sustainable growth will come through the development manufacture and widespread use of manufactured organs and organ technologies to provide a solution to patients suffering from end-stage kidney, lung, heart and liver disease. Now moving to our near-term pipeline and second wave of growth. We have four key registration trials underway. Three, TETON studies for pulmonary fibrosis and the ADVANCE OUTCOMES study for ralinepag and oral therapy for Group 1 PAH. We also advanced our MiroliverELAP program towards the clinic with a recent and historic IND clearance by the FDA. Moving to TETON. We believe IPF represents a 100,000 patient opportunity in the United States with only two approved therapies that nearly slow lung function decline. Both TETON 1 and TETON 2 are enrolling patients. And at this time, we are aiming for full enrollment in both studies with 576 patients each by the end of this calendar year. Likewise, we believe PPF or progressive pulmonary fibrosis represents a 60,000-patient opportunity in the US alone. And this disease is quite distinct from IPF or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. One of the two FDA approved IPF therapies is also approved for PPF and as in IPF, it only slows the decline of lung function in these fragile patients. The TETON PPF study dosed its first patients in the fourth quarter of 2023 right on schedule and we expect this trial to enroll 698 patients. We believe there is a high probability of success in the three TETON studies based on the IPF subset analysis of the INCREASE study of nebulized Tyvaso in PH-ILD patients. Unlike the two IPF studies that are already on the market, nebulized Tyvaso in a safety endpoint showed an improvement -- an actual improvement of lung function in the subset of patients that had IPF along with their pulmonary hypertension. That just gives so many people so much hope. Now let's move on to ralinepag and our ADVANCE OUTCOMES study in Group I PAH, which continues to enroll patients and we expect completion of the study in 2025. We are in fact targeting 700 to 1,000 patients in this study depending on the pace of accruing clinical worsening events. Ralinepag is a next-generation selective and potent prostacyclin receptor agonist which we are developing as a once-daily oral therapy for PAH. We believe ralinepag's once-daily dosing, sustained release profile, and titratability could position it favorably against the other oral prostacyclin receptor agonists on the market as well as other therapies for PAH patients. Ralinepag provides 24-hour coverage with higher potency than the other oral prostacyclin agonists as demonstrated by in-vitro assays and ralinepag significantly demonstrated more than 20% improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance in a Phase 2 study. A long-term Phase 2 open-label study of ralinepag also showed sustained improvement in six-minute walk distance out to more than two years. A manuscript recently published in the journal Advances in Therapy describes these exciting findings. Now, while we and others have made progress at extending lives and improving patient outcomes through treprostinil and other therapies, the only known cure for PAH remains a lung transplant. That also is the case for IPF. The problem for PAH, IPF, and many other patients with end-stage organ disease is that there aren't enough donors and transplantable organs available to address the need. And for many organ donations, one life sadly must be lost to save another. We believe the best solution to this problem is to create a supply -- an unlimited supply of tolerable transplantable manufactured organs even better with an unlimited supply of organs transplant can become a consideration for therapy in countless end-stage organ diseases for which there are few good treatment options. Accordingly, we have been developing several investigational approaches using multiple technologies with different organs all with this same goal in mind. The first is our ex vivo lung perfusion service or EVLP, which has led to over 380 lives saved with lungs that have undergone EVLP in our facilities in Silver Spring, Maryland and at the Mayo Clinic Jacksonville campus. Beyond EVLP, we have four platforms xenotransplantation, regenerative medicine, 3D bioprinting, and bioartificial organs. These four platforms cover four key organs lung, heart, kidney, and liver. Starting with xenotransplantation, we continue to work with the FDA on the clinical path forward. We're underway with what we call pivotal preclinical studies in baboons at the request of the agency. Specifically, for our 10-gene program, we expect the last preclinical xeno-kidney transplant to occur in the first half of 2024. We expect to meet with the agency later this year to discuss the IND and clinical protocol for human studies for 10-gene xeno organs. In parallel with the pivotal preclinical studies, the construction of our clinical scale Designated Pathogen-Free facility or DPF in Virginia is complete and we dedicated the facility earlier this month. We expect the facility to begin receiving pigs this quarter and for the facility to grow its population through the balance of 2024 in preparation for clinical studies in humans for both xeno-kidneys and xeno-hearts. Super, super exciting and wow, just breathing so much hope into the entire transplant space. Last month, we received FDA clearance of our investigational new drug application that allows the miroliverELAP system to enter human clinical trials. By the way this non-registration study will be the first ever clinical study of a bioengineered organ. MiroliverELAP is an external liver-assist product or ELAP that is designed to provide liver support to -- in the critical care setting. Acute liver failure is a devastating condition with no approved therapies. A liver transplant is often the only way to save these patients. The ELAP is intended to give the patient's liver a chance to heal itself, possibly reducing the need for liver transplantation. We look forward to providing more details on this program in the coming quarters. I'm thrilled that we're in such a great position at United Therapeutics. We have a solid commercial business, posting record results with continued strong growth ahead, a pipeline of novel therapies that continue our strong double-digit revenue growth and a long-term plan to address one of the largest, critical, unmet medical needs in medicine all while helping our patients, employees and shareholders succeed. I'll now turn the call over to our President, Michael Benkowitz, who will give an overview of our commercial performance and expectations for potential competition this year. Michael? Thanks, Mike. And congratulations again to you and your entire sales, commercialization, marketing, strategic operations and allied health teams that have achieved sequential record on quarters and years of growth in these products. It's just really beyond awesome. Thank you so much. Operator, you could now open up the lines for any questions. Thanks Roanna for your question. It seems Mike would be the best person on the call to answer those questions. He did touch upon those points in his introductory remarks, but Mike maybe if you can provide a little bit more color. Perfect. Michael, thank you so much. Operator, next question. Okay. Ash, it sounds to me like you had one question on the clinical trial design for the Xeno program, and then flipped to a completely different topic on the IRA aspect. So, why don't we start with Dr. Peterson, sharing her thoughts on the clinical development way forward for Xeno. And then, Mike can share some more thoughts about reimbursement issues. Dr. Peterson? Okay. Thanks Dr. Peterson. And Ash, I think maybe I misheard a little bit on your trial question was with regard to the ELAP study. And there I would refer you to what's posted at clinicaltrials.gov. It is the first time ever that the FDA has approved a bioengineered organ in clinical trials. That's a humongous achievement and great credit goes to Jeff Ross and his team at Miromatrix for getting us to this point. So the details that's a Phase 1 safety study you could read it on the FDA's website. But we're really excited too with so many pathways and platforms in our organ transplantation business to have the miroELAP to serve in some ways as a pathfinder, as we bring more and more types of manufactured organs into the clinic. Mike, do you want to chat on the IRA thing? That's great, Mike. So again, we have been well prepared for the IRA years ahead of time and all that great groundwork and preparation is certainly paying off. Is there a next question from the operator? Yes. Thanks, Jess. Good to hear your voice this morning and Mike will take your question. Thanks, Mike. Great, great answers in fact a lot of insight. Thank you. Operator next question please? Yes. Thanks for the question. Looking forward to speaking with at our conference. Ordinarily we -- at UT we publish as much as we possibly can in the top journals in the field and as soon as we have new scientific data available to share. And for example there is going to be a review article covering all of our xenotransplantation activities in physiological reviews which is like a top five impact journal in the field coming out in just a month or two. And that will answer I think a great number of your questions in terms of the translatability of the data in the baboons, why the pig, why the 10-gene pig and how all of this will extend into human development. So you'll be seeing that publication very shortly. And like I said it's a comprehensive review that includes a number of the leading experts in the field as well as our top experts such as Dr. Peterson. Beyond that every time the FDA clears us to move to the next stage in clinical development -- we consider that as an important thing to share just like we shared in this call. The first time in the FDA's 100-or-so year history that they cleared a bioengineered organ to be into I assume in human clinical trial was our Miromatrix ELAP and we shared that at the very next call afterwards. So as the FDA shares guidance with us in terms of how to move our xenokidney and xenoheart into the clinical trials we'll positively share that with everybody in our SEC filings and on this call. And the exact protocols will as I mentioned earlier to Ash that will of course be listed on clinicaltrials.gov. Next question operator? Thank you for that great question, Hartaj good to hear your voice this morning. I really like the question, because a CEO probably shouldn't have favorites among their drugs anymore than among their kids. But I would say that ralinepag is unbeatable in my view, as an amazing medicine. For somebody who has a family member with pulmonary hypertension, it's pretty much of a dream drug, subject to the clinical trial outcomes, the regulatory approval, and whatever is supposed to be put on the label. But in terms of its -- the dream characteristics pills are best. I think everybody in the industry would agree with that. Secondly, once a day is better than two times a day or three times a day, I think, everybody would agree with that. Third, titratability is better than non-titratability. Everybody would agree with that. From a drug development standpoint, when you're following in on a pathway that's already been validated by the FDA that reduces risk tremendously. And then what we have is a more potent member of that same pathway. So I think everything is in favor of ralinepag. And in terms of the specifics of your question, Hartaj, of a time frame kind of expected events in terms of enrollment readout, et cetera, during 2024 and 2025, I'd like to turn the mic over to the head of the ralinepag program, our Executive Vice President for Product Development, Dr. Peterson. Leigh? Perfect. Thank you so much Dr. Peterson. Operator, are there any more questions? All right. Well, let's see last and also the most questions. Okay. So, we're going to have a kind of a roundtable talking about here. So we're going to go back to front. Our -- all capital allocation questions at United Therapeutics are under the management and guidance of our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond. So, I'm going to have him speak, first. And then with regard to, the competitive product positioning Mike, will have a few words to say. And finally, third and wrap up hitter here, Dr. Peterson, if you could share some thoughts about monitoring safety aspects in clinical trials. So that – maybe, you could share a little bit about the amazing job our clinical operations team does, in terms of ensuring safety and our stellar pharmaco vigilance and drug safety group. I think at United Therapeutics safety is I would say, our only priority. Nothing ever bumps safety. So James, can you speak about the capital allocation? Yes. I'm going to bounce it over to Mike, to talk about the..."

I think you had two questions kind of weaved in, and I'll start with capital allocation, and then corporate development. But our capital allocation priorities Andreas, are still unchanged. We have three priorities in order, which are internal research and development, business and corporate development and then return of capital to shareholders. And we see ample opportunities to invest in ourselves in complementary businesses, at this time. And at the JPMorgan conference in January, Martine laid out the need to quickly access and deploy capital to support the potential commercial scale build-out of DPS facilities. And this could be several billions of dollars of CapEx over the next several years. And so, there was a good discussion at the conference, with respect to capital allocation and specifically looking at manufactured organs. Now with respect to business and corporate development, we are constantly looking for potential acquisitions and also in-license opportunities. We tend to be most interested in complementary products and platforms that focus on rare lung and other cardiovascular diseases. But as you've also seen recently, that we disclosed in the 10-K, we did a couple of acquisitions being IVIVA and Miromatrix. They were focused on organ manufacturing. So we're looking across the board, and things that really complement the strengths of Unitherians internally and add to the research and development we're doing. So thank you for the question. And Martine, back to you. Great. All right. Well, Leigh I think you're off the hook, because I think Mike commented enough on the safety question. And operator, back to you."

Now I’ll turn the call over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of our third quarter 2023 financial results and the business activities of United Therapeutics. Martine?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Dewey. First off, I’d like to congratulate our team as we had an amazing third quarter for the second quarter in a row. I’m thrilled to report our highest quarterly revenue ever along with double-digit revenue growth as compared to the third quarter of 2022. On top of that, our operational efficiency in the third quarter resulted in one of our highest quarterly net incomes and earnings per share ever. At United Therapeutics, we’re uniquely positioned for three waves of growth with a profile that’s unique in biotechs. Our first wave of growth will come through our existing commercial business led by Tyvaso and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease or PH-ILD. We continue to post solid growth in our current business with record quarterly revenue and patients on therapy for treprostinil products as a whole. Our growth in PH-ILD and continue leadership in pulmonary arterial hypertension or PAH has led to nebulized Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI products combining to become the most prescribed prostacyclin therapy in the U.S. Michael will go into detail on our commercial business later in this call. We believe this growth will continue in the near term and we expect at least a $4 billion annual revenue run rate by mid decades doubling our revenue from 2022 and implying a double-digit compound annual growth rate. Our second wave of growth will come from our near-term pipeline led by the TETON program in pulmonary fibrosis and ralinepag in PAH. These two products, if approved, could lead our revenue to double again to $8 billion by the end of the decade. I will provide updates on the TETON and ralinepag program shortly. Of course, both of our first and second waves of growth are subject to clinical trial outcomes, regulatory approvals, new competitive entrants [ph], and the potential impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act. But we feel good about our prospects for meeting these revenue aspirations. Our third wave of sustainable growth will come through the development, manufacturer and widespread use of manufactured organs and organ technologies to provide a solution to patients experiencing end stage kidney, lung, heart, and liver disease. Moving to our near-term pipeline and second wave of growth, we have two key registration programs underway, TETON for pulmonary fibrosis, and ralinepag an oral therapy for Group 1 PAH. TETON now consists of three registration studies, TETON 1 and TETON 2 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF and now TETON PPF for progressive pulmonary fibrosis. We believe IPF represents a 100,000 patient opportunity in the United States with only two approved therapies that just slow lung function decline. Both TETON 1 and TETON 2 are enrolling patients. And at this time, we are aiming for full enrollment in both studies with 576 patients each by the end of 2024. Likewise, we believe PPF represents up to a 60,000 patient opportunity in the U.S., which is distinct from IPF. One of the two FDA approved IPF therapies is also approved for PPF and liking IPF it only slows the decline of lung function in these fragile patients. As we reported earlier this week, the TETON PPF study has dosed its first patient. We expect this trial to enroll 698 patients. We believe there is a relatively high probability of success in the three TETON studies based on an IPF subset of the increased study of nebulized Tyvaso in PH-ILD patients. Unlike the two IPF therapies on market, nebulized Tyvaso in a safety endpoint showed in an improvement of lung function in the subset of patients that had IPF along with pulmonary hypertension. We’re also encouraged by a recent review by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee of data from 550 patients in the TETON 1 and TETON 2 studies. The committee completed a routine unblinded safety review of data from these patients and unanimously recommended continuation of both trials without modification [ph]. Our advanced outcome study of ralinepag in Group 1 PAH continues to enroll patients. And at this time we are targeting completion of the study in 2025. Ralinepag is a next generation selective and potent prostacyclin receptor agonist, and we are developing it as a once daily oral therapy for PAH. We believe ralinepag in once daily dosing sustained release profile and titratability could position it favorably against the other oral prostacyclin receptor agonist as well as other therapies currently available for PAH patients. Ralinepag provides 24-hour coverage with 6.5x to 10x the potency of the other oral prostacyclin receptor agonist on the market and ralinepag demonstrated more than 20% improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance in Phase 2 studies. That’s close to the improvement observed in intravenous epoprostenol. Long-term Phase 2 open-label studies of ralinepag also showed sustained improvement in six-minute walk distance. We are pleased to announce that the Data Safety Monitoring Committee for the advanced outcome study met for the fourth time last month and unanimously recommended the continuation of the trial without modification after evaluating unblinded data from 510 patients enrolled in the study. We are targeting 700 patients to a 1,000 patients in the study, depending on the pace of accruing clinical worsening events. Moving to our organ programs, we have been developing several investigational approaches using different technologies with different organs. The first is our ex-vivo lung perfusion service or EVLP, which has led to over 350 lives saved with lungs that have undergone EVLP. We’re also developing xenotransplantation products consisting of hearts and kidneys. Finally, we’ve been working on 3-D printing and regenerative medicine technologies to develop manufactured lungs and kidneys. At United Therapeutics, we always want multiple shots on goal. To that end, we recently acquired privately held IVIVA Medical based out of Woburn, Massachusetts. IVIVA’s core technology is an engineered kidney implant that mimics native kidney elements with a simple architecture to achieve implantable, durable blood purification much like a native kidney. IVIVA’s kidney is seated with a patient’s own cells, eliminating the need for immunosuppression. Also, earlier this week we announced an agreement to acquire publicly traded Miromatrix Medical, a company focused on ending the waiting list for organ transplantation. Miromatrix utilizes an organ manufacturing platform that consists of decellularized porcine organs that are then cellularized with cells derived from non-transplantable donor human organs. These organ constructs are intended to replace some of the functionality of human organs using standard organ transplantation techniques and immunosuppression regimens. Miromatrix has three key programs that would broaden our existing manufactured organ pipeline. MiroliverELAP, which is ex-vivo or outside the body and intended to provide temporary external liver dialysis for acute liver failure. Mirokidney, a fully-implanted kidney and Miroliver, a fully-implantable liver. Moving to Xenotransplantation. We continue to work with the FDA on a clinical path forward. We're underway with what we call pivotal preclinical studies in baboons at the request of the FDA. Specifically, for our 10-gene program we expect the last preclinical xenokidney transplant to occur in early 2024. After collecting the data we'll meet with the FDA to discuss the IND and clinical protocol for human studies for our 10-gene xeno organs. In parallel with the pivotal preclinical studies, we're wrapping up construction of our clinical stage designated pathogen-free facility or DPF, in Virginia. We expect the facility to begin receiving pigs in early 2024 and for the facility to grow its population through the balance of 2024 in preparation for clinical studies in humans for both xenokidneys and xenohearts. Behind our Xenotransplantation programs, our manufactured lungs now in large mammal testing by our North Carolina-based regenerative medicine team, and behind that our 3D printed autologous lungs by our New Hampshire-based organ manufacturing group using technologies from our partner, 3D Systems. We look forward to sharing more detail on these programs as they progress towards clinical studies. I'm thrilled that we're in such a great position at United Therapeutics. We have a solid commercial business posting record results with continued strong growth ahead, a pipeline of novel therapies that could again double our revenues by the end of the decade. And on top of all of that we have a long-term plan to address one of the largest, critical, unmet medical needs while helping our patients, employers and the employees and shareholders all succeed. I'll now turn the call over to our President, Michael Benkowitz, who will give an overview of our commercial performance and progress for our near-term goal of a $4 billion annual revenue run rate by mid-decade. Mike?\nMichael Benkowitz: Thanks, Martine, and good morning, everyone. As Martine noted, today, we reported our highest revenue quarter ever at $609 million, up 18% from the third quarter of 2022. We saw meaningful growth for each of the Tyvaso franchise, Remodulin, Orenitram and Unituxin. With respect to Orenitram, we saw revenue of $92 million during the quarter, which was up 5% from the prior year. This growth reflects increases to both patient growth and average dose. In the third quarter, following the publication of two peer-reviewed manuscripts, we are also able to commence education efforts by our field-based teams on the EXPEDITE protocol, which is based on our rapid Remodulin titration and transition to Orenitram study, allowing patients to get to higher doses of Orenitram quicker and with less side effects than starting Orenitram de novo. Remodulin revenue of $131 million was up 15% from last year, reflecting both U.S. patient growth from the third quarter of 2022 as well as an increase in international sales from the same period last year. Patients who use our Remunity Pump now make up more than 50% of subcutaneous Remodulin patients in the U.S. compared to under 10% at the same period just last year. Remodulin continues to be the Number 1 prescribed parenteral therapy for PAH in the U.S. Moving to Unituxin; we saw revenue of $51 million, which was up 11% from the prior year quarter. This growth was driven by an increase in U.S. sales and includes a modest inventory build at our U.S. distributor. Finally, Tyvaso; We saw revenue of $326 million for Tyvaso DPI and nebulized Tyvaso combined, which was up 26% from the prior year quarter and was the highest Tyvaso revenue quarter ever. This growth was principally driven by new patients on therapy. This performance reflects the rapid uptake of Tyvaso DPI among physicians and patients, as well as continued expansion into the PH-ILD market. We saw the highest number of referrals and patient starts for the combined Tyvaso business during the quarter. I'm proud to report that Tyvaso is now the Number 1 prescribed prostacyclin treatment in the U.S. and remains the only approved therapy for PH-ILD. Regarding Tyvaso DPI inventory, the first phase of process improvements and new equipment at our partner MannKind that went online in June has meaningfully helped to expand the supply of Tyvaso DPI. These enhancements, coupled with a further expansion that will come online next year have us well positioned to provide ample supply of Tyvaso DPI moving forward. We're now working to drive growth in PH-ILD, where Tyvaso remains the only approved product, as I mentioned before. We have been increasing the size of our field-based teams over the last 12 months, adding medical science liaisons, regional nurse specialists, and more recently sales representatives and reimbursement specialists to our team. With this expansion, we're able to both reach more prescribers and importantly focus on driving depth within these prescribers. And we've already made great progress. On the last earnings call, I mentioned that we've more than doubled the number of Tyvaso prescribers since the PH-ILD approval in 2021, and maintain depth, defined as three or more patients per prescriber, at about 40% of these prescribers. Peeling that back a little bit, about 50% of the growth in those total prescribers are true ILD prescribers, which means we're now starting to see these physicians begin to treat the disease rather than refer these patients into the PAH clinics. Depth within our true ILD treaters is also coming along nicely with about 20% of those prescribers having three or more patients on Tyvaso. Our recent sales force expansion will allow us to continue to lean into the ILD physicians, particularly in the community setting. While Tyvaso DPI has been a tremendous – has been a source of tremendous growth since we launched it last year, we continue to appreciate the value of nebulized Tyvaso in our portfolio. Some physicians and patients continue to prefer the nebulizer because of its profile or for reimbursement reasons. In addition, we're aware that some pulmonologists prefer to start and titrate their PH-ILD patients using the nebulizer before switching to Tyvaso DPI. This allows more precise titration in one breadth increments compared to the three-breath equivalent increments of Tyvaso DPI. We expect this platform strategy to become a competitive advantage over other potential DPI products should they reach the market. Before we move to the Q&A, I want to take a moment to address some questions we've received around potential competition and reiterate our confidence that we're well positioned for growth in the near-term with our current commercial portfolio. Questions have centered primarily around sotatercept and a potential inhaled treprostinil competitor. First, with respect to sotatercept; it's important to note that it will not be indicated for PH-ILD if approved next year, and therefore will not be a factor in the source of our most recent growth and expected near-term growth. In Group 1 PAH, where it will be indicated if approved, it appears this drug will be a nice addition to the PAH armamentarium. But based on the clinical data and our experience with new agents entering the space, it will be an addition, not a replacement, for existing therapies. And therefore, we remain extremely confident in the durability of our PAH business. Targeting multiple pathogenic pathways is considered the current standard of care for PAH. This mirrors therapy for other serious conditions that result from multiple pathways of pathogenesis like cancers, heart failure and some viral infections. In fact, sotatercept was studied only in combination with other PAH products, including 70% of patients on concomitant prostacyclins or prostacyclin analogs including our treprostinil products. We believe the convenience of Tyvaso DPI allows physicians to easily, relatively speaking cover the prostacyclin pathway for those patients not already on a prostacyclin. And if the addition of sotatercept helps patients live longer, that's phenomenal for the patients, of course and likewise, benefits us from a revenue standpoint because patients will be on our medicines longer. Moving to the other inhaled treprostinil that could reach the market, we believe we have a preferred product with Tyvaso DPI. Tyvaso DPI demonstrated 98% patient satisfaction in the pre-study and has now been prescribed to more than 4,000 patients, a clear demonstration of patient physician interest and our DPI format. Tyvaso DPI is differentiated from its potential competitor because of its simple, easy-to-use inhaler that patients just open load and inhale with only one breath per cartridge four times a day. Tyvaso DPI's low-flow profile also facilitates treprostinil delivery deep and consistently into the lungs with generally only title breathing required to actuate a dose. On top of that, the Tyvaso DPI inhalation device requires no cleaning and patients can hold the inhaler in an actual position when using the device. So to wrap up, we're extremely proud of our record performance this quarter, and we think we're in the early stages of sustainable growth for our current commercial portfolio as we continue to make in-roads with PH-ILD prescribers and our base business in PAH will continue to be appreciated by prescribers and patients alike. So with that, Martine, I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks Mike. I hope everyone can tell that United Therapeutics is a truly compelling investment with a strong cash-generating commercial business supporting novel R&D efforts in rare lung disease, coupled with the revolutionary potential for our organ manufacturing programs. Operator, let's start the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Congrats on all the progress. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, maybe it's a question for Mike, if you can offer any perspective on Tyvaso net adds, in the quarter if that's been pretty consistent at that 500 patient level. And then are you able to tell us where inventory levels shook out for the quarter? Like was – did the quarter include a significant build? Or was this all demand driven? Thank you, on Tyvaso specifically.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Terence. Mike?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Yes. So the net adds continue to kind of clip along at kind of that roughly 500, sometimes a little higher, sometimes a little lower, but kind of in that range per quarter. So we're really happy with that – that continued progress. And as I said in the third quarter, we saw a record number of prescriptions and starts. And so just continue to kind of pull that through and keep those patients on therapy. So we're pleased with the progress on that front. From an inventory standpoint and the revenue numbers, not – I think what you can infer from the revenue numbers is that the revenue number revenue numbers reflect underlying patient demand. So there wasn't really a significant inventory build in the quarter. And as I said, with the enhancements that we've seen at MannKind since June, we think we're – plus what's coming next year, we're really well positioned from an inventory standpoint going forward.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you very much, Mike. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nHartaj Singh: Great. Thank you for the question, and really nice quarter. Just maybe a little bit of a different tack, which is that you had really nice revenues across the board, especially Tyvaso, but you're really holding your OpEx pretty firm and staying to that algorithm that James has talked about previously. Your operating margin just seems to keep on getting better. Can you just talk a little bit about that progression? And do you expect that to keep getting better as your PAH franchise becomes even more profitable? Thank you for the question.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you very much, Hartaj. James Edgemond is our Chief Financial Officer. So James, could you please answer that question?\nJames Edgemond: Yes. Thanks, Martine. Good morning, Hartaj and thank you for the question. As a reminder and you alluded to this in your question we still and will apply that budget algorithm where we will spend no more on cash, operating budget in 2023, for example, that exceeds 50% of prior year revenue. So our budget algorithm this year and continuing forward, we expect to apply. With respect to your question on the operating margin, specifically, in an environment of continued revenue growth, which we've demonstrated, you will have improving operating margins over time. But remember, that can bounce around quarter-to-quarter because we typically look at our budgets and our budget spend on an annual basis. And those expenses could be impacted by clinical trial enrollment and the timing around that, for example. But from a fiduciary and kind of fiduciary responsibility perspective, we do want to continue and we will expect to continue to apply the budget algorithm, be good financial stewards of the expenses. And as you heard Michael talk about in a very successful quarter and growing revenue when you think about some of the investments that Michael has made as well. So thank you very much, and Martine, back to you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, James. Thank you, Hartaj. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Thome with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Thome: Hi there. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Obviously, a lot of progress on the organ side of the business this quarter. When we think about the xenokidney, the mirokidney and the IVIVA kidney implant. Should we think of these largely as sort of three shots on goal in kidney transplant? Or are there discrete populations that could benefit from each of these products? How do you view that? Thanks.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Joe. I think the answer is all of the above, both of the above to be specific. Definitely, positively, there are multiple shots on goal, but there is a large diversity of different types of manifestation of end-stage organ disease generally and specifically within kidney disease. So I could very much see products from one of the other groups, whether it's a xenokidney or autologous IVIVA kidney or a allogeneically cellularized with primary cells mirokidney going to different end-stage kidney disease patient populations. As you know, Joe, there are more than 0.5 million people just in the United States on dialysis. So the level of demand is really off the charts, and we're confident that each of these kidney technologies and our other organ technologies we'll find very, very receptive physicians and patient populations for their use. Thanks for the question, Joe. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from Eun Yang with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nEun Yang: Thank you. So you recently started another Phase 3 TETON study for progressive pulmonary fibrosis. I'm just wondering why you are not using the DPI formulation in the trial. And once it's approved, do you think you may not need a bridging study to DPI from the nebulizer similar to PH-ILD? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Eun. Very good question; I'd like to ask the clinical trial executive responsible for that study, Dr. Leigh Peterson, if she could please answer your question.\nLeigh Peterson: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. Regarding why we're not using the DPI, we want to use the nebulizer to remove as many variables as possible between the studies. So between the INCREASE study and TETON 1, TETON 2 and TETON PPF, so we're sticking with the same delivery device for those. And yes, we'll definitely seek approval for the DPI once we see the results of these studies with a nebulizer. It's – we're still having ongoing conversations with FDA to determine what will be required for that approval.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you very much, Dr. Peterson. Thank you very much, Eun, for your question. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJessica Fye: Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Question on Tyvaso. So recognizing that titration dynamic you mentioned, which could suggest that the mix of new starts between DPI and nebulized Tyvaso understates the longer-term proportion who might end up on DPI. Can you talk about what you’re seeing as a mix among new starts as well as your latest expectations for the longer-term mix of Tyvaso DPI and nebulized Tyvaso within the franchise? Thanks.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you very much Jess. Mike, would you be able to give some color on that question please?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Happy to. So Jess with respect to referral, sorry, with respect to the mix between the nebulizer and the DPI, I think we’ve said for the last couple quarters that it’s been kind of in the neighborhood of two thirds DPI, one third nebulizer that continues to hold true. That’s what we saw in the third quarter and actually was a couple points higher on the nebulizer in the third quarter than the prior quarters. But it’s generally kind of in that, kind of two thirds 65% to 70% DPI, 30% to 35% nebulizer. I kind of expect that it’s going to stay there. It could tip up a little bit towards DPI after the first of the year when some of the new Medicare Part D redesign elements. It's kicking under the IRA and patient out of pocket goes down. So to the extent that reimbursement challenges are a reason for using the nebulizer that might tilt things a little bit more towards DPI. But as I said in my opening comments, I continue to think that there’s going to be a role for nebulizer. I think what we have learned over the 25 years to 30 years that we’ve been in this space is that patients are very different and some react better to one delivery device over another and vice versa. And so, we’re just really happy that we have multiple options to offer patients. And at the end of the day we’re really, we’re kind of agnostic as to which device it is because either way they’re running United – the patients are benefiting from a United Therapeutics product.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, Mike. And Jess, thank you for the question. We’re at the end of the call. But we have time for just one last question. Operator, last question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from Ash Verma with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAsh Verma: Great. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking our question. So I have two. On the manufacturing expansion for Tyvaso at your partner MannKind for the DPI that was up 2.5x in June. Is that now allowing you to fulfill the minimum contractual levels at your distributors, or would that level of supply only be fully enabled by the second production line that MannKind is building? That’s first. And I mean, there’s a lot of pipeline for Tyvaso, very excited about PPF, IPF, but just curious the timelines for the enrolling these studies are a little bit protracted. Is that primarily because of the heterogeneity of the disease or just curious if there is any other factor playing in that? Thanks.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Ash, thanks for that question or that compound question. So let’s have the first part of your question relating to manufacturing be answered by our Executive Vice President for Technical Operations, Pat Poisson. And when he’s done answering the first part of your question, the second part of your question relating to the timelines for enrollment in the pulmonary fibrosis studies that one will be answered by Dr. Leigh Peterson. Pat, can you go first?\nPat Poisson: Sure. Thanks, Martine. And thanks for the question. So the process improvements we implemented earlier this year will fulfill demand both near and midterm for Tyvaso DPI, longer term, as we see growth in ILD will certainly need the new equipment that is coming online in the first half of 2024. So as of right now we’re able to fulfill demand and maintain inventory levels at the SPs [ph] and we’ll be able to do so until the new equipment comes online. And then we’ll be well prepared for the future.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Pat. Dr. Peterson?\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. So thanks for the question on our TETON program. We actually haven’t increased our timeline. I mean, we’re still on target to finish enrollment of the TETON studies at the end of 2024. But you’re right, we have increased the sample size and we’re now targeting the enrollment of the 576 patients in each study. And the reason for that is you’re exactly right. You mentioned the variability of the disease and we do routine blinded data looks and that is what we saw there was some basically standard deviations of the FEC and the completers prompted us to just out of caution to increase the sample size to increase the chance of success. But again just because of the pace of enrollment into these studies, which is fairly rapid. We haven’t increased our overall timeline to enroll those additional patients.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, Dr. Peterson. Ash, thank you so much for the question. In conclusion, as mentioned earlier, we’re really happy to be in such a great position here at United Therapeutics. We have a solid commercial business posting record results with continued strong growth ahead. We have a pipeline of novel therapies that could again double our revenue by the end of the decade. And we have a long-term plan to address one of the largest critical unmet medical needs. All of the above, while helping our patients, employees, and shareholders succeed. Operator, you may now terminate the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today’s United Therapeutics Corporation earnings webcast. A re-broadcast of this webcast will be available for replay for one week by visiting the events and presentation section of the United Therapeutics Investor Relations website at ir.unither.com.

            "content": "Thanks, Martine, and good morning, everyone. As Martine noted, today, we reported our highest revenue quarter ever at $609 million, up 18% from the third quarter of 2022. We saw meaningful growth for each of the Tyvaso franchise, Remodulin, Orenitram and Unituxin. With respect to Orenitram, we saw revenue of $92 million during the quarter, which was up 5% from the prior year. This growth reflects increases to both patient growth and average dose. In the third quarter, following the publication of two peer-reviewed manuscripts, we are also able to commence education efforts by our field-based teams on the EXPEDITE protocol, which is based on our rapid Remodulin titration and transition to Orenitram study, allowing patients to get to higher doses of Orenitram quicker and with less side effects than starting Orenitram de novo. Remodulin revenue of $131 million was up 15% from last year, reflecting both U.S. patient growth from the third quarter of 2022 as well as an increase in international sales from the same period last year. Patients who use our Remunity Pump now make up more than 50% of subcutaneous Remodulin patients in the U.S. compared to under 10% at the same period just last year. Remodulin continues to be the Number 1 prescribed parenteral therapy for PAH in the U.S. Moving to Unituxin; we saw revenue of $51 million, which was up 11% from the prior year quarter. This growth was driven by an increase in U.S. sales and includes a modest inventory build at our U.S. distributor. Finally, Tyvaso; We saw revenue of $326 million for Tyvaso DPI and nebulized Tyvaso combined, which was up 26% from the prior year quarter and was the highest Tyvaso revenue quarter ever. This growth was principally driven by new patients on therapy. This performance reflects the rapid uptake of Tyvaso DPI among physicians and patients, as well as continued expansion into the PH-ILD market. We saw the highest number of referrals and patient starts for the combined Tyvaso business during the quarter. I'm proud to report that Tyvaso is now the Number 1 prescribed prostacyclin treatment in the U.S. and remains the only approved therapy for PH-ILD. Regarding Tyvaso DPI inventory, the first phase of process improvements and new equipment at our partner MannKind that went online in June has meaningfully helped to expand the supply of Tyvaso DPI. These enhancements, coupled with a further expansion that will come online next year have us well positioned to provide ample supply of Tyvaso DPI moving forward.

Moving to the other inhaled treprostinil that could reach the market, we believe we have a preferred product with Tyvaso DPI. Tyvaso DPI demonstrated 98% patient satisfaction in the pre-study and has now been prescribed to more than 4,000 patients, a clear demonstration of patient physician interest and our DPI format. Tyvaso DPI is differentiated from its potential competitor because of its simple, easy-to-use inhaler that patients just open load and inhale with only one breath per cartridge four times a day.

So with that, Martine, I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Sure. Yes. So the net adds continue to kind of clip along at kind of that roughly 500, sometimes a little higher, sometimes a little lower, but kind of in that range per quarter. So we're really happy with that – that continued progress. And as I said in the third quarter, we saw a record number of prescriptions and starts. And so just continue to kind of pull that through and keep those patients on therapy. So we're pleased with the progress on that front. From an inventory standpoint and the revenue numbers, not – I think what you can infer from the revenue numbers is that the revenue number revenue numbers reflect underlying patient demand. So there wasn't really a significant inventory build in the quarter. And as I said, with the enhancements that we've seen at MannKind since June, we think we're – plus what's coming next year, we're really well positioned from an inventory standpoint going forward.

You mentioned the variability of the disease and we do routine blinded data looks and that is what we saw there was some basically standard deviations of the FEC and the completers prompted us to just out of caution to increase the sample size to increase the chance of success. But again just because of the pace of enrollment into these studies, which is fairly rapid. We haven't increased our overall timeline to enroll those additional patients."

So the process improvements we implemented earlier this year will fulfill demand both near and midterm for Tyvaso DPI, longer term, as we see growth in ILD will certainly need the new equipment that is coming online in the first half of 2024. So as of right now we're able to fulfill demand and maintain inventory levels at the SPs [ph] and we'll be able to do so until the new equipment comes online. And then we'll be well prepared for the future."

            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thank you, Dewey. First off, I'd like to congratulate our team as we had an amazing third quarter for the second quarter in a row. I'm thrilled to report our highest quarterly revenue ever along with double-digit revenue growth as compared to the third quarter of 2022. On top of that, our operational efficiency in the third quarter resulted in one of our highest quarterly net incomes and earnings per share ever. At United Therapeutics, we're uniquely positioned for three waves of growth with a profile that's unique in biotechs. Our first wave of growth will come through our existing commercial business led by Tyvaso and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease or PH-ILD. We continue to post solid growth in our current business with record quarterly revenue and patients on therapy for treprostinil products as a whole. Our growth in PH-ILD and continue leadership in pulmonary arterial hypertension or PAH has led to nebulized Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI products combining to become the most prescribed prostacyclin therapy in the U.S. Michael will go into detail on our commercial business later in this call. We believe this growth will continue in the near term and we expect at least a $4 billion annual revenue run rate by mid decades doubling our revenue from 2022 and implying a double-digit compound annual growth rate. Our second wave of growth will come from our near-term pipeline led by the TETON program in pulmonary fibrosis and ralinepag in PAH. These two products, if approved, could lead our revenue to double again to $8 billion by the end of the decade. I will provide updates on the TETON and ralinepag program shortly. Of course, both of our first and second waves of growth are subject to clinical trial outcomes, regulatory approvals, new competitive entrants [ph], and the potential impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act. But we feel good about our prospects for meeting these revenue aspirations. Our third wave of sustainable growth will come through the development, manufacturer and widespread use of manufactured organs and organ technologies to provide a solution to patients experiencing end stage kidney, lung, heart, and liver disease. Moving to our near-term pipeline and second wave of growth, we have two key registration programs underway, TETON for pulmonary fibrosis, and ralinepag an oral therapy for Group 1 PAH. TETON now consists of three registration studies, TETON 1 and TETON 2 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF and now TETON PPF for progressive pulmonary fibrosis. We believe IPF represents a 100,000 patient opportunity in the United States with only two approved therapies that just slow lung function decline. Both TETON 1 and TETON 2 are enrolling patients. And at this time, we are aiming for full enrollment in both studies with 576 patients each by the end of 2024. Likewise, we believe PPF represents up to a 60,000 patient opportunity in the U.S., which is distinct from IPF. One of the two FDA approved IPF therapies is also approved for PPF and liking IPF it only slows the decline of lung function in these fragile patients. As we reported earlier this week, the TETON PPF study has dosed its first patient. We expect this trial to enroll 698 patients. We believe there is a relatively high probability of success in the three TETON studies based on an IPF subset of the increased study of nebulized Tyvaso in PH-ILD patients. Unlike the two IPF therapies on market, nebulized Tyvaso in a safety endpoint showed in an improvement of lung function in the subset of patients that had IPF along with pulmonary hypertension. We're also encouraged by a recent review by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee of data from 550 patients in the TETON 1 and TETON 2 studies. The committee completed a routine unblinded safety review of data from these patients and unanimously recommended continuation of both trials without modification [ph]. Our advanced outcome study of ralinepag in Group 1 PAH continues to enroll patients. And at this time we are targeting completion of the study in 2025. Ralinepag is a next generation selective and potent prostacyclin receptor agonist, and we are developing it as a once daily oral therapy for PAH. We believe ralinepag in once daily dosing sustained release profile and titratability could position it favorably against the other oral prostacyclin receptor agonist as well as other therapies currently available for PAH patients. Ralinepag provides 24-hour coverage with 6.5x to 10x the potency of the other oral prostacyclin receptor agonist on the market and ralinepag demonstrated more than 20% improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance in Phase 2 studies. That's close to the improvement observed in intravenous epoprostenol. Long-term Phase 2 open-label studies of ralinepag also showed sustained improvement in six-minute walk distance. We are pleased to announce that the Data Safety Monitoring Committee for the advanced outcome study met for the fourth time last month and unanimously recommended the continuation of the trial without modification after evaluating unblinded data from 510 patients enrolled in the study. We are targeting 700 patients to a 1,000 patients in the study, depending on the pace of accruing clinical worsening events. Moving to our organ programs, we have been developing several investigational approaches using different technologies with different organs. The first is our ex-vivo lung perfusion service or EVLP, which has led to over 350 lives saved with lungs that have undergone EVLP. We're also developing xenotransplantation products consisting of hearts and kidneys. Finally, we've been working on 3-D printing and regenerative medicine technologies to develop manufactured lungs and kidneys. At United Therapeutics, we always want multiple shots on goal. To that end, we recently acquired privately held IVIVA Medical based out of Woburn, Massachusetts. IVIVA's core technology is an engineered kidney implant that mimics native kidney elements with a simple architecture to achieve implantable, durable blood purification much like a native kidney. IVIVA's kidney is seated with a patient's own cells, eliminating the need for immunosuppression. Also, earlier this week we announced an agreement to acquire publicly traded Miromatrix Medical, a company focused on ending the waiting list for organ transplantation. Miromatrix utilizes an organ manufacturing platform that consists of decellularized porcine organs that are then cellularized with cells derived from non-transplantable donor human organs. These organ constructs are intended to replace some of the functionality of human organs using standard organ transplantation techniques and immunosuppression regimens. Miromatrix has three key programs that would broaden our existing manufactured organ pipeline. MiroliverELAP, which is ex-vivo or outside the body and intended to provide temporary external liver dialysis for acute liver failure. Mirokidney, a fully-implanted kidney and Miroliver, a fully-implantable liver. Moving to Xenotransplantation. We continue to work with the FDA on a clinical path forward. We're underway with what we call pivotal preclinical studies in baboons at the request of the FDA. Specifically, for our 10-gene program we expect the last preclinical xenokidney transplant to occur in early 2024. After collecting the data we'll meet with the FDA to discuss the IND and clinical protocol for human studies for our 10-gene xeno organs. In parallel with the pivotal preclinical studies, we're wrapping up construction of our clinical stage designated pathogen-free facility or DPF, in Virginia. We expect the facility to begin receiving pigs in early 2024 and for the facility to grow its population through the balance of 2024 in preparation for clinical studies in humans for both xenokidneys and xenohearts. Behind our Xenotransplantation programs, our manufactured lungs now in large mammal testing by our North Carolina-based regenerative medicine team, and behind that our 3D printed autologous lungs by our New Hampshire-based organ manufacturing group using technologies from our partner, 3D Systems. We look forward to sharing more detail on these programs as they progress towards clinical studies. I'm thrilled that we're in such a great position at United Therapeutics. We have a solid commercial business posting record results with continued strong growth ahead, a pipeline of novel therapies that could again double our revenues by the end of the decade. And on top of all of that we have a long-term plan to address one of the largest, critical, unmet medical needs while helping our patients, employers and the employees and shareholders all succeed. I'll now turn the call over to our President, Michael Benkowitz, who will give an overview of our commercial performance and progress for our near-term goal of a $4 billion annual revenue run rate by mid-decade. Mike? Thanks Mike. I hope everyone can tell that United Therapeutics is a truly compelling investment with a strong cash-generating commercial business supporting novel R&D efforts in rare lung disease, coupled with the revolutionary potential for our organ manufacturing programs. Operator, let's start the Q&A session. Thank you, Terence. Mike? Thank you very much, Mike. Operator, next question please? Thank you very much, Hartaj. James Edgemond is our Chief Financial Officer. So James, could you please answer that question? Thank you, James. Thank you, Hartaj. Operator, next question please. Thank you, Joe. I think the answer is all of the above, both of the above to be specific. Definitely, positively, there are multiple shots on goal, but there is a large diversity of different types of manifestation of end-stage organ disease generally and specifically within kidney disease. So I could very much see products from one of the other groups, whether it's a xenokidney or autologous IVIVA kidney or a allogeneically cellularized with primary cells mirokidney going to different end-stage kidney disease patient populations. As you know, Joe, there are more than 0.5 million people just in the United States on dialysis. So the level of demand is really off the charts, and we're confident that each of these kidney technologies and our other organ technologies we'll find very, very receptive physicians and patient populations for their use. Thanks for the question, Joe. Operator, next question please. Thank you, Eun. Very good question; I'd like to ask the clinical trial executive responsible for that study, Dr. Leigh Peterson, if she could please answer your question. Thank you very much, Dr. Peterson. Thank you very much, Eun, for your question. Operator, next question please. Thank you very much Jess. Mike, would you be able to give some color on that question please? Thank you so much, Mike. And Jess, thank you for the question. We're at the end of the call. But we have time for just one last question. Operator, last question, please. Okay. Ash, thanks for that question or that compound question. So let's have the first part of your question relating to manufacturing be answered by our Executive Vice President for Technical Operations, Pat Poisson. And when he's done answering the first part of your question, the second part of your question relating to the timelines for enrollment in the pulmonary fibrosis studies that one will be answered by Dr. Leigh Peterson. Pat, can you go first? Thank you, Pat. Dr. Peterson? Thank you so much, Dr. Peterson. Ash, thank you so much for the question. In conclusion, as mentioned earlier, we're really happy to be in such a great position here at United Therapeutics. We have a solid commercial business posting record results with continued strong growth ahead. We have a pipeline of novel therapies that could again double our revenue by the end of the decade. And we have a long-term plan to address one of the largest critical unmet medical needs. All of the above, while helping our patients, employees, and shareholders succeed. Operator, you may now terminate the call."

Now, I will turn the webcast over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of our second quarter 2023 financial results and the business activities of United Therapeutics. Martine?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Dewey. I'm thrilled that United Therapeutics continues to report double-digit revenue growth and our highest quarterly revenue ever. We expect this growth trajectory to continue, with our current business, as we expect to reach a $4 billion annual revenue run rate by mid-decade. Beyond that, we expect continued waves of growth with an additional doubling of our revenue from the potential launch of Tyvaso in pulmonary fibrosis and of ralinepag in pulmonary arterial hypertension and then yet another doubling of our revenues with the potential for an unlimited supply of tolerable transplantable organs in the next decade. Let me now drive a little bit deeper into some of these absolutely fantastic results that we are pleased to report this quarter. As mentioned, the total revenues are at $596 million for the three months. But it's interesting to compare that with the matching three months of last year, which were just about $467 million. So that's a percentage growth rate of 28% and very much in line with the type of growth rate that we have previously indicated we expect to achieve in order to achieve that $4 billion revenue run rate by mid-decade. Another deeper level to look at is the company's net income. For the past quarter, we reported over $0.25 billion in net income. And again, it's instructive to compare that with the quarter -- matching quarter in 2022, when we reported $116 million in net income a percentage change of 123%. Very comparable numbers can be obtained, if you divide the net income into the outstanding shares. And in fact, we're pretty proud that as compared to peers we have a relatively low number of shares outstanding, which helps drive those fantastic results. Now let's dive even deeper, into some of the results on the products. Tyvaso $319 million, up 59% from last year. Remodulin $127 million, down about $5 million from the matching quarter last year. Orenitram $95 million, up 20% from the matching quarter last year. Unituxin $44 million essentially flat from the matching quarter last year. We don't really talk that much about Unituxin, but I probably should stop and for people who are perhaps newer to United Therapeutics, remind everyone, that this is a treatment for neuroblastoma, a pediatric cancer with a very high rate of mortality. And for the -- based on the several years that Unituxin has been used by doctors to treat that cancer, approximately 50% of the kids treated with Unituxin as well as the other concomitant therapies used, their cancer is wiped out it does not return. Even five years later, when they're checked the cancer has not returned in about half of the patients. I find that truly remarkable, and just a miracle of biotechnology and one of the many blessings to be here at United Therapeutics, that so many kids can live a cancer-free life, after getting that devastating diagnosis in their tender years. So in any event because that drug is so well used by the pediatric oncologists, we're now looking at on an annualized basis it's getting close to $200 million, a year. Now in addition, to those top line revenues and profit figures. Let's dive a little bit into the spending section. And here we break out our spending in large categories, in terms of external research and development, internal research and development and then the general administrative and sales and marketing categories, with a few miscellaneous rows put in there according to GAAP standards. So the external research and development is, what we spend on other companies assisting us with our research and development. The lion's share of that money goes to conducting our worldwide clinical trials. So, we've got quite a few clinical trials going on right now, and most of them are in the Phase III stage of development, which is the largest and the most costly phase of development. We have the two TETON 1 and TETON 2 Phase III trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. And then we have this new TETON 3 or also called PPF type of pulmonary fibrosis, which is another Phase III trial just starting up this year. We have the ongoing worldwide Ralinepag clinical trials covering countries in almost every continent. And that is a more expensive clinical trial, because that clinical trial is aiming for an endpoint to show that we reduce death and morbidity in patients, with pulmonary hypertension. So, we have to both enroll more patients and keep the study going longer, until we get a statistically significant difference in the death rates. And then we look at that and hope to achieve our statistical significance, with respect to the treated or active group. We also still are ongoing with the gene therapy trial. And so all of these trials combined, they end up costing us more than $100 million, a year, just in spending outside of the company and that's not even talking about the level of spending inside of the company. Now inside of the company we've got our great team of clinical drug developers ultimately led by Dr. Peterson who joins me on the call today. And she has just been doing an amazing, amazing job of running all of these Phase 3 trials simultaneously. And it really -- it takes a humongous amount of effort to get drug labeled, translated, shipped to these countries all over the world, constantly be monitoring those centers, sending people there every month to make sure that the protocol is being complied with. I cannot begin to tell you how long the checklist is to conduct these clinical trials. So it's not surprising that there is another more than $100 million a year spent on internal research and development. Now under the internal research and development category, we also cover the development activities for the organ manufacturing efforts that I described at the beginning of the call. And there we've got the lead program our Xeno transplantation efforts. And they're in accordance with the FDA guidance, which we received in our interact meetings with the FDA both for the xenokidney and for the xenoheart. We are proceeding with the pivotal preclinical studies necessary to enable an opening of an IND for xenokidney and xenoheart. We are doing our best to hopefully be able to open that IND as soon as possible. It's not really possible to predict exactly when the FDA would feel that it was the appropriate time to do that. But I would say that the time frame for that FDA decision kind of a reasonable case is a 2024-2025 time frame more pessimistic case could be a 2025-2026 time frame. But anyway you look at it, it is literally around the corner in drug development speak. And that's an additional area of significant spend. We also are continuing to spend heavily on our laboratory-based lung manufacturing activities both with allogeneic as well as with autologous cellularization. And that too is really a trailblazing effort where people many of them our own patients who have been treated with our medicines for pulmonary hypertension. But in the event that their disease progresses, which is usually the case with pulmonary hypertension and for that matter pulmonary fibrosis as well and of course many other lung diseases, you progress to the point of needing a lung transplant. And we are doing our best to be able to have laboratory manufactured lungs to satisfy those patients' needs for lung transplant. But in the meantime we have a really remarkable program, which we call lung bioengineering. And in this program we take lungs from organ donors who for various reasons the transplant surgeons feel they are not quite ready or certain that they want to use that donor lung for -- to put into a very, very sick person who needs that lung. So they asked the organ procurement organizations to fly those lungs to one of our two lung bioengineering centers. One is in Silver Spring, Maryland across the street from our headquarters and the other is in Jacksonville, Florida on the campus of the Mayo Clinic. And there are highly skilled highly trained technicians. They work on the lung like a person would -- like a doctor would work on a patient or a surgeon would work on a patient. And they do everything that they can to render that lung as suitable for transplantation. Again, quite to me as a person who's actually never done the procedure, I'm like blown away that half of the time they succeed and a lung that was not going to be used to save a person's life is in fact able to be used to save a person's life. And to-date we have saved over 300 people's lives with these lung bioengineering products. I'll also mention just kind of coincidentally that when we are not able to use the lung to save a person's life, we are oftentimes able to use the cells from the lung to assist in our efforts to manufacture allogeneically cellularized lungs in our laboratories. So it's kind of everything all fits together here at United Therapeutics. I know I've talked on for quite a while here but there is just so many exciting things going on at United Therapeutics. We have been able to build up a substantial cash balance and we are targeting that for three main areas of deployment. First and foremost is to invest in all of the internal projects that we have going here at United Therapeutics. And I've mentioned several of them in my remarks today. You may recall, just last quarter we talked about $0.5 billion being allocated to the production of a dedicated Tyvaso DPI production facility on our campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. So that is in recognition of the very excellent take-up that the Tyvaso DPI product has seen among physicians, patients and their families, all supporting the patients in that regard. And then another area of capital deployment would be to build the GMP equivalent production facilities for the xenokidneys and xenohearts that I mentioned previously. And of course, the FDA wants to see and we would also want to see that those xenokidneys and xenohearts are manufactured in a totally clinically appropriate fashion, which requires the animal equivalent of a GMP facility. The technical name for it is a designated pathogen-free facility. So capital is also targeted for that. In addition, we have a very robust business development group led by Dr. Betsy Eades of our company. And she is frequently bringing to us often very compelling candidates for potential either investment or outright acquisition, and we need to retain adequate capital for those opportunities. You may recall that I think probably the next biggest impact drug that we could have in pulmonary hypertension ralinepag was acquired through our business development efforts for about $1 billion. So these type of opportunities are regularly being reviewed by Dr. Eades. And then third is to repurchase shares to the extent that there is excess capital that can't be deployed for internal business development or external business development. Of course, the next step would be to engage in share repurchases and we have repurchased lots of shares over time. In fact, I mentioned earlier that our outstanding share count is relatively modest compared to peers and that is because in no small part our previous share repurchase. So with those introductory remarks, I'd now like to turn the phone over to Michael Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Mike?\nMichael Benkowitz: Thanks Martine. Good morning, everyone. As Martine said, we had a phenomenal second quarter from a revenue standpoint, setting revenue records for Tyvaso, Orenitram and total treprostinil. And I want to begin by publicly thanking and congratulating all of our commercial and medical affairs teams at United Therapeutics for their hard work and achievements during the quarter. As usual, I'll provide some color on what we're seeing with respect to Tyvaso, Orenitram and Remodulin. So, I'll start with Tyvaso, where I want to highlight several things. I should also mention that for purposes of these comments, Tyvaso refers to the combined nebulizer and DPI unless I otherwise know. So first as I just mentioned, we posted the highest quarterly revenues ever for Tyvaso which reflects increasing physician and patient demand in both the PAH and PH-ILD indications as well as the Tyvaso DPI inventory build of about $30 million in the quarter at the specialty pharmacies. Our underlying demand metrics that is referrals, which is what we call prescriptions new patient starts and net patient adds remained very strong and roughly in line with the last few quarters. New patient starts are trending around a 70-30 split between DPI and the nebulizer respectively. The transitioning of long-term existing nebulized Tyvaso patients to Tyvaso DPI has largely played out at this point at least until the Part D redesign provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act begin to go into effect over the next two years. And in fact, nebulized Tyvaso referrals and starts have trended upward over the last few months. We do expect that there will be some basal level of transitioning between the nebulizer and DPI going forward as physicians optimize to which delivery device is best suited to each of their patients. We also continue to make great progress growing the Tyvaso prescriber base and prescribing depth within that base. On the Tyvaso DPI supply side our partner MannKind completed their production expansion and process improvement efforts during the quarter which we expect will increase production capacity by about 250% going forward. We started to benefit from these enhancements at the end of June when as I mentioned the specialty pharmacies were able to build about $30 million of DPI inventory. Specialty pharmacy inventory levels on the last day of the quarter actually reached their contractual range based on historical demand. However, this could fluctuate through the remainder of the year as Tyvaso DPI demand grows and until MannKind has a few more months of production with the additional capacity. We anticipate that specialty pharmacies may be able to get into the regular ordering patterns for Tyvaso DPI, sometime either later this year or in the first half of '24. As a reminder, MannKind is also undertaking work to further expand production capacity even beyond these most recent improvements, which we expect will come online in 2024. I should also note that the nebulizer destocking that we highlighted in the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year did in fact conclude in the first quarter. Second quarter nebulizer orders were in line with specialty pharmacy contractual inventory levels and patient demand. So to wrap up the Tyvaso story, we're extremely pleased with the progress we've made and the opportunity that lies ahead of us. Our focus and efforts in the second half of this year and into '24 fall into four main areas: first is increasing production of supply of Tyvaso DPI in partnership with MannKind; second is increasing physician screening for PH-ILD and their ILD patient population; third is growing the prescribing breadth and driving depth to 3-plus patients as I mentioned on prior calls; and then fourth is continuing to increase patient retention on Tyvaso. While we've made very good progress on each of these items thus far there's still more we can do. And to this end, we recently realigned product promotional responsibilities within our existing commercial headcount and are in the middle of a headcount expansion including in sales to drive these efforts. Turning to Remodulin. This business continues to be incredibly resilient even though it has faced generic competition for almost four years now. Continuing a trend that started last quarter, we saw a near record number of referrals in the second quarter and active Remodulin patients remain at pre-generic levels. Remunity continues to gain traction in the market as it is the only subcutaneous pump widely available for new Remodulin patient starts. Finally, Orenitram had another record quarter with the highest revenue of patients on therapy since its launch. Our 90-day titration kit launched during the first quarter has continued to receive positive patient and physician feedback. We're also very excited that data from the EXPEDITE trial which is our rapid Remodulin titration and transition to Orenitram study has now been published in two medical journals. We look forward to disseminating this important information to clinicians and appropriate forums over the balance of this year and into next. So to wrap up we're very pleased with the overall treprostinil business led by the credible demand for Tyvaso DPI. And we believe we're on our way to hitting our goal of a $4 billion annual revenue run rate by the middle of the decade. With that I'll turn the call back over to you Martine. \nMartine Rothblatt : Mike that was an amazing awesome wrap up. Thank you so much. How do you stay on top of some of the details blows my mind. Perfect. Wow. We have the best in the President. Thank you Mike. Okay. Operator, please open up the lines for any questions. And like I'll forward them amongst Mike, Pat and Dr. Peterson.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ash Verma of UBS. Please go ahead.\nAsh Verma: Hi. Thanks. Good morning and congrats for a very strong quarter here. I have two questions. One just on Tyvaso in IPF. So I wanted to ask what's your level of conviction in clinical success here? The prior increased study showed benefit in IPF subset, but in the TETON studies you're studying IPF all comers. And then second one, can you provide some color on the patient adds? Like how much of the new patient adds is coming from PH versus PH-ILD. And do you expect the patient adds per quarter to start to ramp up faster in the coming quarters and years?\nMartine Rothblatt: Ash, thank you for your question, and thanks for the congratulations. We have so many callers in the queue. I'm just going to have to limit it to one question per caller. So we'll take your first question about pulmonary fibrosis. And Dr. Peterson could you kindly respond to Ash's question?\nLeigh Peterson: Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question. So as you mentioned that we had data from increase in PH IPF a subpopulation of INCREASE that exhibited improvements in FVC, which is a marker that indicates potentially an antifibrotic activity of Tyvaso. Now this in addition to many, many publications on also a mechanism for Tyvaso which is antifibrotic gives us confidence that it will also work in the population of TETON 1 and TETON 2 which are IPF idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as well as our new study in PPF which is progressive pulmonary fibrosis.\nMartine Rothblatt: That's excellent. Dr. Peterson. And operator could you please take the next caller.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eun Yang from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nEun Yang: Thank you. Congrats on the great quarter. That's amazing numbers on Tyvaso. The question on DPI inventory buildup of $30 million in second quarter. Would that be the inventory levels that you would expect going forward, or do you think it would increase or could there be some drawdown in third quarter? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Great question, and so nice to hear your voice this morning, Eun. Thank you for the congratulations. The questions with regard to inventory, we normally ask our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond to handle because he's totally on top of the flow of everything of value in and out the company. So James, could you please answer Eun's question? \nJames Edgemond: Yes. Thanks, Martine. Good morning, Eun and thanks for the congrats on the quarter. Two parts to the response. So Michael talked about the $30 million addition to DPI inventory during the quarter, which was specific to DPI inventory build and Michael addressed nebulizers inventory as well, which is pretty much normalized. With respect to the demand for DPI for the balance of the year, as Michael talked about, this could really fluctuate going forward through the remainder of the year, as we think about patient demand as well as the manufacturing at MannKind as we work through some of the improvements that we've highlighted. So going forward, there certainly could be a fluctuation in DPI inventory. But I would want to reiterate what Michael said across the portfolio of products, as we completed the quarter, we were in contractual requirements with all the products, but it is important to highlight the DPI fluctuation going forward based upon demand as well as manufacturing at MannKind. So thanks for the question. And Martine back to you.\nMartine Rothblatt: James, just excellent answer as always. So thank you and Eun thanks for asking the question. Operator, can you please pull up the next person from the queue.\nOperator: The next question comes from Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nHartaj Singh: Great. Thank you for the question and a really nice quarter. Really tough comp last year this quarter, so really well done. Just a question on ralinepag. Assuming the Phase 3s are successful, Martine and team, how do you see the product sort of -- where do you see it being used in the treatment paradigm? Is this a straight replacement for Orenitram? Would we take some of the selexipag patients? There could be some generics there by then. Any thoughts there? \nMartine Rothblatt: Yeah. That's a great question. I'm really happy to have it. I think, Hartaj, you've been able to ask a question that kind of transcends two different areas. So, unusually I'm going to ask two separate team members to respond to your question with regard to their different levels of involvement in the frontline treatment for pulmonary hypertension clinical situation and end market. First of all Mike, if you could answer Hartaj in terms of where you see placing ralinepag once approved in basically the presentation of treatment options that would be presented to physicians by -- especially by our sales force. And then, perhaps Leigh if after Mike talks you can provide some insight that you're able to share from our clinical trials in terms of how you see what the protocol calls for in our clinical trials and that might also help to shed some light on Hartaj's question in terms of where it's being used in the clinical trial outcomes in particular. So, Mike, you first. \nMichael Benkowitz: Yeah. Sure. And again all of this is obviously contingent on how the study reads out the data and kind of what we see through the trial Hartaj. But I think generally speaking I think we expect that you'll still start with a PDE-5 and an ERA. And then at that point as once the disease -- the patient's disease continues to progress, the doctor has an option as to what to add. That's where I think we're expecting that ralinepag's sweet spot is going to be right after the PDE-5 and ERA. Now for various reasons depending on where the patient is in their disease journey, it could be maybe they need something stronger so they go to Orenitram or maybe they want the convenience of DPI so they start there and then they kind of transition back and forth. But I really kind of look at it as being sort of in that sort of area of after PDE-5 and ERA and patients' disease has started to progress further.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yeah, Mike, that makes such perfect sense, because it would really be to my understanding the only once-a-day prostacyclin category. It's not exactly a prostacyclin analog, but it works on that pathway. So the only once-a-day treatment which will just be huge for the patients because if you miss even a few doses, this disease is insidious and it could just start reclaiming territory in your lung. So compliance is king and once-a-day is the emperor type of delivery for compliance. Leigh, what kind of insights do you have on Hartaj's question from the outcome of the from the contact of the outcome study?\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. So really with -- as Michael just said with regard to selexipag, I mean, of course we're shooting for a better clinical effect, but also the fact that Michael just said it's ralinepag is once-daily dosing versus twice. So, I mean most patients feel that that's an advantage. But scientifically with -- about your question regarding Orenitram now you might remember that Orenitram or treprostinil actually binds and interacts with multiple prostacyclin receptors versus selexipag and ralinepag, who are IP-specific activators of the IP-only receptor. And so and it's thought at least from several non-clinical studies that these different receptors have different activities. And so, this could very well translate to the clinic where certain patients do better when they have binding and activation of multiple prostacyclin receptors and some patients might do better with regard to both, tolerability and efficacy if they simply have a binding and activation of the IP receptor. And so, I hope that answers your question as to where we see things. It's not a complete overlap with regard to the mechanisms of action for sure.\nMartine Rothblatt: Brilliant answer. Wow, that's why I'm so glad we have a scientist on the call. And Hartaj, I'm so glad you asked the question because look at all the information that got shared through your question. Thank you. Operator, next question?\nOperator: The next question comes from Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the quarter. A two-part question for me. Just wondering if you can comment at all on Tyvaso patient start trends in July versus June, as well as breadth of prescriber base. Mike, I know you touched on that but any more color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Thank you, Terence. Mike, you got it. \nMichael Benkowitz: Yes. I think on the referral start trends in July versus June, I mean we're continuing – it's been pretty consistent I think over the first half of the year and that's continuing into July. So I think the rate of referrals and starts is consistent with what we've seen in the first half of the year. And I would say on the prescriber growth, I think the rate of growth has been – I think what I've said is that – in the last calls that we've roughly doubled the number of prescribers since we launched. Month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, that doesn't necessarily change literally. It's just – it's a little choppy. So that's – it's increased marginally above the kind of the doubling in the last quarter. We have seen however continued – maybe stronger growth or higher growth in the last quarter in terms of the depth of three-plus prescribers. So – which is good. I mean as I said on prior calls, we use the analogy that we get the prescribers to three-plus patients you sort of kind of get the flywheel spinning and then the three goes to 10 pretty quickly thereafter. So we are making really good progress on that aspect of prescribing depth, and as I said, continuing to add top line prescribers as well.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike. Yes that's a great metaphor with the flywheel. You could just see how our success compounds, once doctors start using our medicine. Operator, we have time for just two last calls.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joseph Thome of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Thome: Hi, there. Good morning. Congrats on a quarter and thank you for taking my question. Maybe just as we think about penetration into the PH-ILD market, where do you think you stand now? And now that the therapy has been on the market for a couple of years in the indication have your expectations for the size of this market changed at all? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Thank you very much, Joe. Mike, I think you're the best person to answer that. \nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. I think on penetration of the market, I think we're in the low single-digits. And I say think because I still – and this is I think a question that was asked earlier that we just didn't have time to ask but around the kind of the mix of the PAH and the PH-ILD. I mean the data coming in on the referrals is still not – it's still a little dirty. So it's not still 100% clean in terms of what's Group one or what's Group 3. But I think based on kind of what we're seeing it's – I think it's fair to say that we're kind of in that low single digits of the PH-ILD market. And in terms of the size of the market, nothing's really changed in terms of our understanding of what that is. We kind of started out saying it's at least 30,000. We still think that that's accurate. You can talk to some KOLs, you'd think it's significantly higher than that and that may be. But like we've said all along with the 30,000 I mean that's still a really good size market for us. And so we're really focused on continuing to penetrate in that market. And get – as I said in my opening remarks, really kind of ramp up the screening of ILD patients to look for pulmonary hypertension.\nMartine Rothblatt: Super. Thank you, Mike so much. Operator, the last question we just have time for one more I'm sorry.\nOperator: The last question comes from Andreas Argyrides from Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nAndreas Argyrides: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to be the last one here. Great quarter, another congrats there as well. So lots of good questions from my colleagues on Tyvaso in the market evolving in PAH. Going back to the prepared remarks and the potential use of cash, how are you thinking about outside investment opportunities? Is it just in the PH or maybe perhaps targeting the company's core focus? Thanks.\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes, Andreas, deep and interesting question. And I think that we are most interested right now in the pulmonary fibrosis segment in terms of outside investment. It's not to say that, we don't have continued interest in the PH segment. But the PH segment is, by I think almost anybody's estimation, a pretty crowded marketplace at this point in time. And by reflection, when we started the company, there was no oral treatment approved for PH as well. There was no inhaled treatment approved for PH. In fact, all of that was really available was parenteral flow land. And if you compare that, situation with the situation today, I honestly have lost track of how many different drugs and versions of drugs and generic versions of drugs there are, but it's certainly over a dozen. So PH is a very crowded marketplace. Despite that crowding, there seems to be continued synergy amongst certain drugs in that crowded field. For example, the PDE5 inhibitor Adcirca which can be taken once daily is something which is often used in combination with several of the other drugs less often but still frequently an ETRA such as ambrisentan can be used in combination with the other drugs. And increasingly now our own Orenitram is used in combination with those other two kind of, I don't want to say weaker, but I'd say non-treprostinil strength drugs. So this kind of combination phenomena means that even though the market is very crowded, there always is still great opportunity for a new drug in terms of being used as combination therapy. And that certainly as Mike Benkowitz mentioned in his discussion of ralinepag that's our expectation in ralinepag that will be used in combination. Thanks for the congrats. But one thing that, maybe didn't get enough highlighting on the call although Dr. Peterson did talk a bit about it was the tremendous upswing in growth in Orenitram. And that's no like coincidence or just something coming out of the blue. That's because increasingly, first of all, Orenitram is being used in combination with the PDE5s and ETRAs. It's a convenient pill. And then secondly, we have another study going on to develop confirmatory data it's called the ARTISAN study. And this study shows that building on our previous smaller studies that you could rapidly switch a patient from a parenteral drug, like parenteral prostacyclins or treprostinil to Orenitram a pill. And if you do that you're able to kind of jump over this valley when you have the side effects of Orenitram without the efficacy you're able to jump over that valley and go directly to the efficacy and you're already kind of inert to the side effects or they've been mitigated by the time you spent on the parenteral drug. So again, this is all to say while PH is a crowded area, I think that there is strong room for United Therapeutics to continue to grow. There hasn't been much discussion on this call about sotatercept, but just to say some of the best data that has been published so far in sotatercept is in combination with the treprostinil product. So I think combination therapies are the way to go. Now kind of exact opposite situation is in pulmonary fibrosis, where you have a comparable size patient population yet instead of there being a dozen-plus approved drugs for it, there are really only two. And so it's a very, very different situation. Neither of those two are reported to be disease-modifying in any way. They simply have been shown to slow the rate of progression of the disease, which is good, but not as good as being disease-modifying. So, I'm very hopeful that we will have something that indicates a disease-modifying capability come out of our TETON studies. And I'm very hopeful that we can do as much in pulmonary fibrosis, as we as a company have done in pulmonary hypertension. As I mentioned when I started to answer your question, Andreas, at the beginning of the company, there were very few prescribers, because all the patients died. There was very little hope. And United Therapeutics has enabled a kind of a reinvention of the pulmonary hypertension space that now there's over a dozen drugs and patients instead of dying from pulmonary hypertension, they live with pulmonary hypertension. And there are patients living literally decades, which is amazing and wonderful. But we would like to be able to do the same thing in pulmonary fibrosis that we've done and are doing in pulmonary hypertension. Some of that will be done with internal R&D, such as the great efforts being led by Dr. Peterson the TETON 1, TETON 2, TETON 3. And then we are also keenly interested in deploying our capital for business development activities that could build out and expand our portfolio in pulmonary fibrosis. So that's just one example of a disease area outside of pulmonary hypertension that we plan to tackle. Andreas, thank you for your question. Operator, feel free to roll into the wrap-up script.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back over to Martine for closing remarks.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation earnings webcast.

            "name": "Michael Benkowitz",
            "content": "Thanks Martine. Good morning, everyone. As Martine said, we had a phenomenal second quarter from a revenue standpoint, setting revenue records for Tyvaso, Orenitram and total treprostinil. And I want to begin by publicly thanking and congratulating all of our commercial and medical affairs teams at United Therapeutics for their hard work and achievements during the quarter. As usual, I'll provide some color on what we're seeing with respect to Tyvaso, Orenitram and Remodulin. So, I'll start with Tyvaso, where I want to highlight several things. I should also mention that for purposes of these comments, Tyvaso refers to the combined nebulizer and DPI unless I otherwise know. So first as I just mentioned, we posted the highest quarterly revenues ever for Tyvaso which reflects increasing physician and patient demand in both the PAH and PH-ILD indications as well as the Tyvaso DPI inventory build of about $30 million in the quarter at the specialty pharmacies. Our underlying demand metrics that is referrals, which is what we call prescriptions new patient starts and net patient adds remained very strong and roughly in line with the last few quarters. New patient starts are trending around a 70-30 split between DPI and the nebulizer respectively. The transitioning of long-term existing nebulized Tyvaso patients to Tyvaso DPI has largely played out at this point at least until the Part D redesign provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act begin to go into effect over the next two years. And in fact, nebulized Tyvaso referrals and starts have trended upward over the last few months. We do expect that there will be some basal level of transitioning between the nebulizer and DPI going forward as physicians optimize to which delivery device is best suited to each of their patients. We also continue to make great progress growing the Tyvaso prescriber base and prescribing depth within that base. On the Tyvaso DPI supply side our partner MannKind completed their production expansion and process improvement efforts during the quarter which we expect will increase production capacity by about 250% going forward. We started to benefit from these enhancements at the end of June when as I mentioned the specialty pharmacies were able to build about $30 million of DPI inventory. Specialty pharmacy inventory levels on the last day of the quarter actually reached their contractual range based on historical demand. However, this could fluctuate through the remainder of the year as Tyvaso DPI demand grows and until MannKind has a few more months of production with the additional capacity. We anticipate that specialty pharmacies may be able to get into the regular ordering patterns for Tyvaso DPI, sometime either later this year or in the first half of '24. As a reminder, MannKind is also undertaking work to further expand production capacity even beyond these most recent improvements, which we expect will come online in 2024. I should also note that the nebulizer destocking that we highlighted in the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year did in fact conclude in the first quarter. Second quarter nebulizer orders were in line with specialty pharmacy contractual inventory levels and patient demand. So to wrap up the Tyvaso story, we're extremely pleased with the progress we've made and the opportunity that lies ahead of us. Our focus and efforts in the second half of this year and into '24 fall into four main areas: first is increasing production of supply of Tyvaso DPI in partnership with MannKind; second is increasing physician screening for PH-ILD and their ILD patient population; third is growing the prescribing breadth and driving depth to 3-plus patients as I mentioned on prior calls; and then fourth is continuing to increase patient retention on Tyvaso. While we've made very good progress on each of these items thus far there's still more we can do. And to this end, we recently realigned product promotional responsibilities within our existing commercial headcount and are in the middle of a headcount expansion including in sales to drive these efforts. Turning to Remodulin. This business continues to be incredibly resilient even though it has faced generic competition for almost four years now. Continuing a trend that started last quarter, we saw a near record number of referrals in the second quarter and active Remodulin patients remain at pre-generic levels. Remunity continues to gain traction in the market as it is the only subcutaneous pump widely available for new Remodulin patient starts. Finally, Orenitram had another record quarter with the highest revenue of patients on therapy since its launch. Our 90-day titration kit launched during the first quarter has continued to receive positive patient and physician feedback. We're also very excited that data from the EXPEDITE trial which is our rapid Remodulin titration and transition to Orenitram study has now been published in two medical journals. We look forward to disseminating this important information to clinicians and appropriate forums over the balance of this year and into next. So to wrap up we're very pleased with the overall treprostinil business led by the credible demand for Tyvaso DPI. And we believe we're on our way to hitting our goal of a $4 billion annual revenue run rate by the middle of the decade. With that I'll turn the call back over to you Martine. Yeah. Sure. And again all of this is obviously contingent on how the study reads out the data and kind of what we see through the trial Hartaj. But I think generally speaking I think we expect that you'll still start with a PDE-5 and an ERA. And then at that point as once the disease -- the patient's disease continues to progress, the doctor has an option as to what to add. That's where I think we're expecting that ralinepag's sweet spot is going to be right after the PDE-5 and ERA. Now for various reasons depending on where the patient is in their disease journey, it could be maybe they need something stronger so they go to Orenitram or maybe they want the convenience of DPI so they start there and then they kind of transition back and forth. But I really kind of look at it as being sort of in that sort of area of after PDE-5 and ERA and patients' disease has started to progress further. Yes. I think on the referral start trends in July versus June, I mean we're continuing – it's been pretty consistent I think over the first half of the year and that's continuing into July. So I think the rate of referrals and starts is consistent with what we've seen in the first half of the year.

And get – as I said in my opening remarks, really kind of ramp up the screening of ILD patients to look for pulmonary hypertension."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Leigh Peterson",
            "content": "Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question. So as you mentioned that we had data from increase in PH IPF a subpopulation of INCREASE that exhibited improvements in FVC, which is a marker that indicates potentially an antifibrotic activity of Tyvaso. Now this in addition to many, many publications on also a mechanism for Tyvaso which is antifibrotic gives us confidence that it will also work in the population of TETON 1 and TETON 2 which are IPF idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as well as our new study in PPF which is progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Yes. So really with -- as Michael just said with regard to selexipag, I mean, of course we're shooting for a better clinical effect, but also the fact that Michael just said it's ralinepag is once-daily dosing versus twice. So, I mean most patients feel that that's an advantage. But scientifically with -- about your question regarding Orenitram now you might remember that Orenitram or treprostinil actually binds and interacts with multiple prostacyclin receptors versus selexipag and ralinepag, who are IP-specific activators of the IP-only receptor.

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thank you, Dewey. I'm thrilled that United Therapeutics continues to report double-digit revenue growth and our highest quarterly revenue ever. We expect this growth trajectory to continue, with our current business, as we expect to reach a $4 billion annual revenue run rate by mid-decade. Beyond that, we expect continued waves of growth with an additional doubling of our revenue from the potential launch of Tyvaso in pulmonary fibrosis and of ralinepag in pulmonary arterial hypertension and then yet another doubling of our revenues with the potential for an unlimited supply of tolerable transplantable organs in the next decade. Let me now drive a little bit deeper into some of these absolutely fantastic results that we are pleased to report this quarter. As mentioned, the total revenues are at $596 million for the three months. But it's interesting to compare that with the matching three months of last year, which were just about $467 million. So that's a percentage growth rate of 28% and very much in line with the type of growth rate that we have previously indicated we expect to achieve in order to achieve that $4 billion revenue run rate by mid-decade. Another deeper level to look at is the company's net income. For the past quarter, we reported over $0.25 billion in net income. And again, it's instructive to compare that with the quarter -- matching quarter in 2022, when we reported $116 million in net income a percentage change of 123%. Very comparable numbers can be obtained, if you divide the net income into the outstanding shares. And in fact, we're pretty proud that as compared to peers we have a relatively low number of shares outstanding, which helps drive those fantastic results. Now let's dive even deeper, into some of the results on the products. Tyvaso $319 million, up 59% from last year. Remodulin $127 million, down about $5 million from the matching quarter last year. Orenitram $95 million, up 20% from the matching quarter last year. Unituxin $44 million essentially flat from the matching quarter last year. We don't really talk that much about Unituxin, but I probably should stop and for people who are perhaps newer to United Therapeutics, remind everyone, that this is a treatment for neuroblastoma, a pediatric cancer with a very high rate of mortality. And for the -- based on the several years that Unituxin has been used by doctors to treat that cancer, approximately 50% of the kids treated with Unituxin as well as the other concomitant therapies used, their cancer is wiped out it does not return. Even five years later, when they're checked the cancer has not returned in about half of the patients. I find that truly remarkable, and just a miracle of biotechnology and one of the many blessings to be here at United Therapeutics, that so many kids can live a cancer-free life, after getting that devastating diagnosis in their tender years. So in any event because that drug is so well used by the pediatric oncologists, we're now looking at on an annualized basis it's getting close to $200 million, a year. Now in addition, to those top line revenues and profit figures. Let's dive a little bit into the spending section. And here we break out our spending in large categories, in terms of external research and development, internal research and development and then the general administrative and sales and marketing categories, with a few miscellaneous rows put in there according to GAAP standards. So the external research and development is, what we spend on other companies assisting us with our research and development. The lion's share of that money goes to conducting our worldwide clinical trials. So, we've got quite a few clinical trials going on right now, and most of them are in the Phase III stage of development, which is the largest and the most costly phase of development. We have the two TETON 1 and TETON 2 Phase III trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. And then we have this new TETON 3 or also called PPF type of pulmonary fibrosis, which is another Phase III trial just starting up this year. We have the ongoing worldwide Ralinepag clinical trials covering countries in almost every continent. And that is a more expensive clinical trial, because that clinical trial is aiming for an endpoint to show that we reduce death and morbidity in patients, with pulmonary hypertension. So, we have to both enroll more patients and keep the study going longer, until we get a statistically significant difference in the death rates. And then we look at that and hope to achieve our statistical significance, with respect to the treated or active group. We also still are ongoing with the gene therapy trial. And so all of these trials combined, they end up costing us more than $100 million, a year, just in spending outside of the company and that's not even talking about the level of spending inside of the company. Now inside of the company we've got our great team of clinical drug developers ultimately led by Dr. Peterson who joins me on the call today. And she has just been doing an amazing, amazing job of running all of these Phase 3 trials simultaneously. And it really -- it takes a humongous amount of effort to get drug labeled, translated, shipped to these countries all over the world, constantly be monitoring those centers, sending people there every month to make sure that the protocol is being complied with. I cannot begin to tell you how long the checklist is to conduct these clinical trials. So it's not surprising that there is another more than $100 million a year spent on internal research and development. Now under the internal research and development category, we also cover the development activities for the organ manufacturing efforts that I described at the beginning of the call. And there we've got the lead program our Xeno transplantation efforts. And they're in accordance with the FDA guidance, which we received in our interact meetings with the FDA both for the xenokidney and for the xenoheart. We are proceeding with the pivotal preclinical studies necessary to enable an opening of an IND for xenokidney and xenoheart. We are doing our best to hopefully be able to open that IND as soon as possible. It's not really possible to predict exactly when the FDA would feel that it was the appropriate time to do that. But I would say that the time frame for that FDA decision kind of a reasonable case is a 2024-2025 time frame more pessimistic case could be a 2025-2026 time frame. But anyway you look at it, it is literally around the corner in drug development speak. And that's an additional area of significant spend. We also are continuing to spend heavily on our laboratory-based lung manufacturing activities both with allogeneic as well as with autologous cellularization. And that too is really a trailblazing effort where people many of them our own patients who have been treated with our medicines for pulmonary hypertension. But in the event that their disease progresses, which is usually the case with pulmonary hypertension and for that matter pulmonary fibrosis as well and of course many other lung diseases, you progress to the point of needing a lung transplant. And we are doing our best to be able to have laboratory manufactured lungs to satisfy those patients' needs for lung transplant. But in the meantime we have a really remarkable program, which we call lung bioengineering. And in this program we take lungs from organ donors who for various reasons the transplant surgeons feel they are not quite ready or certain that they want to use that donor lung for -- to put into a very, very sick person who needs that lung. So they asked the organ procurement organizations to fly those lungs to one of our two lung bioengineering centers. One is in Silver Spring, Maryland across the street from our headquarters and the other is in Jacksonville, Florida on the campus of the Mayo Clinic. And there are highly skilled highly trained technicians. They work on the lung like a person would -- like a doctor would work on a patient or a surgeon would work on a patient. And they do everything that they can to render that lung as suitable for transplantation. Again, quite to me as a person who's actually never done the procedure, I'm like blown away that half of the time they succeed and a lung that was not going to be used to save a person's life is in fact able to be used to save a person's life. And to-date we have saved over 300 people's lives with these lung bioengineering products. I'll also mention just kind of coincidentally that when we are not able to use the lung to save a person's life, we are oftentimes able to use the cells from the lung to assist in our efforts to manufacture allogeneically cellularized lungs in our laboratories. So it's kind of everything all fits together here at United Therapeutics. I know I've talked on for quite a while here but there is just so many exciting things going on at United Therapeutics. We have been able to build up a substantial cash balance and we are targeting that for three main areas of deployment. First and foremost is to invest in all of the internal projects that we have going here at United Therapeutics. And I've mentioned several of them in my remarks today. You may recall, just last quarter we talked about $0.5 billion being allocated to the production of a dedicated Tyvaso DPI production facility on our campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. So that is in recognition of the very excellent take-up that the Tyvaso DPI product has seen among physicians, patients and their families, all supporting the patients in that regard. And then another area of capital deployment would be to build the GMP equivalent production facilities for the xenokidneys and xenohearts that I mentioned previously. And of course, the FDA wants to see and we would also want to see that those xenokidneys and xenohearts are manufactured in a totally clinically appropriate fashion, which requires the animal equivalent of a GMP facility. The technical name for it is a designated pathogen-free facility. So capital is also targeted for that. In addition, we have a very robust business development group led by Dr. Betsy Eades of our company. And she is frequently bringing to us often very compelling candidates for potential either investment or outright acquisition, and we need to retain adequate capital for those opportunities. You may recall that I think probably the next biggest impact drug that we could have in pulmonary hypertension ralinepag was acquired through our business development efforts for about $1 billion. So these type of opportunities are regularly being reviewed by Dr. Eades. And then third is to repurchase shares to the extent that there is excess capital that can't be deployed for internal business development or external business development. Of course, the next step would be to engage in share repurchases and we have repurchased lots of shares over time. In fact, I mentioned earlier that our outstanding share count is relatively modest compared to peers and that is because in no small part our previous share repurchase. So with those introductory remarks, I'd now like to turn the phone over to Michael Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Mike? Mike that was an amazing awesome wrap up. Thank you so much. How do you stay on top of some of the details blows my mind. Perfect. Wow. We have the best in the President. Thank you Mike. Okay. Operator, please open up the lines for any questions. And like I'll forward them amongst Mike, Pat and Dr. Peterson. Ash, thank you for your question, and thanks for the congratulations. We have so many callers in the queue. I'm just going to have to limit it to one question per caller. So we'll take your first question about pulmonary fibrosis. And Dr. Peterson could you kindly respond to Ash's question? That's excellent. Dr. Peterson. And operator could you please take the next caller. Great question, and so nice to hear your voice this morning, Eun. Thank you for the congratulations. The questions with regard to inventory, we normally ask our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond to handle because he's totally on top of the flow of everything of value in and out the company. So James, could you please answer Eun's question? James, just excellent answer as always. So thank you and Eun thanks for asking the question. Operator, can you please pull up the next person from the queue. Yeah. That's a great question. I'm really happy to have it. I think, Hartaj, you've been able to ask a question that kind of transcends two different areas. So, unusually I'm going to ask two separate team members to respond to your question with regard to their different levels of involvement in the frontline treatment for pulmonary hypertension clinical situation and end market. First of all Mike, if you could answer Hartaj in terms of where you see placing ralinepag once approved in basically the presentation of treatment options that would be presented to physicians by -- especially by our sales force. And then, perhaps Leigh if after Mike talks you can provide some insight that you're able to share from our clinical trials in terms of how you see what the protocol calls for in our clinical trials and that might also help to shed some light on Hartaj's question in terms of where it's being used in the clinical trial outcomes in particular. So, Mike, you first. Yeah, Mike, that makes such perfect sense, because it would really be to my understanding the only once-a-day prostacyclin category. It's not exactly a prostacyclin analog, but it works on that pathway. So the only once-a-day treatment which will just be huge for the patients because if you miss even a few doses, this disease is insidious and it could just start reclaiming territory in your lung. So compliance is king and once-a-day is the emperor type of delivery for compliance. Leigh, what kind of insights do you have on Hartaj's question from the outcome of the from the contact of the outcome study? Brilliant answer. Wow, that's why I'm so glad we have a scientist on the call. And Hartaj, I'm so glad you asked the question because look at all the information that got shared through your question. Thank you. Operator, next question? Okay. Thank you, Terence. Mike, you got it. Thanks so much, Mike. Yes that's a great metaphor with the flywheel. You could just see how our success compounds, once doctors start using our medicine. Operator, we have time for just two last calls. Okay. Thank you very much, Joe. Mike, I think you're the best person to answer that. Super. Thank you, Mike so much. Operator, the last question we just have time for one more I'm sorry. Yes, Andreas, deep and interesting question. And I think that we are most interested right now in the pulmonary fibrosis segment in terms of outside investment. It's not to say that, we don't have continued interest in the PH segment. But the PH segment is, by I think almost anybody's estimation, a pretty crowded marketplace at this point in time. And by reflection, when we started the company, there was no oral treatment approved for PH as well. There was no inhaled treatment approved for PH. In fact, all of that was really available was parenteral flow land. And if you compare that, situation with the situation today, I honestly have lost track of how many different drugs and versions of drugs and generic versions of drugs there are, but it's certainly over a dozen. So PH is a very crowded marketplace. Despite that crowding, there seems to be continued synergy amongst certain drugs in that crowded field. For example, the PDE5 inhibitor Adcirca which can be taken once daily is something which is often used in combination with several of the other drugs less often but still frequently an ETRA such as ambrisentan can be used in combination with the other drugs. And increasingly now our own Orenitram is used in combination with those other two kind of, I don't want to say weaker, but I'd say non-treprostinil strength drugs. So this kind of combination phenomena means that even though the market is very crowded, there always is still great opportunity for a new drug in terms of being used as combination therapy. And that certainly as Mike Benkowitz mentioned in his discussion of ralinepag that's our expectation in ralinepag that will be used in combination. Thanks for the congrats. But one thing that, maybe didn't get enough highlighting on the call although Dr. Peterson did talk a bit about it was the tremendous upswing in growth in Orenitram. And that's no like coincidence or just something coming out of the blue. That's because increasingly, first of all, Orenitram is being used in combination with the PDE5s and ETRAs. It's a convenient pill. And then secondly, we have another study going on to develop confirmatory data it's called the ARTISAN study. And this study shows that building on our previous smaller studies that you could rapidly switch a patient from a parenteral drug, like parenteral prostacyclins or treprostinil to Orenitram a pill. And if you do that you're able to kind of jump over this valley when you have the side effects of Orenitram without the efficacy you're able to jump over that valley and go directly to the efficacy and you're already kind of inert to the side effects or they've been mitigated by the time you spent on the parenteral drug. So again, this is all to say while PH is a crowded area, I think that there is strong room for United Therapeutics to continue to grow. There hasn't been much discussion on this call about sotatercept, but just to say some of the best data that has been published so far in sotatercept is in combination with the treprostinil product. So I think combination therapies are the way to go. Now kind of exact opposite situation is in pulmonary fibrosis, where you have a comparable size patient population yet instead of there being a dozen-plus approved drugs for it, there are really only two. And so it's a very, very different situation. Neither of those two are reported to be disease-modifying in any way. They simply have been shown to slow the rate of progression of the disease, which is good, but not as good as being disease-modifying. So, I'm very hopeful that we will have something that indicates a disease-modifying capability come out of our TETON studies. And I'm very hopeful that we can do as much in pulmonary fibrosis, as we as a company have done in pulmonary hypertension. As I mentioned when I started to answer your question, Andreas, at the beginning of the company, there were very few prescribers, because all the patients died. There was very little hope. And United Therapeutics has enabled a kind of a reinvention of the pulmonary hypertension space that now there's over a dozen drugs and patients instead of dying from pulmonary hypertension, they live with pulmonary hypertension. And there are patients living literally decades, which is amazing and wonderful. But we would like to be able to do the same thing in pulmonary fibrosis that we've done and are doing in pulmonary hypertension. Some of that will be done with internal R&D, such as the great efforts being led by Dr. Peterson the TETON 1, TETON 2, TETON 3. And then we are also keenly interested in deploying our capital for business development activities that could build out and expand our portfolio in pulmonary fibrosis. So that's just one example of a disease area outside of pulmonary hypertension that we plan to tackle. Andreas, thank you for your question. Operator, feel free to roll into the wrap-up script. Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation earnings webcast. A rebroadcast of this webcast will be available for replay for one week by visiting the Events & Presentations section of the United Therapeutics Investor Relations website at ir.unither.com."

So Michael talked about the $30 million addition to DPI inventory during the quarter, which was specific to DPI inventory build and Michael addressed nebulizers inventory as well, which is pretty much normalized. With respect to the demand for DPI for the balance of the year, as Michael talked about, this could really fluctuate going forward through the remainder of the year, as we think about patient demand as well as the manufacturing at MannKind as we work through some of the improvements that we've highlighted. So going forward, there certainly could be a fluctuation in DPI inventory. But I would want to reiterate what Michael said across the portfolio of products, as we completed the quarter, we were in contractual requirements with all the products, but it is important to highlight the DPI fluctuation going forward based upon demand as well as manufacturing at MannKind. So thanks for the question. And Martine back to you."

Now I will turn the webcast over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of our first quarter 2023 financial results and the business activities of United Therapeutics. Martine?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Dewey. Very excited to welcome everyone to another great quarter at United Therapeutics. We are thrilled to continue on course towards our mid-decade goals of 25,000 patients being treated for pulmonary hypertension and the doubling of our revenue run rate. This quarter, we moved toward those goals with double-digit revenue growth from first quarter '22 to first quarter '23. And that also includes, by the way, nearly 40% growth in our main growth driver, which is Tyvaso. I think our double-digit growth rate remains a solid forecast even with the possibility of new FDA approvals of sotatercept or Liquidia. The reason is that sotatercept has not even been tested in our main growth market of Group III pulmonary hypertension. Indeed, systemic drugs are generally contraindicated there due to them causing VQ or ventilation perfusion mismatch. In the disease Tabarcept was tested in, Group I pulmonary arterial hypertension, we expect it to be complementary to either our Orenitram, Tyvaso or Remodulin products. So we don't forecast a realistic threat from sotatercept, to our growth. Sales in Liquidia, if approved, also does not challenge our projected double-digit growth is because it is not a generic product, but is instead of a strongly differentiated drug device product requiring 65% more drug to even match Tyvaso's effect based on their own clinical trial data. Also exciting to report this quarter is the robust progress in our pipeline. We are spot on target to fully enroll our current big Phase III trials by the end of next year, each of which have their own $1 billion potential. In other words, the pipeline now embeds more than double our current total revenues, and then there is the aforementioned organic doubling of our revenues from our existing products already commercialized and now entering the market, such as Tyvaso DPI, Remunity and our new Orenitram dose titration kits. I'm also very excited to report big news on the use of capital front. We have allocated $0.5 billion to a new Tyvaso DPI manufacturing facility in Search Triangle Park, North Carolina, with 50,000 patient capacity. And by the way, this is in addition to our existing nearly $100 million allocation of capital to our new clinical Xeno transplantation facility in Virginia. By the way, speaking about transplant, I'd like to thank the dozens of our shareholders and other stakeholders who sent me Amy Silversea's superb story of her heroism in the face of heart transplants and immunosuppressants. In that vein, I wanted to take a moment to update everyone on what we at United Therapeutics are doing to effectuate Amy's Quest. In our own line of company, we reprogrammed differentiated cells from patients back to stem cells called IPSCs or inducible pluripotent stem cells. By the end of this year, we'll be creating IPSCs from two patient donors every single month. In our own labs, we differentiate cells into different types of cells need for cellularizing different organs, such as lung, including stromal cells and epithelial cells and different types of alveolar cells. In our own labs, we grow differentiated cells in 3D changes into the billions of cells needed to cover each organ and in our own labs over the past three years we have produced about two trillion cells every year. Also in our own labs, we cellularize our organ scaffolds with the cells that we have expanded. Indeed, last month, we achieved a kind of level of proof of concept for one of our own cellularized lungs, provided a pig model with the level of ox considered acceptable for human lung transplants. Again, in our own labs, we produce this time under GMP conditions about 500 lung scaffolds every year and are now working on 3D printing kidney and liver scaffolds in partnership with 3D Systems. In short, Amy's vision of an immunosuppressant free organ transplant is realistic for this decade, the 2020s. Here at United Therapeutics, we expect to have patient-derived stem cell differentiated autologous lungs, kidneys and livers in the clinic within five years. Parts could also be done, though immunosuppressants would be needed because the transplanted organs will have the same DNA as a patient. So it is really the best of times here at United Therapeutics with record revenues, another $0.5 billion quarter; record pipeline potential, $2 billion-plus opportunities; and record deployment of capital and business expansion. At UT, our mantra is go big or go home. We are going big on pulmonary hypertension. We are going big on pulmonary fibrosis. And we are going big on creating an unlimited supply of transplantable, tolerable organs. Michael Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will now give you a deeper dive into the business. Mike?\nMichael Benkowitz: Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report yet another quarter of meaningful growth for our treprostinil business. And as Martine said, we're really excited to have quarterly revenues of more than $500 million for the second time in our company's history. As usual, I'm going to provide some color around what we're seeing with respect to each of our treprostinil products, Tyvaso, Remodulin and Orenitram. For Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI, underlying physician and patient demand for Tyvaso remained exceptionally strong in the first quarter as we continue to grow our Tyvaso active patients at a clip consistent with the patient growth trends for the prior three quarters. We saw a record number of referrals, which is what we call prescriptions and new patient starts during the first quarter. We also continue to increase the breadth and depth of the Tyvaso prescriber base. Since the PH-ILD launch in 2021, we have now doubled the number of Tyvaso prescribers. That's our breadth metric. And in terms of prescribing depth, I've mentioned on prior calls that our key metric here is the number of prescribers with three or more Tyvaso patients. I'm really happy to report that we've also doubled the number of prescribers in this category. The 3-plus Tyvaso prescribers now represent about 40% of all prescribers, which means we still have an opportunity to expand depth, which should pave the way to further accelerate Tyvaso growth over time. The first quarter performance for Tyvaso saw the usual early year seasonality with respect to patient discontinuations due to insurance changes and also as usual, discontinuations returned to normal levels in February, March and in April. Importantly, discontinuations for Tyvaso DPI continue to run well below that of nebulized Tyvaso, reflecting patient satisfaction with Tyvaso DPI. So overall, we believe the underlying strength of the Tyvaso business is great. Looking at first quarter revenue, as I said in the past, due to the nature of our business, we regularly encourage investors to look at longer-term revenue trends compared to quarterly revenue fluctuations. With that said, there were three main factors that impacted Tyvaso revenue in the first quarter, given that we're essentially in the middle of two product launches within the Tyvaso franchise, PH-ILD and then Tyvaso DPI. First, and as we discussed last quarter, our specialty pharmacies are still rightsizing orders for the correct DPI and nebulized mix. In the third quarter of last year, specialty pharmacies made significant orders of nebulized Tyvaso in anticipation of increased PH-ILD demand without fully appreciating the potential for Tyvaso DPI demand. Moving to the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, we saw unexpectedly strong demand for Tyvaso DPI relative to nebulized Tyvaso. And the specialty pharmacies needed to reduce its nebulized inventory, which reduced Tyvaso revenue well under patient -- well under actual patient demand in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of this year. Second, we're seeing a higher level of PAP utilization for Tyvaso DPI than we expected. We believe this is a short-term phenomenon and will subside to a large degree when the Medicare changes that are part of the inflation reduction at go into effect starting next year. Finally, due to the incredible demand for DPI and the fact that we launched immediately upon approval without building inventory, we have not been able to allow specialty pharmacies to up to their contractual minimum inventories each month. Based on our DPI demand trends and forecast, this is something that could persist for the balance of the year. Having said that, we are taking steps to increase DPI production capacity in both the short and medium term. First, our partner, MannKind, is activating a second production line and additional kitting capacity from which we expect to see increased DPI supply as soon as this quarter. Second, and in parallel, MannKind is also on track to significantly expand manufacturing capacity in the first half of next year to support up to 25,000 Tyvaso DPI patients a year. And finally, as Martine mentioned, we have initiated a construction project to build a new UT owned and operated Tyvaso DPI manufacturing facility. That facility is intended to provide enough capacity to support an additional 50,000 DPI patients per year and with expansion capacity for up to 75,000 DPI patients. Turning to Remodulin. This business continues to be incredibly resilient, even though it's faced a generic competitor for almost four years now. We saw the second highest number of referrals for Remodulin in the first quarter. And after a small dip in active patients following the generic launch of a subcutaneous version of Remodulin, our active patients are back to pre-generic levels. Remunity continues to gain traction in the market as it is the only subcutaneous pump widely available for new Remodulin patient starts, with Remunity representing over half of our monthly subcu Remodulin shipments during the quarter. Finally, Orenitram had a very solid quarter, achieving a record number of patients on therapy and record revenues. We launched a 90-day titration kit during the first quarter, which simplifies dosing and titration for new patients. While still early, physician and patient feedback has been very positive around the convenience of these new kits. There continues to be a lot of buzz in the physician community around the expedite data we top-lined last October, demonstrating that prostacyclin induction with Remodulin can lead to double the average Orenitram dose when patients shift to oral therapy and in a shorter period of time as compared to patients who do not have a Remodulin induction. We expect to publish a peer-reviewed manuscript detailing the study in the coming months. To wrap up, we're very pleased with the overall Treprostinil business, led by the incredible demand for Tyvaso DPI, and we believe we're on our way to hitting our goal of a $4 billion revenue run rate. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine to start the Q&A session.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, Mike. Those were terrific insights into every one of the products. We take that call that you shared with everyone. Operator, could you please open the phones, and I will sort the questions to the person most appropriate for answering them.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joseph Thome of TD Cowen.\nJoseph Thome: Mike, I know you mentioned that the Tyvaso DPI discontinuations are a little bit lower than what you were seeing with the nebulized Tyvaso. Maybe what are the expectations for the Tyvaso DPI average time on therapy versus what you were seeing with the nebulizer? And as we see sotatercept potentially launching maybe next year, do you expect the Tyvaso time on therapy could actually increase as these patients kind of continue to do maybe better than they did without sotatercept? Or would they intend maybe ramp down their use? How do you expect that to kind of play out?\nMartine Rothblatt: Looks like direct this question to you.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. So I think overall, we're really encouraged by the lower level of discontinuation rates with Tyvaso DPI. And we do think that, that augurs well for increased time on therapy. To put a number on that, I think it's still a little early to kind of say definitively what that's going to be. But certainly, a patient satisfaction has been really high with Tyvaso DPI. I think it's led to better adherence, better compliance and that leads to patients doing better, and then that will ultimately lead to patients staying on therapy longer. So I think your premise, your hypothesis that time on therapy will increase with DPI over time is absolutely right. And that's something we're certainly expecting. Similarly, I think sotatercept probably helps in that regard as well. If you look at the underlying data and the sotatercept study, 70% of the patients in that study were on a background prostacyclin. So as Martine said in her opening comments, we think there's a lot of complementary effects between prostacyclin and sotatercept. And so we would expect that when sotatercept is launched into the market, that will continue and patients will experience a nice benefit between the two products as well as the other products on background therapy and should continue to lead to increased time on therapy.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Hartaj Singh of Oppenheimer.\nHartaj Singh: Nice update everybody. Just had a question on OrCam in the EXPEDITE study. I know at ERS last year in Barcelona really big updates there and educating the patient/physician community. It seems like at ATS this year, again, you will kind of delve into that. If you can just talk to us a little bit about what the patient flow is. Are patients mostly starting in Remodulin, and then going over to Orenitram? Or are they still starting Orenitram and what's the breakdown? And then how can we expect sort of that to benefit Orenitram going forward? I know it already is, but could that add even more going forward?\nMartine Rothblatt: Great question, Hartaj. Mike, I think you'd be, again, be the best person to address that question.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Thanks, Hartaj, for the question. So in terms of kind of the mix of patients between starting de novo and Orenitram transition from Remodulin, I think it's roughly, call it, 65 -- two-thirds roughly, two-thirds of patients are starting Orenitram right now. And as I mentioned in my comments, I think the fact that we've got that titration -- new titration kit, I think that's going to continue to help patients titrate up on Orenitram starting de novo, and then the balance are transitions from Remodulin. I still believe that there will be there will be patients that will start de novo or Orenitram over time once we really fully, I think, take advantage of the EXPEDITE data. But I also think it's true that Tyvaso DPI is proving to be so convenient for patients, and it's almost sort of your gateway drug to prostacyclin. So I think over time, you're going to see a higher number -- higher percentage of patients initiate prostacyclin therapy on DPI even over the orals, both Orenitram and selexipag. And so the thing that we really like about the EXPEDITE data and then the ARTISAN study, which we've talked about on prior calls is it's an opportunity to take these maybe functional Class III patients or even IV patients in the case of Artisan, start them on Remodulin, get their hemodynamic hemodynamics down to closer to normal levels. And then you can flip them over to Orenitram and really use Orenitram as their maintenance drug, and continue to titrate up as you need. And if they continue -- over time, they decline, you can obviously switch them back to Remodulin. But we really see that as sort of a key position for Orenitram as we move forward over the next several years. And in some, it really just kind of speaks to the flexibility of treprostinil and the fact that we've got these different delivery options. And so it really just, I think, allows us to kind of meet the patient and the physician where the patient is in their disease progression.\nMartine Rothblatt: Great. Thanks so much, Mike. That was really beautiful the way you're able to describe that with ARTISAN and EXPEDITE and the whole rapid transition to oral. We're able to get patients into a stable equilibria, if you will, with the pulmonary artery pressures down around, I would say, below 40 millimeters of mercury. And there's like an increasing volume of data out there. Well over a dozen scientific paper that have shown that patients with pulmonary hypertension who are managed in this kind of potential well between 30 and 40 millimeters of mercury are able to achieve very long-term survival, 10, 20 years out to the limit of the papers -- of the data that the papers had access to. And those are papers by independent physicians, not from us. So we really believe that our initial mission of the company of being able to keep patients with pulmonary hypertension living with pulmonary hypertension instead of dying from pulmonary hypertension has been very largely achieved with the combination of parenteral prostacyclin to rapidly get their pressures down and then oral prostacyclin, Orenitram to be able to keep them stable in the long term. Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jessica Fye of JPMorgan.\nJessica Fye: On the plans to increase capacity for Tyvaso DPI, that sounds pretty bullish with respect to the anticipated demand trends there. And it sounds like you're seeing nice net patient adds as well. But can you just confirm whether there's any capacity constraint on DPI right now that's at all limiting to patient adds? Or is it that you're keeping up with patient demand and then in the near term, the capacity is maybe just keeping the specialty pharmacies from reaching target inventory levels? And just related to that, I think you said Tyvaso net patient adds were in line with the past three quarters. Can you just remind me what that run rate was that you're tracking in-line with.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Thanks so much for the questions, Jess, and good to hear your voice this morning. There were several questions there. So let me start with the production expansion questions. And then, Mike, if you could queue up your responses to the rest of the questions that Jess asked there. So Jess, we are pretty bullish on our forecast for Tyvaso DPI and the maximum capacity of the MannKind facility up in Danbury, Connecticut, will be by the beginning of next year, will be for 25,000 DPI patients. So we'll be entering '24 with a capacity for 25,000 patients. Now as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, our company's goals for the middle of the decade are 25 -- being able to treat 25,000 pulmonary hypertension patients. So if a large proportion of those 25,000 patients are on Tyvaso DPI, which is, I think, reasonable, then it would be like, well, where is the production capacity for the go big on pulmonary fibrosis, whereas the production capacity for what we think the pulmonary fibrosis market will be. Well, best as we can tell, we expect the pulmonary fibrosis market to actually be for Tyvaso DPI even larger than the pulmonary hypertension market. So we would need more than an additional 25,000 patient capacity for the pulmonary fibrosis market and indeed, the market research and the disease-modifying hypotheses that we have for Tyvaso DPI in pulmonary fibrosis is such that we could easily expect to have 50,000 pulmonary fibrosis patients being treated in addition to the 25,000 mid-decade pulmonary hypertension patients. So that's the reason why we need to start now deploying a substantial amount of capital to build this brand-new Tyvaso DPI production facility in Research Clinical Park, North Carolina. As Mike mentioned, even that facility, even though its launch capacity will be 50,000 patients, it will have a surge capacity to go up to 75,000 patients. So we think between the 25,000 at MannKind, the 50,000 in North Carolina, the surge to 75,000 in North Carolina, as we enter the 2026 time frame, we then have a capacity to support 75,000 to 100,000 DPI patients which would cover our needs for both Group I pulmonary hypertension, Group III pulmonary hypertension, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and additional forms of pulmonary fibrosis that go under the rubric of proliferative -- progressive pulmonary fibrosis, which in fact, we are embarking on the other additional Phase III trial for. So Mike, with those comments in terms of the production capacity, can you answer the other questions that Jess had?\nMichael Benkowitz: Absolutely. So Jess, I think your question around your first -- first part of your question was around sort of patient demand versus SP demand to build up their inventory. So it's -- we're definitely in the category of the latter. So we're not having to delay patient starts on DPI. We're making enough to meet the patient demand. I think the issue that I was referencing in my opening comments is typically, specialty pharmacy, they have an algorithm for figuring out how much -- how they order every month. They typically try to order up to have, call it, roughly two months of inventory on hand and then over the course of the month, they'll get down to about 30 days. So they generally like to keep at least -- always be in a position where they have at a minimum 30 days of inventory on hand. So due to the demand, we're not able to kind of meet that need on the part of the specialty pharmacy. Like I said, we have some additional production capacity coming online as soon as this quarter. That will start to open things up a little bit. But I think really between -- as we're continuing to grow over the balance of the year, we're probably going to be in this situation where they're not going to be able to order up to the levels they're accustomed to ordering up to until, as Martine said, we get that the significant expansion next year to get up to 25,000 patients. Second part of your question was just sort of the average, I guess, the run rate in terms of patient adds. So if you look back over the last -- this quarter and the prior three quarters, it's kind of averaged up to around 500 patient adds per quarter on Tyvaso, and that's between both DPI and nebulized.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect, Mike. Thanks so much. Operator, we're ready for your next question. .\nOperator: The next question comes from Eun Yang from Jefferies.\nEun Yang: I have a question on TETON trial. So we are expecting data in 2025. So based on the Phase III increase trial, a subgroup of patients with underlying IPF, we saw benefits on FVC up to 16 weeks. So TETON trial is a 52-week time point. So do you expect benefits on FVC to continue to increase to 52 weeks? And then can you comment on powering assumptions for the TETON trial.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks. Good morning, Eun. Nice to hear your questions. I think it will be best to have Dr. Peterson. She is in charge of running TETON trial answer your questions.\nLeigh Peterson: Yes. Thank you for your question. Yes, so in fact, the INCREASE study, indeed, the main study, the placebo-controlled study, was 16 weeks, as you mentioned. However, we do have an open-label extension study of the increased data where we've looked to see how the patients do over the longer period of time, including the 52-week time period. And we still see benefits of patients on Tyvaso in the increased population. So we feel confident that, that will translate to the longer period in the TETON studies. And as far as the TETON studies, they are definitely powered, I mean, we have 90% power to detect the difference that we've seen in the increased studies with regard to absolute FVC. So we have sufficient power to see the difference over the 52-week period. So again, we feel confident on that.\nMartine Rothblatt: It's very awesome. Thank you so much, Leigh. Operator, we are ready for your next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andreas Argyrides of Wedbush Securities.\nAndreas Argyrides: Congrats on the quarter. When thinking -- so quickly, first, what's the status of the organ manufacturing programs? And when can we expect first clinical trial? And then how should we think about spend when it comes to organ manufacturing? And I have one follow-up.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. We won't be able to take your follow-up, and Andreas congrats on the quarter. Your line broke up a little bit, but I think the gist of the question was to get an overview of the organ manufacturing situation and when we expect results of the organ manufacturing to enter into clinical trials. And I think you asked something about the capital associated with other spending. So the organ manufacturing program is a broad, multifaceted, multiple shots on Gold programs. So it won't be really realistic to give an overview of everything beyond the really exciting things I mentioned this morning that in response to any silver teams passionate arguments that part of our organ manufacturing program is strongly focused on organs that would not require immunosuppressants. In other words, autologous organs that are manufactured with the cells downstream from a patient's own donated cells. And we -- within different laboratories at United Therapeutics, we currently produce iPSC cells. In other words, we reprogram PBMCs and another differentiated cells from patients back into stem cells. We then used techniques proprietary to the company to then differentiate those stem cells into the different types of cells that we would cellularize organs with. Other programs at other laboratories within United Therapeutics are based on allogeneic cell lines that we are able to MHC segment. So patients could expect a much lighter immunosuppressant load than if they were just taking kind of an average donor organ. And then let me get to your question about the clinical trial. So the organs we have closest to clinical trials are our Xeno hearts and Xeno kidneys. These are hearts and kidneys from donor animals that have been grown under the equivalent of good manufacturing practices conditions, whether called pathogen-free conditions. And they have 10 genetic modifications that we believe will allow them to surmount hyperacute and acute rejection with no more than the normal commercially available immunosuppressants today, and be able to continue on to a long-term duration in the recipients body with the management of chronic rejection as is done today with allografts. So those organs are currently in what's called by the FDA a pivotal preclinical program. That means it's the last preclinical program before going into a human study. And that program is -- hopefully, we will be able to complete that program by the end of '24 and be able to then enter into the first clinical trials in '25. So that would be kind of a bottom line answer to your question at the first manufactured kidneys and hearts hopefully. Knock on wood, should be able to enter into clinical trials in '25. Operator, we've got time for one last question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ash Verma of UBS.\nAshwani Verma: I had one on sotatercept impact. So the feedback that we've heard for physicians indicates that Merck's product positioning and payer reception can have an important bearing on what part of your portfolio may get impacted. In your view, does that matter? And like what is the assumptions that you have on competitors' pricing in line of therapy positioning?\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Thanks for the questions, Ash. Like a frontline question that Mike an answer, and Mike will give you more of a definitive answer. But as I noted in our introductory remarks, we don't see sotatercept having any effect whatsoever on the growth guidance that we've provided for our company. And the reason for that is a lot of people are not completely clear that there are two different diseases that are treated with drugs such as ours that sound very similar and it's easy to get them confused. So the disease that sotatercept was tested in and the disease that all of our drugs are approved for all of our non-cancer drugs are approved for is called Group I pulmonary arterial hypertension, and the acronym is PAH. A different disease is called Group III pulmonary hypertension or just Group II PH. Sotatercept has never been tested, at least anything published that we're aware of, in Group III pulmonary hypertension. The only drug approved for Group III pulmonary hypertension is Tyvaso, including Tyvaso DPI. And as Mike described very well, most of our growth in the coming years, we expect to come from Group III pulmonary hypertension. So by definition, sotatercept cannot have any effect on that growth trajectory whatsoever. In addition to that, within the group I pulmonary arterial hypertension, where we do continue to have growth across our franchise, I think Mike mentioned we had our highest quarterly sales of Orenitram ever, we expect sotatercept to be complementary. And Mike, would you like to expand on that?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. I'll just kind of pick up right there, which is, I think I said in response to an earlier question around this, we definitely look at sotatercept as complementary to our drug and the other drugs that are currently on the market to treat Group I PAH. It's another pathway to now we have a drug to treat four different pathways, associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. If you look at the -- as I said, if you look at the data in the sotatercept trial, 70, 7-0, 70% of those patients were on prostacyclin therapy. So clearly, there appears to be a complementary or synergistic effects between prostacyclin and sotatercept. So we think that all of the drugs will continue to be used. I think some physicians that we've talked to have talked about, this sort of Four Corners approach of treating PAH, so you have a drug to treat each of the four pathways. How that gets sequenced and -- in the grand scheme of things doesn't really matter because I think it's still a progressive disease. There was nothing in the sotatercept data really to suggest that it's a cure or even a disease-modifying agent. I know there was some speculation that, that might be the case, but I don't think that's borne out in the data. So clearly, patients are benefiting from it, but I think it's a combination with the other drugs. And so we think over time, it's another drug that physicians can add to their treatment on rematarium, but it doesn't appear to be something that's going to replace or displace our products.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike. And thank you, operator, and everybody, for joining our first quarter conference call. The great work of Dewey Steadman. We'll be presenting at various and sundry health care conferences during the balance of the year, and we look forward to seeing you there and providing additional insights and color on United Therapeutics business. Operator, you can disconnect the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation earnings webcast.

            "name": "Michael Benkowitz",
            "content": "Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report yet another quarter of meaningful growth for our treprostinil business. And as Martine said, we're really excited to have quarterly revenues of more than $500 million for the second time in our company's history. As usual, I'm going to provide some color around what we're seeing with respect to each of our treprostinil products, Tyvaso, Remodulin and Orenitram. For Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI, underlying physician and patient demand for Tyvaso remained exceptionally strong in the first quarter as we continue to grow our Tyvaso active patients at a clip consistent with the patient growth trends for the prior three quarters. We saw a record number of referrals, which is what we call prescriptions and new patient starts during the first quarter. We also continue to increase the breadth and depth of the Tyvaso prescriber base. Since the PH-ILD launch in 2021, we have now doubled the number of Tyvaso prescribers. That's our breadth metric. And in terms of prescribing depth, I've mentioned on prior calls that our key metric here is the number of prescribers with three or more Tyvaso patients. I'm really happy to report that we've also doubled the number of prescribers in this category. The 3-plus Tyvaso prescribers now represent about 40% of all prescribers, which means we still have an opportunity to expand depth, which should pave the way to further accelerate Tyvaso growth over time. The first quarter performance for Tyvaso saw the usual early year seasonality with respect to patient discontinuations due to insurance changes and also as usual, discontinuations returned to normal levels in February, March and in April. Importantly, discontinuations for Tyvaso DPI continue to run well below that of nebulized Tyvaso, reflecting patient satisfaction with Tyvaso DPI. So overall, we believe the underlying strength of the Tyvaso business is great. Looking at first quarter revenue, as I said in the past, due to the nature of our business, we regularly encourage investors to look at longer-term revenue trends compared to quarterly revenue fluctuations. With that said, there were three main factors that impacted Tyvaso revenue in the first quarter, given that we're essentially in the middle of two product launches within the Tyvaso franchise, PH-ILD and then Tyvaso DPI. First, and as we discussed last quarter, our specialty pharmacies are still rightsizing orders for the correct DPI and nebulized mix. In the third quarter of last year, specialty pharmacies made significant orders of nebulized Tyvaso in anticipation of increased PH-ILD demand without fully appreciating the potential for Tyvaso DPI demand. Moving to the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, we saw unexpectedly strong demand for Tyvaso DPI relative to nebulized Tyvaso. And the specialty pharmacies needed to reduce its nebulized inventory, which reduced Tyvaso revenue well under patient -- well under actual patient demand in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of this year. Second, we're seeing a higher level of PAP utilization for Tyvaso DPI than we expected. We believe this is a short-term phenomenon and will subside to a large degree when the Medicare changes that are part of the inflation reduction at go into effect starting next year. Finally, due to the incredible demand for DPI and the fact that we launched immediately upon approval without building inventory, we have not been able to allow specialty pharmacies to up to their contractual minimum inventories each month. Based on our DPI demand trends and forecast, this is something that could persist for the balance of the year. Having said that, we are taking steps to increase DPI production capacity in both the short and medium term. First, our partner, MannKind, is activating a second production line and additional kitting capacity from which we expect to see increased DPI supply as soon as this quarter. Second, and in parallel, MannKind is also on track to significantly expand manufacturing capacity in the first half of next year to support up to 25,000 Tyvaso DPI patients a year. And finally, as Martine mentioned, we have initiated a construction project to build a new UT owned and operated Tyvaso DPI manufacturing facility. That facility is intended to provide enough capacity to support an additional 50,000 DPI patients per year and with expansion capacity for up to 75,000 DPI patients. Turning to Remodulin. This business continues to be incredibly resilient, even though it's faced a generic competitor for almost four years now. We saw the second highest number of referrals for Remodulin in the first quarter. And after a small dip in active patients following the generic launch of a subcutaneous version of Remodulin, our active patients are back to pre-generic levels. Remunity continues to gain traction in the market as it is the only subcutaneous pump widely available for new Remodulin patient starts, with Remunity representing over half of our monthly subcu Remodulin shipments during the quarter. Finally, Orenitram had a very solid quarter, achieving a record number of patients on therapy and record revenues. We launched a 90-day titration kit during the first quarter, which simplifies dosing and titration for new patients. While still early, physician and patient feedback has been very positive around the convenience of these new kits. There continues to be a lot of buzz in the physician community around the expedite data we top-lined last October, demonstrating that prostacyclin induction with Remodulin can lead to double the average Orenitram dose when patients shift to oral therapy and in a shorter period of time as compared to patients who do not have a Remodulin induction. We expect to publish a peer-reviewed manuscript detailing the study in the coming months. To wrap up, we're very pleased with the overall Treprostinil business, led by the incredible demand for Tyvaso DPI, and we believe we're on our way to hitting our goal of a $4 billion revenue run rate. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine to start the Q&A session. Sure. So I think overall, we're really encouraged by the lower level of discontinuation rates with Tyvaso DPI. And we do think that, that augurs well for increased time on therapy. To put a number on that, I think it's still a little early to kind of say definitively what that's going to be. But certainly, a patient satisfaction has been really high with Tyvaso DPI. I think it's led to better adherence, better compliance and that leads to patients doing better, and then that will ultimately lead to patients staying on therapy longer. So I think your premise, your hypothesis that time on therapy will increase with DPI over time is absolutely right. And that's something we're certainly expecting. Similarly, I think sotatercept probably helps in that regard as well. If you look at the underlying data and the sotatercept study, 70% of the patients in that study were on a background prostacyclin. So as Martine said in her opening comments, we think there's a lot of complementary effects between prostacyclin and sotatercept. And so we would expect that when sotatercept is launched into the market, that will continue and patients will experience a nice benefit between the two products as well as the other products on background therapy and should continue to lead to increased time on therapy. Sure. Thanks, Hartaj, for the question. So in terms of kind of the mix of patients between starting de novo and Orenitram transition from Remodulin, I think it's roughly, call it, 65 -- two-thirds roughly, two-thirds of patients are starting Orenitram right now. And as I mentioned in my comments, I think the fact that we've got that titration -- new titration kit, I think that's going to continue to help patients titrate up on Orenitram starting de novo, and then the balance are transitions from Remodulin. I still believe that there will be there will be patients that will start de novo or Orenitram over time once we really fully, I think, take advantage of the EXPEDITE data. But I also think it's true that Tyvaso DPI is proving to be so convenient for patients, and it's almost sort of your gateway drug to prostacyclin. So I think over time, you're going to see a higher number -- higher percentage of patients initiate prostacyclin therapy on DPI even over the orals, both Orenitram and selexipag. And so the thing that we really like about the EXPEDITE data and then the ARTISAN study, which we've talked about on prior calls is it's an opportunity to take these maybe functional Class III patients or even IV patients in the case of Artisan, start them on Remodulin, get their hemodynamic hemodynamics down to closer to normal levels. And then you can flip them over to Orenitram and really use Orenitram as their maintenance drug, and continue to titrate up as you need. And if they continue -- over time, they decline, you can obviously switch them back to Remodulin. But we really see that as sort of a key position for Orenitram as we move forward over the next several years. And in some, it really just kind of speaks to the flexibility of treprostinil and the fact that we've got these different delivery options. And so it really just, I think, allows us to kind of meet the patient and the physician where the patient is in their disease progression. Absolutely. So Jess, I think your question around your first -- first part of your question was around sort of patient demand versus SP demand to build up their inventory. So it's -- we're definitely in the category of the latter. So we're not having to delay patient starts on DPI. We're making enough to meet the patient demand. I think the issue that I was referencing in my opening comments is typically, specialty pharmacy, they have an algorithm for figuring out how much -- how they order every month. They typically try to order up to have, call it, roughly two months of inventory on hand and then over the course of the month, they'll get down to about 30 days. So they generally like to keep at least -- always be in a position where they have at a minimum 30 days of inventory on hand. So due to the demand, we're not able to kind of meet that need on the part of the specialty pharmacy. Like I said, we have some additional production capacity coming online as soon as this quarter. That will start to open things up a little bit. But I think really between -- as we're continuing to grow over the balance of the year, we're probably going to be in this situation where they're not going to be able to order up to the levels they're accustomed to ordering up to until, as Martine said, we get that the significant expansion next year to get up to 25,000 patients. Second part of your question was just sort of the average, I guess, the run rate in terms of patient adds. So if you look back over the last -- this quarter and the prior three quarters, it's kind of averaged up to around 500 patient adds per quarter on Tyvaso, and that's between both DPI and nebulized. Sure. I'll just kind of pick up right there, which is, I think I said in response to an earlier question around this, we definitely look at sotatercept as complementary to our drug and the other drugs that are currently on the market to treat Group I PAH. It's another pathway to now we have a drug to treat four different pathways, associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. If you look at the -- as I said, if you look at the data in the sotatercept trial, 70, 7-0, 70% of those patients were on prostacyclin therapy. So clearly, there appears to be a complementary or synergistic effects between prostacyclin and sotatercept. So we think that all of the drugs will continue to be used. I think some physicians that we've talked to have talked about, this sort of Four Corners approach of treating PAH, so you have a drug to treat each of the four pathways. How that gets sequenced and -- in the grand scheme of things doesn't really matter because I think it's still a progressive disease. There was nothing in the sotatercept data really to suggest that it's a cure or even a disease-modifying agent. I know there was some speculation that, that might be the case, but I don't think that's borne out in the data. So clearly, patients are benefiting from it, but I think it's a combination with the other drugs. And so we think over time, it's another drug that physicians can add to their treatment on rematarium, but it doesn't appear to be something that's going to replace or displace our products."

            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thank you, Dewey. Very excited to welcome everyone to another great quarter at United Therapeutics. We are thrilled to continue on course towards our mid-decade goals of 25,000 patients being treated for pulmonary hypertension and the doubling of our revenue run rate. This quarter, we moved toward those goals with double-digit revenue growth from first quarter '22 to first quarter '23. And that also includes, by the way, nearly 40% growth in our main growth driver, which is Tyvaso. I think our double-digit growth rate remains a solid forecast even with the possibility of new FDA approvals of sotatercept or Liquidia. The reason is that sotatercept has not even been tested in our main growth market of Group III pulmonary hypertension. Indeed, systemic drugs are generally contraindicated there due to them causing VQ or ventilation perfusion mismatch. In the disease Tabarcept was tested in, Group I pulmonary arterial hypertension, we expect it to be complementary to either our Orenitram, Tyvaso or Remodulin products. So we don't forecast a realistic threat from sotatercept, to our growth. Sales in Liquidia, if approved, also does not challenge our projected double-digit growth is because it is not a generic product, but is instead of a strongly differentiated drug device product requiring 65% more drug to even match Tyvaso's effect based on their own clinical trial data. Also exciting to report this quarter is the robust progress in our pipeline. We are spot on target to fully enroll our current big Phase III trials by the end of next year, each of which have their own $1 billion potential. In other words, the pipeline now embeds more than double our current total revenues, and then there is the aforementioned organic doubling of our revenues from our existing products already commercialized and now entering the market, such as Tyvaso DPI, Remunity and our new Orenitram dose titration kits. I'm also very excited to report big news on the use of capital front. We have allocated $0.5 billion to a new Tyvaso DPI manufacturing facility in Search Triangle Park, North Carolina, with 50,000 patient capacity. And by the way, this is in addition to our existing nearly $100 million allocation of capital to our new clinical Xeno transplantation facility in Virginia. By the way, speaking about transplant, I'd like to thank the dozens of our shareholders and other stakeholders who sent me Amy Silversea's superb story of her heroism in the face of heart transplants and immunosuppressants. In that vein, I wanted to take a moment to update everyone on what we at United Therapeutics are doing to effectuate Amy's Quest. In our own line of company, we reprogrammed differentiated cells from patients back to stem cells called IPSCs or inducible pluripotent stem cells. By the end of this year, we'll be creating IPSCs from two patient donors every single month. In our own labs, we differentiate cells into different types of cells need for cellularizing different organs, such as lung, including stromal cells and epithelial cells and different types of alveolar cells. In our own labs, we grow differentiated cells in 3D changes into the billions of cells needed to cover each organ and in our own labs over the past three years we have produced about two trillion cells every year. Also in our own labs, we cellularize our organ scaffolds with the cells that we have expanded. Indeed, last month, we achieved a kind of level of proof of concept for one of our own cellularized lungs, provided a pig model with the level of ox considered acceptable for human lung transplants. Again, in our own labs, we produce this time under GMP conditions about 500 lung scaffolds every year and are now working on 3D printing kidney and liver scaffolds in partnership with 3D Systems. In short, Amy's vision of an immunosuppressant free organ transplant is realistic for this decade, the 2020s. Here at United Therapeutics, we expect to have patient-derived stem cell differentiated autologous lungs, kidneys and livers in the clinic within five years. Parts could also be done, though immunosuppressants would be needed because the transplanted organs will have the same DNA as a patient. So it is really the best of times here at United Therapeutics with record revenues, another $0.5 billion quarter; record pipeline potential, $2 billion-plus opportunities; and record deployment of capital and business expansion. At UT, our mantra is go big or go home. We are going big on pulmonary hypertension. We are going big on pulmonary fibrosis. And we are going big on creating an unlimited supply of transplantable, tolerable organs. Michael Benkowitz, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will now give you a deeper dive into the business. Mike? Thank you so much, Mike. Those were terrific insights into every one of the products. We take that call that you shared with everyone. Operator, could you please open the phones, and I will sort the questions to the person most appropriate for answering them. Looks like direct this question to you. Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question please. Great question, Hartaj. Mike, I think you'd be, again, be the best person to address that question. Great. Thanks so much, Mike. That was really beautiful the way you're able to describe that with ARTISAN and EXPEDITE and the whole rapid transition to oral. We're able to get patients into a stable equilibria, if you will, with the pulmonary artery pressures down around, I would say, below 40 millimeters of mercury. And there's like an increasing volume of data out there. Well over a dozen scientific paper that have shown that patients with pulmonary hypertension who are managed in this kind of potential well between 30 and 40 millimeters of mercury are able to achieve very long-term survival, 10, 20 years out to the limit of the papers -- of the data that the papers had access to. And those are papers by independent physicians, not from us. So we really believe that our initial mission of the company of being able to keep patients with pulmonary hypertension living with pulmonary hypertension instead of dying from pulmonary hypertension has been very largely achieved with the combination of parenteral prostacyclin to rapidly get their pressures down and then oral prostacyclin, Orenitram to be able to keep them stable in the long term. Operator, next question. Okay. Thanks so much for the questions, Jess, and good to hear your voice this morning. There were several questions there. So let me start with the production expansion questions. And then, Mike, if you could queue up your responses to the rest of the questions that Jess asked there. So Jess, we are pretty bullish on our forecast for Tyvaso DPI and the maximum capacity of the MannKind facility up in Danbury, Connecticut, will be by the beginning of next year, will be for 25,000 DPI patients. So we'll be entering '24 with a capacity for 25,000 patients. Now as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, our company's goals for the middle of the decade are 25 -- being able to treat 25,000 pulmonary hypertension patients. So if a large proportion of those 25,000 patients are on Tyvaso DPI, which is, I think, reasonable, then it would be like, well, where is the production capacity for the go big on pulmonary fibrosis, whereas the production capacity for what we think the pulmonary fibrosis market will be. Well, best as we can tell, we expect the pulmonary fibrosis market to actually be for Tyvaso DPI even larger than the pulmonary hypertension market. So we would need more than an additional 25,000 patient capacity for the pulmonary fibrosis market and indeed, the market research and the disease-modifying hypotheses that we have for Tyvaso DPI in pulmonary fibrosis is such that we could easily expect to have 50,000 pulmonary fibrosis patients being treated in addition to the 25,000 mid-decade pulmonary hypertension patients. So that's the reason why we need to start now deploying a substantial amount of capital to build this brand-new Tyvaso DPI production facility in Research Clinical Park, North Carolina. As Mike mentioned, even that facility, even though its launch capacity will be 50,000 patients, it will have a surge capacity to go up to 75,000 patients. So we think between the 25,000 at MannKind, the 50,000 in North Carolina, the surge to 75,000 in North Carolina, as we enter the 2026 time frame, we then have a capacity to support 75,000 to 100,000 DPI patients which would cover our needs for both Group I pulmonary hypertension, Group III pulmonary hypertension, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and additional forms of pulmonary fibrosis that go under the rubric of proliferative -- progressive pulmonary fibrosis, which in fact, we are embarking on the other additional Phase III trial for. So Mike, with those comments in terms of the production capacity, can you answer the other questions that Jess had? Perfect, Mike. Thanks so much. Operator, we're ready for your next question. . Thanks. Good morning, Eun. Nice to hear your questions. I think it will be best to have Dr. Peterson. She is in charge of running TETON trial answer your questions. It's very awesome. Thank you so much, Leigh. Operator, we are ready for your next question. Okay. We won't be able to take your follow-up, and Andreas congrats on the quarter. Your line broke up a little bit, but I think the gist of the question was to get an overview of the organ manufacturing situation and when we expect results of the organ manufacturing to enter into clinical trials. And I think you asked something about the capital associated with other spending. So the organ manufacturing program is a broad, multifaceted, multiple shots on Gold programs. So it won't be really realistic to give an overview of everything beyond the really exciting things I mentioned this morning that in response to any silver teams passionate arguments that part of our organ manufacturing program is strongly focused on organs that would not require immunosuppressants. In other words, autologous organs that are manufactured with the cells downstream from a patient's own donated cells. And we -- within different laboratories at United Therapeutics, we currently produce iPSC cells. In other words, we reprogram PBMCs and another differentiated cells from patients back into stem cells. We then used techniques proprietary to the company to then differentiate those stem cells into the different types of cells that we would cellularize organs with. Other programs at other laboratories within United Therapeutics are based on allogeneic cell lines that we are able to MHC segment. So patients could expect a much lighter immunosuppressant load than if they were just taking kind of an average donor organ. And then let me get to your question about the clinical trial. So the organs we have closest to clinical trials are our Xeno hearts and Xeno kidneys. These are hearts and kidneys from donor animals that have been grown under the equivalent of good manufacturing practices conditions, whether called pathogen-free conditions. And they have 10 genetic modifications that we believe will allow them to surmount hyperacute and acute rejection with no more than the normal commercially available immunosuppressants today, and be able to continue on to a long-term duration in the recipients body with the management of chronic rejection as is done today with allografts. So those organs are currently in what's called by the FDA a pivotal preclinical program. That means it's the last preclinical program before going into a human study. And that program is -- hopefully, we will be able to complete that program by the end of '24 and be able to then enter into the first clinical trials in '25. So that would be kind of a bottom line answer to your question at the first manufactured kidneys and hearts hopefully. Knock on wood, should be able to enter into clinical trials in '25. Operator, we've got time for one last question. Okay. Thanks for the questions, Ash. Like a frontline question that Mike an answer, and Mike will give you more of a definitive answer. But as I noted in our introductory remarks, we don't see sotatercept having any effect whatsoever on the growth guidance that we've provided for our company. And the reason for that is a lot of people are not completely clear that there are two different diseases that are treated with drugs such as ours that sound very similar and it's easy to get them confused. So the disease that sotatercept was tested in and the disease that all of our drugs are approved for all of our non-cancer drugs are approved for is called Group I pulmonary arterial hypertension, and the acronym is PAH. A different disease is called Group III pulmonary hypertension or just Group II PH. Sotatercept has never been tested, at least anything published that we're aware of, in Group III pulmonary hypertension. The only drug approved for Group III pulmonary hypertension is Tyvaso, including Tyvaso DPI. And as Mike described very well, most of our growth in the coming years, we expect to come from Group III pulmonary hypertension. So by definition, sotatercept cannot have any effect on that growth trajectory whatsoever. In addition to that, within the group I pulmonary arterial hypertension, where we do continue to have growth across our franchise, I think Mike mentioned we had our highest quarterly sales of Orenitram ever, we expect sotatercept to be complementary. And Mike, would you like to expand on that? Thanks so much, Mike. And thank you, operator, and everybody, for joining our first quarter conference call. The great work of Dewey Steadman. We'll be presenting at various and sundry health care conferences during the balance of the year, and we look forward to seeing you there and providing additional insights and color on United Therapeutics business. Operator, you can disconnect the call."

Now I will turn the call -- the webcast over to Martine for an overview of our third quarter 2024 financial results and the business activities of United Therapeutics. Martine?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Dewey, and good morning, everyone. We have slides available for reference, and I encourage you to review those at your leisure. I'm not going to speak directly to the slides. United Therapeutics is a momentum story. We continue to reach and exceed our goals quarter after quarter, year after year in all three waves of growth: foundation, innovation and revolution. For our foundation wave, driven by our current commercial business, United Therapeutics posted its sixth consecutive quarter of record revenue, led by double-digit growth for Tyvaso, both nebulized and DPI Orenitram and Unituxin. We also had a record number of patients on Tyvaso DPI, Orenitram and Remodulin. We remain confident in the potential for our current commercial business to continue to drive double-digit revenue growth in the near and midterm as our innovation wave starts to reach the market. Our innovation wave is on the cusp of generating significant registration phase data with the TETON 2 study of nebulized Tyvaso in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis expected to report top line data in the second half of 2025. As we progress toward full enrollment for TETON 1 by the end of this year, data for that study will not be far behind. In 2026, we expect to complete our ADVANCE OUTCOMES study of Ralinepag in PAH. And finally, in 2025, we expect FDA action on our recently submitted premarket approval application for our Centralized Lung Evaluation System, or CLES, Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion technology. Beyond our record-setting commercial performance, we expect a steady stream of clinical data reads and regulatory actions through the next 36 months, setting our company up well for continued growth through the balance of the decade. Our Revolution Wave is also making tangible progress toward reality with our Phase I study for miroliverELAP now underway, the first clinical study of a bioengineered organ alternative. We expect data from this initial safety study in 2025. Also within our Revolution Wave, we recently received feedback from the FDA regarding our IND for our UKidney 10-gene edited porcine xenokidney, and we expect to file our IND shortly for what will be the first clinical study of a xeno organ. We look forward to sharing more details on our clinical trial design and commercial opportunity in the future following acceptance of our IND. To close, I want to reiterate that our momentum is strong and growing. We have double-digit revenue growth from our thriving commercial business. We have several important data reads and potential regulatory decisions over the next 36 months, and we're moving into the clinic with revolutionary organ alternative technologies. In short, there is no other biotech with the vision, grit and determination as United Therapeutics. I'll now turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, James Edgemond, to give a summary of our recently completed accelerated share repurchase program and our capital allocation priorities. James?\nJames Edgemond: Thank you, Martine. I'd like to provide an update on our capital allocation strategy, specifically regarding our accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, that was announced in late March 2024 earlier this year. As you recall, we entered into an ASR agreement with Citi to repurchase $1 billion of UTHR common stock. During the third quarter, Citi successfully completed the overall ASR program having repurchased a total of approximately 3.5 million shares at an average repurchase price of approximately $282 which repurchase shares we are currently holding as treasury stock on our balance sheet. The approximately 3.5 million repurchase shares represent approximately 7% of our outstanding shares as of the program's initiation date. Despite this overall reduction in UT's outstanding share count, liquidity in our stock has increased as reflected by our average daily trading volume being at its highest level ever through the end of September. Since the program's announcement in late March 2024, our stock appreciated 47% through September 30. The completion of this ASR program demonstrates our commitment over the last 12 months to all of our capital allocation priorities. First, through our innovative clinical development pipeline, as well as CapEx to support our DPI manufacturing facility in North Carolina and our clinical scale xenotransplantation DPF facilities in Virginia and Minnesota. Second, through the acquisition of IVIVA and Miromatrix, as well as an in-licensing agreement to support our small molecule business; and finally, through successful completion of this ASR. Looking ahead, we remain committed to all three capital allocation priorities, which in order are, first, to invest in our commercial and R&D opportunities through P&L spend as well as capital outlays for our commercial and clinical facilities. Our second priority is to pursue intelligent business and corporate development opportunities that enhance our rare disease focus and complement our organ alternative initiatives like bolt-on M&A and in-license opportunities. And our third priority is to return capital to shareholders like share repurchases. And we'll continue to consider all three priorities when deploying our financial capital. Our healthy balance sheet and robust cash flow generation driven by our growing commercial portfolio, enable us to continue to pursue these capital allocation priorities in a thoughtful manner. Moreover, we remain in a strong position to meet our mid- and long-term goals that set ourselves up for future growth across our innovative pipeline with Tyvaso in pulmonary fibrosis and Ralinepag in pulmonary hypertension, and our revolutionary organ alternative program. On a separate note, in the third quarter, we recorded under selling, general and administrative expenses, a litigation accrual of $65.1 million in connection with a potential judgment in the Sandoz case. While this liability could be adjusted up or down in the future as the litigation progresses, it should not be considered a recurring expense. I'll now turn the call over to our President, Michael Benkowitz, who will give an overview of our commercial performance. Michael?\nMichael Benkowitz: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are excited and pleased to report another quarter of record-breaking revenue, achieving a remarkable $749 million, which represents a 23% growth from the third quarter of 2023. Achieving this $3 billion revenue run rate just eight quarters after surpassing the $2 billion run rate mark is a significant milestone for our company, something we have been really focused on hitting since the beginning of the year. Before I provide the usual product performance overview, I want to express my thanks and congratulations to my fellow Unitarians for their incredible effort and success. Total Tyvaso revenue for the third quarter was $434 million, marking a 33% increase over the previous year. This growth was driven by continued uptake of Tyvaso DPI, growth in utilization by PH-ILD patients, an increase in pricing and enhanced commercial utilization following the implementation of the Part D redesign provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act. Tyvaso has solidified its position as the number one prescribed prostacyclin treatment in the U.S. across both nebulizer and dry powder inhaler delivery systems. Referral and start patterns remain very robust and the franchise saw record commercial and total patients, reinforcing our confidence in the durability of our growth profile. We're also seeing the benefit of the sales force expansion and realignment that went into effect at the beginning of this year. Through the third quarter, we have grown our prescriber base by almost 15%, while still maintaining prescribing depth, measured as those physicians with three or more Tyvaso patients. 40% of these new prescribers are ILD physicians which is important to grow the PH-ILD market and eventually the IPF and PPF markets if our clinical trials in those indications are successful. We also reported record revenue for Orenitram at $113 million for the third quarter, representing a 23% growth from the same period last year. This increase was driven by increased demand, higher commercial utilization and pricing adjustments. As with Tyvaso, referral and start patterns remained strong, and we ended the quarter with a record number of commercial and total patients. We are seeing increased utilization of the expedite induction protocol where PAH patients initiate treprostinil therapy on Remodulin and then transition to Orenitram. Over time, we could see the average Orenitram dose per patient increase as patients are able to reach a therapeutic dose more quickly with this approach. Worldwide revenue for Remodulin was $128 million, a slight decline of 2% from last year due to international order timing. However, U.S. revenue grew by 3% year-over-year, setting a new record for total U.S. patients on therapy. And for the first nine months of the year, U.S. Remodulin revenue was up about 12% from the same period in 2023 reflecting the continued strength of the brand despite competition on multiple fronts. Looking deeper, U.S. Remodulin referral and start patterns remain very strong. Remodulin remains the most prescribed parental prostacyclin in the U.S. with sustained demand for both intravenous and subcutaneous administration. And this comes five years after the first launch of a generic version of Remodulin. Finally, Unituxin also achieved record revenue of $61 million for the third quarter, up 19% from the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue for Unituxin was $58 million, driven by both price and volume increases. This growth demonstrates the product's strong market presence and the effectiveness of our commercial strategies. To wrap up, we are extremely proud of our achievements this quarter driven by strong performance from each of our commercial products. We are well positioned to continue providing these important medicines to our patients and delivering value to our shareholders. Martine, I'll turn things back to you to run the Q&A. Martine, do we still have you?\nOperator: We have lost connection with Martine. Okay, so, Dewey, you want to run the Q&A.\nDewey Steadman: Yes, I'll run the Q&A. Operator, can we have our first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Thome with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Thome: Hi there. Good morning. Congrats on the progress. And thank you for taking my question. Maybe a little bit of a follow-up to the expedite question. We have heard since when [indiscernible] launch that some patients are able to deescalate from Remodulin down to oral Orenitram. I guess, is this something that you were seeing? Obviously, Orenitram was strong in the quarter. And patients that do kind of titrate off of Remodulin onto the Orenitram, are they going to higher doses like what we were seeing in expedite? Maybe how would you expect this to impact the revenue line maybe going forward?\nMartine Rothblatt: Michael, go ahead. Can you take that?\nMichael Benkowitz: Thank you. Yes, I'll go ahead and take that one. Yes. So I think two parts to that question, Joe. Thanks for the question. I think on the first part in terms of the -- I guess, the down titration off of Remodulin to Orenitram, I wouldn't say this is a trend yet or I guess, a widely used practice. I mean, we have heard at the margins that there -- some patients are able to do that. But I think the jury is still out on whether that's going to become like a widespread trend. We did kind of point back to kind of how -- to Remodulin performance during the quarter which is certainly showing that brand is continuing to grow, and there's certainly still a place for Remodulin and parental prostacyclin therapy in PAH. Regarding expedite and the transition from Remodulin to Orenitram, and the short answer to that is, yes, we do expect higher doses with Orenitram as a result of the expedite protocol. We're seeing, I'd say, higher average dose, right? Because the idea is that you start patients on Remodulin, you titrate them up to a range of a dose and then you're able to transition them over to Orenitram and you're able to get them up to a therapeutic dose, in some cases as soon as a month, but I would say, in kind of a one to two range, which would normally take -- if you're starting de novo, it could take up to six months. And then from there, depending on the patients to how the patient is doing, you can continue to titrate up. So as a result of that, as we see more patients coming to Orenitram from Remodulin, we're going to see that average dose for Orenitram to continue to tick up over time.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Michael. Great answer. Next question please.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Roanna Ruiz with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nRoanna Ruiz: So I noticed that the nebulized Tyvaso had pretty robust growth in the quarter along with DPI. I was just curious if you could elaborate on some of the drivers behind that? Did that include some new patient starts? And was there a piece of that where if you're observing, are there more patients transitioning from nebulizer to DPI eventually?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Roanna. Michael, you definitely have the most knowledge of us on that. So if you could answer?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. I think some of the growth -- some of the year-over-year growth in the nebulized Tyvaso was a function of some of the destocking that we saw last year. And so that may be explain some of the delta. But I would say generally, from a trending standpoint, I think we've reached kind of a really nice kind of steady state in terms of the mix of DPI and nebulizer. It's roughly 2/3, 1/3 in favor of DPI. And we're starting to see really both of those growing. I would say, transitions back and forth between the products, nebulizer to DPI or DPI to nebulizer, it's pretty marginal at this point. I mean, we are seeing some of that, but not a lot. I mean, I think we saw -- when we launched in the DPI, we did see, obviously, a significant number of nebulizer patients transition over to DPI. But that's largely played out. So it's really, I think, more case by case, how is the patient doing on one delivery system versus the other. And then the nice thing about our portfolio is the doctors can toggle back and forth as they need to, depending on how the patient is doing. Martine?\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect. Thank you so much Michael. Operator, next question.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Andreas Argyrides with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nAndreas Argyrides: Good morning and thanks for taking our questions and congrats on another solid quarter. We have some couple of capital allocation questions, just one or two parts here. But can you talk about Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI manufacturing capacity needs to support IPF? Will additional investment need to take place? And then along the share repurchase program, how are you thinking about the potential to run another program, especially given the lead up into the IPF?\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Thanks for those questions. And by the way, thanks to Oppenheimer as well for continuing a Rare Disease Day that we'll be very proud to present at. Our whole community appreciates that. Those two questions are best addressed by James. So James, can you take it from here?\nJames Edgemond: Yes. Thanks, Martine. So Andreas, good to hear your voice this morning. On your first question, which I think was capital allocation, but really related to production of DPI relative to an approval in IPF. And we do not expect to have -- or let me say it differently, we expect to be able to support and approval of IPF with DPI. So our production facility in North Carolina, which we talked about previously, a $500 million investment in a new manufacturing facility for Tyvaso DPI and the thinking of expanding that manufacturing capacity was not only to continue serving the existing patient population but be in a strong position to support new indications that would use DPI going forward. So we don't expect any -- we expect to be able to support that and don't expect any shortages or anything like that going forward at all. The second question with respect to the share repurchase. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we did do the $1 billion ASR in 2024, which was completed in September. And as I also mentioned, over the last 12 months, we've actually demonstrated our commitment to all three capital allocation priorities through various opportunities. And going forward, we're going to continue to thoughtfully evaluate the deployment of capital in all our capital allocation priorities going forward. So investing in ourselves, in our facilities through a thoughtful corporate development, but also through potentially ASRs. But again, at this point, we're not calling specifically out in ASR going forward, but it's going to be in our catalyst going forward as we look at all our capital deployment. So Martine, back to you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Thank you, James. That's -- I love how you covered all 360 degrees of that question, excellent. Operator, next question.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Roger Song with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nRoger Song: Great. Congrats for the quarter. Thank you for taking our question. Maybe a question relates to the margin. And since your sales is reaching a pretty good kind of steady state with a slight growth just curious about the nuance between IV versus subcu against the generics? And then should we see some regrowth from here?\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay, Roger. Thank you for your question and the complement on the blowout order. Yes, and thank you also for recognizing the growth in the Remodulin patients. I think Mike would have all of the answers at his fingertips to the questions you asked. Mike?\nMichael Benkowitz: Yes. Thanks, Martine. Thanks for the question, Roger. So with respect to Remodulin, I mean -- I think we have -- ever since we were on the cusp of a generic launch, been very confident about the durability and resilience of the brand through generic competition and then even through the introduction of other medicines in PAH. I think if you talk to doctors today, they still think that, that is one of the go-to drugs, one of the best drugs that we have at our disposal to treat pulmonary hypertension patients. I think the limitation of it being more widely used is one is patients are a little bit reluctant to go on a pump before they have to. And there are other options available. So naturally, we're going to want to try and experiment or use these less invasive options before moving to Remodulin. But PAH is a progressive disease. There is no cure. And so we believe that really almost all patients, at some point, are going to need parental prostacyclin. So that's really why, over time, we've been very, I think, confident in the durability of the Remodulin product. And we continue to feel that, that will be the case going forward. And so as we look out into the future, we continue to believe that it will continue to perform at current levels. As we talked about with I think Joe's question, I mean, there could be some toggling back and forth between Remodulin and Orenitram, starting on Remodulin, going to Orenitram, moving up to Orenitram. But even those patients, at some point, may need to go on Remodulin. So you may see some variability there over the next few years as the expedite approach continues to take hold. We have another trial that is about to complete called the ARTISAN study where it's similar to expedite and that we're starting the patient on Remodulin. We're actually keeping them on for a longer period of time and the idea is that we're able to return the hemodynamics to a normal level and then transition those patients over to Orenitram as a maintenance drug. So we continue to feel very strongly that there will be a place for Remodulin in the PAH armamentarium now and in the future.\nMartine Rothblatt: Excellent, Mike. I'd love when you used the word armamentarium. That describes us -- yes. Well, it's like hits UT, right at the bullseye. Perfect. Operator, next question.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJessica Fye: Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on what sounds like some favorable pre-IND feedback for the 10-gene edit kidney. Can you elaborate on some of that pre-IND feedback you got from FDA? And maybe talk about how we should think about the design and goals for initial clinical trial?\nMartine Rothblatt: Sure, Jessica, and it's so nice to hear your voice this morning as well. We have on our call, Dr. Leigh Peterson. She is in charge of all xenotransplantation. So Leigh, could you address Jessica's question.\nLeigh Peterson: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. You're right. We did receive some pre-IND feedback from the FDA on our UKidney, which is the 10-gene edited porcine xenokidney, and we're working very hard to submit that IND shortly. We did propose the clinical study design. We had a few proposals there. But unfortunately, we haven't -- I mean, we really don't want to share all of the details until it's officially cleared by FDA, which is IND clearance. So we're really looking forward to sharing that design with you later, but we need to get that IND cleared first.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, Leigh. Great answer. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Ash Verma with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAsh Verma: Great, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Just good to see you get to the $3 billion annualized revenue run rate. I know you had previously outlined this goal of reaching $4 billion run rate actually in 2025. Are you still on track to get there? And then secondly, in the last quarter, you made a mention a potential rebating contracting, I know the competitor launch has since then been pushed out to May next year, but have you already rebated some book of your business preemptively?\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. So maybe best would be to have Mike talk about the competitor environment. And with regard to the revenue run rate, it is actually quite amazing that we have doubled from $1.5 billion to $3 billion revenue run rate so rapidly. As we've mentioned throughout the call and in the earnings release, and actually, as we've been forecasting for the past several quarters, we feel very comfortable continuing our double-digit annual revenue growth based on all of the products that we have in our portfolio and already approved and then in the pipeline and then with the three waves that we talk about. So if you just do the math, you take $3 billion revenue run rate and you keep growing it at a double-digit rate, very quickly, you will be able to get to a $4 billion or $5 billion, $6 billion and beyond revenue run rates, and that's what we're targeting. Mike, can you talk about the competitor environment question?\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. And I think your question was specifically around some of the payer contracts we've entered into or in the process that we entered into. So we did have some that started. This is mainly on the Part D side where we haven't with the Part D payers where we historically have not contracted. So we had a couple that went effective July 1. We have a couple, I think, that kicked on October 1. And then I think one that kicks on January 1. So by January 1, they will all be in place. So we did see a little bit higher gross to net, particularly on DPI in Q3. But as you can see, we're clearly able to kind of grow through that. We think entering into these contracts now positions us very favorably for when a competitor comes to the market because we will, at that point, have rebate dollars already flowing through the payers, and we have parity and non-disadvantaged language. So I think they're going to be reluctant to just turn those off overnight. And so we thought it was important to kind of get those contracts in place, and I just have to give really a big shout out to our market access team. They did a phenomenal job in negotiating these contracts and really, I think, negotiating them on terms are very favorable to United Therapeutics.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect. Thanks, Michael. Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: We are not showing any further questions at this time.\nMartine Rothblatt: Excellent. Thank you. We've blown them away. Fantastic. Well, just to wrap up here, as we mentioned at the beginning, United Therapeutics is a very strong momentum story. As a bit of a science nerd, I've got to point out that momentum is mass times velocity. And our mass is truly formidable. We have a huge fault of intellectual property. We've got over 1,000 top of their game science, marketing and allied health professionals among our employee base and others have pointed out that we have a fortress balance sheet. So all of that is really, as Michael would say, an armamentarium of math. And then in terms of velocity, UT really prides itself at moving at an entrepreneurial speed and the speed that we're moving in is in the direction of ever greater evasion and then, ultimately, a revolution in manufactured organ and organ alternative products. Thank you so much for participating in the call today, and I'll turn it back to the operator to wrap it up.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation Earnings Webcast.

Today, we are excited and pleased to report another quarter of record-breaking revenue, achieving a remarkable $749 million, which represents a 23% growth from the third quarter of 2023. Achieving this $3 billion revenue run rate just eight quarters after surpassing the $2 billion run rate mark is a significant milestone for our company, something we have been really focused on hitting since the beginning of the year. Before I provide the usual product performance overview, I want to express my thanks and congratulations to my fellow Unitarians for their incredible effort and success.

Looking deeper, U.S. Remodulin referral and start patterns remain very strong. Remodulin remains the most prescribed parental prostacyclin in the U.S. with sustained demand for both intravenous and subcutaneous administration. And this comes five years after the first launch of a generic version of Remodulin. Finally, Unituxin also achieved record revenue of $61 million for the third quarter, up 19% from the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue for Unituxin was $58 million, driven by both price and volume increases. This growth demonstrates the product's strong market presence and the effectiveness of our commercial strategies. To wrap up, we are extremely proud of our achievements this quarter driven by strong performance from each of our commercial products. We are well positioned to continue providing these important medicines to our patients and delivering value to our shareholders. Martine, I'll turn things back to you to run the Q&A.

We're seeing, I'd say, higher average dose, right? Because the idea is that you start patients on Remodulin, you titrate them up to a range of a dose and then you're able to transition them over to Orenitram and you're able to get them up to a therapeutic dose, in some cases as soon as a month, but I would say, in kind of a one to two range, which would normally take -- if you're starting de novo, it could take up to six months. And then from there, depending on the patients to how the patient is doing, you can continue to titrate up. So as a result of that, as we see more patients coming to Orenitram from Remodulin, we're going to see that average dose for Orenitram to continue to tick up over time. Sure. I think some of the growth -- some of the year-over-year growth in the nebulized Tyvaso was a function of some of the destocking that we saw last year. And so that may be explain some of the delta. But I would say generally, from a trending standpoint, I think we've reached kind of a really nice kind of steady state in terms of the mix of DPI and nebulizer. It's roughly 2/3, 1/3 in favor of DPI. And we're starting to see really both of those growing. I would say, transitions back and forth between the products, nebulizer to DPI or DPI to nebulizer, it's pretty marginal at this point. I mean, we are seeing some of that, but not a lot. I mean, I think we saw -- when we launched in the DPI, we did see, obviously, a significant number of nebulizer patients transition over to DPI. But that's largely played out. So it's really, I think, more case by case, how is the patient doing on one delivery system versus the other. And then the nice thing about our portfolio is the doctors can toggle back and forth as they need to, depending on how the patient is doing. Martine? Yes. Thanks, Martine. Thanks for the question, Roger. So with respect to Remodulin, I mean -- I think we have -- ever since we were on the cusp of a generic launch, been very confident about the durability and resilience of the brand through generic competition and then even through the introduction of other medicines in PAH. I think if you talk to doctors today, they still think that, that is one of the go-to drugs, one of the best drugs that we have at our disposal to treat pulmonary hypertension patients. I think the limitation of it being more widely used is one is patients are a little bit reluctant to go on a pump before they have to. And there are other options available. So naturally, we're going to want to try and experiment or use these less invasive options before moving to Remodulin. But PAH is a progressive disease. There is no cure. And so we believe that really almost all patients, at some point, are going to need parental prostacyclin. So that's really why, over time, we've been very, I think, confident in the durability of the Remodulin product. And we continue to feel that, that will be the case going forward. And so as we look out into the future, we continue to believe that it will continue to perform at current levels. As we talked about with I think Joe's question, I mean, there could be some toggling back and forth between Remodulin and Orenitram, starting on Remodulin, going to Orenitram, moving up to Orenitram. But even those patients, at some point, may need to go on Remodulin. So you may see some variability there over the next few years as the expedite approach continues to take hold. We have another trial that is about to complete called the ARTISAN study where it's similar to expedite and that we're starting the patient on Remodulin. We're actually keeping them on for a longer period of time and the idea is that we're able to return the hemodynamics to a normal level and then transition those patients over to Orenitram as a maintenance drug. So we continue to feel very strongly that there will be a place for Remodulin in the PAH armamentarium now and in the future. Sure. And I think your question was specifically around some of the payer contracts we've entered into or in the process that we entered into. So we did have some that started. This is mainly on the Part D side where we haven't with the Part D payers where we historically have not contracted. So we had a couple that went effective July 1. We have a couple, I think, that kicked on October 1. And then I think one that kicks on January 1. So by January 1, they will all be in place. So we did see a little bit higher gross to net, particularly on DPI in Q3. But as you can see, we're clearly able to kind of grow through that. We think entering into these contracts now positions us very favorably for when a competitor comes to the market because we will, at that point, have rebate dollars already flowing through the payers, and we have parity and non-disadvantaged language. So I think they're going to be reluctant to just turn those off overnight. And so we thought it was important to kind of get those contracts in place, and I just have to give really a big shout out to our market access team. They did a phenomenal job in negotiating these contracts and really, I think, negotiating them on terms are very favorable to United Therapeutics."

We did receive some pre-IND feedback from the FDA on our UKidney, which is the 10-gene edited porcine xenokidney, and we're working very hard to submit that IND shortly. We did propose the clinical study design. We had a few proposals there. But unfortunately, we haven't -- I mean, we really don't want to share all of the details until it's officially cleared by FDA, which is IND clearance. So we're really looking forward to sharing that design with you later, but we need to get that IND cleared first."

            "content": "Thank you, Dewey, and good morning, everyone. We have slides available for reference, and I encourage you to review those at your leisure. I'm not going to speak directly to the slides. United Therapeutics is a momentum story. We continue to reach and exceed our goals quarter after quarter, year after year in all three waves of growth: foundation, innovation and revolution. For our foundation wave, driven by our current commercial business, United Therapeutics posted its sixth consecutive quarter of record revenue, led by double-digit growth for Tyvaso, both nebulized and DPI Orenitram and Unituxin. We also had a record number of patients on Tyvaso DPI, Orenitram and Remodulin. We remain confident in the potential for our current commercial business to continue to drive double-digit revenue growth in the near and midterm as our innovation wave starts to reach the market. Our innovation wave is on the cusp of generating significant registration phase data with the TETON 2 study of nebulized Tyvaso in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis expected to report top line data in the second half of 2025. As we progress toward full enrollment for TETON 1 by the end of this year, data for that study will not be far behind. In 2026, we expect to complete our ADVANCE OUTCOMES study of Ralinepag in PAH. And finally, in 2025, we expect FDA action on our recently submitted premarket approval application for our Centralized Lung Evaluation System, or CLES, Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion technology. Beyond our record-setting commercial performance, we expect a steady stream of clinical data reads and regulatory actions through the next 36 months, setting our company up well for continued growth through the balance of the decade. Our Revolution Wave is also making tangible progress toward reality with our Phase I study for miroliverELAP now underway, the first clinical study of a bioengineered organ alternative. We expect data from this initial safety study in 2025. Also within our Revolution Wave, we recently received feedback from the FDA regarding our IND for our UKidney 10-gene edited porcine xenokidney, and we expect to file our IND shortly for what will be the first clinical study of a xeno organ. We look forward to sharing more details on our clinical trial design and commercial opportunity in the future following acceptance of our IND. To close, I want to reiterate that our momentum is strong and growing. We have double-digit revenue growth from our thriving commercial business. We have several important data reads and potential regulatory decisions over the next 36 months, and we're moving into the clinic with revolutionary organ alternative technologies. In short, there is no other biotech with the vision, grit and determination as United Therapeutics. I'll now turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, James Edgemond, to give a summary of our recently completed accelerated share repurchase program and our capital allocation priorities. James? Michael, go ahead. Can you take that? Thank you, Michael. Great answer. Next question please. Thanks, Roanna. Michael, you definitely have the most knowledge of us on that. So if you could answer? Perfect. Thank you so much Michael. Operator, next question. Okay. Thanks for those questions. And by the way, thanks to Oppenheimer as well for continuing a Rare Disease Day that we'll be very proud to present at. Our whole community appreciates that. Those two questions are best addressed by James. So James, can you take it from here? Okay. Thank you, James. That's -- I love how you covered all 360 degrees of that question, excellent. Operator, next question. Okay, Roger. Thank you for your question and the complement on the blowout order. Yes, and thank you also for recognizing the growth in the Remodulin patients. I think Mike would have all of the answers at his fingertips to the questions you asked. Mike? Excellent, Mike. I'd love when you used the word armamentarium. That describes us -- yes. Well, it's like hits UT, right at the bullseye. Perfect. Operator, next question. Sure, Jessica, and it's so nice to hear your voice this morning as well. We have on our call, Dr. Leigh Peterson. She is in charge of all xenotransplantation. So Leigh, could you address Jessica's question. Thank you so much, Leigh. Great answer. Operator, next question please. Okay. So maybe best would be to have Mike talk about the competitor environment. And with regard to the revenue run rate, it is actually quite amazing that we have doubled from $1.5 billion to $3 billion revenue run rate so rapidly. As we've mentioned throughout the call and in the earnings release, and actually, as we've been forecasting for the past several quarters, we feel very comfortable continuing our double-digit annual revenue growth based on all of the products that we have in our portfolio and already approved and then in the pipeline and then with the three waves that we talk about. So if you just do the math, you take $3 billion revenue run rate and you keep growing it at a double-digit rate, very quickly, you will be able to get to a $4 billion or $5 billion, $6 billion and beyond revenue run rates, and that's what we're targeting. Mike, can you talk about the competitor environment question? Perfect. Thanks, Michael. Operator, we have time for one last question. Excellent. Thank you. We've blown them away. Fantastic. Well, just to wrap up here, as we mentioned at the beginning, United Therapeutics is a very strong momentum story. As a bit of a science nerd, I've got to point out that momentum is mass times velocity. And our mass is truly formidable. We have a huge fault of intellectual property. We've got over 1,000 top of their game science, marketing and allied health professionals among our employee base and others have pointed out that we have a fortress balance sheet. So all of that is really, as Michael would say, an armamentarium of math. And then in terms of velocity, UT really prides itself at moving at an entrepreneurial speed and the speed that we're moving in is in the direction of ever greater evasion and then, ultimately, a revolution in manufactured organ and organ alternative products. Thank you so much for participating in the call today, and I'll turn it back to the operator to wrap it up."

            "name": "James Edgemond",
            "content": "Thank you, Martine. I'd like to provide an update on our capital allocation strategy, specifically regarding our accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, that was announced in late March 2024 earlier this year. As you recall, we entered into an ASR agreement with Citi to repurchase $1 billion of UTHR common stock. During the third quarter, Citi successfully completed the overall ASR program having repurchased a total of approximately 3.5 million shares at an average repurchase price of approximately $282 which repurchase shares we are currently holding as treasury stock on our balance sheet. The approximately 3.5 million repurchase shares represent approximately 7% of our outstanding shares as of the program's initiation date. Despite this overall reduction in UT's outstanding share count, liquidity in our stock has increased as reflected by our average daily trading volume being at its highest level ever through the end of September. Since the program's announcement in late March 2024, our stock appreciated 47% through September 30. The completion of this ASR program demonstrates our commitment over the last 12 months to all of our capital allocation priorities. First, through our innovative clinical development pipeline, as well as CapEx to support our DPI manufacturing facility in North Carolina and our clinical scale xenotransplantation DPF facilities in Virginia and Minnesota. Second, through the acquisition of IVIVA and Miromatrix, as well as an in-licensing agreement to support our small molecule business; and finally, through successful completion of this ASR. Looking ahead, we remain committed to all three capital allocation priorities, which in order are, first, to invest in our commercial and R&D opportunities through P&L spend as well as capital outlays for our commercial and clinical facilities. Our second priority is to pursue intelligent business and corporate development opportunities that enhance our rare disease focus and complement our organ alternative initiatives like bolt-on M&A and in-license opportunities. And our third priority is to return capital to shareholders like share repurchases. And we'll continue to consider all three priorities when deploying our financial capital. Our healthy balance sheet and robust cash flow generation driven by our growing commercial portfolio, enable us to continue to pursue these capital allocation priorities in a thoughtful manner. Moreover, we remain in a strong position to meet our mid- and long-term goals that set ourselves up for future growth across our innovative pipeline with Tyvaso in pulmonary fibrosis and Ralinepag in pulmonary hypertension, and our revolutionary organ alternative program. On a separate note, in the third quarter, we recorded under selling, general and administrative expenses, a litigation accrual of $65.1 million in connection with a potential judgment in the Sandoz case. While this liability could be adjusted up or down in the future as the litigation progresses, it should not be considered a recurring expense. I'll now turn the call over to our President, Michael Benkowitz, who will give an overview of our commercial performance. Michael? Yes. Thanks, Martine. So Andreas, good to hear your voice this morning. On your first question, which I think was capital allocation, but really related to production of DPI relative to an approval in IPF. And we do not expect to have -- or let me say it differently, we expect to be able to support and approval of IPF with DPI. So our production facility in North Carolina, which we talked about previously, a $500 million investment in a new manufacturing facility for Tyvaso DPI and the thinking of expanding that manufacturing capacity was not only to continue serving the existing patient population but be in a strong position to support new indications that would use DPI going forward. So we don't expect any -- we expect to be able to support that and don't expect any shortages or anything like that going forward at all. The second question with respect to the share repurchase. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we did do the $1 billion ASR in 2024, which was completed in September. And as I also mentioned, over the last 12 months, we've actually demonstrated our commitment to all three capital allocation priorities through various opportunities. And going forward, we're going to continue to thoughtfully evaluate the deployment of capital in all our capital allocation priorities going forward. So investing in ourselves, in our facilities through a thoughtful corporate development, but also through potentially ASRs. But again, at this point, we're not calling specifically out in ASR going forward, but it's going to be in our catalyst going forward as we look at all our capital deployment. So Martine, back to you."

Now I will turn the webcast over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of our second quarter 2024 financial results and the business activities of United Therapeutics. Dr. Rothblatt?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you very Dewey, We at UT are very pleased and proud to present the results of another record quarter. As described in the press release, PowerPoint and the financials, we are doing very well across the board. Double-digit revenue growth is the norm. In a moment, our President, Mike Benkowitz, will provide some deep insight into these numbers. So let me start with the strategic overview. We see our business as three waves of success. First, approved products that are market leaders for the mid-2020s. Second, next-generation products and new indications that can be market leaders in the late 2020s. Third, an organ manufacturing business that can transform the treatment of end-stage organ disease. Examples of the first wave are Remodulin, Tyvaso, Orenitram and Unituxin. Examples of the second wave are Ralinepag as a once-daily pill for pulmonary hypertension and our TETON trial aiming to show improvement in pulmonary fibrosis. Examples of our third wave of success are our xenotransplantation products that offer tremendous potential for the thousands patients on dialysis. Now I'm sometimes asked with all of this success, Martine, what keeps you up at night. Well, let me start with what does not keep me up. What does not keep me up is our foundational business, because I do not see any threats to the vitality of our Remodulin, Tyvaso or Orenitram products. For Remodulin and Tyvaso, my confidence is borne of the uniqueness and clinical efficacy of our drug device combination technology. For Remodulin, there is no other parenteral drug delivery device that is as small accurate and easy to use as our Remunity Pump. It's happened acoustic volume sensing technology is more than 10 times more accurate than legacy pumps and has fewer moving parts. For Tyvaso, there is no other dry powder inhaler so well matched to deep lung delivery of our drug as the mankind DPI. The proof is really in the pudding in record time, thousands of patients have begun using our patented device in both old and new pulmonary indications, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and interstitial lung disease. Competition in our current foundational business doesn't really keep me up either, because they are mostly used in combination with our drugs or if not used drug delivery devices that are not as elegant as our and DPI devices. Now let me jump ahead to the organ business. That also doesn't keep me up because in the last year, we have obtained multiple times scientific proof that our Xeno kidney function well in human bodies with no more immunosuppression than an allograft. Folks that cannot happen by accident. Of course, there's much more work to do to get these Xeno kidney FDA approved and even more work to do to get them into quantity production, but I see no show stoppers, and we have achieved proof of concept. It is only in our second wave of success, Tyvaso for pulmonary fibrosis and Ralinepag for PAH that I find myself kept up at night. The reason is that the results a clinical trial cannot be known until it is unblinded. And even a study that is 90% powered for success by definition, still has a 10% chance of missing. Of course, we are doing everything we can to ensure the credibility and approvability of our IPF and Ralinepag clinical trials. But because these two products have the potential to more than double our current $3 billion revenue run rate, the stakes are extremely high. In conclusion, UT is a rock-solid bet on its current foundational business. UT is a very, very good bet and a highly rewarding one at that in its next stage generation products that are now in late-stage clinical trials. And UT is a once-in-a-lifetime biotechnology opportunity in manufactured organs. With that strategic overview, I'd like to now turn the call over to our President, Michael Benkowitz. Mike?\nMichael Benkowitz: Thanks Martine and good morning, everyone. As Martine noted, today, we reported yet another quarter of record revenue at $715 million and 20% growth from the second quarter of 2023. We saw meaningful worldwide revenue growth for all of our key products, Tyvaso, Orenitram, Remodulin, and Unituxin. First, I want to touch on Tyvaso, which when viewing the nebulizer and dry powder inhaler delivery systems together, remains the number one prescribed prostacyclin treatment in the U.S. Total Tyvaso revenue for the second quarter was $398 million, up 25% over last year with growth led by continued uptake of Tyvaso DPI, increase in pricing, and increased commercial utilization, following the implementation of the Part D redesign provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA. For the franchise, we saw record referrals and starts during the quarter, leading us to have confidence in the durability of our growth profile, as Martine mentioned. The percentage of Tyvaso DPI patients using our patient access programs continues to tick down following the implementation of the first provisions of the IRA earlier this year, albeit not at the same rate we saw between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. We could continue to see a modest decline in patient access program utilization through the remainder of the year as new patients on therapy are less likely to need patient assistance, having met their copay obligations on another product before starting Tyvaso DPI. The benefit from this could be offset by modest rebates from our initial contracting efforts to ensure a period of access in the future for Tyvaso DPI. As an aside, we understand that CMS will soon publish the negotiated prices for the first 10 drugs selected under the IRA's drug price negotiation provision. I want to remind investors that our drugs are not on this list. In addition, based on our current understanding of the IRA statute and guidance issued by CMS thus far, we expect our treprostinil products will not be subject to price negotiation under the IRA because there is at least one marketed generic version of treprostinil. Moving to Orenitram. We reported getting another quarter of record revenue at $107 million, representing 13% growth from the second quarter of 2023. Like the first quarter, this was driven by a combination of increased commercial utilization, pricing, and a modest increase in average dose from prior quarter levels. Recall that Orenitram and Remodulin are priced on a per milligram basis. Like with Tyvaso DPI, we saw a modest decrease in patient access program used for Orenitram in the second quarter, driven by the same dynamics. Likewise, we expect a modest decline in patient access program used through the remainder of the year. Our medical teams continue to have scientific discussions based on recent scientific publications, with healthcare providers on the EXPEDITE induction protocol where PAH patients initiate on Remodulin and then transition to Orenitram as an option for appropriate patients who may not want or need to go on long-term parenteral therapy. Moving to Remodulin. Worldwide revenue of $147 million was up 16% from last year with very strong performance across all of our underlying demand metrics. And this comes five years after the first launch of generic Remodulin, reflecting our continued commitment to our patients and Remodulin. Remodulin, both intravenous and subcutaneous remains the most prescribed parental prostacyclin in the US. Our Remunity pump remains the only option for new subcutaneous patient starts. Last quarter, we heard through the channel that specialty pharmacy distributors are going to start proactively converting all subcu treprostinil use, to Remodulin and our immunity pump given the discontinuation of support for the CAD MS3 system by its manufacturer. We've seen this trend continue through the second quarter. Finally, Unituxin. Worldwide revenue of $52 million was up 17% from the prior year quarter and US Unituxin revenue of $47 million was up 18%. US growth was driven by price and volume. To wrap-up with our fifth quarter in a row of record revenue, our commercial products clearly have the innovation, interest momentum and muscle to continue to grow serve our patients. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine to run the Q&A.\nMartine Rothblatt: Michael, that was just such a perfect overview of everything. Thanks so much, and thanks for all of all of your leadership in those areas. Operator, you may now bring forward the first call.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We will pause momentarily for the first question. Today, it will come from Roanna Ruiz with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nRoanna Ruiz: Hey, good morning, everyone. So I was curious, could you elaborate a bit on the different drivers you saw in quarter for Tyvaso DPI versus nebulized Tyvaso. And were there any changes or reasons for greater confidence coming through, like I think you mentioned increased number of referrals and possibly ramping the new field force that we should keep in mind going into 3Q this year?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you for that question, Roanna, that type of commercialization question would be best handled by Michael.\nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Thanks for the question. So I think the underlying demand metrics, just kind of -- we continue to just, I think, plug along or tug-along like we have the past few quarters with the referrals and the starts and continues to come from both Group 1 PAH as well as Group 3 PAH ILD. The second part of your question about the sales force, I think we're starting to see some of the impact of that sales force expansion in the second quarter. As you recall, we started that ramp-up in the last fall, really fully deployed that team January 1. And of course, it takes a little bit of time for the reps to get out in the field and get in front of those physicians and have the opportunity to educate them on the benefits of our products. But what's been really nice to see so far in the first six months is the increase in the number of ILD prescribers actually writing Tyvaso. So when we first launched in the PAH ILD a couple of years ago, our efforts are really focused on educating around the need to screen for pulmonary hypertension. And then once they started to do that -- that the patients had, pulmonary hypertension associated with ILD, then they can make the decision whether we refer that patient into the PH clinic or trying to treat it themselves. I would say, the vast majority of doctors at that time started referring to the PAH clinic. So -- but we knew really -- for us to I think, realize the full opportunity that have in PAH-ILD, these physicians are going to have to start treating just because of the number of patients that are out there and the bandwidth constraints on the physicians in the PAH clinic. So it's been really nice to see that over the last six months, we really started to increase the breadth of ILD prescribers as well as the depth and recall the depth metric we always look at is physicians with 30-plus [ph] patients. And so we're seeing really positive momentum and growth on both of those key metrics.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, Mike, and thank you, Roanna, for your question. Operator, you could bring forward the next question.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJessica Fye: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Curious if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the PAH marketplace as it relates to the initial winner of your launch. Do your observations line up with Merck's commentary yesterday, have you noticed any changes in referrals or starts in PAH?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks, Jess. Nice to hear your voice this morning. Again, I think it's a market dynamic question that Michael is the best person to answer.\nMichael Benkowitz: Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question, Jess. Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to really comment too much on Merck's product. I mean they're plenty capable of speaking to sell. I would say with respect to our business and specifically in the PAH, I think the business remains very solid, very strong, really strong referral growth, really, really strong start growth, patient shipments, all of the underlying demand metrics continue to be in line with what we expect and where we think we need to be, and that's obviously being reflected in the revenue line on our financial statement. So, yes, at this point, in the first quarter, no surprises there. I think as Martine said in opening remarks, if you look at the Merck’s clinical trial, most of those patients were using sotatercept in combination with prostacyclins and that certainly at least seems to be how that's playing out so far.\nMartine Rothblatt: Perfect. Thanks so much, Mike. Thank you, Jess. Operator, could you bring forward the next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ash Verma with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAsh Verma: Great. Thanks for that. So my question just wanted to understand. So look, I mean, I think the stock has reacted pretty favorably to the ASR. And I know from a cash outflow, you mentioned last quarter that you have now a more specific understanding of what's required for Xeno. So given where we are right now, like what's your appetite for another significant share buyback or another ASR?\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you for your question, Ash. That being basically a kind of a capital allocation question, I think the best person on the call to answer that would be our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond. James?\nJames Edgemond: Great. Thanks, Martine. Ash, good to hear your voice. Thank you for the question. Two kinds of responses to your question; one is, our current ASR is still in process. The existing or the second tranche as we've described in our disclosure, the $700 million still is in process through the end of September of this year. So we're going to first focus on executing the existing ASR and share repurchase program. A second kind of consideration is, we are still committed to allocating capital wisely. And in the best interest of stakeholders by first deploying it, as we've said historically, Ash, internally for our R&D initiatives, including manufacturing facilities and included in those manufacturing facilities certainly is our consideration of future commercial DPF capital requirements. Second is we're going to still focus on corporate development to find those opportunities where we think can bring value to shareholders and value to patients. And third, kind of what we've said to be [indiscernible] at the beginning, our current share repurchase program. So our capital allocation program will continue to continue to be the same. We'll evaluate and get more knowledgeable about construction of the DPF facilities. But right now, we're just going to continue to focus on the ASR that's in place and then continue to use that capital allocation waterfall to evaluate any future opportunities, whether it's share repurchase or otherwise. But thank you for the question, Martine, back to you.\nMartine Rothblatt: James, that was a 360-degree comprehensive answer to Ash. So, greatly appreciated. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Joseph Thome with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Thome: Hi there. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Maybe just 1 on the filing strategy for IPF, assuming success. I guess, do both of the ongoing IPF studies need to be successful in order to pursue a filing? Or do you think there is a P-value level or a level of benefit that you could see in one where you maybe would only need one of these studies to work and any feedback from the FDA on that point would be helpful if you have it? Thank you.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Joe, for that question. Fortunately, we have on our call the person who's in charge of that entire program, Dr. Leigh Peterson. So Dr. Peterson, could you kindly respond to Joe?\nLeigh Peterson: Yes, sure. We haven't recently discussed this with FDA. I mean this was really early, early discussions with the IND, they really just gave us the boilerplate language that they always do, which is typically we require 2 studies for 2 positive studies for registration. But of course, I mean, if we see, we'll likely see the TETON2 results coming out before TETON1, at least the top line results because as you know, we completed the TETON2 enrollment period early. And so we'll see those, and we will certainly continue discussions with FDA. I mean assuming a really significant, highly positive, clinically significant results, then we will certainly have a discussion with them about that.\nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, Dr. Peterson. And -- just to -- because she's too modest to really TETON's [ph] horn, but I just want to remind everybody that Dr. Peterson and Dr. Smith, her right-hand clinical trial leader. They're the same team that executed so successfully or interstitial lung disease trial that resulted in the -- in really much of what we are celebrating today, the explosive growth in Group 3 PAH and the entry into that space of DPI. So this team, I can -- I know for sure, because I see them often, they, too, they sweat this trial day and night, and we are -- this is our -- somebody said like, what is your number one priority, it is the success with the TETON trial and the indication to achieve an indication in pulmonary fibrosis, a market that is probably three times the size of pulmonary hypertension market. And again, our trial design is in combination with already approved background therapies. So there's no real kind of having to like take a patient off a drug to start them on an inhaled treprostinil. And similarly, there's no need to put patient on another drug to start them because we have both types of patients in the trial. So we would hope for all of that to be in the label. Anyway, sorry to ramble on there a bit, Dr. Peterson, but great answer to Joe. And operator, due the time we have time for just one more question.\nOperator: And that question will come from Andreas Argyrides with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nAndreas Argyrides: Good morning and thanks for taking our questions. And continuing on the topic of TETON. What kind of bridging study might the FDA require to approve evasive DPI in addition to the nebulized if TETON is successful? And then how are you thinking about presenting data. I mean, is there a chance for maybe like an interim readout of sorts or anything like that?\nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Yes. Thanks for those two questions. Again, I think Dr. Peterson would be the best person on the call to answer. Once again, just for your recollection, she and her team did the bridging study from the Tyvaso Nebulizer into the DPI for PAH. So she's very, very familiar with how to do that. She also was the lead author in a publication on those results in the New England Journal of Medicine. So very much on top of getting the word out in the most credible and respected way. So with that little two tooth of your horn, Dr. Peterson, can you answer the questions?\nLeigh Peterson: Thank you. Yes, Sure. So for the bridging study, again, we will -- well, let me answer the second question first for interim results. We will not do an interim analysis or an interim look. We have, for TETON 2, as I just said, we have completed enrollment. So we're in the final follow-up period, and we will have the actual final results within a year, just shortly after the year follow-up is up. So we completed in July, so that would be July plus some time to clean those data just for the top line results. So that will be the next time we -- that will be the first time we see the actual results from these -- one of these studies. And as far as bridging into DPI. Now as you know, the -- so what we did for in our BREEZE study, we looked at PAH patients. We transitioned from nebulized Tyvaso to Tyvaso DPI and that was actually sufficient to get approval for both PAH patients and PH-ILD patients for the Tyvaso DPI. Now for the IPF studies, we still have some ongoing discussions with FDA. We will be discussing as soon as -- I mean, really, when we get further into the follow-up period or when we get top line results, we're going to have a discussion because it's a different group. It's the pulmonary division for IPF versus the cardiorenal division for PAH and PH-ILD, so different group, different people, sometimes just slightly different requirements. So we need to just confirm what we need to do for the bridging. It might be a matter of small sub-study in our TETON-OLE program, so we need to sort that out. But again, it shouldn't delay. We'll get the results of the TETON studies. We will pursue the approval based on the TETON 1, TETON 2. And then while that is occurring, we'll do what we need to do for bridging.\nMartine Rothblatt: Excellent. Excellent answer. Thank you so much, Dr. Peterson. Thank you, everybody, for being on the call today. I'd like to just wrap up with drawing everybody's attention to the terrific PowerPoint that Dewey Steadman and his team released, I think it's not only aesthetically beautiful, which it is, it's just rich in content, graphs, charts, numbers, kind of strategic overview, kind of things. So please study that PowerPoint at depth, if you really want to understand the beauty of the United Therapeutics story. And then finally, I'd like to just do a shout out to everybody that is part of our United Therapeutics family, what we call Unitherians. We're now bumping up on 1,500 people. And it's in line with the metric that Michael, James and I have long adopted at UT to grow our headcount in accordance with a revenue per head metric of approximately $2 million per head, and that's on par with the absolute best, not only of biotech, but of really American corporations in general. So now that we're knocking on the door of a $3 billion revenue run rate, that's $2 million per head for our knocking on the door of 1,500 people. And it's just another tremendous testament to the success of United Therapeutics and to the fact that the leaders of this company, Michael, James, myself, Pat Poisson, Dr. Peterson, others for all of us, our number one goal is to make sure that everybody working at our company is having the absolute best career development experience of their dreams. And so long as that is happening, then all of our goals pretty much happen automatically. And I think a great -- another metric I can share with you that I got from our HR department is our percentage of employees who voluntarily terminate, we call voluntary termination rate is about 5%. That far lower than I think any of our peers, but certainly far lower than the averages in the biotech sector and definitely outside biotech. So the numbers say we're doing things right, the people say we're doing things right. And I hope all of you agree that we're doing the things you want to see us do. Have a great day. Operator, you can close the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation earnings webcast.

            "name": "Michael Benkowitz",
            "content": "Thanks Martine and good morning, everyone. As Martine noted, today, we reported yet another quarter of record revenue at $715 million and 20% growth from the second quarter of 2023. We saw meaningful worldwide revenue growth for all of our key products, Tyvaso, Orenitram, Remodulin, and Unituxin. First, I want to touch on Tyvaso, which when viewing the nebulizer and dry powder inhaler delivery systems together, remains the number one prescribed prostacyclin treatment in the U.S. Total Tyvaso revenue for the second quarter was $398 million, up 25% over last year with growth led by continued uptake of Tyvaso DPI, increase in pricing, and increased commercial utilization, following the implementation of the Part D redesign provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA. For the franchise, we saw record referrals and starts during the quarter, leading us to have confidence in the durability of our growth profile, as Martine mentioned. The percentage of Tyvaso DPI patients using our patient access programs continues to tick down following the implementation of the first provisions of the IRA earlier this year, albeit not at the same rate we saw between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. We could continue to see a modest decline in patient access program utilization through the remainder of the year as new patients on therapy are less likely to need patient assistance, having met their copay obligations on another product before starting Tyvaso DPI. The benefit from this could be offset by modest rebates from our initial contracting efforts to ensure a period of access in the future for Tyvaso DPI. As an aside, we understand that CMS will soon publish the negotiated prices for the first 10 drugs selected under the IRA's drug price negotiation provision. I want to remind investors that our drugs are not on this list. In addition, based on our current understanding of the IRA statute and guidance issued by CMS thus far, we expect our treprostinil products will not be subject to price negotiation under the IRA because there is at least one marketed generic version of treprostinil. Moving to Orenitram. We reported getting another quarter of record revenue at $107 million, representing 13% growth from the second quarter of 2023. Like the first quarter, this was driven by a combination of increased commercial utilization, pricing, and a modest increase in average dose from prior quarter levels. Recall that Orenitram and Remodulin are priced on a per milligram basis. Like with Tyvaso DPI, we saw a modest decrease in patient access program used for Orenitram in the second quarter, driven by the same dynamics. Likewise, we expect a modest decline in patient access program used through the remainder of the year. Our medical teams continue to have scientific discussions based on recent scientific publications, with healthcare providers on the EXPEDITE induction protocol where PAH patients initiate on Remodulin and then transition to Orenitram as an option for appropriate patients who may not want or need to go on long-term parenteral therapy. Moving to Remodulin. Worldwide revenue of $147 million was up 16% from last year with very strong performance across all of our underlying demand metrics. And this comes five years after the first launch of generic Remodulin, reflecting our continued commitment to our patients and Remodulin. Remodulin, both intravenous and subcutaneous remains the most prescribed parental prostacyclin in the US. Our Remunity pump remains the only option for new subcutaneous patient starts. Last quarter, we heard through the channel that specialty pharmacy distributors are going to start proactively converting all subcu treprostinil use, to Remodulin and our immunity pump given the discontinuation of support for the CAD MS3 system by its manufacturer. We've seen this trend continue through the second quarter. Finally, Unituxin. Worldwide revenue of $52 million was up 17% from the prior year quarter and US Unituxin revenue of $47 million was up 18%. US growth was driven by price and volume. To wrap-up with our fifth quarter in a row of record revenue, our commercial products clearly have the innovation, interest momentum and muscle to continue to grow serve our patients. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine to run the Q&A. Sure. Thanks for the question. So I think the underlying demand metrics, just kind of -- we continue to just, I think, plug along or tug-along like we have the past few quarters with the referrals and the starts and continues to come from both Group 1 PAH as well as Group 3 PAH ILD. The second part of your question about the sales force, I think we're starting to see some of the impact of that sales force expansion in the second quarter. As you recall, we started that ramp-up in the last fall, really fully deployed that team January 1. And of course, it takes a little bit of time for the reps to get out in the field and get in front of those physicians and have the opportunity to educate them on the benefits of our products. But what's been really nice to see so far in the first six months is the increase in the number of ILD prescribers actually writing Tyvaso. So when we first launched in the PAH ILD a couple of years ago, our efforts are really focused on educating around the need to screen for pulmonary hypertension. And then once they started to do that -- that the patients had, pulmonary hypertension associated with ILD, then they can make the decision whether we refer that patient into the PH clinic or trying to treat it themselves. I would say, the vast majority of doctors at that time started referring to the PAH clinic. So -- but we knew really -- for us to I think, realize the full opportunity that have in PAH-ILD, these physicians are going to have to start treating just because of the number of patients that are out there and the bandwidth constraints on the physicians in the PAH clinic. So it's been really nice to see that over the last six months, we really started to increase the breadth of ILD prescribers as well as the depth and recall the depth metric we always look at is physicians with 30-plus [ph] patients. And so we're seeing really positive momentum and growth on both of those key metrics. Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question, Jess. Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to really comment too much on Merck's product. I mean they're plenty capable of speaking to sell. I would say with respect to our business and specifically in the PAH, I think the business remains very solid, very strong, really strong referral growth, really, really strong start growth, patient shipments, all of the underlying demand metrics continue to be in line with what we expect and where we think we need to be, and that's obviously being reflected in the revenue line on our financial statement. So, yes, at this point, in the first quarter, no surprises there. I think as Martine said in opening remarks, if you look at the Merck's clinical trial, most of those patients were using sotatercept in combination with prostacyclins and that certainly at least seems to be how that's playing out so far."

            "name": "Martine Rothblatt",
            "content": "Thank you very Dewey, We at UT are very pleased and proud to present the results of another record quarter. As described in the press release, PowerPoint and the financials, we are doing very well across the board. Double-digit revenue growth is the norm. In a moment, our President, Mike Benkowitz, will provide some deep insight into these numbers. So let me start with the strategic overview. We see our business as three waves of success. First, approved products that are market leaders for the mid-2020s. Second, next-generation products and new indications that can be market leaders in the late 2020s. Third, an organ manufacturing business that can transform the treatment of end-stage organ disease. Examples of the first wave are Remodulin, Tyvaso, Orenitram and Unituxin. Examples of the second wave are Ralinepag as a once-daily pill for pulmonary hypertension and our TETON trial aiming to show improvement in pulmonary fibrosis. Examples of our third wave of success are our xenotransplantation products that offer tremendous potential for the thousands patients on dialysis. Now I'm sometimes asked with all of this success, Martine, what keeps you up at night. Well, let me start with what does not keep me up. What does not keep me up is our foundational business, because I do not see any threats to the vitality of our Remodulin, Tyvaso or Orenitram products. For Remodulin and Tyvaso, my confidence is borne of the uniqueness and clinical efficacy of our drug device combination technology. For Remodulin, there is no other parenteral drug delivery device that is as small accurate and easy to use as our Remunity Pump. It's happened acoustic volume sensing technology is more than 10 times more accurate than legacy pumps and has fewer moving parts. For Tyvaso, there is no other dry powder inhaler so well matched to deep lung delivery of our drug as the mankind DPI. The proof is really in the pudding in record time, thousands of patients have begun using our patented device in both old and new pulmonary indications, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and interstitial lung disease. Competition in our current foundational business doesn't really keep me up either, because they are mostly used in combination with our drugs or if not used drug delivery devices that are not as elegant as our and DPI devices. Now let me jump ahead to the organ business. That also doesn't keep me up because in the last year, we have obtained multiple times scientific proof that our Xeno kidney function well in human bodies with no more immunosuppression than an allograft. Folks that cannot happen by accident. Of course, there's much more work to do to get these Xeno kidney FDA approved and even more work to do to get them into quantity production, but I see no show stoppers, and we have achieved proof of concept. It is only in our second wave of success, Tyvaso for pulmonary fibrosis and Ralinepag for PAH that I find myself kept up at night. The reason is that the results a clinical trial cannot be known until it is unblinded. And even a study that is 90% powered for success by definition, still has a 10% chance of missing. Of course, we are doing everything we can to ensure the credibility and approvability of our IPF and Ralinepag clinical trials. But because these two products have the potential to more than double our current $3 billion revenue run rate, the stakes are extremely high. In conclusion, UT is a rock-solid bet on its current foundational business. UT is a very, very good bet and a highly rewarding one at that in its next stage generation products that are now in late-stage clinical trials. And UT is a once-in-a-lifetime biotechnology opportunity in manufactured organs. With that strategic overview, I'd like to now turn the call over to our President, Michael Benkowitz. Mike? Michael, that was just such a perfect overview of everything. Thanks so much, and thanks for all of all of your leadership in those areas. Operator, you may now bring forward the first call. Thank you for that question, Roanna, that type of commercialization question would be best handled by Michael. Thank you so much, Mike, and thank you, Roanna, for your question. Operator, you could bring forward the next question. Thanks, Jess. Nice to hear your voice this morning. Again, I think it's a market dynamic question that Michael is the best person to answer. Perfect. Thanks so much, Mike. Thank you, Jess. Operator, could you bring forward the next question, please. Thank you for your question, Ash. That being basically a kind of a capital allocation question, I think the best person on the call to answer that would be our Chief Financial Officer, James Edgemond. James? James, that was a 360-degree comprehensive answer to Ash. So, greatly appreciated. Operator, next question, please. Thank you, Joe, for that question. Fortunately, we have on our call the person who's in charge of that entire program, Dr. Leigh Peterson. So Dr. Peterson, could you kindly respond to Joe? Thank you so much, Dr. Peterson.

So please study that PowerPoint at depth, if you really want to understand the beauty of the United Therapeutics story. And then finally, I'd like to just do a shout out to everybody that is part of our United Therapeutics family, what we call Unitherians. We're now bumping up on 1,500 people.

The existing or the second tranche as we've described in our disclosure, the $700 million still is in process through the end of September of this year. So we're going to first focus on executing the existing ASR and share repurchase program. A second kind of consideration is, we are still committed to allocating capital wisely. And in the best interest of stakeholders by first deploying it, as we've said historically, Ash, internally for our R&D initiatives, including manufacturing facilities and included in those manufacturing facilities certainly is our consideration of future commercial DPF capital requirements. Second is we're going to still focus on corporate development to find those opportunities where we think can bring value to shareholders and value to patients.

Remarks today will include forward-looking statements representing our expectations or beliefs regarding future events. These statements will involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.

Also, our scientific medical and commercial teams will present at the American Thoracic Society International Conference, May 17 through the 22nd in San Diego, the Seventh World Symposium on Pulmonary hypertension, June 29 to July 1 in Barcelona and the Pulmonary Hypertension Association's 2024 International PH Conference and Scientific Sessions, August 15 to 18 in Indianapolis.\n Now I will turn the webcast over to James Edgemond, our CFO and Treasurer, for some brief comments on our recent accelerated share repurchase plan followed by Martine and Michael for an overview of our first quarter 2024 financial results and the business activities of United Therapeutics. James? \nJames Edgemond: Thank you, Dewey, and good morning, everyone. In our meetings with shareholders over the last several years, we've noticed a common theme. Shareholders are excited about our potential, both the continued growth in our foundational core business and our innovative organ manufacturing opportunities, and they are also impressed by our P&L philosophy that results in outstanding cash flow generation to support our ways of growth. So we recognize that there has been a disconnect between our desire to preserve capital to support our ambitious long-term organ manufacturing goals and some shareholder perspectives around capital allocation.\n We continue to follow our 3 capital allocation priorities, which in order are: first, to invest in our commercial and R&D opportunities through P&L spend as well as capital outlays like our new North Carolina manufacturing facility. Our second priority to pursue intelligent business and corporate development opportunities that enhance our rare disease focus and complement our organ manufacturing initiatives like bolt-on M&A and in-license opportunities. And our third priority to return capital to shareholders like share repurchases and we consider all 3 priorities when deploying our financial capital.\n Over the last year, we've learned a great deal about the size, the staging and the timing for capital expenditures associated with the construction and commissioning of our designated pathogen-free facilities or DPFs, to support our Xenotransplantation efforts. With the commissioning of our Christiansburg, Virginia clinical scale DPF last quarter, we now better understand the phasing of capital spending associated with the commercial scale DPF construction project for the commercial launch of our Xeno organs.\n With this improved awareness of our future cash outlays and taking into consideration our near-term cash flow generation potential. We saw an opportunity to return capital to you, our shareholders. To deploy the UT fit and announced on March 25, a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR. Through the ASR, we expect Citibank to repurchase $1 billion in UTHR shares through the end of the third quarter of this year. Under the ASR on March 27, Citibank delivered to us approximately 3.3 million UTHR shares, representing approximately 80% of the total shares that will be repurchased under the ASR, and we have placed these shares into treasury stock as reflected on our balance sheet. The final number of shares that we will ultimately repurchase pursuant to our ASR agreement with Citibank will be based upon the average of the daily volume weighted average price per share of our common stock during the ASR agreement.\n Following the ASR, we believe that we will have ample financial capital to deploy for the commercial scale DPF facilities in the coming years that I previously mentioned. We also continue to believe in our core business and our cash flow generation potential, driven by our foundational products led by Tyvaso DPI and Nebulized Tyvaso and potentially accelerated by our innovative studies of Tyvaso in pulmonary fibrosis and ralinepag in pulmonary hypertension. We're excited about our current business and our growth potential, and we appreciate the feedback and support of our shareholders.\n I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Martine Rothblatt, our Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer, for insight into our development portfolio. Martine? \nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to let the next few slides speak for themselves and forego a script in favor of speaking directly from the perspective of being our CEO. We have had a fantastic quarter, coming on the heels of previous great quarters and we are confident continued good news will flow in the quarters ahead. The main basis for our confidence is that we have multiple best-in-category products for growing indications Remodulin for parenteral or PAH, Orenitram for oral prostacyclin in PAH, Tyvaso for inhaled treatment of both PAH Group I and PAH Group III in interstitial lung disease and Unituxin for neuroblastoma.\n Other categories of good news in the years ahead are clinical trial outcomes. We have 3 Phase III trials in varieties of pulmonary fibrosis known as the TETON trial and another Phase III trial of a best-in-class oral prostacyclin agonist called OUTCOMES. Upon approval and market launch the products from these Phase III trials could help more than twice the number of people that we are helping today. And there's even more good news in the area of organ manufacturing. We have now successfully enabled hundreds of additional lungs to be transplanted. We have now built a Xenotransplantation facility with the potential for over 100 Xeno Hearts and 200 Xeno kidneys a year to be transplanted. We have now commenced a clinical trial of a Xeno liver assistance product. And we have now helped to save the life of a woman in New York with our manufactured ThymoKidney.\n Now let me comment on a few topics that I've heard some questions about. First, the big buyback. James did a superb overview of every aspect of that. We did the recent $1 billion stock buyback because the stock is too cheap, full stop. Because our future is so bright, we believe this could be one of the best ROI investments for our shareholder partners. As James has long said, other great ROI opportunities are first and foremost in our own pipeline; and secondly, in our strategic business development decisions.\n Next, I'd like to say a word about insider selling. I personally hold options for 10 full years, and I only sell just before expiry. This is a passive, long-standing program. There is nothing more than that to read into these sales, they are use it or lose it sales. Third, our Group 1 business. Our expectation remains that the Group 1 PAH business will continue to grow and will do so even more rapidly if we can gain FDA approval of ralinepag after the completion of our clinical trial. As a reminder, this is a best-in-class once-a-day oral treatment for PAH and its Phase III trial endeavors to show long-term morbidity and mortality benefit on top of multiple conventional therapies. It is a worldwide study, and we intend to commercialize that product globally.\n Let's talk about Tyvaso Trans, next. Tyvaso has been a dramatic grower since interstitial lung disease approval, and it is a roughly $1 billion indication to date. We have only gotten started serving the large unmet need for this product with its unique delivery methods. In addition to our continued growth in PAH Group 3 supercharged by our 2 proprietary modes of inhaled drug delivery. We are also very excited about the enrollment of our Phase III trials in IPF and PPF known as TETON 1, TETON 2 and TETON PPF. Once the results of these studies are approved, we will be able to help multiples of the number of patients we are helping today in PAH.\n Finally, let me talk about our transformational strategy. As Mike said a year or so ago, the ramp for DPI toward our Tyvaso goals would not be linear, but it would bend upwards after a period of provider familiarity with both treating Group 3 PAH patients and our unique products. We are now seeing the bend upward that Mike had predicted. I doubt any organization interacts with as many PAH providers as do we, given our multiple PAH products and multiple pipeline activities, including in addition, our exciting ARTISAN trial showing that you can transition patients from a parenteral form of prostacyclin onto oral Orenitram. It is born of the great confidence in our products that these many, many providers share with us that we undertook the $1 billion buyback and continue to invest heavily in our Tyvaso pipeline.\n We have organically developed drugs that solve difficult unmet needs. We have built a magnificent business. We have created a fortress balance sheet, and we have pipeline programs that could be worth more than the entire current market cap of our company. The transformation of UT is well underway, and we welcome shareholder partners to join us in not only a great investment opportunity but in supporting a company that is a true biotech innovator.\n On that note, Mike, can you please take it from here? \nMichael Benkowitz: Thanks, Martine. I will. Good morning, everybody. As Martine noted, today, we report yet another quarter of record revenue at $678 million and 34% growth from the first quarter of 2023. We saw meaningful growth for all of our key products, Tyvaso Orenitram, Remodulin and Unituxin. Before I get into the details on each of the products, I just want to take a moment to thank all of our fellow Unitarians for an amazing quarter.\n First, I want to talk about Tyvaso, which when viewing the nebulizer and dry powder inhaler delivery systems together represents our largest product and remains the #1 prescribed prostacyclin treatment in the U.S. Total Tyvaso revenue for the first quarter was $373 million, up 56% over last year, with growth led by continued uptake of Tyvaso DPI, our regular annual price increase and the increased commercial utilization following the implementation of the Part D redesign provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA. Again, this quarter, there were no material changes in inventories of Tyvaso DPI at our specialty pharmacy distributors.\n During the first quarter, and both distributors remain within their contracted inventory levels. After a relatively consistent monthly referral rate over the course of 2023, referrals are what we call prescriptions, we saw a nice positive trend break in referral levels for both DPI and Nebulizer in the first quarter with about a 10% to 15% total increase in monthly referrals. This is continuing at least so far into the second quarter. Patient starts also increased, but at a lesser rate during the first quarter, but this is not surprising as there is often a many week lag between referrals and starts. But it does appear that starts per month are increasing in line with the first quarter referral level into the second quarter.\n During the first quarter, we were pleasantly surprised to see an increase in commercial utilization of Tyvaso due to the implementation of the IRA. We were expecting to see this increase began in the second quarter as patients reach are out-of-pocket maximums. We expect commercial utilization will continue to increase over the balance of the year. Lastly, on Tyvaso, we're well positioned for competition should it come to market this year. The sales force expansion that we began last year is now complete and fully deployed as of January 1. We expect that we'll start to see the impact of this enhanced sales team beginning in the second half of the year.\n We are also now engaging regularly with HCPs or health care providers on the key characteristics of our DPI device, namely that Tyvaso DPI requires only 1 breath per cartridge. Our low flow design requires less patient breadth than high-flow devices, which we believe will be beneficial to patients with compromised lungs. The low flow design also allows for a more efficient delivery of treprostinil relative to the nebulizer and other treprostinil DPI devices. And finally, the BREEZE study demonstrated 98% patient satisfaction with Tyvaso DPI. As I said on our last call, these factors, coupled with the experienced physicians have gained through the rapid uptake of Tyvaso DPI since launch, lead us to believe that Tyvaso DPI will compete effectively with similar product offerings in the inhaled market, given our presence in the PAH and PH-ILD community, our commitment to patients and platform of both nebulized and dry powder delivery options.\n Moving to Orenitram. We are very excited to report that not only did we achieve record revenue for the quarter, but we eclipsed $100 million in the quarter for the very first time, reaching $106 million during the first quarter, up 20% from the prior year. This was driven by a combination of increased commercial utilization, pricing of what we consider to be an extremely modest inventory buy-in during the quarter, counter to the normal seasonality we experienced with the Orenitram patterns in the first quarter of the year. Because Orenitram is a Medicare Part D is a drug, like Tyvaso DPI, we saw a meaningful increase in commercial utilization for Orenitram due to the implementation of the IRA. Our medical teams continue to have scientific discussions with health care providers on the EXPEDITE induction protocol where PAH patients initiate therapy on Remodulin and then transition to Orenitram based on recent scientific publications as an option for appropriate patients who may not want or need to go on long-term parenteral therapy.\n Transitioning to Remodulin. Worldwide Remodulin revenue was $128 million was up 5% from last year with very strong performance across all of our underlying demand metrics. And this is almost 5 years since the first launch of the generic for Remodulin, reflecting our continued commitment to our patients and the product. Remodulin, both intravenous and subcutaneous remains the most prescribed parenteral prostacyclin in the U.S. We expect this momentum to continue, given the high level of referrals and starts in the first quarter. Our Remunity Pump remains the only option for new subcutaneous patient starts. And we have heard through the channel that specialty pharma distributors are beginning to proactively convert -- beginning to proactively convert remaining subcu treprostinil patients to our immunity pump given the discontinuation of support for the CAD MS3 system by its manufacturer.\n Regarding the recent approval of the first active inhibitor, based on conversations with physicians, both before and after approval, we expect many practices will take a measured stance toward its wide use and most used initially could be consistent with the product's clinical evidence, largely in combination use with a prostacyclin therapy. Finally, moving to Unituxin. Worldwide revenue of $58 million, a record, was up 19% from the prior year quarter, and U.S. Unituxin revenue was $53 million, was up 21%. U.S. growth was driven by both price and volume.\n To wrap up, following this record quarter, we remain confident that we have the product portfolio, marketing muscle, support structures, clinical data and commercial expertise to continue to grow in both PAH and PH-ILD.\n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Martine to run the Q&A. \nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Mike, for that superb overview and deep dive into so many key and important details of all of our different products. It's literally a historic quarter. It's the best we've ever had. Operator, we're ready for the first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. \nTerence Flynn: Maybe a 2 part from me. I was just wondering what you're seeing now with respect to breadth of prescribing for Tyvaso and ILD. I know you went to a broader prescriber audience sometime last year, and you have the new sales force, but just wondering if you can comment at all there. And then can you provide the percentage of Remodulin patients that are now on the Remunity pump? \nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you, Terence. And congratulations on being over at Morgan Stanley now. Mike, given the queue, feel free to answer as much of that question as you feel time permits. \nMichael Benkowitz: Yes, sure. So on the breadth of prescribing, I mean, overall, we're continuing to see growth in both breadth and depth. But I think a lot of that is attributable to, again, just the work and pounding the pavement that we've been doing over the last couple of years and gaining traction with new prescribers. As I said in my opening remarks, we now have the expanded sales force fully deployed. It's going to take time for them to build relationships. And so I think we'll really start to see the impact of that effort as we move into the third quarter, really. So that could be -- we're expecting continued breadth as we move on.\n One answer is interesting statistic I was looking at, is if you look at ILD, historically ILD physicians that didn't have experience writing for PAH products. Over the last 15 months, we've seen a 50%, so 5-0 percent increase in breadth. And then the depth is which we measure by that 3-plus metric that I've mentioned on prior calls, has increased by -- and that group has increased by about 30%. So we are really starting to get traction in any ILD community, not only on a referral basis that we've had, but also on an actual writing basis. So really happy to see that. Just quickly on Remunity. Right now, we've got the vast majority of patients are on Remunity. I think there's maybe a few hundreds left that need to be transitioned. And as I said, I think specialty pharmacies are looking to probably get those transitioned over to Remunity by the end of the year. \nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Mike, for the fully comprehensive answer. Terence, hopefully, that addressed all your concerns. Next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Roanna Ruiz from Leerink. \nRoanna Clarissa Ruiz: So I was curious, what are your field reps hearing on the ground from physicians around the sotatercept approval and launch, if you're able to say? And bigger picture, what's your outlook on the future in terms of combined use of Tyvaso with sotatercept and prescribers consideration of both these products? \nMartine Rothblatt: Great. That would also be within President, Benkowitz's purview. So Mike, take it away. \nMichael Benkowitz: Sure. Thanks for the question. So with sotatercept, it's been -- in terms of the launch, it's effectively been relatively quiet. I mean I think what we've heard through the Rumour mill as they're supposed to launch this week, but it's been a little bit quiet. So I mean it's probably a question best direct to Merck on what their launch plans are. The second point on what's our outlook for the use of our products with sotatercept, I think as we've said in prior quarters and as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we really look at this as being a complementary product to the existing products that are on the market. It's not a cure. It's not a replacement for prostacyclin. We don't expect that existing patients are going to be transitioned off of a prostacyclin as a result of sotatercept.\n We -- almost 70% of the patients in the clinical trial broad background prostacyclin therapy. So certainly, we think and based on conversations, we think largely sotatercept is going to be used in combination with the prostacyclin therapy. And if it works well and patients are able to live longer then that means that they're staying on our products longer, which helps us from a financial standpoint. So that's kind of what we've been hearing for the last, I would say, 6 to 9 months and what we hear in the fourth quarter. \nMartine Rothblatt: Excellent, Michael. Thank you so much. Operator, we have time for about 2 more questions. Next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ash Verma from UBS. \nAshwani Verma: Congrats on all the progress. So I had to -- like for Xenotransplantation, can you comment on, how do you decide which and how many genes are modified? There's another player in this field, which is using a slightly different approach. How confident are you that your level and selection of gene modification is the most appropriate approach here? And then secondly, I wanted to understand the -- some of the pricing pushes and pulls for 2025 across your portfolio. I mean clearly, there is a benefit that you get from the co-pay normalization with IRA out of pocket going to 2,000, but then also the donut hole impact. Net-net, does that shake out as a headwind or tailwind on 2025 pricing? \nMartine Rothblatt: So Ash, thank you for your questions and great analyst coverage, but there's only going to be time to answer the first question. Each of those questions would take an hour to like fully delve into. Fortunately, we have on the call our Executive Vice President for Product Development and Xenotransplantation, Dr. Peterson. And Leigh, can you answer the Xeno question? \nLeigh Peterson: Yes, of course. Thanks for this question. And so as you know, at United Therapeutics, we believe on multiple shots on goal. So in fact, we are developing -- we have our Tianjin pig that we have where we're developing 2 different organs or Tianjin Xeno kidney as well as our Tianjin Xeno heart. And then we also are developing our ThymoKidney, which is from a pig with a single genetic modification. And this was the organ that was transplanted into the recent NYU patients. And we actually have good scientific rationale as well as preclinical evidence that both of these products, again, with a single genetic modification as well as the Tianjin pig are effective.\n And again, there's advantages to both, at least from the scientific rationale. So but really to establish the scientific safety and efficacy of each. We need to conduct clinical studies and we're planning on doing those for both of these products. And ideally, we will receive approval for multiple products. And which will allow different options for patients and enhanced available supply. So again, your question is, is the obvious question, which is better. Well, we again, advantages to both, and we'll be testing those in our clinical studies in the near future. \nMartine Rothblatt: Thanks so much, Leigh. Fantastic answer. Operator, last question, please. \nOperator: The next question comes from Joseph Thome from TD Cowen. \nJoseph Thome: Congrats on the progress. Maybe one more on the Xenotransplantation side. Maybe where do you see the importance of using a CD40, CD154, product in Xenotransplantation? I know preclinically, I think you looked at both with and without maybe what will impact your decision to take a CD40, 154 into the human clinical study or not? \nMartine Rothblatt: Okay. Very good. Dr. Peterson, would you like to also address that question? \nLeigh Peterson: Yes. well, the main difference is that the CD40, there are no agents that -- with the CD40 blockade mechanism of action approved by FDA for use in any indication, actually. And so what we chose to do is if you look at the background in the history, most Xenotransplantation, at least with the clinical -- preclinical models, those studies were done with the CD40 blockade. But our study that we're doing, we actually have 2 arms, CD40 blockade as well as with conventional immunosuppression in our baboon IND-enabling studies, and we're getting good results with both.\n And in fact, there was a publication that recently came out by Ivinson at all 2024, that discusses a case the -- a really significant case where an a baboon was transplanted with standard of care regimens and survived for 9.5 months, which has never -- absolutely never been seen, and we have some reasons why that happens. So we prefer to go into a clinical study with approved medicines to not introduce another variable into the study. And again, we're backing it up with our pre-clinical studies, and we're seeing good results in the model. So that's where we're going first. \nMartine Rothblatt: Thank you so much, Dr. Peterson, very comprehensive answer. Operator, you can now conclude the call. \nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's United Therapeutics Corporation Earnings Webcast. A rebroadcast of this webcast will be available for replay for 1 week by visiting the Events & Presentations section of the United Therapeutics Investor Relations website at ir.unither.com.

            "content": "Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to let the next few slides speak for themselves and forego a script in favor of speaking directly from the perspective of being our CEO. We have had a fantastic quarter, coming on the heels of previous great quarters and we are confident continued good news will flow in the quarters ahead. The main basis for our confidence is that we have multiple best-in-category products for growing indications Remodulin for parenteral or PAH, Orenitram for oral prostacyclin in PAH, Tyvaso for inhaled treatment of both PAH Group I and PAH Group III in interstitial lung disease and Unituxin for neuroblastoma.\n Other categories of good news in the years ahead are clinical trial outcomes. We have 3 Phase III trials in varieties of pulmonary fibrosis known as the TETON trial and another Phase III trial of a best-in-class oral prostacyclin agonist called OUTCOMES. Upon approval and market launch the products from these Phase III trials could help more than twice the number of people that we are helping today. And there's even more good news in the area of organ manufacturing. We have now successfully enabled hundreds of additional lungs to be transplanted. We have now built a Xenotransplantation facility with the potential for over 100 Xeno Hearts and 200 Xeno kidneys a year to be transplanted. We have now commenced a clinical trial of a Xeno liver assistance product. And we have now helped to save the life of a woman in New York with our manufactured ThymoKidney.\n Now let me comment on a few topics that I've heard some questions about. First, the big buyback. James did a superb overview of every aspect of that. We did the recent $1 billion stock buyback because the stock is too cheap, full stop. Because our future is so bright, we believe this could be one of the best ROI investments for our shareholder partners. As James has long said, other great ROI opportunities are first and foremost in our own pipeline; and secondly, in our strategic business development decisions.\n Next, I'd like to say a word about insider selling. I personally hold options for 10 full years, and I only sell just before expiry. This is a passive, long-standing program. There is nothing more than that to read into these sales, they are use it or lose it sales. Third, our Group 1 business. Our expectation remains that the Group 1 PAH business will continue to grow and will do so even more rapidly if we can gain FDA approval of ralinepag after the completion of our clinical trial. As a reminder, this is a best-in-class once-a-day oral treatment for PAH and its Phase III trial endeavors to show long-term morbidity and mortality benefit on top of multiple conventional therapies. It is a worldwide study, and we intend to commercialize that product globally.\n Let's talk about Tyvaso Trans, next. Tyvaso has been a dramatic grower since interstitial lung disease approval, and it is a roughly $1 billion indication to date. We have only gotten started serving the large unmet need for this product with its unique delivery methods. In addition to our continued growth in PAH Group 3 supercharged by our 2 proprietary modes of inhaled drug delivery. We are also very excited about the enrollment of our Phase III trials in IPF and PPF known as TETON 1, TETON 2 and TETON PPF. Once the results of these studies are approved, we will be able to help multiples of the number of patients we are helping today in PAH.\n Finally, let me talk about our transformational strategy. As Mike said a year or so ago, the ramp for DPI toward our Tyvaso goals would not be linear, but it would bend upwards after a period of provider familiarity with both treating Group 3 PAH patients and our unique products. We are now seeing the bend upward that Mike had predicted. I doubt any organization interacts with as many PAH providers as do we, given our multiple PAH products and multiple pipeline activities, including in addition, our exciting ARTISAN trial showing that you can transition patients from a parenteral form of prostacyclin onto oral Orenitram. It is born of the great confidence in our products that these many, many providers share with us that we undertook the $1 billion buyback and continue to invest heavily in our Tyvaso pipeline.\n We have organically developed drugs that solve difficult unmet needs. We have built a magnificent business. We have created a fortress balance sheet, and we have pipeline programs that could be worth more than the entire current market cap of our company. The transformation of UT is well underway, and we welcome shareholder partners to join us in not only a great investment opportunity but in supporting a company that is a true biotech innovator.\n On that note, Mike, can you please take it from here? Thank you, Mike, for that superb overview and deep dive into so many key and important details of all of our different products. It's literally a historic quarter. It's the best we've ever had. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Thank you, Terence. And congratulations on being over at Morgan Stanley now. Mike, given the queue, feel free to answer as much of that question as you feel time permits. Thanks so much, Mike, for the fully comprehensive answer. Terence, hopefully, that addressed all your concerns. Next question. Great. That would also be within President, Benkowitz's purview. So Mike, take it away. Excellent, Michael. Thank you so much. Operator, we have time for about 2 more questions. Next question. So Ash, thank you for your questions and great analyst coverage, but there's only going to be time to answer the first question. Each of those questions would take an hour to like fully delve into. Fortunately, we have on the call our Executive Vice President for Product Development and Xenotransplantation, Dr. Peterson. And Leigh, can you answer the Xeno question? Thanks so much, Leigh. Fantastic answer. Operator, last question, please. Okay. Very good. Dr. Peterson, would you like to also address that question? Thank you so much, Dr. Peterson, very comprehensive answer. Operator, you can now conclude the call."

            "content": "Thank you, Dewey, and good morning, everyone. In our meetings with shareholders over the last several years, we've noticed a common theme. Shareholders are excited about our potential, both the continued growth in our foundational core business and our innovative organ manufacturing opportunities, and they are also impressed by our P&L philosophy that results in outstanding cash flow generation to support our ways of growth. So we recognize that there has been a disconnect between our desire to preserve capital to support our ambitious long-term organ manufacturing goals and some shareholder perspectives around capital allocation.\n We continue to follow our 3 capital allocation priorities, which in order are: first, to invest in our commercial and R&D opportunities through P&L spend as well as capital outlays like our new North Carolina manufacturing facility. Our second priority to pursue intelligent business and corporate development opportunities that enhance our rare disease focus and complement our organ manufacturing initiatives like bolt-on M&A and in-license opportunities. And our third priority to return capital to shareholders like share repurchases and we consider all 3 priorities when deploying our financial capital.\n Over the last year, we've learned a great deal about the size, the staging and the timing for capital expenditures associated with the construction and commissioning of our designated pathogen-free facilities or DPFs, to support our Xenotransplantation efforts. With the commissioning of our Christiansburg, Virginia clinical scale DPF last quarter, we now better understand the phasing of capital spending associated with the commercial scale DPF construction project for the commercial launch of our Xeno organs.\n With this improved awareness of our future cash outlays and taking into consideration our near-term cash flow generation potential. We saw an opportunity to return capital to you, our shareholders. To deploy the UT fit and announced on March 25, a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR. Through the ASR, we expect Citibank to repurchase $1 billion in UTHR shares through the end of the third quarter of this year. Under the ASR on March 27, Citibank delivered to us approximately 3.3 million UTHR shares, representing approximately 80% of the total shares that will be repurchased under the ASR, and we have placed these shares into treasury stock as reflected on our balance sheet. The final number of shares that we will ultimately repurchase pursuant to our ASR agreement with Citibank will be based upon the average of the daily volume weighted average price per share of our common stock during the ASR agreement.\n Following the ASR, we believe that we will have ample financial capital to deploy for the commercial scale DPF facilities in the coming years that I previously mentioned. We also continue to believe in our core business and our cash flow generation potential, driven by our foundational products led by Tyvaso DPI and Nebulized Tyvaso and potentially accelerated by our innovative studies of Tyvaso in pulmonary fibrosis and ralinepag in pulmonary hypertension. We're excited about our current business and our growth potential, and we appreciate the feedback and support of our shareholders.\n I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Martine Rothblatt, our Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer, for insight into our development portfolio. Martine?"
