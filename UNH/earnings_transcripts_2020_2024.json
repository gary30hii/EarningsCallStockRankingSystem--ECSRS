A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company\u2019s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 20, 2021, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We remain in a time of unprecedented challenges for individuals, employers, and the health system broadly, particularly frontline clinicians, including our own. Health systems across the world have been and continue to be stressed. Amidst these challenges, we are grateful for the daily displays of human spirit to serve others and the resolve to make things better. We remain optimistic because we are also living at a time of unprecedented collaboration, knowledge sharing, and innovation. The health system has come together in ways previously not seen, a powerful multi-dimensional response to support patients, physicians, and communities. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of or more grateful to the more than 325,000 women and men of this enterprise. They work each day under difficult conditions with clinicians comprising well more than a third of the total. To advance a high performing healthcare system, one built on personal human connections enabled through information and technology and supported by strong alignment of physician-led, value-based delivery of care. They are another profound reason for our optimism. With all that\u2019s transpired in 2020, we finished the year responsibly and strongly. We delivered meaningful advances in NPS and employee engagement and financial results well above the upper end of our expectations, all while navigating the uncertain environment and achieving our commitment to address financial imbalances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we move into 2021, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to serve more people even more deeply and more effectively, while continuing to build this enterprise and grow strongly in the decades to come. Just 7 weeks ago, we were privileged to spend a full day with you at our investor conference. Over the course of that day, we tried to convey how we seek to lead in the development of the next generation healthcare system. We shared the distinctive capabilities we apply to make healthcare more connected, more informed, more human, and more deeply personal. We finished 2020 encouraged by the performance across the businesses of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Let me provide just a few broad highlights. The UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage offerings are off to an excellent start. 2021 will be one of our strongest years of growth, now expected to approach 900,000 more people served across individual and group Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans. UnitedHealthcare will have grown to serve 3.5 million more seniors over 5 years. Seniors choose our offerings because of the value they receive, better health outcomes and experiences at lower costs. We have also been enhancing our offerings to better meet expectations about how people want to live their lives, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our one-on-one concierge navigation services, and enabling the home as the safest and more effective setting of care. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Medicaid offerings continued to grow strongly as well, including entry into three new states in 2021. New business opportunities are substantial with momentum towards managed care adoption by states and RFP activity accelerating this year and next. And while the economic effects of COVID-19 impacted UnitedHealthcare\u2019s employer-sponsored growth in 2020, we are encouraged by the positive market response to the new highly consumer-centric offerings we have been discussing with you in recent months. Among these are digital first, on-demand, and physician-led products each provide deeply aligned modern, personal, and coordinated-care experiences and save people up to 20% compared to traditional offerings. These innovative products are generating significant responses because they are designed to better meet the unique needs and financial needs of more people. All-in, we expect UnitedHealthcare will grow in 2021 to serve upwards of 1.5 million more people across its senior community, employer-sponsored, and individual offerings. We continue to make important advancements and strategic investments to lay the foundation for the next generation health system. Over the last many years, you have heard us discuss our ambition to build high performing systems of care, including an aim to reinvent healthcare delivery, which is the first of our five strategic growth platforms. The foundations for those efforts are in our primary and multi-specialty care practices. OptumCare entered 2021 with over 50,000 physicians and 1,400 clinics. Over the course of this year, we expect to grow our employed and affiliated physicians by at least 10,000. This work of building local physician-led systems of care continues to be central to our mission and is accelerating with notable progress in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and Southern California in 2020. Two weeks ago, we announced the combination of Change Healthcare and OptumInsight. We expect this combination will greatly advance the foundational connectivity and collaboration needed for the next-generation health system, establishing a new, more modern information, and technology-enabled healthcare platform. It will help accelerate the development and use of digital and advanced technologies, another of our five key growth platforms and critical to connecting all elements of our business strategy. This advanced platform will help clinicians make the most informed and clinically advanced patient care decisions more quickly and easily. Change Healthcare brings widely adopted technology for integrating evidence-based clinical criteria directly into the clinician\u2019s workflow, while Optum\u2019s clinical analytics expertise and individual health record can strengthen the evidence base needed to deliver effective clinical decision support at the point of care. This can ensure appropriate clinical pathways are offered in the most appropriate sites of care, leading to consistent achievement of the best possible outcomes experiences and value for the patients we serve. Another key opportunity will be to enhance administrative processes by combining Optum\u2019s advanced data analytics with Change Healthcare\u2019s intelligent healthcare network to support simpler, more informed, and accurate services and processing at considerably lower costs. Finally, combining Change Healthcare\u2019s payment capacities with Optum\u2019s highly automated payment networks will simplify financial interactions among care providers, payers, and consumers and accelerate the movement to a more modern, real-time, and transparent payment system. This will help physicians get paid more quickly, accurately, and reliably and provide consumers with more options and convenience and managing their healthcare finances. The Change Healthcare team has been doing outstanding work and we are looking forward to working alongside them. We continue to execute on the core initiatives we laid out for you in December. One example as the pandemic disrupted care patterns, we all saw the increased need to enhance in-home and alternative settings of care offering patients to receive safe, effective, and efficient care outside of traditional venues. However, the need for in-home care will continue to grow well beyond the current environment. We know that more than 80% of what impacts a person\u2019s health happens outside of traditional healthcare settings. There is a significant opportunity in offering consistent cost-effective care for seniors, people with complex medical conditions and geographically isolated individuals through in-home and alternative settings. Offering a foundational ability to care for people in their homes is essential to developing a health system that is more consumer centric, higher quality, and lower cost. We already have well established trusted capacities to bring skilled care resources into the home, including through Optum\u2019s HouseCalls program. We expect our advanced practice clinicians will conduct over 2 million in-home visits this year. And we are building upon this established home capacity in many ways. We have introduced Vivify remote patient monitoring capabilities to improve connectivity and information sharing with physicians. This has been received positively by patients with a net promoter score over 80. Optum At-Home provides in-person and telephonic touch points across an interdisciplinary team, including physical, social and behavioral aspects. The program increases preventative care, achieves exceptional NPS in the mid-80s, lowers medical expense and demonstrates high quality with over 90% of our members in a 4-star or higher plan. Similarly, Optum\u2019s Pharmacy Care Services enables patients to receive the care and medications they need with capacities to deliver outside of traditional settings. OptumRx infusion services now addresses the needs of about 25,000 patients per month and is growing double-digits, which means more patients can obtain the care they need outside of the acute settings. That makes it safer, simpler and more affordable for people. We remain encouraged as well by the traditional pharmacy services provided by OptumRx with an over 98% customer retention rate entering 2021. We are off to a good start for the 2022 selling season as we were recently awarded the honor to serve more than 2.5 million members of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. In sum, we enter 2021 with momentum, competent in our capacities to navigate through and begin to emerge from these challenging times as an even more capable, diverse and growing enterprise. Now, I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dave. The full year 2020 and fourth quarter results were favorable to the outlook we provided at our December 1 investor conference, while continuing to be impacted by the unprecedented environment which has existed most of the year. To begin, as we know it is of great interest to you, I\u2019d like to share what we are seeing in current care patterns. Starting at the highest level within the broad member categories we serve, people with commercial benefits continue to exhibit overall higher levels of care activity with less deferrals and those served in public sector programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our top priority remains getting people the care they need. During the fourth quarter, we saw overall average care activities return to seasonal baselines compared to the just over 95% we cited for the third quarter. The pacing over the course of the quarter, perhaps not too surprisingly, moved from just below baseline as we began to modestly exceeding baseline in the latter half. This measure includes increased direct COVID-19 related care, which in total comprised about 11% of all care activity during the fourth quarter compared to about 6% in the third quarter. Looking deeper within specific care categories, outpatient activity began the quarter at baseline and we were gratified people were able to obtain needed care previously deferred. By the latter part of the quarter however, some outpatient activity moderated as COVID-19 incidence elevated. Total in-patient activity increased modestly over the course of the quarter as the direct COVID-19 related care components rose as a percentage of the total in the latter half. For example, of the 65,000 COVID-19 related in-patient admissions during the quarter, about 20% occurred October and about 50% in December. Moving into our specific businesses, OptumHealth\u2019s fourth quarter earnings increased 16% year-over-year as care activity at our fee-for-service practices and ambulatory surgery centers continue to recover with these businesses now operating near baseline. Revenue for consumers served grew 29% over the year ago quarter. The growth in this measure reflects continued development of the value based care arrangements, the depth of our offerings and the increasing acuity of the types of care we can deliver to the people we serve. You should expect this measure to continue to grow at a strong double-digit pace for many years to come. One example which highlights this potential, of the 20 million patients OptumCare serves to-date under 20% are currently in value-based arrangements. We expect both the number of patients served and the depth and number of value-based arrangements to continue to accelerate. OptumInsight\u2019s earnings were ahead of the outlook we offered at the beginning of December, with overall 2020 performance impacted by lower levels of care with revenues dependent upon care activity volumes for many of these businesses and the generally subdued overall business environment. We continue to expect 10% to 15% growth in 2021 as care activity returns to normalized levels and we continue to advance strategic relationships and broaden services with existing customers. This outlook excludes any impact from OptumInsight\u2019s combination with Change Healthcare, which we expect will close in the second half of the year. OptumRx earnings were also ahead of this outlook. During 2020, revenues in our pharmacy care services and specialty businesses continue to grow at double-digits and now comprise nearly half of total OptumRx revenue. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, fourth quarter operating results were above our December review. They reflect continued customer and provider assistance measures to help people obtain the care they need and comparatively lower levels of care deferrals and higher COVID-19 care costs versus the third quarter. Results in the fourth quarter were further impacted by additional reserves or rebates and related activity as plans with such arrangements moved into these positions as a result of the cumulative care deferral impacts throughout 2020 and calendar year end assessments were concluded. As Dave noted, sales activity in the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period was robust. Within the 900,000 new members we expect to serve for full year 2021, about 775,000 will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans, which are included in the community and state Medicaid membership tables. Strong growth in Medicaid membership continued in the fourth quarter. We call our full year 2021 outlook to serve an additional 200,000 to 300,000 people, assumed state re-determination activities are reinitiated during the year. We concluded 2020 with commercial membership about 100,000 people ahead of the outlook we provided at our investor conference. Early January results are well supportive of positive commercial growth in 2021, this even considering the challenging economic environment. Our liquidity, capital positions and capacities remained strong. Full year 2020 cash flows from operations were $22.2 billion or 1.4x net income with the fourth quarter results exceeding the outlook we provided due in part to early customer receipts. Our debt to total capital ratio of 38.9% compares to 40.2% last year. As we look enthusiastically toward the combination with Change Healthcare, we intend to maintain our longstanding capital policies, including our approach to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and an advancing dividend with ample capacity to continue building upon our strategic growth platforms and ongoing priority on expanding our local care delivery capabilities. Our full year 2021 outlook remains consistent with the early December commentary, with total revenue approaching $280 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $17.75 to $18.25, inclusive of the negative COVID-19 related effects we described. Given the still highly dynamic circumstances, we will likely hold this broader than typical range of expectations as we much like everyone else, continue to learn more about the environment. Now, I will turn it back to Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. As you can tell, the businesses of this diversified and growing enterprise remains strong and well-positioned for sustained, balanced growth as we continue to add new capabilities and market positions. We remain committed to our mission and an intense focus on serving one person at a time at increasing levels of value, more affordable, better outcomes and improved experiences, while generating strong returns for you, our shareholders. Operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to some of the commentary. You said trends are near baseline. Just wanted to be clear are you talking about just utilization or spending there? And then the commentary that COVID was 11% of activity, I guess in the fourth quarter. Just want to clarify that.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thanks, Ralph. John?\nJohn Rex: Ralph, yes. So, we\u2019re talking about spending. When we talk about near-baseline levels anticipated and again inclusive of the COVID-19 care costs. So, that\u2019s why I was trying to give you some sense of kind of what component those, what those comprise in there, overall. And your second question, Ralph, I lost just the last part of it. I just want to make sure I heard that.\nDavid Wichmann: I\u2019m afraid he may have cut out.\nJohn Rex: Yes. I didn\u2019t hear quite the very end of it. But when we\u2019re talking about kind of the 11% zone, I think maybe what you were looking for is probably how that relates. Think of that 11% zone in terms of medical costs. If you\u2019re looking at our medical costs on our income statement, I\u2019d use about maybe three quarters of that level as a measure. What I would exclude from that, because we\u2019re thinking about really kind of components, fee-for-service medical costs, but we incur on that. So, it would include UnitedHealthcare\u2019s payments to capitated providers \u2013 it would exclude, sorry. It would also exclude things like pharmacy costs and such. So, I\u2019d probably use about three quarters of that, and I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re going with that question. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, Ralph, if we didn\u2019t get that, just circle back with the team, and we\u2019ll be happy to answer your question [indiscernible]. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi. Good morning. You recently updated your telehealth policies, wanted to dig a little bit deeper into this. What do you think is sort of the right balance between in-person medical care versus telehealth when activity normalizes? And when do you think \u2013 where do you think reimbursement will settle? It seems that you are continuing sort of the imperative reimbursement, but as you think about --?\nDavid Wichmann: Ricky, you cut out about the same time Ralph did, so we\u2019ll take a shot at answering your question around telehealth policies and how we think this will normalize out. Actually, I\u2019ll ask Dirk to do that and maybe ask Dr. Decker to talk about the pluses and minuses \u2013 not pluses and minuses but just maybe when more in-patient care should be administered versus digital.\nDirk McMahon: Yes. So thanks, Dave. What I would say is the good news is that telehealth is a great vehicle for people to access care. So, number one, let\u2019s just start with that as a premise. We at UnitedHealthcare, from a policy standpoint, we work with Optum, we work with a lot of telehealth providers on different products and capabilities, and I would say how it\u2019s ultimately going to shake out is going to be related to who provides the best outcome using telehealth, the lowest costs, and ultimately the best patient experience. Those are sort of truisms which are going to exist no matter what. We saw a huge spike at the beginning of real high telehealth access back in April. It sort of metered out throughout the course of the year. I\u2019m not sure where it\u2019s going to ultimately end, but clearly it\u2019s here to stay and it\u2019s going to be an important part of healthcare going forward.\nDavid Wichmann: Dr. Decker?\nWyatt Decker: Yes, thanks, Dave and Dirk. And Ricky, thanks for the question. What\u2019s fascinating is not all telehealth offerings are created equal, and we have found that not surprisingly patients really appreciate being connected to their own personal providers, and providers very much need the real-time clinical data to provide good advice and care for that patient in a virtual setting. So, that\u2019s key point one. Point two is certain services like ambulatory or outpatient behavioral health care lends themselves to a telehealth solution, and so we have seen approximately 50% of our behavioral healthcare being delivered in a telehealth setting, and that has been sustained throughout the year even as the pandemic had subsided, and as it returns, it empowers those populations to get excellent care virtually. Finally, I\u2019ll just add that it\u2019s critical and we\u2019re very excited about the ability at OptumHealth to connect physical care, virtual care, and home-based care in a comprehensive model that really differentiates itself by providing personal, real-time care in the right setting. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Dr. Decker and Dirk. Thank you for your question, Ricky. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess as you now assess the commercial membership trends exiting 2020 and any early trends so far in 2021, is there any further color just on your conviction around the commercial enrollment projections for 2021, as you would now need a small increase in commercial risk membership to hit the target this year and then whereas fee-based rates would remain essentially flat, just looking for more color around that? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Steven, a good question. And I\u2019d just like to throw in a plug for our commercial team that has worked very hard to get cost structures in line and to be very innovative around new product offerings, bring greater value to people, and I think it\u2019s starting to show through in terms of our overall growth performance. Bill, do you want to comment, respond to Steven directly?\nBill Golden: Yes. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start with we\u2019re really pleased with how our fourth quarter and January 2021 enrollment performance played out. Our enrollment for one-one [ph] is better than we projected at our investor conference, supported by really strong persistency across really all lines of coverage and then less than anticipated attrition. Obviously, in the current economic environment, it\u2019s created some challenges. However, we\u2019re really well-positioned to deliver on our commercial growth strategy that we highlighted at our Investor Day. I think we\u2019ve also benefited from a broad portfolio of products that all of our customers are accessing to renew their business with us. So, we feel really nice \u2013 we feel really strong about our growth prospects for the rest of 2021. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: I\u2019d just say we have a ways to go. We\u2019re kind of turning the corner to growth, and obviously maintaining that consistently and continuing to accelerate it will be our emphasis as we move forward. Thank you for the question, Steven. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Good morning. Could you just talk a little bit in OptumRx about the pace and status for you guys in online pharmacy and in-home delivery? And maybe what your long-term strategy and scope is for that?\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Happy to. John Prince?\nJohn Prince: Thanks for the question, Lance. Obviously we\u2019ve been very focused on building our pharmacy care services model for the last several years. So not only have we been getting into online pharmacy and home delivery but we\u2019ve been creating various programs to meet the needs of populations especially in infusion and pharmacies. And why we frame that is because we\u2019re trying to meet the needs of the population in unique ways and create a very differentiated solution. So I think as you look at online pharmacy and home delivery, it\u2019s been a big grower for us. We\u2019ve continued to grow share, expand our penetration, but we\u2019ve also expanded our services within pharmacy care services to serve all consumers so that they don\u2019t have to be a member of the PBM. We\u2019ve been launching over-the-counter Optum Store, and so we see a significant growth of selling more products. We also will see in those stores unique ones like Optum Perks, which is our discount card of bringing them all together in a virtual environment. So we see good prospects, and we see as a big grower in the long-term.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Lance. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Willoughby: Hi. Good morning. Just a question regarding one of the lines in the press release this morning related to additional reserves for rebates related to activity as calendar year assessments were concluded. Just wondering if you could provide anymore color on that? And anyway to quantify that as compared to the larger, favorable reserve development you experienced during the quarter, anything else interesting on reserves and movements one way or another? Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Sure, Steve. John Rex here. I would say, additional color I could provide on that is kind of those actions well more than offset the magnitude of favorable reserve development in the quarter and just as those moved into those positions. Not too surprisingly, as you can tell, because we were able to, as we provide an outlook in December for the full year and how things would turn out, given the greater level of volatility in specific pieces of business over this course of this year as utilization moved around over the quarter, so thereby putting more plans into those kind of positions than one would of course normally have. Part of what one would have to anticipate in this kind of environment but certainly kind of that move. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Steve. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Had a question just on your latest thinking and expectations just around Medicaid risk corridors and the impact that you\u2019re expecting there. Just interested if the impact of corridors completed in the fourth quarter in line with the expectations that you provided at Investor Day, and whether there\u2019s been any incremental changes there since then in terms of expansion of corridor programs and how you think about that on Medicaid margins. One of your competitors had recently cited a larger than expected impact in 4Q, so wanted to get your feedback on that. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. We\u2019ll send that to Tim Spilker. Tim?\nTim Spilker: Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. States have continued to leverage risk corridors and MLR structures, and many of these were implemented in the back half of \u201820. We anticipated those based on discussions with our customers. One thing that should be noted is that looking ahead CMS has implemented rules requiring corridors to be implemented proactively versus retrospectively, so that will improve some predictability and visibility. And then overall, just in terms of what we\u2019re seeing at this point, while most of our one-one base rate renewals are in line with expectations, we\u2019re really respectful of the financial pressure that many of our states are under as well as the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. So we\u2019ll continue to work with our customers and advocate for sustainable funding in that regard. So thanks for the question.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Scott. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple quickies on post the Investor Day. It sounds like you\u2019re saying that cost trend picked up through the quarter a bit. Can you talk about it relative to what you\u2019re expecting for the full year 2021? Is it ahead of where you\u2019re expecting or in line? And then Medicare physician rates went up a bit post the Stimulus Bill. I\u2019ve estimated it about $0.15 of a headwind for the company. Just curious on your estimate there. And are there any offsets that you see as you are going through the year? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Why don\u2019t we hand the first part to John Rex, and then Tim will handle the second.\nJohn Rex: Justin, I\u2019d say the outlook for 2021 in terms of COVID impact, though even with what you\u2019ve cited there in terms of as things were trending in the quarter still consistent with where we were at Investor Conference. And our expectation is that total direct COVID-19 care costs in 2021 will be similar to what we experienced for full year 2020. So there isn\u2019t anything that would take us off that view right now. I think the other element we cited though, total COVID-19 care costs higher, and then the headwind being that care deferral likely being meaningfully lower than we saw in 2020.\nDavid Wichmann: And, Tim, second part?\nTim Spilker: Yes. Thanks, Justin, for the question. So the fee schedule increase that you talked about was of course part of the relief deal that was passed on December 20. And the physician fee schedule increase that was included there was partially offset by removing sequester for the first quarter of 2021. As we look at this environment, it\u2019s obviously still quite fluid. The PHE has been extended again and obviously also another relief package that\u2019s being worked on. At this time, the sequester relief has only been extended a quarter and does not match the PHE as it has throughout the pandemic, and if sequester was extended one more quarter, that would offset the small headwind that we\u2019re seeing as a result of all of this. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re still watching, but that\u2019s where it stands.\nDavid Wichmann: Good observation on puts and takes that\u2019s going to probably happen as we navigate our way through 2021. That\u2019s why we have a wider range, and we have a $2 billion estimate on net COVID impacts as well. Thanks for the question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thanks for the question. Maybe just to shift over to OptumHealth, I noticed you announced a fairly sizable physician group acquisition in Massachusetts. And if I heard you correctly, I believe you said you expect employed and affiliated physicians to increase around 10,000 this year. I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on the acquisition environment for doc groups. Are you finding a greater willingness in this kind of COVID, post-COVID world for a willingness to consider acquisitions for some of these larger groups?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. Just before we get started, we have not announced any acquisition, as you described. So that\u2019s a market rumor and speculation. As it relates to M&A broadly in this space, Doctor Decker and the team have done a terrific job continuing to build in the Northeast. I\u2019d say in the fourth quarter the [indiscernible] transaction was completed, and that is a strong addition to our I-95 corridor Tri-State expectation. We also finished an acquisition in the Southwest in Southern California, in particular, with the Inland Empire region, and we\u2019ve also done some work up in the Pacific Northwest this past year as well and some in the center part of the United States. I\u2019d say, generally speaking, the market seems to continue to gravitate towards an OptumCare-type model where there\u2019s a great sense of stability as well as a very strong quadruple aim model, which seems to resonate very well with physicians but also with our patients where they get better experiences, outcomes, and overall lower costs as demonstrated by the value that\u2019s being brought every day and the growth of that overall in that area. So I think as we turn into 2021 this will be an area of continued focus for us, and I think you\u2019ll continue to see that occur over the next half to full decade or so as we continue to build out this broad health system that\u2019s much more effective across the four aims that I just described. Thank you for your question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from UBS. Your line is open.\nWhit Mayo: Hey. Thanks. You guys have really emphasized some of the new innovative solutions in commercial, the consumer-centric focus, etcetera. Can you talk maybe more about the on-demand solutions that you\u2019ve been referencing and the partnership with buying just the receptivity among planned sponsors? Just curious if there\u2019s been any sort of surprises in the market as you\u2019ve kind of brought that capability to your customer base.\nDavid Wichmann: Bill, do you want to take that one?\nBill Golden: Yes, sure. I\u2019ll start with we benefit from a broad portfolio of products and plan designs across our business, and depending on the type of buyer we\u2019ve seen great interest in all different types of products for us. So we have seen a big uptick in our motion product, people looking for digital solutions, looking for activity trackers. There\u2019s been a huge amount of emphasis and discussion with employers regarding access to better wellness obviously because of the pandemic, and so we\u2019ve seen a lot of receptivity to that. We\u2019ve seen a lot of receptivity to our All Savers product. As far as Bind, Yes. For a particular type of buyer it\u2019s really been a very interesting, innovative solution. We continue to bring that to market, and we\u2019re excited about the opportunities that we\u2019ll deliver in our fully-insured market as well as in our ASO business for Bind. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: And if I can, I\u2019m just going to have Dan Schumacher on the Bind board also comment on what he\u2019s seeing with the overall progression there.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Thank you. Whit, appreciate the interest. We have seen broad market interest in Bind. I\u2019d say that as you look at what happened over the course of 2020, more people were inclined to stay, so there was less switching going on. You saw that in the broader UnitedHealthcare performance in terms of retention. So on the new sales side, we saw probably lower interest than we would have hoped just given the tendency towards incumbency, but where we had an existing footprint we continued to see employees choose Bind inside those offerings. So we are excited about the prospects forward and expect to build on it especially as we return to more normal buying patterns in the future.\nDavid Wichmann: The progressive model that will continue to evolve and adapt over time like the initial price points and the impact, I also like the receptivity broadly by consumers, which I would say has probably been the greatest surprise for me, personally, is that consumers get it as well as they do. So, I think that\u2019s part of the reason why you have seen strong receptivity in the market overall. Thanks for the question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning, here with Eric as well. My question relates to OptumHealth and you show the 98 million consumers served in 2020 and the average revenue per consumer at $34. I think, John, you mentioned that was up close to 30%, but that\u2019s still a fraction of the opportunity of how we think about a traditional risk-bearing capitation rate. So the question really is what percentage of the OptumHealth revenues are sort of pure fee-for-service? What about \u2013 what\u2019s the percentage on the other end of the spectrum sort of global capitation and how do we think about what\u2019s in the middle, really just trying to see where that number can get to over time?\nDavid Wichmann: John Rex will answer and then I want Dr. Decker to maybe talk a little bit about the evolution from fee-for-service to risk.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Josh and Eric. John Rex here. So, looking at that, looking at that membership, so you are right in terms of where it is risk-based. Let me frame it from a very top level first, about two-thirds of overall OptumHealth revenue is risk-bearing revenue and we have sized before that you think of that as two-thirds of OptumCare also on risk-bearing relationships. If you want to get down to kind of the levels within OptumCare, there are 20 million members that are served by OptumCare of that 94 million that you are referring to. And then within that 20 million, 3.4 million are in some kind of risk-bearing relationship and then a smaller percentage in that in a true global capped relationship, I\u2019d put well below half of that 3.4 million in a global cap relationship. So you are right and one of the reasons we were, I was speaking to that in my prepared comments, is because of that opportunity. There is a comparatively small amount of the total membership potential that is currently in a global cap relationship. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the growth of OptumHealth and OptumCare. It comes down to its primarily an organic revenue growth story, because when we affiliate with physician groups, typically those come in, many of them come in largely fee-for-service arrangements and then we seek to convert those to risk arrangements or with more accountability, more value-based care over several years. And so when you look at kind of the overall revenue growth story of that company, it is predominantly organic revenue growth story just because of that. And that\u2019s really what I was talking about kind of why do we think there is double-digit revenue growth potential there for years to come. It\u2019s because of the still very, I\u2019d say, kind of early stage of where that stands.\nDavid Wichmann: Dr. Decker?\nWyatt Decker: Thank you. Thanks, Josh. So, I think Rex covered it nicely. So I would just underscore a couple of points. One is this is a major growth engine for Optum as we go forward, as we convert fee-for-service practices to value-based care models. Second is as we touched on earlier, this is very compelling for our physician colleagues. It\u2019s quite attractive. It actually allows us to decrease the administrative burden and allow our doctors to practice medicine, which is what they want to do. And the third is that we have a deep expertise in this space, because we have been practicing fully captive, fully delegated risk models for over 12 years and we are able to bring that expertise to our new practices throughout the country. Dave, you touched on the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast. Those are areas where you can expect to see significant growth in our risk-bearing capacities and care delivery. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. So this is a critical anchor strategy both for Optum as well as for UnitedHealth Group. It\u2019s a very important part of how we will continue to advance outsized growth for this enterprise going forward with an aim towards serving obviously more people and doing so with better experiences comes in lower cost. This was designed by the Optum team through their strategic process led by Andrew Witty and they have done a really nice job deploying this capability not only on behalf of Optum, but of course on behalf of all the UnitedHealth Group. Thank you for the question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just wanted to ask about M&A a little more, you have got obviously nice step up in growth expected this year. Any thoughts about what you are assuming relative to your ability to do normal risk assessments and get appropriately reimbursed for the patient population? Have you taken a more conservative view given the COVID backdrop or do you think you can get back to normal there? And just any quick comment on the 2022 rate notice, the final rate notice that they have just released and how you view that?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. Tim Noel, Head of M&R?\nTim Noel: Yes. Thanks, A.J., for the questions. So, first on 2022 revenue that you are getting at there with diagnosis capture for 2021, little bit early to talk about that at depth, but a couple of things I will offer is, one, we are really focused in M&R about getting our members vaccinated as soon as possible and across the enterprise, there is also a focus on doing the same for the frontline healthcare workers. And as both of these things happen, I think seniors will become increasingly more comfortable accessing care and that will have obviously an impact on diagnosis capture in 2021 that impacts revenue for 2022. We are being to be seen exactly how that timing plays out and we obviously have a bit of time remaining as we think about the 2022 bid to inform what does play out at the time of the bid and when that\u2019s submitted. With respect to the final notice that was published by CMS on January 15, as you know, number one, earlier than that\u2019s normally published. And the all-in rates that were included in that final notice of just north of 4% was a little bit of an increase over the advance notice. Beyond that, nothing really surprising with respect to rules or policy changes contained in the final notice this year. Really too early to comment on what that means for rates and benefits, lot of moving parts that remain as we think about the 2022 bid filing. Certainly, COVID is one of those things that we are watching as well with respect to that.\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks for the question. Just if I can add on a little bit, first, one of the key things for us and the reason why Tim started with vaccine is, because it\u2019s important for us to get our substantial health workforce vaccinated in part, our nurse house calls work for us so that they can safely pass into the home more broadly than maybe what we have seen including in more volatile circumstances. The other thing just to recognize is the extent that there was impacts on risk adjustment for 2021 we did take those into consideration in providing you with our estimates back in December. Thanks for the question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKevin Fischbeck: Alright, great. Thanks. Just wanted to maybe dig back into the $1.80 COVID headwind, is there anyway for you to kind of give us more dimensioning around kind of just how that at least from a relative size perspective flows across the three Optum businesses and the three health plan businesses? And it sounds like commercial is coming in better than you thought. Is there anything that maybe is different than what you thought a couple of months ago when you first provided that? Anything better, anything worse?\nDavid Wichmann: John Rex?\nJohn Rex: Yes. Good morning, Kevin. John Rex. So, the broad view on that is about two-thirds of that relates to the UnitedHealthcare businesses when we think about just over $2 billion in impact, of negative impact from COVID-19 in 2021 and about a third relates to the Optum businesses. That\u2019s kind of the general view. As we breakdown to different businesses and think about impacts on those, some of the commentary it offers. So, within OptumInsight, it is most sensitive to just kind of broadly claims volumes and business activity, general business activity. Those are kind of the factors that have been a component within that. The risk-bearing businesses of OptumHealth are impacted similarly to the UnitedHealthcare businesses as you would expect also in terms of activity there. Within the different categories across OptumHealth, across UnitedHealthcare in general, I would just tell you kind of as we look at that, so Dave just cited that as it relates to how we anticipated and incorporated thoughts about facility for seniors to access care and get proper risk adjustment done. So, that\u2019s an impact that\u2019s mostly felt within Medicare & Retirement in terms of that component of it, as you would expect also and to some extent, to a lesser extent, in the Community & State where you would have some of the Dual Special Needs plans membership also. Within OptumRx, that is mostly also a volume-driven component. Has to do largely just with physician visit activity often in terms of scripts being written and as those flow through the system. So, those are kind of the broad overall impacts I would offer. And Dirk, any other comments?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. I think one of the things you mentioned was on commercial. I think what\u2019s resulted in sort of little stronger outlook than what we expected from a membership standpoint is persistency was better. There was a lot of groups that decided to stick. I would also say the various government stimulus packages helped. And I would also say one product stood out for us is our All Savers level-funded product, which has done extremely well which is kind of you give back, if the group performs better than expected they get a refund, if it\u2019s worse than they expected, then you ultimately get a \u2013 if better than expected, then they have \u2013 they get the refund if it\u2019s better than expected. So, that\u2019s a good thing. If it\u2019s worse, then the stop loss policy kicks in. But long story short, I think some good products, as we talked about plus I would say good persistency was a big benefit to commercial.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Kevin. That\u2019s all we have time for today. So, apologies to Ralph and Ricky both whose questions got cut off somehow. So, please, I am glad we were able to fix that, but please give our team a call and we will be happy to answer any other questions that you have. I would like to thank you all for joining us again today. I hope this morning\u2019s call provided you with useful context and importantly clarity and helped to better understand our ambitions for the year ahead. As I said in my opening remarks, we are starting 2021 with an optimistic view. Despite these extraordinary circumstances, our team continues to manage the challenges at hand with unprecedented resiliency and ingenuity. At the same time, we continue to pursue our long-term growth strategy with an even greater sense of urgency and intensity building upon the agility, insights and considerable new capabilities developed this past year to deliver a high-performing healthcare system built on personal human connections, enabled through information and technology and supported by strong alignment of physician-led value-based delivery of care serving millions of people one person at a time while delivering distinguished returns for our shareholders. Thanks again for joining us. We\u2019ll see you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes. So thanks, Dave. What I would say is the good news is that telehealth is a great vehicle for people to access care. So, number one, let's just start with that as a premise. We at UnitedHealthcare, from a policy standpoint, we work with Optum, we work with a lot of telehealth providers on different products and capabilities, and I would say how it's ultimately going to shake out is going to be related to who provides the best outcome using telehealth, the lowest costs, and ultimately the best patient experience. Those are sort of truisms which are going to exist no matter what. We saw a huge spike at the beginning of real high telehealth access back in April. It sort of metered out throughout the course of the year. I'm not sure where it's going to ultimately end, but clearly it's here to stay and it's going to be an important part of healthcare going forward. Yes. I think one of the things you mentioned was on commercial. I think what's resulted in sort of little stronger outlook than what we expected from a membership standpoint is persistency was better. There was a lot of groups that decided to stick. I would also say the various government stimulus packages helped.

            "content": "Yes, thanks, Dave and Dirk. And Ricky, thanks for the question. What's fascinating is not all telehealth offerings are created equal, and we have found that not surprisingly patients really appreciate being connected to their own personal providers, and providers very much need the real-time clinical data to provide good advice and care for that patient in a virtual setting. So, that's key point one. Point two is certain services like ambulatory or outpatient behavioral health care lends themselves to a telehealth solution, and so we have seen approximately 50% of our behavioral healthcare being delivered in a telehealth setting, and that has been sustained throughout the year even as the pandemic had subsided, and as it returns, it empowers those populations to get excellent care virtually. Finally, I'll just add that it's critical and we're very excited about the ability at OptumHealth to connect physical care, virtual care, and home-based care in a comprehensive model that really differentiates itself by providing personal, real-time care in the right setting. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Josh. So, I think Rex covered it nicely. So I would just underscore a couple of points.

            "name": "Tim Spilker",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. States have continued to leverage risk corridors and MLR structures, and many of these were implemented in the back half of \u201820. We anticipated those based on discussions with our customers. One thing that should be noted is that looking ahead CMS has implemented rules requiring corridors to be implemented proactively versus retrospectively, so that will improve some predictability and visibility. And then overall, just in terms of what we're seeing at this point, while most of our one-one base rate renewals are in line with expectations, we're really respectful of the financial pressure that many of our states are under as well as the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. So we'll continue to work with our customers and advocate for sustainable funding in that regard. So thanks for the question. Yes. Thanks, Justin, for the question. So the fee schedule increase that you talked about was of course part of the relief deal that was passed on December 20. And the physician fee schedule increase that was included there was partially offset by removing sequester for the first quarter of 2021. As we look at this environment, it's obviously still quite fluid. The PHE has been extended again and obviously also another relief package that's being worked on. At this time, the sequester relief has only been extended a quarter and does not match the PHE as it has throughout the pandemic, and if sequester was extended one more quarter, that would offset the small headwind that we're seeing as a result of all of this. So it's something we're still watching, but that's where it stands."

Our enrollment for one-one [ph] is better than we projected at our investor conference, supported by really strong persistency across really all lines of coverage and then less than anticipated attrition. Obviously, in the current economic environment, it's created some challenges. However, we're really well-positioned to deliver on our commercial growth strategy that we highlighted at our Investor Day. I think we've also benefited from a broad portfolio of products that all of our customers are accessing to renew their business with us. So, we feel really nice \u2013 we feel really strong about our growth prospects for the rest of 2021. Thank you. Yes, sure. I'll start with we benefit from a broad portfolio of products and plan designs across our business, and depending on the type of buyer we've seen great interest in all different types of products for us. So we have seen a big uptick in our motion product, people looking for digital solutions, looking for activity trackers. There's been a huge amount of emphasis and discussion with employers regarding access to better wellness obviously because of the pandemic, and so we've seen a lot of receptivity to that. We've seen a lot of receptivity to our All Savers product. As far as Bind, Yes. For a particular type of buyer it's really been a very interesting, innovative solution.

            "name": "David Wichmann",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We remain in a time of unprecedented challenges for individuals, employers, and the health system broadly, particularly frontline clinicians, including our own. Health systems across the world have been and continue to be stressed. Amidst these challenges, we are grateful for the daily displays of human spirit to serve others and the resolve to make things better. We remain optimistic because we are also living at a time of unprecedented collaboration, knowledge sharing, and innovation. The health system has come together in ways previously not seen, a powerful multi-dimensional response to support patients, physicians, and communities. I couldn't be prouder of or more grateful to the more than 325,000 women and men of this enterprise. They work each day under difficult conditions with clinicians comprising well more than a third of the total. To advance a high performing healthcare system, one built on personal human connections enabled through information and technology and supported by strong alignment of physician-led, value-based delivery of care. They are another profound reason for our optimism. With all that's transpired in 2020, we finished the year responsibly and strongly. We delivered meaningful advances in NPS and employee engagement and financial results well above the upper end of our expectations, all while navigating the uncertain environment and achieving our commitment to address financial imbalances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we move into 2021, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to serve more people even more deeply and more effectively, while continuing to build this enterprise and grow strongly in the decades to come. Just 7 weeks ago, we were privileged to spend a full day with you at our investor conference. Over the course of that day, we tried to convey how we seek to lead in the development of the next generation healthcare system. We shared the distinctive capabilities we apply to make healthcare more connected, more informed, more human, and more deeply personal. We finished 2020 encouraged by the performance across the businesses of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Let me provide just a few broad highlights. The UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage offerings are off to an excellent start. 2021 will be one of our strongest years of growth, now expected to approach 900,000 more people served across individual and group Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans. UnitedHealthcare will have grown to serve 3.5 million more seniors over 5 years. Seniors choose our offerings because of the value they receive, better health outcomes and experiences at lower costs. We have also been enhancing our offerings to better meet expectations about how people want to live their lives, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our one-on-one concierge navigation services, and enabling the home as the safest and more effective setting of care. UnitedHealthcare's Medicaid offerings continued to grow strongly as well, including entry into three new states in 2021. New business opportunities are substantial with momentum towards managed care adoption by states and RFP activity accelerating this year and next. And while the economic effects of COVID-19 impacted UnitedHealthcare's employer-sponsored growth in 2020, we are encouraged by the positive market response to the new highly consumer-centric offerings we have been discussing with you in recent months. Among these are digital first, on-demand, and physician-led products each provide deeply aligned modern, personal, and coordinated-care experiences and save people up to 20% compared to traditional offerings. These innovative products are generating significant responses because they are designed to better meet the unique needs and financial needs of more people. All-in, we expect UnitedHealthcare will grow in 2021 to serve upwards of 1.5 million more people across its senior community, employer-sponsored, and individual offerings. We continue to make important advancements and strategic investments to lay the foundation for the next generation health system. Over the last many years, you have heard us discuss our ambition to build high performing systems of care, including an aim to reinvent healthcare delivery, which is the first of our five strategic growth platforms. The foundations for those efforts are in our primary and multi-specialty care practices. OptumCare entered 2021 with over 50,000 physicians and 1,400 clinics. Over the course of this year, we expect to grow our employed and affiliated physicians by at least 10,000. This work of building local physician-led systems of care continues to be central to our mission and is accelerating with notable progress in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and Southern California in 2020. Two weeks ago, we announced the combination of Change Healthcare and OptumInsight. We expect this combination will greatly advance the foundational connectivity and collaboration needed for the next-generation health system, establishing a new, more modern information, and technology-enabled healthcare platform. It will help accelerate the development and use of digital and advanced technologies, another of our five key growth platforms and critical to connecting all elements of our business strategy. This advanced platform will help clinicians make the most informed and clinically advanced patient care decisions more quickly and easily. Change Healthcare brings widely adopted technology for integrating evidence-based clinical criteria directly into the clinician's workflow, while Optum's clinical analytics expertise and individual health record can strengthen the evidence base needed to deliver effective clinical decision support at the point of care. This can ensure appropriate clinical pathways are offered in the most appropriate sites of care, leading to consistent achievement of the best possible outcomes experiences and value for the patients we serve. Another key opportunity will be to enhance administrative processes by combining Optum's advanced data analytics with Change Healthcare's intelligent healthcare network to support simpler, more informed, and accurate services and processing at considerably lower costs. Finally, combining Change Healthcare's payment capacities with Optum's highly automated payment networks will simplify financial interactions among care providers, payers, and consumers and accelerate the movement to a more modern, real-time, and transparent payment system. This will help physicians get paid more quickly, accurately, and reliably and provide consumers with more options and convenience and managing their healthcare finances. The Change Healthcare team has been doing outstanding work and we are looking forward to working alongside them. We continue to execute on the core initiatives we laid out for you in December. One example as the pandemic disrupted care patterns, we all saw the increased need to enhance in-home and alternative settings of care offering patients to receive safe, effective, and efficient care outside of traditional venues. However, the need for in-home care will continue to grow well beyond the current environment. We know that more than 80% of what impacts a person's health happens outside of traditional healthcare settings. There is a significant opportunity in offering consistent cost-effective care for seniors, people with complex medical conditions and geographically isolated individuals through in-home and alternative settings. Offering a foundational ability to care for people in their homes is essential to developing a health system that is more consumer centric, higher quality, and lower cost. We already have well established trusted capacities to bring skilled care resources into the home, including through Optum's HouseCalls program. We expect our advanced practice clinicians will conduct over 2 million in-home visits this year. And we are building upon this established home capacity in many ways. We have introduced Vivify remote patient monitoring capabilities to improve connectivity and information sharing with physicians. This has been received positively by patients with a net promoter score over 80. Optum At-Home provides in-person and telephonic touch points across an interdisciplinary team, including physical, social and behavioral aspects. The program increases preventative care, achieves exceptional NPS in the mid-80s, lowers medical expense and demonstrates high quality with over 90% of our members in a 4-star or higher plan. Similarly, Optum's Pharmacy Care Services enables patients to receive the care and medications they need with capacities to deliver outside of traditional settings. OptumRx infusion services now addresses the needs of about 25,000 patients per month and is growing double-digits, which means more patients can obtain the care they need outside of the acute settings. That makes it safer, simpler and more affordable for people. We remain encouraged as well by the traditional pharmacy services provided by OptumRx with an over 98% customer retention rate entering 2021. We are off to a good start for the 2022 selling season as we were recently awarded the honor to serve more than 2.5 million members of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. In sum, we enter 2021 with momentum, competent in our capacities to navigate through and begin to emerge from these challenging times as an even more capable, diverse and growing enterprise. Now, I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. Thank you, John. As you can tell, the businesses of this diversified and growing enterprise remains strong and well-positioned for sustained, balanced growth as we continue to add new capabilities and market positions. We remain committed to our mission and an intense focus on serving one person at a time at increasing levels of value, more affordable, better outcomes and improved experiences, while generating strong returns for you, our shareholders. Operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please. Great. Thanks, Ralph. John? I'm afraid he may have cut out. Okay, Ralph, if we didn't get that, just circle back with the team, and we'll be happy to answer your question [indiscernible]. Next question, please? Ricky, you cut out about the same time Ralph did, so we'll take a shot at answering your question around telehealth policies and how we think this will normalize out. Actually, I'll ask Dirk to do that and maybe ask Dr. Decker to talk about the pluses and minuses \u2013 not pluses and minuses but just maybe when more in-patient care should be administered versus digital. Dr. Decker? Great. Thank you, Dr. Decker and Dirk. Thank you for your question, Ricky. Next question, please? Great. Steven, a good question. And I'd just like to throw in a plug for our commercial team that has worked very hard to get cost structures in line and to be very innovative around new product offerings, bring greater value to people, and I think it's starting to show through in terms of our overall growth performance. Bill, do you want to comment, respond to Steven directly? I'd just say we have a ways to go. We're kind of turning the corner to growth, and obviously maintaining that consistently and continuing to accelerate it will be our emphasis as we move forward. Thank you for the question, Steven. Next question, please? Great. Happy to. John Prince? Great. Thank you, Lance. Next question, please? Thank you, Steve. Next question, please? Sure. We'll send that to Tim Spilker. Tim? Great. Thank you, Scott. Next question, please? Why don't we hand the first part to John Rex, and then Tim will handle the second. And, Tim, second part? Good observation on puts and takes that's going to probably happen as we navigate our way through 2021. That's why we have a wider range, and we have a $2 billion estimate on net COVID impacts as well. Thanks for the question. Next question, please? Yes. Just before we get started, we have not announced any acquisition, as you described. So that's a market rumor and speculation. As it relates to M&A broadly in this space, Doctor Decker and the team have done a terrific job continuing to build in the Northeast. I'd say in the fourth quarter the [indiscernible] transaction was completed, and that is a strong addition to our I-95 corridor Tri-State expectation. We also finished an acquisition in the Southwest in Southern California, in particular, with the Inland Empire region, and we've also done some work up in the Pacific Northwest this past year as well and some in the center part of the United States. I'd say, generally speaking, the market seems to continue to gravitate towards an OptumCare-type model where there's a great sense of stability as well as a very strong quadruple aim model, which seems to resonate very well with physicians but also with our patients where they get better experiences, outcomes, and overall lower costs as demonstrated by the value that's being brought every day and the growth of that overall in that area. So I think as we turn into 2021 this will be an area of continued focus for us, and I think you'll continue to see that occur over the next half to full decade or so as we continue to build out this broad health system that's much more effective across the four aims that I just described. Thank you for your question. Next question, please? Bill, do you want to take that one? And if I can, I'm just going to have Dan Schumacher on the Bind board also comment on what he's seeing with the overall progression there. The progressive model that will continue to evolve and adapt over time like the initial price points and the impact, I also like the receptivity broadly by consumers, which I would say has probably been the greatest surprise for me, personally, is that consumers get it as well as they do. So, I think that's part of the reason why you have seen strong receptivity in the market overall. Thanks for the question. Next question, please? John Rex will answer and then I want Dr. Decker to maybe talk a little bit about the evolution from fee-for-service to risk. Dr. Decker? Yes. So this is a critical anchor strategy both for Optum as well as for UnitedHealth Group. It's a very important part of how we will continue to advance outsized growth for this enterprise going forward with an aim towards serving obviously more people and doing so with better experiences comes in lower cost. This was designed by the Optum team through their strategic process led by Andrew Witty and they have done a really nice job deploying this capability not only on behalf of Optum, but of course on behalf of all the UnitedHealth Group. Thank you for the question. Next question, please? Sure. Tim Noel, Head of M&R? Thanks for the question. Just if I can add on a little bit, first, one of the key things for us and the reason why Tim started with vaccine is, because it's important for us to get our substantial health workforce vaccinated in part, our nurse house calls work for us so that they can safely pass into the home more broadly than maybe what we have seen including in more volatile circumstances. The other thing just to recognize is the extent that there was impacts on risk adjustment for 2021 we did take those into consideration in providing you with our estimates back in December. Thanks for the question. Next question, please? John Rex? Thank you, Kevin. That's all we have time for today. So, apologies to Ralph and Ricky both whose questions got cut off somehow. So, please, I am glad we were able to fix that, but please give our team a call and we will be happy to answer any other questions that you have. I would like to thank you all for joining us again today. I hope this morning's call provided you with useful context and importantly clarity and helped to better understand our ambitions for the year ahead. As I said in my opening remarks, we are starting 2021 with an optimistic view. Despite these extraordinary circumstances, our team continues to manage the challenges at hand with unprecedented resiliency and ingenuity. At the same time, we continue to pursue our long-term growth strategy with an even greater sense of urgency and intensity building upon the agility, insights and considerable new capabilities developed this past year to deliver a high-performing healthcare system built on personal human connections, enabled through information and technology and supported by strong alignment of physician-led value-based delivery of care serving millions of people one person at a time while delivering distinguished returns for our shareholders. Thanks again for joining us. We'll see you soon."

            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. The full year 2020 and fourth quarter results were favorable to the outlook we provided at our December 1 investor conference, while continuing to be impacted by the unprecedented environment which has existed most of the year. To begin, as we know it is of great interest to you, I'd like to share what we are seeing in current care patterns. Starting at the highest level within the broad member categories we serve, people with commercial benefits continue to exhibit overall higher levels of care activity with less deferrals and those served in public sector programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our top priority remains getting people the care they need. During the fourth quarter, we saw overall average care activities return to seasonal baselines compared to the just over 95% we cited for the third quarter. The pacing over the course of the quarter, perhaps not too surprisingly, moved from just below baseline as we began to modestly exceeding baseline in the latter half. This measure includes increased direct COVID-19 related care, which in total comprised about 11% of all care activity during the fourth quarter compared to about 6% in the third quarter. Looking deeper within specific care categories, outpatient activity began the quarter at baseline and we were gratified people were able to obtain needed care previously deferred. By the latter part of the quarter however, some outpatient activity moderated as COVID-19 incidence elevated. Total in-patient activity increased modestly over the course of the quarter as the direct COVID-19 related care components rose as a percentage of the total in the latter half. For example, of the 65,000 COVID-19 related in-patient admissions during the quarter, about 20% occurred October and about 50% in December. Moving into our specific businesses, OptumHealth's fourth quarter earnings increased 16% year-over-year as care activity at our fee-for-service practices and ambulatory surgery centers continue to recover with these businesses now operating near baseline. Revenue for consumers served grew 29% over the year ago quarter. The growth in this measure reflects continued development of the value based care arrangements, the depth of our offerings and the increasing acuity of the types of care we can deliver to the people we serve. You should expect this measure to continue to grow at a strong double-digit pace for many years to come. One example which highlights this potential, of the 20 million patients OptumCare serves to-date under 20% are currently in value-based arrangements. We expect both the number of patients served and the depth and number of value-based arrangements to continue to accelerate. OptumInsight's earnings were ahead of the outlook we offered at the beginning of December, with overall 2020 performance impacted by lower levels of care with revenues dependent upon care activity volumes for many of these businesses and the generally subdued overall business environment. We continue to expect 10% to 15% growth in 2021 as care activity returns to normalized levels and we continue to advance strategic relationships and broaden services with existing customers. This outlook excludes any impact from OptumInsight's combination with Change Healthcare, which we expect will close in the second half of the year. OptumRx earnings were also ahead of this outlook. During 2020, revenues in our pharmacy care services and specialty businesses continue to grow at double-digits and now comprise nearly half of total OptumRx revenue. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, fourth quarter operating results were above our December review. They reflect continued customer and provider assistance measures to help people obtain the care they need and comparatively lower levels of care deferrals and higher COVID-19 care costs versus the third quarter. Results in the fourth quarter were further impacted by additional reserves or rebates and related activity as plans with such arrangements moved into these positions as a result of the cumulative care deferral impacts throughout 2020 and calendar year end assessments were concluded. As Dave noted, sales activity in the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period was robust. Within the 900,000 new members we expect to serve for full year 2021, about 775,000 will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans, which are included in the community and state Medicaid membership tables. Strong growth in Medicaid membership continued in the fourth quarter. We call our full year 2021 outlook to serve an additional 200,000 to 300,000 people, assumed state re-determination activities are reinitiated during the year. We concluded 2020 with commercial membership about 100,000 people ahead of the outlook we provided at our investor conference. Early January results are well supportive of positive commercial growth in 2021, this even considering the challenging economic environment. Our liquidity, capital positions and capacities remained strong. Full year 2020 cash flows from operations were $22.2 billion or 1.4x net income with the fourth quarter results exceeding the outlook we provided due in part to early customer receipts. Our debt to total capital ratio of 38.9% compares to 40.2% last year. As we look enthusiastically toward the combination with Change Healthcare, we intend to maintain our longstanding capital policies, including our approach to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and an advancing dividend with ample capacity to continue building upon our strategic growth platforms and ongoing priority on expanding our local care delivery capabilities. Our full year 2021 outlook remains consistent with the early December commentary, with total revenue approaching $280 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $17.75 to $18.25, inclusive of the negative COVID-19 related effects we described. Given the still highly dynamic circumstances, we will likely hold this broader than typical range of expectations as we much like everyone else, continue to learn more about the environment. Now, I will turn it back to Dave. Ralph, yes. So, we're talking about spending. When we talk about near-baseline levels anticipated and again inclusive of the COVID-19 care costs. So, that's why I was trying to give you some sense of kind of what component those, what those comprise in there, overall. And your second question, Ralph, I lost just the last part of it. I just want to make sure I heard that. Yes. I didn't hear quite the very end of it. But when we're talking about kind of the 11% zone, I think maybe what you were looking for is probably how that relates. Think of that 11% zone in terms of medical costs. If you're looking at our medical costs on our income statement, I'd use about maybe three quarters of that level as a measure. What I would exclude from that, because we're thinking about really kind of components, fee-for-service medical costs, but we incur on that. So, it would include UnitedHealthcare's payments to capitated providers \u2013 it would exclude, sorry. It would also exclude things like pharmacy costs and such. So, I'd probably use about three quarters of that, and I think that's where you're going with that question. Thank you. Sure, Steve. John Rex here. I would say, additional color I could provide on that is kind of those actions well more than offset the magnitude of favorable reserve development in the quarter and just as those moved into those positions. Not too surprisingly, as you can tell, because we were able to, as we provide an outlook in December for the full year and how things would turn out, given the greater level of volatility in specific pieces of business over this course of this year as utilization moved around over the quarter, so thereby putting more plans into those kind of positions than one would of course normally have. Part of what one would have to anticipate in this kind of environment but certainly kind of that move. Thank you. Justin, I'd say the outlook for 2021 in terms of COVID impact, though even with what you've cited there in terms of as things were trending in the quarter still consistent with where we were at Investor Conference. And our expectation is that total direct COVID-19 care costs in 2021 will be similar to what we experienced for full year 2020. So there isn't anything that would take us off that view right now. I think the other element we cited though, total COVID-19 care costs higher, and then the headwind being that care deferral likely being meaningfully lower than we saw in 2020. Good morning, Josh and Eric. John Rex here. So, looking at that, looking at that membership, so you are right in terms of where it is risk-based. Let me frame it from a very top level first, about two-thirds of overall OptumHealth revenue is risk-bearing revenue and we have sized before that you think of that as two-thirds of OptumCare also on risk-bearing relationships. If you want to get down to kind of the levels within OptumCare, there are 20 million members that are served by OptumCare of that 94 million that you are referring to. And then within that 20 million, 3.4 million are in some kind of risk-bearing relationship and then a smaller percentage in that in a true global capped relationship, I'd put well below half of that 3.4 million in a global cap relationship. So you are right and one of the reasons we were, I was speaking to that in my prepared comments, is because of that opportunity. There is a comparatively small amount of the total membership potential that is currently in a global cap relationship. That's really what's driving the growth of OptumHealth and OptumCare. It comes down to its primarily an organic revenue growth story, because when we affiliate with physician groups, typically those come in, many of them come in largely fee-for-service arrangements and then we seek to convert those to risk arrangements or with more accountability, more value-based care over several years. And so when you look at kind of the overall revenue growth story of that company, it is predominantly organic revenue growth story just because of that. And that's really what I was talking about kind of why do we think there is double-digit revenue growth potential there for years to come. It's because of the still very, I'd say, kind of early stage of where that stands. Yes. Good morning, Kevin. John Rex. So, the broad view on that is about two-thirds of that relates to the UnitedHealthcare businesses when we think about just over $2 billion in impact, of negative impact from COVID-19 in 2021 and about a third relates to the Optum businesses. That's kind of the general view. As we breakdown to different businesses and think about impacts on those, some of the commentary it offers. So, within OptumInsight, it is most sensitive to just kind of broadly claims volumes and business activity, general business activity. Those are kind of the factors that have been a component within that. The risk-bearing businesses of OptumHealth are impacted similarly to the UnitedHealthcare businesses as you would expect also in terms of activity there. Within the different categories across OptumHealth, across UnitedHealthcare in general, I would just tell you kind of as we look at that, so Dave just cited that as it relates to how we anticipated and incorporated thoughts about facility for seniors to access care and get proper risk adjustment done. So, that's an impact that's mostly felt within Medicare & Retirement in terms of that component of it, as you would expect also and to some extent, to a lesser extent, in the Community & State where you would have some of the Dual Special Needs plans membership also. Within OptumRx, that is mostly also a volume-driven component. Has to do largely just with physician visit activity often in terms of scripts being written and as those flow through the system. So, those are kind of the broad overall impacts I would offer. And Dirk, any other comments?"

            "name": "Tim Noel",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, A.J., for the questions. So, first on 2022 revenue that you are getting at there with diagnosis capture for 2021, little bit early to talk about that at depth, but a couple of things I will offer is, one, we are really focused in M&R about getting our members vaccinated as soon as possible and across the enterprise, there is also a focus on doing the same for the frontline healthcare workers. And as both of these things happen, I think seniors will become increasingly more comfortable accessing care and that will have obviously an impact on diagnosis capture in 2021 that impacts revenue for 2022. We are being to be seen exactly how that timing plays out and we obviously have a bit of time remaining as we think about the 2022 bid to inform what does play out at the time of the bid and when that's submitted. With respect to the final notice that was published by CMS on January 15, as you know, number one, earlier than that's normally published. And the all-in rates that were included in that final notice of just north of 4% was a little bit of an increase over the advance notice. Beyond that, nothing really surprising with respect to rules or policy changes contained in the final notice this year. Really too early to comment on what that means for rates and benefits, lot of moving parts that remain as we think about the 2022 bid filing. Certainly, COVID is one of those things that we are watching as well with respect to that."

I'd say that as you look at what happened over the course of 2020, more people were inclined to stay, so there was less switching going on. You saw that in the broader UnitedHealthcare performance in terms of retention. So on the new sales side, we saw probably lower interest than we would have hoped just given the tendency towards incumbency, but where we had an existing footprint we continued to see employees choose Bind inside those offerings. So we are excited about the prospects forward and expect to build on it especially as we return to more normal buying patterns in the future."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company\u2019s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 14, 2020, which maybe accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The past 9 months have hopefully provided you a window into both the values and capabilities of this organization and how they enable us to serve our customers, patients, care providers, team members and their families and you, our investors, in a period of unprecedented challenge. I am fortunate to witness up close the exceptional work of our team everyday, an innovative, growing and highly adaptable enterprise driven by the compassion, expertise and restless spirit of our 325,000 people, over 120,000 of them providing care on the frontlines. Our collective experiences over this year have made us an even more deeply committed and energized organization about our potential to help advance the next generation health system, one which is fair, affordable, simpler and effective. Our team combines division with sharp focus on day-to-day execution, delivering strong well-balanced results across the enterprise. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $3.51 per share with the decline from the year ago quarter reflecting the swift customer and consumer support actions we committed to from the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based upon this performance and forward estimate of pandemic impacts, we are updating our full year 2020 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $16.50 to $16.75 per share. In this, we remain committed to ensuring any financial imbalances arising from the pandemic are addressed proactively and fairly for those we serve. We have done this consistently over this period even as the ultimate outcomes remain unclear. As the timeliness of relief to our stakeholders is critical, service, fairness and performance with a long-term view, this is what you could continue to expect from us. You should also expect this enterprise will apply its innovative spirit to contribute in a new and different ways as our capabilities expand and circumstances require. We have partnered on and led clinical trials, helping resolve the nation\u2019s critical PPE and PCR supply chain issues and enabling more rapid testing at considerable scale, while keeping the health workforce safe. We are supporting state testing operations in California, New Jersey, North Carolina and Indiana and contact tracing in New York City. We are supporting the Mayo Clinic\u2019s development of convalescent plasma and some of the most promising vaccine and antibody trials. We have helped enabled workforce safety through the development of ProtectWell, a protocol processing technology to enable the safety of the health workforce as well as the safe opening of businesses, schools and nursing homes. We are working to assist with employees\u2019 health coverage transitions through our GetCovered campaign now being offered by employers to assist people who have lost their jobs. We provided $2 billion in liquidity relief for the health system and our customers and consumers will realize over $3 billion in premium and cost sharing relief, including $1 billion in estimated rebates. We have contributed more than $100 million of financial support and 6 million pounds of meals for communities suffering from food insecurity, homelessness, and health disparities. These efforts are possible, because we operate a capable set of businesses and capacities that are leading the development of the next generation health system and expanding our opportunities to serve. Today, I would like to give you a brief sense of this work. Early in the pandemic, we quickly enabled Optum physicians and the physicians of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s most vulnerable patients to adapt and expand rapidly to meet the needs of millions of patients for care of chronic and emerging conditions. This included advancing telehealth by creating direct connections between patients and their own physicians, a critical element to highly effective digital health, ensuring adoption will extend well beyond this crisis. So far this year, OptumCare physicians have facilitated 1 million digital clinical visits directly with their patients. And we are rapidly developing a proprietary set of distinctive tools and aligning our clinical practices to further develop and amplify this capability. I am sure you can see how advancing modern telehealth fits into our overall strategy to build high performing systems of care. Our growing therapeutics capacities are positively impacting the management of chronic diseases. With the introduction of Level 2, a digital therapy developed to improve the lives of the 30 million people with Type 2 diabetes, we are helping patients move toward remission of the disease. Level 2 uniquely measures signals and applies artificial intelligence engaging people in producing better health outcomes. You can expect more digital therapeutics from us in the coming months and years. Our growing capacities are especially apparent within our OptumCare platform, where 53,000 physicians across 1,500 local patient-centered facilities serve nearly 20 million patients, over 3.5 million of these in some form of risk arrangements, with 1.3 million Medicare Advantage or dually-eligible members under global capitation. OptumCare creates substantial value by building a deeper clinician patient relationship and by leveraging data and artificial intelligence to enable our clinical model to intercept and treat disease early and proactively leading to better health outcomes, value and industry leading patient experiences. Our patients are experienced safer, healthier, more fulfilling lifestyles, spending one-third fewer days per year on average in a hospital bed and 40% fewer days in a skilled nursing facility than patients supported by traditional Medicare fee-for-service. Moreover, our most advanced care delivery practices deliver this high-quality care at upwards of 40% lower costs than the equivalent traditional Medicare benefit, with the value fully reflected in improved benefits and lower costs for seniors all at world class NPS scores in the mid-70s. The proven clinical success of Optum Senior Care offerings supports our considerable growth goals for OptumCare and also demonstrates the longer term potential to greatly benefit consumers and commercial offerings. We have been building this platform for over a decade now and expect it to continue to grow at strong double-digit rates for years to come. Another aspect of a modern next generation health system is managing the specialized and costly medications of the future in a way which works for patients, clinicians, employers and payers. Our OptumRx integrated specialty solution brings a total approach to managing complex conditions across both the medical and pharmacy benefits, where we are able to generate up to 37,000 in annual savings per patient by employing clinically appropriate care at more convenient lower cost sites. This approach is enabled by Optum\u2019s growing footprint of integrated community pharmacies which will grow by over 60 centers in 2020 and the number of patients served with our infusion services will grow at double-digit rates. We expect this to be another durable growth trend given the much safer and clinically equivalent patient experience. We see OptumRx as continuing to transform to be a leader in pharmacy care services. Put differently, we believe the value for people and the system from pharmacy care services resides in managing personal engagement in health, not just supply chain management. This plays to our strengths and will increasingly contribute to the growth of OptumRx in the years ahead. UnitedHealthcare continues to focus on the very needs of healthcare consumers. In the next generation health system, we expect consumer benefits to become increasingly customized to meet these needs as people search for solutions which are simple, affordable and help enable quality outcomes. UnitedHealthcare see strong reception to our expanding suite of highly tailored and affordable individual coverages. This year alone, the number of people we serve with individual health coverage has grown by 15%. Likewise, an employer sponsored coverage, our growing set of consumer centered, innovative and flexible offerings such as bind, all savers and traditional line plans such as Harmony in Southern California are gaining traction, with membership in these offerings having grown over 50% this year. You know many of you are interested in the Annual Medicare Advantage enrollment period which opens tomorrow. The 2021 benefit year will be UnitedHealthcare\u2019s largest Medicare Advantage footprint expansion in 5 years, reaching an additional 3.2 million people in nearly 300 additional counties. We are emphasizing what we know seniors are looking for this year even more than ever, stability and value. Premiums for most people we serve will be flat or reduced and nearly 2.5 million people will have no premium at all. We continue to innovate our product offerings, with all Medicare Advantage plans featuring zero co-pay primary care digital health visits and the expansion of our personal support services, such as an annual clinical health assessment delivered in a senior\u2019s home and for many the assignment of a dedicated UnitedHealthcare navigator. We expect strong growth in individual MA and when combined with our group Medicare gains, 2021 is shaping up to be another year of market leading growth. We also expect continued growth in Medicaid due to transitions in coverage and net new market gains and are looking forward to a record RFP season as we seek to serve more people in more geographies. What I have described for you this morning is a sampling of the initiatives we are pursuing today to help lead in the development of the next generation health system, a health system that works better for everyone, those who experienced care, those who provide care and those who pay for care. Now, I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dave. Broadly speaking, third quarter results continued to be impacted by disrupted care patterns, albeit to a much lesser extent than in the second quarter, as many regions of the country stabilize near to more normalized levels. Within the quarter, care deferral impacts were more than offset by the proactive consumer and customer assistance measures we voluntarily undertook earlier this year as well as COVID-19 care and testing costs and broader economic effects. These factors resulted in a 10% year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings per share. As we discussed last quarter, the deepest period of care deferral, which occurred in the second quarter and the timing of that recognition of our assistance actions built entirely lining up, which makes for a more pronounced adverse impact to earnings in the second half of 2020. The measures we voluntarily undertook mostly impact our benefits businesses and contribute to the UnitedHealthcare\u2019s third quarter operating earnings decline from a year ago. In the quarter, we saw total care activity now exceeding 95% of seasonal baseline, with certain categories even more closely approaching normal. This compares to an overall measure of about two-thirds at the lowest point in the second quarter. Each of the three Optum businesses continue to perform well, while accepted in different ways by still recovering care patterns and economic effects. Optum helped third quarter earnings increase 12% year-over-year as fee-for-service practices and ambulatory surgery activity began to recover, while risk bearing practices still experienced some modest continual effects from deferral of care. Our SCA ambulatory surgery centers operated about 95% of seasonal baseline in the third quarter compared to 55% in the second quarter. Year-to-date, over 1,000 new surgeons, have performed procedures at FDA as they seek a safe, convenient and efficient clinical partner. New surgeon affiliations for the 9-month period rose nearly 25% over last year and we continue to expand the complexity of procedures performed in these settings, having added over 40 new service lines nearly doubled last year. Patients increasingly prefer these three family centers with NPS measured at 92. These durable long-term trends will benefit our growth even more strongly in the future as elective care activity fully normalized. OptumInsight third quarter earnings increased 24% year-over-year, while the revenue backlog grew by $0.5 billion in the quarter to nearly $20 billion. Payor services and state government businesses performed strongly, while we continue to see lower activity in the provider-facing businesses due to procedural volumes. While still not fully normalized, business development activity has increased from the second quarter\u2019s much lower pacing. OptumRx earnings declined 2% year-over-year in the third quarter as script volumes were impacted by lower care activity and economic factors. Personal scripts, which are correlated to a physician business activity, greatly improved from the second quarter, which was down about 25%, while not yet fully back to prior year levels. Revenues in our expanding pharmacy services businesses have grown nearly 30% year-to-date. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, third quarter operating results reflect a considerable moderation of the care deferral impact experienced in the second quarter, while it\u2019s still not at baseline levels. This was more than offset by our assistance measures, direct COVID-19 care costs and economic factors. The number of people served in commercial products declined primarily due to employer actions. Within this, for us, about 40% of the fee-based decline came from very large employers, primarily in the hospitality, transportation and energy sectors. During the third quarter, growth in Medicaid membership accelerated, benefiting from the continued easing of state re-determination requirements. We have not yet seen material Medicaid enrollment activity due to job losses and historically, these transitions lag loss with healthcare coverage by about 6 months. Our Medicaid business has seen strong year-to-date organic growth of over 500,000 people. Sales activity in Medicare Advantage has continued to move towards more normalized patterns after seeing some slowing in the second quarter due to the pandemic. Within this, we have seen considerably less plan switching than typical for existing Medicare Advantage enrollees, while selection of MA over fee-for-service for people new to Medicare is tracking well. We continue to deepen our engagement with those seniors most in need, increasing the distribution of remote digital sensor kits to collect and monitor vital health data and address gaps in care generated by the pandemic. Seniors continue to highly value our house call programs with the number of home visits in the third quarter growing by nearly 30% over last year. Our liquidity and financial position remains strong. Third quarter cash flow is up $3.1 billion or 1x net income reflects the extra federal tax payment in the quarter due to the deferral of payments typically paid in the second quarter. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations are $16.1 billion or 1.2x net earnings and our debt to total capital ratio of 39.1% compares to 43.7% in the year ago quarter. As noted earlier, we have updated our full year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $16.50 to $16.75 per share. This reflects third quarter performance, while anticipating the fourth quarter will reflect continued customer assistance measures, normalization in care patterns and rising acuity as a result of missed and deferred treatments. We will continue to work proactively to help people obtain the care they need. Now, I will turn it back to Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. With the third quarter earnings report, we have at times provided some early soundings on our growth outlook. Even as the current environment is anything, but routine, I will still try to offer some useful perspectives. We approach the future with continued conviction on our long-term 13% to 16% earnings growth objective. Some of the factors giving us confidence include our rapidly expanding care delivery services now benefiting from over a decade of building and investing in local value-based care systems and extension into market leading post-acute home and modern behavioral health intervention services. Our ability to support seniors across multiple channels and markets was increasingly innovative high-value offerings. The way we meet the growing needs of people with highly complex conditions with comprehensive personalized care, including people across commercial, federal and state-based programs. The innovative and consumer response of products is now being offered through the employer and individual market channels. Our unmatched ability to support a more interoperable and intelligent health system as a result of significant investments over many years to improve performance, integrating data analytics and clinical information to provide essential insights to evidence-based next best care actions and our restless drive to allocate capital in line with other innovative companies as we lead in the development of the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. These are just a few of the accelerating capabilities which will enable our enterprise to serve more people much more deeply as we look to the years ahead. As to early thoughts on 2021, we expect our underlying business performance to be strong and well supportive of our long-term growth objectives, including the tailwinds we have highlighted throughout this morning. The pandemic and related economic impacts of course remain difficult to predict and at this distance likely represents a significant potential headwind. As a result, we envision stepping out initially with a more conservative all-in 2021 starting point to accommodate these still developing and unknown COVID-related impacts in particular the pacing of a return to more normal levels of care services and the condition of the economy. As the environment continues to evolve, we will also continue to evolve our thinking in perspective and it is our custom, we look forward to providing you further perspectives on all aspects of our business at our investor conference on Tuesday, December 1 which will be held virtually this year. Thank you for your time today. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just to pursue a little bit further the comments that Dave just made about thinking about next year, I guess predicting a medical cost trend you have got a lot of moving parts there, potential further deferrals, potential pent-up demand that could come back, cost of vaccines and therapies that could be there, a number of things and thinking about the cost trend for next year, how are you approaching that? How do you see a competitive environment that is changing as a result of that, just maybe flush that old comment about how uncertain the ability to predict the medical cost trend is for next year?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, A.J., a very thoughtful question. Hopefully, you took away from the prepared remarks that we are optimistic about the performance of our business and that\u2019s pretty much universal across Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We didn\u2019t get into some of the smaller size businesses, but we are optimistic in particular about our relative competitive position and the growth prospects for 2021. But as also indicated, we remain deeply respectful of the environment both the pandemic and related economic consequences. And one thing I would underscore, AJ, is what you had very well, there are a number of moving parts, which are very difficult to predict and you should also know that we are extending our efforts to ensure that our chronic members and patients are getting the care that they need during this unprecedented time and we also still have a strong commitment towards correcting any imbalances that could occur. So, at this instance, we do see our business \u2013 underlying business performing strongly and aligned to our long-term growth objectives, which are 13% to 16% per year offset in part by these pandemic-related effects. So the starting point, as we indicated in December, will likely represent a wider range given the possible outcomes and a more conservative all-in expectation than normal that you would normally see from us given all the elements that you just described. So, we are taking that into consideration as we develop our point of view about where our MLR might land, how \u2013 what the variability of that might be. We see it generally speaking that whole pandemic related impacts is being an area \u2013 a headwind for the organization, but don\u2019t misread it, we are very bullish on the strong underlying growth performance of our business. Thank you. Next question, please.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, fine.\nOperator: And next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a question on OptumCare, I guess and you are seeing big growth in the PMPMs there on the consumers served and I just want to better understand the relative performance sort of 3Q year-over-year versus 2Q kind of what\u2019s driving that increase in revenue per member? And then if you could also talk about sort of physician recruiting and how that\u2019s going over the last 6 months?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure, Josh. Great questions and I think you are hitting on one of the strengths of the enterprise and one of the reasons why we are showing growth for next year. Simply said it would be more market, more deeply penetrated into those markets and a higher percentage of them having a risk-bearing arrangement. But Wyatt, do you want to talk more fully?\nWyatt Decker: Yes, sure. Thanks, Josh and thank you, Dave. I think, Dave, you captured it well. What we are seeing is as we grow, we not only have increased the number of members we serve to 98 million, but we have increased by 25% the revenue per member and that\u2019s being driven in part by the more extensive services that we would offer somebody through a risk-based arrangement in OptumCare versus the lighter touch that you might see through some of the other businesses within OptumHealth. We expect that trend to continue and frankly are very excited about double-digit growth in our MA risk life and related fully [capitated][ph] lives that we serve. Another piece I would say, Josh, around your question about physician recruitment is we have seen continued robust interest in both small tuck-in acquisitions as well as medium and large physician groups who are attracted to both stability, the physician leadership and the evidence based approach that we have embraced in OptumCare. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Good question, Josh. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: We are going next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to circle back to the comments on 2021. First, from a consensus, in and around your 11% range for growth year-over-year [indiscernible] wondering if you think this will fall within that range at any point [indiscernible] to be in the breadth of the business?\nDavid Wichmann: Justin, we are having a hard time hearing you. If you are on a headset, can you pick up the handset?\nJustin Lake: Sure. Is this better?\nDavid Wichmann: No.\nJustin Lake: No, okay, hold on.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay.\nJustin Lake: Is that better?\nDavid Wichmann: It is. Thank you.\nJustin Lake: Sorry about that. So, what I wanted to do was circle back to the comments you made on 2021, first consensus earnings growth, I think I am curious to look like it\u2019s targeting around 11% year-over-year, still below your 13 to 16, wondering if you think that might your wider than typical guidance still might include that consensus estimate within the range? And then can you point us to the specific businesses where you are seeing, the potential impact of, call it in a recession concerns, maybe beyond just a typical commercial membership? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Fair enough. John?\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Justin. It\u2019s John Rex here. As Dave pointed out, I think we are quite confident in terms of the underlying growth of the organization as we look towards 2021 and kind of in a normal year, I would think kind of things like even [indiscernible] that consensus range that\u2019s the point would be kind of in a normal zone that one could expect an area that we would think about stepping out with. We are very respectful of the fact however as anything, but a normal year end. We have learned so much every month like I\u2019d tell you during this period over the last 6 months and in terms of how we operate, how our businesses perform, how we need to respond for the people we serve. And so we have continued to be in a respectful mode in terms of learning more, understanding the situation better and realizing there could be significant impacts in certain businesses as we think about \u2013 as we think about performance. So, we look at it in the world of excluding kind of this world we operate in today with kind of COVID-related impacts, a good zone where it fits, but you should expect that we think that there are potential headwinds within there, whether those are economic headwinds, whether those are factors in terms of what we need to do from a customer assistance perspective and really kind of really the pacing of direct COVID care and treatment costs. So, perhaps a longwinded way of getting asked we are in a mode still of really trying to be responsive to what we are seeing in the environment and evolve our thinking as that environment evolves. And Justin, I don\u2019t think I heard - picked up your second question, if you could repeat that one, it was just hard to hear?\nJustin Lake: Yes, what I was asking is specifically around the segments that could be impacted and most of all, I know COVID is a potential uncertainty, [indiscernible] in the market as a lot of companies are trying to price for that adding a little bit to trend. Is that something that you felt like you did for last year and you are just still being conservative, but you feel like that\u2019s something that\u2019s tough to do in this environment? Thanks.\nDirk McMahon: No, I mean, Justin, this is Dirk McMahon. How are you doing? What I would say is, we are of course going to price to our best estimates of forward trends that\u2019s going to include COVID, but you asked about the economic impact. So as we sat back and we looked at the third quarter, actually, our membership was a little less impacted than we thought it was going to be, because of things like the payroll protection program as well as some furloughs that large employers did. So yes, there will be a little bit of a running problem, but less than what we expected. So, from a membership standpoint, we are actually fairly optimistic about how we priced. We continue to look at how our block is priced for 1-1 and as we look at that, we are more than competitive and we monitor that everyday.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Justin. Great questions. Next question, please.\nOperator: We are next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning. John, you mentioned expectation for a decline in plan switching this year in the MA market, just curious did you make any color on why you expect that to be the case? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Just to follow-up, I think, what we \u2013 one of the things I commented on was actually we are seeing less plan switching to normal actually. And what we are seeing is strong adoption of people new to Medicare coming into Medicare Advantage.\nDavid Wichmann: Tim, anything to know?\nTim Noel: Yes, Frank. Thanks. Tim Noel. Good morning. Yes, what John alluded to is that what we have seen in the marketplace is a decline in people that are switching from one MA carrier to the next. However, a lot of strength in what we call the chooser market, which are folks that are newly eligible for Medicare or people that are choosing a Medicare Advantage plan compared to other coverage types throughout the course of the year. So, we have seen really good, strong demand in those categories, but the plan switching activity was lighter and in particular, in March and April, it\u2019s come back a little bit throughout the course of the year and actually, we have seen some better activity recently. So, the dynamic in the marketplace as we head into any enrollment period is one where we are trending back to an environment that\u2019s more normal compared to selling season in the past.\nFrank Morgan: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Frank. Next question, please.\nOperator: We are next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi, good morning. Question on the Medicaid side of the enrollment impact from higher unemployment is coming in lower than you expect. When do you expect the impact to peak? How do you think about the balance of going to Medicaid versus exchanges? And then on the Medicaid side, has the pandemic change how states think about transitioning to higher acuity populations to managed care fee-for-service and what type of visibility do you have for Medicaid rates for next year at this point of time?\nDavid Wichmann: Pretty much covered the entire landscape, Ricky, well done. We will try to be as responsive as possible on all of that. Tim Spilker is our Chief Executive for Community & State.\nTim Spilker: Yes. Hey, thanks for the question. And you are definitely hitting on a lot of the factors that we have been tracking. The first step just in terms of enrollment and Dirk mentioned this as is John in his opening comments so far what we have seen just in terms of enrollment gains is really the result of the suspension re-determination through the result of the CARES Act. We really have not yet seen unemployment pull through. And I think that\u2019s reflective of some of the dynamics that we are seeing in the commercial market. And that\u2019s been supported I think by a lot of external studies as well. So, we continue to watch this, I think we would expect that unemployment would pull through at some point, especially as the timeframe between lots of coverage increases. As for your second question, just around complex populations, yes, we are actively monitoring states as they explore transitions to managed care. We believe there is a very strong value proposition, especially for complex populations, including those that receive long-term care services and HCBS services. We know based on our experience that managed care can deliver significant value, not just in terms of cost savings, but also in terms of helping individuals remain in their homes, helping people access social services and support. And so we have been working with states and monitoring states activity as they transition. I think we are seeing a very robust RFP pipeline, as Dave mentioned and we are hopeful that many states include long-term care services in complex populations in those. And then finally, I think your last question was on funding and rates, and so just on that one, yes, this is something that we have also been working closely with our state customers on really to ensure that funding is sustainable both now and into 2021, especially considering all of the dynamics in play. States are really taking a rational approach to funding. They are leveraging the appropriate risk management mechanisms, depending on their experience that include risk corridors and MLR structures. They are also benefiting from some of the additional federal funding through the CARES Act. And then of course, just is a reminder, Medicaid funding must be actuarially sound, which our states really do continue to use as a guiding principle. This is certainly an area of focus for us. We have strong relationships with our customers and we feel good about those conversations thus far. And then maybe just the last thing I would say is sustainable funding. And all of this work is really critical as it enables us to invest in programs that really do drive substantial social and health outcomes for our customers as well as for the people that we serve.\nDavid Wichmann: So, Ricky, I hope that was responsive, at least responsive enough. Thank you for the thorough question. Next question, please.\nOperator: And the next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hey, good morning. Two part question just in case I strike out on the first one. I was wondering if you could quantify the consumer and customer assistance how that impacted the MLR this quarter? The second part of the question is just thinking about cost trend heading into 2021. I think by the time this year is all said and done, you might end up being on your on your core commercial group, cost trend down a couple of 100 basis points at least. So, when you are thinking about your guidance for \u201821, are you thinking it could be a normal cost trend on top of that? Are you thinking deferrals would accelerate it could be 200 basis points or more higher than normal, just interested in your thought process on how you are going to comp what was easier than expected all-in trend for 2020?\nDavid Wichmann: Well, I will give you the strike on the first one, because I don\u2019t think we are going to quantify customer and consumer assistance in the quarter. The one thing I would tell you is it\u2019s extensive in particular. This is one of the primary quarters where the Medicare business was offering full co-pay waivers on both primary care and specialist visits. And the reason for that, Gary, is that we were deeply concerned and remain deeply concerned that Medicare consumers access their physicians just as quickly as possible, because they are obviously managing chronic disease and we saw a very nice response to that program so much so that we are extending elements of it into the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s where our customer assistance will continue. In addition to that, we extended some other programs you probably saw that our $1.5 billion of initial estimate went to $2 billion and in part that was because of additional premium waivers and adjustments that we have made that will extend through the balance of this year and modestly into next as well. So that gives you a color for the kind of the volume, the quantity of things that were going on during that timeframe. And with respect to cost trends in 2021, Dirk you want to take?\nDirk McMahon: Yes, I would say, Gary, this goes back to what Dave said originally, we do consider all of those factors you described. We consider what we expect COVID to do with respect to testing, with respect to treatment, all things that are associated with abatement as well we make an estimate of that. We are tying to make a forecast of when the vaccines would come available. So, all those things are considered as we price our business for next year. I am not going to get into the exact number of basis points associated with each one of those that\u2019s competitive. But I mentioned earlier, we do monitor what\u2019s going on in the market, what we see with ongoing trends in all three of those buckets as well as all of the underlying cost. And we make our best estimate as to where we should land to be competitive for a membership growth standpoint as well as earnings standpoint. That\u2019s what we do and we have actuaries and we have management teams that are pretty experienced with that.\nDavid Wichmann: So, thank you for the question. Gary, next question please.\nOperator: We are going next to Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on Medicare Advantage for 2021 and the comments that David made around industry leading growth expectations and guess really just a two-part question to this just one, so we do have CMS projecting the at least 10% enrollment growth for individual MA for 2021. So, just interested in terms of your commentary in industry leading growth how you take that into context and whether that would support double-digit enrollment growth in individual MA for 2021? And then just secondly, it sounded like the comments around group MA, it sounded pretty bullish in terms of sales, just interested if you can maybe quantify for us the expected \u2013 the group MA lives that so far you think you have added for 2021? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Just to clarify, Scott, from at least my standpoint, what I really look at is the number of people served and what our performance will be relative to the market overall. And as has being pretty consistent over time, UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirement has outperformed on that metric in particular. What I like about this year in particular is what, not only the group MA component really coming off of what would be a disappointing year in 2020 meaning the 2021 actual policy year, but also the kind of setup for individual MA and continuation with our newly eligible members in their growth. So, that\u2019s the essence of the backdrop of the comment that I made. Tim, do you want add anything further?\nTim Noel: Yes, thanks, Scott. So, selling obviously starts tomorrow for individual Medicare Advantage. We have been marketing our products since the beginning of October, receiving really positive feedback from the broker community about how we are positioned. And once again, as you know, our top priority is providing stability and benefit for the members that we serve. And as they go to market, we are happy to have succeeded in providing that for our members and in fact about 75% of our members will experience improving benefits in 2021 compared to 2020. And then we also made some additional investments and capabilities to support seniors. So given that backdrop, we do feel really good about our positioning to gain share in individual MA, group MA as well as the dual special needs plans to market. We are not going to comment specifically on any point estimate for industry growth, but we really like our positioning from inside of the growth whatever that might be. And today\u2019s comments, we are really excited about our group MA growth for 2021.\nDavid Wichmann: Great, thank you, Scott. Next question, please.\nOperator: And next, we have Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRobert Jones: Great, thanks for the question. I guess maybe just wanted to get your latest thinking on participating in direct contracting next year, obviously, through OptumCare. I was wondering if this would contribute at all to your projections around global cap wise growth or would that be incremental? And then maybe just relatedly, how are you thinking about direct contracting relative to the opportunity obviously around MA on the UHC side? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Let\u2019s start with UHC.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Brian Thompson here. As it relates to Medicare Advantage, as you have known from us for a long time, we have had the enterprise perspective of modernizing fee-for-service, but we are certainly encouraged by any activities like this. We participate in things like bundled payment programs, etcetera. And I see direct contracting as a positive to try to modernize the overall fee-for-service system in total and why it obviously is looking at direct contracting to going to OptumCare.\nJohn Rex: Yes, thanks, BT and Robert, thanks for the question. We are very encouraged by every effort to move from fee-for-service to value based contracting. So use this as a positive trend. The direct contracting proposals are primarily geared towards smaller groups that are in fee-for-service. And we have been in risk based arrangements for over 10 years. And so while we will embrace this, where it\u2019s appropriate, we have relationships with over 80 payers, and we will expect to see continued double digit growth of our MA and dual risk lives that we care for. And I don\u2019t anticipate that the direct contracting would be a major factor for us. But again, I don\u2019t mean to say that in any kind of a negative way, it\u2019s a good program, but it\u2019s \u2013 we will embrace all vehicles to grow. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks for the question, Robert. Next question, please.\nOperator: We are going next to Sarah James with Piper. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSarah James: Thank you. I was hoping if you could give us some context around corporate tax reform looking back to 2018, you sized the benefit around $2 billion wondering where that sits now and if there is a difference between product lines and how we should think about which line benefited on a margin side versus was passed through for pricing changes or other items?\nJohn Rex: Sarah, good morning. This is John Rex here. So I think if we go back to the former period that you are discussing in corporate tax reform I think there are a number of things that we commented on during that period. And in terms of impacts and if you recall, during that period, we also commented about investments that we are making, as a result, to build to build for future growth and how we were how we were investing in the businesses for longer term. So that was an element there clearly, since that period, a number of years ago now the company is much, much larger. So you would expect the kind of that impact is much smaller from an effective tax rate impact than we would have had back in that in that time. among the other elements that you were talking to incorporate tax reform and impacts, I think it is tough, really to kind of get out ahead of anything in terms of potential impacts, and even how those impact down on specific businesses just because there has not been, we just don\u2019t really don\u2019t want to get ahead in any kind of policy that might be that might be out there. So probably would just leave it at that. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Sarah. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next is David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And I am interested in I appreciate the comments, several kind of percentage of baseline utilization numbers offered in the prepared remarks. I am curious how that has progressed perhaps through the quarter, for example, by the end of the quarter, were some of those at or above 100%? Are you expecting that to get to above baseline in the fourth quarter and based on your assessments of kind of pent up under utilization and system capacity? How long might you expect that to last and then just a tag on the DCP for the first couple of quarters of the year had been pretty consistent year over year, but at the third quarter is down, a couple days two to three days. I am wondering how that folds into that view of where utilization is going. Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Alright, David, John Rex, let me answer that I get those. So first of all, let me give you a little more color in terms of what we saw in utilization over the course of the quarter and how it fits to what we are seeing last quarter and so I spoke to kind of baseline exceeding 95% across our businesses as we look at the utilization at this point here, maybe a little color kind of context within that and different categories and how those would trend. I point out if I look at physician services that would be below that baseline, might post kind of outpatient surgery, that kind of the writer kind of in that zone, that baseline and I put in patient above that baseline zone, as we look down to kind of various populations and such maybe a little color commentary in terms of how that trends. So commercial, certainly kind of higher in terms of where we are seeing utilization and where we are seeing against baseline, and government programs services lower. And within that, I would say kind of within the government programs, let\u2019s say, the community state business being the lower element of both and that the way it\u2019s trending. One important element here you saw what you referred to from the commentary we had for our expectations for the fourth quarter and then so among those were that care that has been deferred that we are able to help facilitate that carrying curves and that\u2019s kind of where we are making investments and what we want to see happen here. The other element that we anticipate as we look towards the end of the year is we have been anticipating the rising acuity because of deferred and mistreatment, then we\u2019d see higher acuity population. I tell you we really haven\u2019t seen that yet. Where we see rising acuity on the overall book is it\u2019s because of the COVID-19 cases that come in at a higher acuity level. And so you see a higher acuity on that component. But if you take that component out, we don\u2019t really see it across the full scope of the book of our business at this point. As your \u2013 to your comment over in terms \u2013 over the course of the quarter what we saw, essentially it was an interesting course in that perspective, because you saw different incidence rates in different parts of the country over the course of the quarter. So, we really monitored that quite closely and you would see as a particular part of the country, you saw infection rates begin to rise, you would see deferral come into that mix. Given our platform across the entire country, we have a viewpoint into that, but you see deferral and then you see it come back in. I think the last thing \u2013 place I would just point out is within kind of that baseline that we are talking about and so I said exceeding 95%, I put kind of in the zone of 5 points or so or probably COVID-19 driven in terms of within that mix and that\u2019s inclusive in the baseline we are talking about.\nDavid Windley: And then DCP?\nJohn Rex: And DCP, thank you for reminding, so DCP is declining year-over-year, so that is due to the really could be acceleration in provider payments that we took on earlier in the year. So, as we really were trying to get liquidity injected into the healthcare system, we accelerated our payment cycles very, very significantly and that continues. The reason you wouldn\u2019t have seen that in the second quarter is because of the very significant deferral of medical care in the second quarter. So, that\u2019s kind of getting into the math of it, right. We get a denominator here, where medical cost per day was declining very, very significantly in the second quarter, so that more than offset the impact of those payments. As we saw care being restored much closer to normal levels this quarter, then that comes up and so now you are seeing the impact of that accelerated payment cycle show up in our DCP, but that was impacting.\nDavid Windley: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: And just to remind you, to give you a sense of that, as we indicated in the prepared remarks as well as around the $2 billion advance to the market or acceleration in payment. Thank you, David. Next question, please.\nOperator: And next is Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, hey, thanks for getting the question. Maybe if I could follow-up on that about utilization and then tie it back to sort of your comments around the outlook for \u201821. If it sounds like in-patient volume is a little bit above normal, others of areas are a little bit below and overall, let\u2019s say we are kind of getting back to a normal baseline utilization, given that kind of pace that we are on this year and then we think about next year, what is it in your thinking that makes you think that we are going see a really big uptick in utilization, because it sounds like when we go back to the earlier part of the Q&A when you are \u2013 in your comments, Dave and John at the end was next year you are thinking about a more conservative starting point to think about the \u201821 outlook and I understand that we would want to backup some of the one-time items that were positive for this year. But maybe help us understand a little bit what is your underlying assumptions for utilization, because it seems to me, the pace that we are going at, it doesn\u2019t strike me that we are going to really have really over utilization per se next year, maybe help us understand what maybe you are seeing here as we are now into part of the fourth quarter that kind of gives you that sense?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. So, my comments are really grounded in the unprecedented uncertainty as we look forward and the deep respect for the pandemic and its impact on the economic climate. And that\u2019s why as you think about being at this distance stepping out recognizing that as you are \u2013 as the kind of the future expectation, you would normally widen your range and you would probably take a more conservative posture. And that\u2019s essentially what we were trying to communicate. And John, do you have anything further to add?\nJohn Rex: No. Like, sort of the one thing in your comment and I think you said kind of we have seen in-patient kind of above normal, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s where we are. I said on that exceeding 95% baseline, I was orienting those categories around how they orient around that exceeding 95%, but in-patient rides a little above that position below that and outpatient surgery is kind of right in that zone. So, that\u2019s more the commentary that I was providing there not that in-patient is running above baseline yet. But we certainly categories are progressing to that. And I think it goes in terms of your broader commentary into what to expect for utilization. So, we want to make sure people get the care they need. That\u2019s why we are here ultimately. And so we are going to do everything in our power to make sure that that care occurs. But you heard some of the commentary he offered earlier in the year even in terms of what was going on different categories in terms of cancer diagnoses, different areas that were off significantly, obviously that\u2019s not kind of good for people, that\u2019s not good for the system, we want to make sure that we are that, that care is getting delivered. And there are areas of care that we are going to be very proactive in making sure that people are able to access that. In our business, we have both direct access in the OptumCare businesses. UnitedHealthcare is being very proactive in its outreach to vulnerable populations and making sure that they are getting the treatment that they need. So, our ambition is to make sure that that care is delivered as there is much \u2013 there is a lot of necessary care that\u2019s not happening also. But, I would come back today\u2019s commentary, as we look out to 2021 and some of the earlier things of we have been learning stuff all along the way over the past many months and we continue to evolve that thinking and continue to feel like we get better perspectives, and why deeply respectful in terms of, we don\u2019t really know how this moves over the next several months also. So, I think that\u2019s what you hear in terms of our commentary in terms of how we think, why we think, how we think about stepping out and why that we want to be respectful of environment frankly that no one has navigated before. And I think that\u2019s just what you would expect us to the way you would expect us to approach it. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: And we will take the next 30, 45 days or so to accumulate more facts, understand even better and then lay all this out for you in more detail to the best of our ability. I want to get together on December 1. We have time for one more question with quick question and answer. And then I will close. Next question.\nOperator: And we will take the question from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, just wanted to ask them for employer enrollment, how is that progressing in October and what\u2019s your outlook for 4Q and beyond? And if you can give any clarification in OptumRx on kind of the real sharp increase in revenue per script and some other compression in margin, that would be helpful, too? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Hey, Lance. I don\u2019t think we will be able to give you insights into October in the quarter specifically, but what we can give you insights into is what\u2019s the progresses we are making across the board in the commercial market going forward. I will give you some sense of that without quantifying it. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. I would say that, as you think about the fourth quarter, the sense should be is there is a good amount of stickiness with respect to the end of this year in terms of persistency that we are seeing with our groups. And further, I think as we look at next year, I think we talked about in the script, we will have lot of good products coming off the assembly line that we are very enthused about. All savers are level funded product, find a good product, which basically is a scenario where you have a kind of a base level of courage and you buy out for cares meeting in certain categories, then we have, what I would say a bunch of provider-centric products where we are looking at really efficient, high-quality networks and having low consumer out of pockets associated with those. So, what I would say is we are optimistic about our product portfolio for next year as you look at the third quarter \u2013 the fourth quarter specifically. We have had good stickiness in terms of our persistency.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, I think the commercial business is doing a nice job. Obviously, we are very dissatisfied with the start of this year, but I think they have come on stronger as the years progressed with a wider array of product choices and offerings, but also getting their cost structures in line and being able to reflect that in more competitive price positions in the market overall, again appropriately index the forward view of cost plus margin, which reflects the variability of the future marketplace. John, do you want to touch on?\nJohn Prince: Sure, Lance, John Prince. Talking about the revenue growth, we have had really strong growth in our specialty business as well as infusion, our community pharmacies which is a general one. That has been a big driver as well as our external client wins we had on the beginning of the year if you look at our services businesses such as those services as I mentioned we are going on the 30% inside that so really strong growth in that in terms of our margin and why its declined, year over year, it is really two factors, one, on earnings side of the impact of COVID-19. As we know with the pandemic, we have had less [indiscernible] in Q2 that continued in Q3, as well, as we have seen in Q3, less utilization per member as well as some loss and unemployment. So that is the impact of our earnings. And on the denominator side, the retail co payment, which was added to revenue in 2020, was added to the denominator which actually impacted the margin in Q3. Overall, we are quite pleased with our margin performance, as you see, between Q2 and Q3 earnings grew sequentially, by 16%, as well as in commitment to group of margins. So overall, we are seeing we are exiting very well. \nDavid Wichmann: Perfect. Thank you, John. Thank you, Lance. And thanks to all of you for your interest in the very thoughtful, insightful questions that you offered today. As this is an unprecedented time in our company\u2019s history. As you have come to expect, we will continue to respond and lead with full strength compassion and fortitude, restlessness for serving the unique needs of every one of the 140 million people we serve around the world. Despite the challenging times the 325,000 people in the UnitedHealth Group are deeply committed and are energized about our work to advance the next generation health system in a socially conscious way it is a health system that will be universal, affordable, simple and effective. And we look forward to engaging you in several weeks at our upcoming annual investor conference on Tuesday, December 1 we see the virtual format as an opportunity to provide you an even deeper view of our company with strategic plans, its people and our future. Thank you very much. \nOperator: And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

What I would say is, we are of course going to price to our best estimates of forward trends that's going to include COVID, but you asked about the economic impact. So as we sat back and we looked at the third quarter, actually, our membership was a little less impacted than we thought it was going to be, because of things like the payroll protection program as well as some furloughs that large employers did. So yes, there will be a little bit of a running problem, but less than what we expected. So, from a membership standpoint, we are actually fairly optimistic about how we priced. We continue to look at how our block is priced for 1-1 and as we look at that, we are more than competitive and we monitor that everyday. Yes, I would say, Gary, this goes back to what Dave said originally, we do consider all of those factors you described. We consider what we expect COVID to do with respect to testing, with respect to treatment, all things that are associated with abatement as well we make an estimate of that. We are tying to make a forecast of when the vaccines would come available. So, all those things are considered as we price our business for next year. I am not going to get into the exact number of basis points associated with each one of those that's competitive. But I mentioned earlier, we do monitor what's going on in the market, what we see with ongoing trends in all three of those buckets as well as all of the underlying cost. And we make our best estimate as to where we should land to be competitive for a membership growth standpoint as well as earnings standpoint. That's what we do and we have actuaries and we have management teams that are pretty experienced with that. Yes. I would say that, as you think about the fourth quarter, the sense should be is there is a good amount of stickiness with respect to the end of this year in terms of persistency that we are seeing with our groups. And further, I think as we look at next year, I think we talked about in the script, we will have lot of good products coming off the assembly line that we are very enthused about.

What we are seeing is as we grow, we not only have increased the number of members we serve to 98 million, but we have increased by 25% the revenue per member and that's being driven in part by the more extensive services that we would offer somebody through a risk-based arrangement in OptumCare versus the lighter touch that you might see through some of the other businesses within OptumHealth. We expect that trend to continue and frankly are very excited about double-digit growth in our MA risk life and related fully [capitated][ph] lives that we serve. Another piece I would say, Josh, around your question about physician recruitment is we have seen continued robust interest in both small tuck-in acquisitions as well as medium and large physician groups who are attracted to both stability, the physician leadership and the evidence based approach that we have embraced in OptumCare. Thank you."

            "name": "Tim Spilker",
            "content": "Yes. Hey, thanks for the question. And you are definitely hitting on a lot of the factors that we have been tracking. The first step just in terms of enrollment and Dirk mentioned this as is John in his opening comments so far what we have seen just in terms of enrollment gains is really the result of the suspension re-determination through the result of the CARES Act. We really have not yet seen unemployment pull through. And I think that's reflective of some of the dynamics that we are seeing in the commercial market. And that's been supported I think by a lot of external studies as well. So, we continue to watch this, I think we would expect that unemployment would pull through at some point, especially as the timeframe between lots of coverage increases. As for your second question, just around complex populations, yes, we are actively monitoring states as they explore transitions to managed care. We believe there is a very strong value proposition, especially for complex populations, including those that receive long-term care services and HCBS services. We know based on our experience that managed care can deliver significant value, not just in terms of cost savings, but also in terms of helping individuals remain in their homes, helping people access social services and support. And so we have been working with states and monitoring states activity as they transition. I think we are seeing a very robust RFP pipeline, as Dave mentioned and we are hopeful that many states include long-term care services in complex populations in those. And then finally, I think your last question was on funding and rates, and so just on that one, yes, this is something that we have also been working closely with our state customers on really to ensure that funding is sustainable both now and into 2021, especially considering all of the dynamics in play. States are really taking a rational approach to funding. They are leveraging the appropriate risk management mechanisms, depending on their experience that include risk corridors and MLR structures. They are also benefiting from some of the additional federal funding through the CARES Act. And then of course, just is a reminder, Medicaid funding must be actuarially sound, which our states really do continue to use as a guiding principle. This is certainly an area of focus for us. We have strong relationships with our customers and we feel good about those conversations thus far. And then maybe just the last thing I would say is sustainable funding. And all of this work is really critical as it enables us to invest in programs that really do drive substantial social and health outcomes for our customers as well as for the people that we serve."

            "name": "David Wichmann",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The past 9 months have hopefully provided you a window into both the values and capabilities of this organization and how they enable us to serve our customers, patients, care providers, team members and their families and you, our investors, in a period of unprecedented challenge. I am fortunate to witness up close the exceptional work of our team everyday, an innovative, growing and highly adaptable enterprise driven by the compassion, expertise and restless spirit of our 325,000 people, over 120,000 of them providing care on the frontlines. Our collective experiences over this year have made us an even more deeply committed and energized organization about our potential to help advance the next generation health system, one which is fair, affordable, simpler and effective. Our team combines division with sharp focus on day-to-day execution, delivering strong well-balanced results across the enterprise. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $3.51 per share with the decline from the year ago quarter reflecting the swift customer and consumer support actions we committed to from the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based upon this performance and forward estimate of pandemic impacts, we are updating our full year 2020 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $16.50 to $16.75 per share. In this, we remain committed to ensuring any financial imbalances arising from the pandemic are addressed proactively and fairly for those we serve. We have done this consistently over this period even as the ultimate outcomes remain unclear. As the timeliness of relief to our stakeholders is critical, service, fairness and performance with a long-term view, this is what you could continue to expect from us. You should also expect this enterprise will apply its innovative spirit to contribute in a new and different ways as our capabilities expand and circumstances require. We have partnered on and led clinical trials, helping resolve the nation's critical PPE and PCR supply chain issues and enabling more rapid testing at considerable scale, while keeping the health workforce safe. We are supporting state testing operations in California, New Jersey, North Carolina and Indiana and contact tracing in New York City. We are supporting the Mayo Clinic's development of convalescent plasma and some of the most promising vaccine and antibody trials. We have helped enabled workforce safety through the development of ProtectWell, a protocol processing technology to enable the safety of the health workforce as well as the safe opening of businesses, schools and nursing homes. We are working to assist with employees' health coverage transitions through our GetCovered campaign now being offered by employers to assist people who have lost their jobs. We provided $2 billion in liquidity relief for the health system and our customers and consumers will realize over $3 billion in premium and cost sharing relief, including $1 billion in estimated rebates. We have contributed more than $100 million of financial support and 6 million pounds of meals for communities suffering from food insecurity, homelessness, and health disparities. These efforts are possible, because we operate a capable set of businesses and capacities that are leading the development of the next generation health system and expanding our opportunities to serve. Today, I would like to give you a brief sense of this work. Early in the pandemic, we quickly enabled Optum physicians and the physicians of UnitedHealthcare's most vulnerable patients to adapt and expand rapidly to meet the needs of millions of patients for care of chronic and emerging conditions. This included advancing telehealth by creating direct connections between patients and their own physicians, a critical element to highly effective digital health, ensuring adoption will extend well beyond this crisis. So far this year, OptumCare physicians have facilitated 1 million digital clinical visits directly with their patients. And we are rapidly developing a proprietary set of distinctive tools and aligning our clinical practices to further develop and amplify this capability. I am sure you can see how advancing modern telehealth fits into our overall strategy to build high performing systems of care. Our growing therapeutics capacities are positively impacting the management of chronic diseases. With the introduction of Level 2, a digital therapy developed to improve the lives of the 30 million people with Type 2 diabetes, we are helping patients move toward remission of the disease. Level 2 uniquely measures signals and applies artificial intelligence engaging people in producing better health outcomes. You can expect more digital therapeutics from us in the coming months and years. Our growing capacities are especially apparent within our OptumCare platform, where 53,000 physicians across 1,500 local patient-centered facilities serve nearly 20 million patients, over 3.5 million of these in some form of risk arrangements, with 1.3 million Medicare Advantage or dually-eligible members under global capitation. OptumCare creates substantial value by building a deeper clinician patient relationship and by leveraging data and artificial intelligence to enable our clinical model to intercept and treat disease early and proactively leading to better health outcomes, value and industry leading patient experiences. Our patients are experienced safer, healthier, more fulfilling lifestyles, spending one-third fewer days per year on average in a hospital bed and 40% fewer days in a skilled nursing facility than patients supported by traditional Medicare fee-for-service. Moreover, our most advanced care delivery practices deliver this high-quality care at upwards of 40% lower costs than the equivalent traditional Medicare benefit, with the value fully reflected in improved benefits and lower costs for seniors all at world class NPS scores in the mid-70s. The proven clinical success of Optum Senior Care offerings supports our considerable growth goals for OptumCare and also demonstrates the longer term potential to greatly benefit consumers and commercial offerings. We have been building this platform for over a decade now and expect it to continue to grow at strong double-digit rates for years to come. Another aspect of a modern next generation health system is managing the specialized and costly medications of the future in a way which works for patients, clinicians, employers and payers. Our OptumRx integrated specialty solution brings a total approach to managing complex conditions across both the medical and pharmacy benefits, where we are able to generate up to 37,000 in annual savings per patient by employing clinically appropriate care at more convenient lower cost sites. This approach is enabled by Optum's growing footprint of integrated community pharmacies which will grow by over 60 centers in 2020 and the number of patients served with our infusion services will grow at double-digit rates. We expect this to be another durable growth trend given the much safer and clinically equivalent patient experience. We see OptumRx as continuing to transform to be a leader in pharmacy care services. Put differently, we believe the value for people and the system from pharmacy care services resides in managing personal engagement in health, not just supply chain management. This plays to our strengths and will increasingly contribute to the growth of OptumRx in the years ahead. UnitedHealthcare continues to focus on the very needs of healthcare consumers. In the next generation health system, we expect consumer benefits to become increasingly customized to meet these needs as people search for solutions which are simple, affordable and help enable quality outcomes. UnitedHealthcare see strong reception to our expanding suite of highly tailored and affordable individual coverages. This year alone, the number of people we serve with individual health coverage has grown by 15%. Likewise, an employer sponsored coverage, our growing set of consumer centered, innovative and flexible offerings such as bind, all savers and traditional line plans such as Harmony in Southern California are gaining traction, with membership in these offerings having grown over 50% this year. You know many of you are interested in the Annual Medicare Advantage enrollment period which opens tomorrow. The 2021 benefit year will be UnitedHealthcare's largest Medicare Advantage footprint expansion in 5 years, reaching an additional 3.2 million people in nearly 300 additional counties. We are emphasizing what we know seniors are looking for this year even more than ever, stability and value. Premiums for most people we serve will be flat or reduced and nearly 2.5 million people will have no premium at all. We continue to innovate our product offerings, with all Medicare Advantage plans featuring zero co-pay primary care digital health visits and the expansion of our personal support services, such as an annual clinical health assessment delivered in a senior's home and for many the assignment of a dedicated UnitedHealthcare navigator. We expect strong growth in individual MA and when combined with our group Medicare gains, 2021 is shaping up to be another year of market leading growth. We also expect continued growth in Medicaid due to transitions in coverage and net new market gains and are looking forward to a record RFP season as we seek to serve more people in more geographies. What I have described for you this morning is a sampling of the initiatives we are pursuing today to help lead in the development of the next generation health system, a health system that works better for everyone, those who experienced care, those who provide care and those who pay for care. Now, I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. Thank you, John. With the third quarter earnings report, we have at times provided some early soundings on our growth outlook. Even as the current environment is anything, but routine, I will still try to offer some useful perspectives. We approach the future with continued conviction on our long-term 13% to 16% earnings growth objective. Some of the factors giving us confidence include our rapidly expanding care delivery services now benefiting from over a decade of building and investing in local value-based care systems and extension into market leading post-acute home and modern behavioral health intervention services. Our ability to support seniors across multiple channels and markets was increasingly innovative high-value offerings. The way we meet the growing needs of people with highly complex conditions with comprehensive personalized care, including people across commercial, federal and state-based programs. The innovative and consumer response of products is now being offered through the employer and individual market channels. Our unmatched ability to support a more interoperable and intelligent health system as a result of significant investments over many years to improve performance, integrating data analytics and clinical information to provide essential insights to evidence-based next best care actions and our restless drive to allocate capital in line with other innovative companies as we lead in the development of the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. These are just a few of the accelerating capabilities which will enable our enterprise to serve more people much more deeply as we look to the years ahead. As to early thoughts on 2021, we expect our underlying business performance to be strong and well supportive of our long-term growth objectives, including the tailwinds we have highlighted throughout this morning. The pandemic and related economic impacts of course remain difficult to predict and at this distance likely represents a significant potential headwind. As a result, we envision stepping out initially with a more conservative all-in 2021 starting point to accommodate these still developing and unknown COVID-related impacts in particular the pacing of a return to more normal levels of care services and the condition of the economy. As the environment continues to evolve, we will also continue to evolve our thinking in perspective and it is our custom, we look forward to providing you further perspectives on all aspects of our business at our investor conference on Tuesday, December 1 which will be held virtually this year. Thank you for your time today. Operator, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you, A.J., a very thoughtful question. Hopefully, you took away from the prepared remarks that we are optimistic about the performance of our business and that's pretty much universal across Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We didn't get into some of the smaller size businesses, but we are optimistic in particular about our relative competitive position and the growth prospects for 2021. But as also indicated, we remain deeply respectful of the environment both the pandemic and related economic consequences. And one thing I would underscore, AJ, is what you had very well, there are a number of moving parts, which are very difficult to predict and you should also know that we are extending our efforts to ensure that our chronic members and patients are getting the care that they need during this unprecedented time and we also still have a strong commitment towards correcting any imbalances that could occur. So, at this instance, we do see our business \u2013 underlying business performing strongly and aligned to our long-term growth objectives, which are 13% to 16% per year offset in part by these pandemic-related effects. So the starting point, as we indicated in December, will likely represent a wider range given the possible outcomes and a more conservative all-in expectation than normal that you would normally see from us given all the elements that you just described. So, we are taking that into consideration as we develop our point of view about where our MLR might land, how \u2013 what the variability of that might be. We see it generally speaking that whole pandemic related impacts is being an area \u2013 a headwind for the organization, but don't misread it, we are very bullish on the strong underlying growth performance of our business. Thank you. Next question, please. Sure, Josh. Great questions and I think you are hitting on one of the strengths of the enterprise and one of the reasons why we are showing growth for next year. Simply said it would be more market, more deeply penetrated into those markets and a higher percentage of them having a risk-bearing arrangement. But Wyatt, do you want to talk more fully? Good question, Josh. Thank you. Next question, please. Justin, we are having a hard time hearing you. If you are on a headset, can you pick up the handset? No. Okay. It is. Thank you. Fair enough. John? Thank you, Justin. Great questions. Next question, please. Tim, anything to know? Thank you, Frank. Next question, please. Pretty much covered the entire landscape, Ricky, well done. We will try to be as responsive as possible on all of that. Tim Spilker is our Chief Executive for Community & State. So, Ricky, I hope that was responsive, at least responsive enough. Thank you for the thorough question. Next question, please. Well, I will give you the strike on the first one, because I don't think we are going to quantify customer and consumer assistance in the quarter. The one thing I would tell you is it's extensive in particular. This is one of the primary quarters where the Medicare business was offering full co-pay waivers on both primary care and specialist visits. And the reason for that, Gary, is that we were deeply concerned and remain deeply concerned that Medicare consumers access their physicians just as quickly as possible, because they are obviously managing chronic disease and we saw a very nice response to that program so much so that we are extending elements of it into the fourth quarter. So, that's where our customer assistance will continue. In addition to that, we extended some other programs you probably saw that our $1.5 billion of initial estimate went to $2 billion and in part that was because of additional premium waivers and adjustments that we have made that will extend through the balance of this year and modestly into next as well. So that gives you a color for the kind of the volume, the quantity of things that were going on during that timeframe. And with respect to cost trends in 2021, Dirk you want to take? So, thank you for the question. Gary, next question please. Just to clarify, Scott, from at least my standpoint, what I really look at is the number of people served and what our performance will be relative to the market overall. And as has being pretty consistent over time, UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirement has outperformed on that metric in particular. What I like about this year in particular is what, not only the group MA component really coming off of what would be a disappointing year in 2020 meaning the 2021 actual policy year, but also the kind of setup for individual MA and continuation with our newly eligible members in their growth. So, that's the essence of the backdrop of the comment that I made. Tim, do you want add anything further? Great, thank you, Scott. Next question, please. Let's start with UHC. Thanks for the question, Robert. Next question, please. Thank you, Sarah. Next question, please. And just to remind you, to give you a sense of that, as we indicated in the prepared remarks as well as around the $2 billion advance to the market or acceleration in payment. Thank you, David. Next question, please. Yes. So, my comments are really grounded in the unprecedented uncertainty as we look forward and the deep respect for the pandemic and its impact on the economic climate. And that's why as you think about being at this distance stepping out recognizing that as you are \u2013 as the kind of the future expectation, you would normally widen your range and you would probably take a more conservative posture. And that's essentially what we were trying to communicate. And John, do you have anything further to add? And we will take the next 30, 45 days or so to accumulate more facts, understand even better and then lay all this out for you in more detail to the best of our ability. I want to get together on December 1. We have time for one more question with quick question and answer. And then I will close. Next question. Hey, Lance. I don't think we will be able to give you insights into October in the quarter specifically, but what we can give you insights into is what's the progresses we are making across the board in the commercial market going forward. I will give you some sense of that without quantifying it. Dirk? Yes, I think the commercial business is doing a nice job. Obviously, we are very dissatisfied with the start of this year, but I think they have come on stronger as the years progressed with a wider array of product choices and offerings, but also getting their cost structures in line and being able to reflect that in more competitive price positions in the market overall, again appropriately index the forward view of cost plus margin, which reflects the variability of the future marketplace. John, do you want to touch on? Perfect. Thank you, John. Thank you, Lance. And thanks to all of you for your interest in the very thoughtful, insightful questions that you offered today. As this is an unprecedented time in our company's history. As you have come to expect, we will continue to respond and lead with full strength compassion and fortitude, restlessness for serving the unique needs of every one of the 140 million people we serve around the world. Despite the challenging times the 325,000 people in the UnitedHealth Group are deeply committed and are energized about our work to advance the next generation health system in a socially conscious way it is a health system that will be universal, affordable, simple and effective.

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Broadly speaking, third quarter results continued to be impacted by disrupted care patterns, albeit to a much lesser extent than in the second quarter, as many regions of the country stabilize near to more normalized levels. Within the quarter, care deferral impacts were more than offset by the proactive consumer and customer assistance measures we voluntarily undertook earlier this year as well as COVID-19 care and testing costs and broader economic effects. These factors resulted in a 10% year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings per share. As we discussed last quarter, the deepest period of care deferral, which occurred in the second quarter and the timing of that recognition of our assistance actions built entirely lining up, which makes for a more pronounced adverse impact to earnings in the second half of 2020. The measures we voluntarily undertook mostly impact our benefits businesses and contribute to the UnitedHealthcare's third quarter operating earnings decline from a year ago. In the quarter, we saw total care activity now exceeding 95% of seasonal baseline, with certain categories even more closely approaching normal. This compares to an overall measure of about two-thirds at the lowest point in the second quarter. Each of the three Optum businesses continue to perform well, while accepted in different ways by still recovering care patterns and economic effects. Optum helped third quarter earnings increase 12% year-over-year as fee-for-service practices and ambulatory surgery activity began to recover, while risk bearing practices still experienced some modest continual effects from deferral of care. Our SCA ambulatory surgery centers operated about 95% of seasonal baseline in the third quarter compared to 55% in the second quarter. Year-to-date, over 1,000 new surgeons, have performed procedures at FDA as they seek a safe, convenient and efficient clinical partner. New surgeon affiliations for the 9-month period rose nearly 25% over last year and we continue to expand the complexity of procedures performed in these settings, having added over 40 new service lines nearly doubled last year. Patients increasingly prefer these three family centers with NPS measured at 92. These durable long-term trends will benefit our growth even more strongly in the future as elective care activity fully normalized. OptumInsight third quarter earnings increased 24% year-over-year, while the revenue backlog grew by $0.5 billion in the quarter to nearly $20 billion. Payor services and state government businesses performed strongly, while we continue to see lower activity in the provider-facing businesses due to procedural volumes. While still not fully normalized, business development activity has increased from the second quarter's much lower pacing. OptumRx earnings declined 2% year-over-year in the third quarter as script volumes were impacted by lower care activity and economic factors. Personal scripts, which are correlated to a physician business activity, greatly improved from the second quarter, which was down about 25%, while not yet fully back to prior year levels. Revenues in our expanding pharmacy services businesses have grown nearly 30% year-to-date. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, third quarter operating results reflect a considerable moderation of the care deferral impact experienced in the second quarter, while it's still not at baseline levels. This was more than offset by our assistance measures, direct COVID-19 care costs and economic factors. The number of people served in commercial products declined primarily due to employer actions. Within this, for us, about 40% of the fee-based decline came from very large employers, primarily in the hospitality, transportation and energy sectors. During the third quarter, growth in Medicaid membership accelerated, benefiting from the continued easing of state re-determination requirements. We have not yet seen material Medicaid enrollment activity due to job losses and historically, these transitions lag loss with healthcare coverage by about 6 months. Our Medicaid business has seen strong year-to-date organic growth of over 500,000 people. Sales activity in Medicare Advantage has continued to move towards more normalized patterns after seeing some slowing in the second quarter due to the pandemic. Within this, we have seen considerably less plan switching than typical for existing Medicare Advantage enrollees, while selection of MA over fee-for-service for people new to Medicare is tracking well. We continue to deepen our engagement with those seniors most in need, increasing the distribution of remote digital sensor kits to collect and monitor vital health data and address gaps in care generated by the pandemic. Seniors continue to highly value our house call programs with the number of home visits in the third quarter growing by nearly 30% over last year. Our liquidity and financial position remains strong. Third quarter cash flow is up $3.1 billion or 1x net income reflects the extra federal tax payment in the quarter due to the deferral of payments typically paid in the second quarter. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations are $16.1 billion or 1.2x net earnings and our debt to total capital ratio of 39.1% compares to 43.7% in the year ago quarter. As noted earlier, we have updated our full year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $16.50 to $16.75 per share. This reflects third quarter performance, while anticipating the fourth quarter will reflect continued customer assistance measures, normalization in care patterns and rising acuity as a result of missed and deferred treatments. We will continue to work proactively to help people obtain the care they need. Now, I will turn it back to Dave. Good morning, Justin. It's John Rex here. As Dave pointed out, I think we are quite confident in terms of the underlying growth of the organization as we look towards 2021 and kind of in a normal year, I would think kind of things like even [indiscernible] that consensus range that's the point would be kind of in a normal zone that one could expect an area that we would think about stepping out with. We are very respectful of the fact however as anything, but a normal year end. We have learned so much every month like I'd tell you during this period over the last 6 months and in terms of how we operate, how our businesses perform, how we need to respond for the people we serve. And so we have continued to be in a respectful mode in terms of learning more, understanding the situation better and realizing there could be significant impacts in certain businesses as we think about \u2013 as we think about performance. So, we look at it in the world of excluding kind of this world we operate in today with kind of COVID-related impacts, a good zone where it fits, but you should expect that we think that there are potential headwinds within there, whether those are economic headwinds, whether those are factors in terms of what we need to do from a customer assistance perspective and really kind of really the pacing of direct COVID care and treatment costs. So, perhaps a longwinded way of getting asked we are in a mode still of really trying to be responsive to what we are seeing in the environment and evolve our thinking as that environment evolves. And Justin, I don't think I heard - picked up your second question, if you could repeat that one, it was just hard to hear? Just to follow-up, I think, what we \u2013 one of the things I commented on was actually we are seeing less plan switching to normal actually. And what we are seeing is strong adoption of people new to Medicare coming into Medicare Advantage. Yes, thanks, BT and Robert, thanks for the question. We are very encouraged by every effort to move from fee-for-service to value based contracting. So use this as a positive trend. The direct contracting proposals are primarily geared towards smaller groups that are in fee-for-service. And we have been in risk based arrangements for over 10 years. And so while we will embrace this, where it's appropriate, we have relationships with over 80 payers, and we will expect to see continued double digit growth of our MA and dual risk lives that we care for. And I don't anticipate that the direct contracting would be a major factor for us. But again, I don't mean to say that in any kind of a negative way, it's a good program, but it's \u2013 we will embrace all vehicles to grow. Thank you. Sarah, good morning. This is John Rex here. So I think if we go back to the former period that you are discussing in corporate tax reform I think there are a number of things that we commented on during that period. And in terms of impacts and if you recall, during that period, we also commented about investments that we are making, as a result, to build to build for future growth and how we were how we were investing in the businesses for longer term. So that was an element there clearly, since that period, a number of years ago now the company is much, much larger. So you would expect the kind of that impact is much smaller from an effective tax rate impact than we would have had back in that in that time. among the other elements that you were talking to incorporate tax reform and impacts, I think it is tough, really to kind of get out ahead of anything in terms of potential impacts, and even how those impact down on specific businesses just because there has not been, we just don't really don't want to get ahead in any kind of policy that might be that might be out there. So probably would just leave it at that. Thank you. Alright, David, John Rex, let me answer that I get those. So first of all, let me give you a little more color in terms of what we saw in utilization over the course of the quarter and how it fits to what we are seeing last quarter and so I spoke to kind of baseline exceeding 95% across our businesses as we look at the utilization at this point here, maybe a little color kind of context within that and different categories and how those would trend. I point out if I look at physician services that would be below that baseline, might post kind of outpatient surgery, that kind of the writer kind of in that zone, that baseline and I put in patient above that baseline zone, as we look down to kind of various populations and such maybe a little color commentary in terms of how that trends. So commercial, certainly kind of higher in terms of where we are seeing utilization and where we are seeing against baseline, and government programs services lower. And within that, I would say kind of within the government programs, let's say, the community state business being the lower element of both and that the way it's trending. One important element here you saw what you referred to from the commentary we had for our expectations for the fourth quarter and then so among those were that care that has been deferred that we are able to help facilitate that carrying curves and that's kind of where we are making investments and what we want to see happen here. The other element that we anticipate as we look towards the end of the year is we have been anticipating the rising acuity because of deferred and mistreatment, then we'd see higher acuity population. I tell you we really haven't seen that yet. Where we see rising acuity on the overall book is it's because of the COVID-19 cases that come in at a higher acuity level. And so you see a higher acuity on that component. But if you take that component out, we don't really see it across the full scope of the book of our business at this point. As your \u2013 to your comment over in terms \u2013 over the course of the quarter what we saw, essentially it was an interesting course in that perspective, because you saw different incidence rates in different parts of the country over the course of the quarter. So, we really monitored that quite closely and you would see as a particular part of the country, you saw infection rates begin to rise, you would see deferral come into that mix. Given our platform across the entire country, we have a viewpoint into that, but you see deferral and then you see it come back in. I think the last thing \u2013 place I would just point out is within kind of that baseline that we are talking about and so I said exceeding 95%, I put kind of in the zone of 5 points or so or probably COVID-19 driven in terms of within that mix and that's inclusive in the baseline we are talking about. And DCP, thank you for reminding, so DCP is declining year-over-year, so that is due to the really could be acceleration in provider payments that we took on earlier in the year. So, as we really were trying to get liquidity injected into the healthcare system, we accelerated our payment cycles very, very significantly and that continues. The reason you wouldn't have seen that in the second quarter is because of the very significant deferral of medical care in the second quarter. So, that's kind of getting into the math of it, right. We get a denominator here, where medical cost per day was declining very, very significantly in the second quarter, so that more than offset the impact of those payments. As we saw care being restored much closer to normal levels this quarter, then that comes up and so now you are seeing the impact of that accelerated payment cycle show up in our DCP, but that was impacting. No. Like, sort of the one thing in your comment and I think you said kind of we have seen in-patient kind of above normal, I wouldn't say that's where we are. I said on that exceeding 95% baseline, I was orienting those categories around how they orient around that exceeding 95%, but in-patient rides a little above that position below that and outpatient surgery is kind of right in that zone. So, that's more the commentary that I was providing there not that in-patient is running above baseline yet. But we certainly categories are progressing to that. And I think it goes in terms of your broader commentary into what to expect for utilization. So, we want to make sure people get the care they need. That's why we are here ultimately. And so we are going to do everything in our power to make sure that that care occurs. But you heard some of the commentary he offered earlier in the year even in terms of what was going on different categories in terms of cancer diagnoses, different areas that were off significantly, obviously that's not kind of good for people, that's not good for the system, we want to make sure that we are that, that care is getting delivered. And there are areas of care that we are going to be very proactive in making sure that people are able to access that. In our business, we have both direct access in the OptumCare businesses. UnitedHealthcare is being very proactive in its outreach to vulnerable populations and making sure that they are getting the treatment that they need. So, our ambition is to make sure that that care is delivered as there is much \u2013 there is a lot of necessary care that's not happening also. But, I would come back today's commentary, as we look out to 2021 and some of the earlier things of we have been learning stuff all along the way over the past many months and we continue to evolve that thinking and continue to feel like we get better perspectives, and why deeply respectful in terms of, we don't really know how this moves over the next several months also. So, I think that's what you hear in terms of our commentary in terms of how we think, why we think, how we think about stepping out and why that we want to be respectful of environment frankly that no one has navigated before. And I think that's just what you would expect us to the way you would expect us to approach it. Thank you."

            "content": "Yes, Frank. Thanks. Tim Noel. Good morning. Yes, what John alluded to is that what we have seen in the marketplace is a decline in people that are switching from one MA carrier to the next. However, a lot of strength in what we call the chooser market, which are folks that are newly eligible for Medicare or people that are choosing a Medicare Advantage plan compared to other coverage types throughout the course of the year. So, we have seen really good, strong demand in those categories, but the plan switching activity was lighter and in particular, in March and April, it's come back a little bit throughout the course of the year and actually, we have seen some better activity recently. So, the dynamic in the marketplace as we head into any enrollment period is one where we are trending back to an environment that's more normal compared to selling season in the past. Yes, thanks, Scott. So, selling obviously starts tomorrow for individual Medicare Advantage. We have been marketing our products since the beginning of October, receiving really positive feedback from the broker community about how we are positioned. And once again, as you know, our top priority is providing stability and benefit for the members that we serve. And as they go to market, we are happy to have succeeded in providing that for our members and in fact about 75% of our members will experience improving benefits in 2021 compared to 2020. And then we also made some additional investments and capabilities to support seniors. So given that backdrop, we do feel really good about our positioning to gain share in individual MA, group MA as well as the dual special needs plans to market. We are not going to comment specifically on any point estimate for industry growth, but we really like our positioning from inside of the growth whatever that might be. And today's comments, we are really excited about our group MA growth for 2021."

Talking about the revenue growth, we have had really strong growth in our specialty business as well as infusion, our community pharmacies which is a general one. That has been a big driver as well as our external client wins we had on the beginning of the year if you look at our services businesses such as those services as I mentioned we are going on the 30% inside that so really strong growth in that in terms of our margin and why its declined, year over year, it is really two factors, one, on earnings side of the impact of COVID-19. As we know with the pandemic, we have had less [indiscernible] in Q2 that continued in Q3, as well, as we have seen in Q3, less utilization per member as well as some loss and unemployment. So that is the impact of our earnings. And on the denominator side, the retail co payment, which was added to revenue in 2020, was added to the denominator which actually impacted the margin in Q3. Overall, we are quite pleased with our margin performance, as you see, between Q2 and Q3 earnings grew sequentially, by 16%, as well as in commitment to group of margins.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 15, 2020, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. When we last met in this forum 90 days ago, the challenges of COVID-19 in the Americas were just beginning to emerge. Now some four months into the evolving pandemic, the individual health system, social and economic implications of the virus are better understood and significant, especially the impact of longstanding health disparities affecting the underserved populations hit hardest by the pandemic.  In uncharted periods such as these, we lean on our mission and culture of values to guide us. That mission and those values call on us to help people, to help health systems, to help everyone with integrity, compassion, innovation, relationships, and performance. I am grateful to and proud of our 325,000 diverse team members as they continue to provide vital support, caring for those we serve and working with the health system partners to combat this disease and the many other daily health challenges that have not gone away, they\u2019ve just been deferred and possibly become more complicated. We deeply appreciate the tireless service of our 120,000 doctors, nurses, medical and behavioral professionals, social workers, pharmacists, and other healthcare workers on the front lines of care. They serve in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Portugal. They serve in New York City, Seattle, southern California, Phoenix, Texas, Florida, and other communities confronted by COVID-19. Their compassion for our patients and members has saved lives and helped make the lives of countless other people better. UnitedHealth Group was built to be adaptable, an instinctive enterprise capable of anticipating change, rapidly evolving and re-configuring capabilities to meet both challenges and opportunities. The past several months have only highlighted the importance of this agility so long core to how we operate, and deepened our resolve to cultivate it. We\u2019ve witnessed our people helping in ways and advancing innovations and solutions at an unprecedented pace, scope and scale.  Today, I\u2019d like to provide insights into how our business is both responding and advancing, share what we\u2019ve learned in the past several months, describe how these lessons enhance our ability to serve even more people more deeply, and as a result we expect to grow and emerge stronger in the years to come.  UnitedHealthcare and Optum have both experienced the effects of an unprecedented decline in healthcare services. Among early actions we undertook to help people were opening new enrolment periods so more people could be covered, waiving all consumer COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment costs, accelerating $2 billion in needed funding to care providers, and providing over $1.5 billion in direct consumer and customer assistance, including premium forgiveness and suspension of member cost sharing to help people manage their health conditions. These amounts are in addition to the $1 billion in estimated rebates to be paid in coming periods. Throughout this pandemic, we have taken extraordinary measures to ensure people get the essential care they need. As we speak with you today, care access patterns are nearing more normal levels, an encouraging sign for people\u2019s health. We see the system operating just short of its normal baseline now, far above the lows experienced as the second quarter began. We currently expect care access patterns, while somewhat more volatile than in the past, to moderately exceed normal baselines in the second half as people seek previously deferred care, and a pandemic with high testing and treatment costs per affected consumer is expected to continue to run its course throughout 2020 and into 2021. Consistent with the proactive actions we\u2019ve already undertaken, we will continue to act swiftly to address any further financial imbalances arising from the pandemic and related effects.  We are further advancing broad health equity initiatives tapping into our data, information and analytics capacities to guide scientific efforts to help eliminate longstanding health disparities. This is a course we have pursued for many years and are now even more intentional as we see underserved populations disproportionately impacted by this health crisis. We established an innovative community-based care model to provide COVID-19 testing, education and other necessary services to some of the highest risk and least served communities in the country. We are focusing on locations with high mortality along with local community challenges, including poverty, crowding, food insecurity, homelessness, and other existing social determinants of health. Our service includes special deployments in the underserved communities of Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Orleans Parish, alongside many other similar communities we serve through our core Medicare and Medicaid programs. We are researching new treatment approaches in partnership with prominent academic institutions. For example, working with the Morehouse School of Medicine, we\u2019re studying the effect of COVID-19 on those with sickle cell trait, a condition which is prevalent in 8% to 10% of Black Americans. We\u2019re conducting an ACE inhibitor virtual clinical trial with the Yale School of Medicine. Artificial intelligence applied to our data showed that seniors on ACE inhibitors who test positive for COVID-19 are 40% less likely to need hospitalizations than those who are not. Understanding that there\u2019s a significant racial disparity in the use of ACE inhibitors to manage hypertension, we\u2019re working rapidly to scale this 10,000 person virtual clinical trial, believed to be the first of its type. We\u2019re partnering with a growing number of state governments and employers who are using Optum\u2019s rapid response resources to stand up mobile and fixed testing sites. To date, we have helped conduct more than a half a million tests across more than 500 sites, most often in rural and underserved communities. We committed another $100 million in affordable housing to address homelessness, bringing our total investments to more than $500 million to build nearly 5,400 units over the past seven years, and we will do more, focused on working with others to eradicate longstanding health disparities in America and to create a more diverse U.S. health workforce. The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the adoption of new technologies and approaches to care. We\u2019re serving people where they want to be served and more often in the home, which is becoming a preferred additional care setting, through new innovative digital offerings. At peak care system closure in April, UnitedHealthcare facilitated more than 4 million digital care visits, the number of visits we enabled in January. We expect digital and homecare to persist and expand in coming years. We are rapidly assembling our next generation comprehensive platform, leveraging the digital signaling and monitor capacities of Vivify, the market-leading engagement capabilities of Rally, our AI-enabled individual health record, the pharmacy ecommerce capabilities of OptumRx on community-based clinical resources, and importantly a proprietary, scalable direct to your own doctor\u2019s telemedicine platform.  The understandable and expected rise in stress, anxiety and social isolation [indiscernible] services, digital platforms are proving to be increasingly effective in remotely diagnosing and caring for people with such needs with a rapidly expanding scope. Optum is among the largest providers of digital behavioral healthcare services in the country, now with more than 10,000 care providers using our virtual visit platform. Our digital psychiatry offerings extend to community behavioral health clinics and [indiscernible] and complements our more than 500 community-based behavioral health pharmacies.  Optum nurses are meeting the increasing need for infusion services in the comfort and safety of people\u2019s homes, [indiscernible] will accelerate for years to come, and our nurses offer fully equivalent clinical efficacy, greater patient convenience and satisfaction, and reduced risk of immuno-compromised people at up to one half the cost of traditional settings, and our house call services include extensive digital clinical care visits supplementing in-home visits by Optum nurses.  As clinical techniques and technologies advance, ambulatory surgical care is expanding as an appropriate care setting for high acuity members and procedures, like cardiovascular surgeries. Partly as a result of convenience, safety, and better patient and surgeon experience [indiscernible]. For example, in just the last two months, [indiscernible] new surgeons to our centers and have opened new and higher acuity service lines. We [indiscernible] this care model to accelerate. The recent months have served as a compelling example of why care delivery has [indiscernible] OptumCare continues as a physician partner of choice with over 6,500 additional clinicians, primarily PCPs, specialists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants added so far this year. These clinicians are seeking alignment with the entity best equipped to help move to high performing and more stable accountable debt entity is OptumCare.  These are a few example of how we have and continue to innovate to help make people healthier to help make health systems work better for everyone. The information and technology capacities of Optum, leveraged and deployed by United Healthcare and other payors in other health systems holds significant promise for the future of the U.S. health system.  Now I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you Dave. As expected, our [indiscernible] impacted by unprecedented and far reaching disruption in care patterns. We expect this temporary impact [indiscernible] by the proactive assistance measures we have already taken, the resumption of more normal care patterns, and future COVID-19 impacts both within the healthcare sector and the economy at large. Looking more specifically, Optum revenue and earnings for fee-for-service care delivery and the OptumInsight and OptumRx volume-based businesses [indiscernible]. For the company as a whole, this was more than offset by the disrupted care patterns within the United Healthcare and the Optum Health risk-based businesses.  Prior period development of $1.4 billion arose primarily from the lower than expected care levels in the second half of March, contributing to the lower medical care ratio this quarter. The impact of this care disruption is reduced by factors such as COVID-related treatment and testing and the financial assistance we are providing. Notably, the assistance component has a more [indiscernible]. For example, the suspension of member cost share will have an accelerating benefit and corresponding impact for the people we serve as care delivery systems further reopen and they seek care again.  At the lowest point in April, in-patient care inclusive of COVID-19 related care was [indiscernible]. In June, this recovered to nearly 95%. At the same lowest point, outpatient and physician services fell to roughly 60% of normal levels. As we exited [indiscernible] tracking above 90%. These national trends [indiscernible] even as certain states are seeing short-term deferral of services where there are elevated levels of infection and hospitalization.  [Indiscernible] each of the three businesses performed well, while they were affected in different ways by care deferral and the economic downturn. Second quarter earnings increased 22% year-over-year. The impact of the lower patient [indiscernible] mostly offset by the same temporary deferral of care effects on [indiscernible]. OptumInsight second quarter earnings increased 7% year-over-year while the revenue backlog grew by nearly $1 billion to $19.4 billion. Many of OptumInsights payor and care provider clients have volume-based contracts for technology and managed services. After an expected slowing of such volumes early in the second quarter due to care deferral, we\u2019re now seeing activity rebound and [indiscernible] again, as evidenced by the new partnership with Boulder Community [indiscernible]. OptumRx earnings declined by 6% year-over-year in the second quarter as script volumes were impacted by [indiscernible]. Unsurprisingly given the sharp drop in primary care and specialist visits, first fills of prescriptions declined by about one-third early in the second quarter, but began to recover as the quarter progressed and have continued to do so as care activity increases.  Turning to UnitedHealthcare, second quarter operating earnings were significantly higher due to the temporary care [indiscernible] continue to serve more people through our public sector and senior businesses, including an increase through the second quarter of nearly 600,000 people year to date. As [indiscernible] commercial enrolment declined, albeit [indiscernible] might have suggested [indiscernible] for furloughed employees.  During the second quarter, growth in sales of individual polices and Medicaid membership accelerated, the latter as states eased redetermination requirements to ensure sustainable coverage for people. We were also awarded contracts to serve Medicaid members in Kentucky in 2021, serve the Medicaid population in Indiana, and are pleased to continue serving in Philadelphia. After a strong annual enrolment period for Medicare Advantage, the pacing of new enrollees in April and May eased as traditional in-person sales slowed. Sales have accelerated with the current level of Medicare Advantage enrollment activity having rebounded to [indiscernible]. Our liquidity and financial position have remained strong [indiscernible] reached $10 billion or 1.5 times net earnings. Both cash flows and days and clients payable were impacted by the swift moves we undertook to provide enhanced liquidity by accelerating payments to individual care providers and health systems. Offsetting this impact was the timing of second quarter income tax payments, which will now occur in the third quarter. As noted in our press release this morning, we are maintaining our full year earnings per share outlook in anticipation of the delivery of previously deferred and potentially even higher acuity care as well as continued costs to address COVID-19 in the second half of the year. We are encouraged by the rapid pacing of the reopening of care delivery systems and are proactively working to help people quickly obtain the care they need. In addition, we incorporate a second half view for a more pronounced impact from the consumer, customer and care provider assistance initiatives already undertaken. As Dave stated, we will act to address further imbalances, should they arise over the duration of this pandemic. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you John. Today in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, foremost on our minds is the safely of our team members and their families and the need to continue adapting rapidly, innovating and delivering for those we serve. [Indiscernible] begin to focus at this time on what will come in 2021 and beyond. At this distance, the evolution of the pandemic, when and to what extent the economy will improve are very much open questions. We expect the macroeconomic impacts of the broader unemployment and actions we have taken to assist customers and communities to continue well into next year. Helping our customers through an unexpected macro environment and the extended impact from disruptions in care has and will continue to be an area of intense focus for our business leaders and care providers. During this period, our diversified businesses are creating unique opportunities to serve, and we don\u2019t believe these are just passing trends. They bring more effective clinical outcomes, satisfaction and convenience for people at lower cost, a significant contribution to the next generation health system, one that operates in a socially conscious way. These are accelerating and durable trends, well supportive of our 13% to 16% long-term growth objective in the years to come.  Public sector and senior benefits programs, our care delivery businesses, our digital and at-home based initiatives, pharmacy care services, data and analytics, and health banking and payment platforms will continue contributing as significant growth factors long into the future.  Thank you for your time today. Operator, can you please open the lines for questions? \nOperator: [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. Wanted to follow up on your comments on second half medical costs. You talked about getting back to about 90% of typical in June, or a little above 90%, and you\u2019re expecting north of 100% of second half, so was hoping you could put some numbers around a few things. First, how much above normal do you expect to be in the back half of the year, how much of a headwind do you expect the patient and client give-backs to be in the back half in terms of the headwind MLR, the impact to MLR, and then can you talk about how you price in 2021 in terms of utilization? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, well maybe we\u2019ll start with John and then as it relates to 2021, I\u2019m sure you can talk about the commercial markets, and we\u2019ll have Dirk address that. \nJustin Lake: Medicare would be great as well, Dave. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, John Rex here, Justin. Just a few comments here in terms of medical cost ratio and the impacts of customer assistance and how they flow through the year. Yes, you are right - clearly we expect higher than historically normal medical cost ratios as we move into the second quarter of the year, and that\u2019s certainly implied in our maintained guidance view. You can see as you look at it versus historical levels of a typical second half, we\u2019re running in the zone of a couple hundred basis points above what we would consider kind of historical medical cost ratios in the second half of the year, to kind of give you a little color in terms of how that flows through. In terms of the customer assistance initiatives and how those play out, among some of the more significant customer assistance initiatives that we are taking on are the waiving of co-pays for seniors for both primary care and very importantly on the specialist component, as that\u2019s a very significant burden for seniors. Those really have much more impact as we get into the second half from the perspective of as care delivery systems reopen, that\u2019s when those costs will be incurred, so you\u2019re incurring those costs as seniors and people are really accessing that care, and that\u2019s where the assistance component comes in. That component, which is one of the more significant components of the customer assistance initiatives we\u2019ve undertaken, is really more weighted to the back half of the year than the first half of the year.\nDavid Wichmann: Great, thank you. Then as it relates to pricing, I think we\u2019ll start with Medicare with Tim Noel and then we\u2019ll go to commercial with Bill Golden. Tim?\nTim Noel: Morning Justin, Tim Noel, thanks for the question. As we talked a little bit last quarter about pricing for 2021 in Medicare, and as a reminder, pre-COVID we talked about total revenue related items roughly on part with our estimates of forward trend, and we also have the repeal, the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax in 2021, so if you take those things, all else equal we would expect that 2021 to be a benefit investment year on the Medicare Advantage. Certainly COVID creates some challenges with diagnosis collection, given the utilization patterns that we\u2019re seeing and talking about, and also CMS has not provided any discrete adjustments in the final notice to account for that, nor have they done anything since. It\u2019s still too early to get specific on our bid offerings for 2021. Bids aren\u2019t final, nor are they public; but again, our top priority is providing stable and reliable benefits for the members that we serve, and we feel really good about 2021 and expect to continue our multi-year momentum in Medicare Advantage. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks Tim. I\u2019d just add to that, I think the way the year is setting up, and I know it\u2019s relatively early, but in terms of the overall positioning is to continue the pace of growth that we have been seeing across the individual Medicare Advantage lines, and then obviously we\u2019re deeply focused on the group Medicare market and growth there as well. Bill Golden, do you want to handle commercial?\nBill Golden: Sure, thanks Dave, and thanks for the question. We\u2019re going to continue our longstanding approach to pricing - you know, we\u2019re disciplined and we\u2019re pricing to our best estimate of future cost trends. We have extensively modeled the potential impact to covid-19, including our testing and treatment costs, potential vaccine costs, and costs that will be expected to be deferred into 2021, which includes the potential higher severity because of the deferred care and also the potential for continued depressed demand for healthcare services in some regions and states. All this is built into our forward view of medical cost trends, and we\u2019re working very closely with our customers right now into August as we start to put out our renewals for 2021. Our clients are really expecting and appreciating consistent and stable pricing from us.  Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you Bill, and thank you Justin for your question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to talk a little bit about the impact on the physician side and Optum Health, OptumCare, specifically the recruitment of physicians and maybe how that\u2019s changed. I think there was an allusion in the press release to maybe an acceleration of bringing in more primary care and maybe some talk on specialty. Then can you flesh out sort of within that, within OptumCare, the impact was a lot lower than I think we had expected. I heard John mention the risk-based entities offsetting the fee-for-service entities. Can you just give us a magnitude on that and how much the UnitedHealthcare payments impact, sort of how did OptumCare hold up so well?\nDavid Wichmann: Good questions, Josh, appreciate them. We did try to lean into this a little bit in the script in terms of giving a general impression that there\u2019s a kind of movement afoot of physicians, advanced practice clinicians towards stable models that allow them to preserve their independence practice at the top of their license, achieve the triple-A in the healthcare, and we\u2019ve clearly seen that. Then we\u2019ve also, as you probably can suspect, had a fair agenda around inorganic build to access new geographies, and we\u2019ve made a decent amount of progress on that front during this time frame as well.  But I think I\u2019ll send it to Wyatt Decker here, he can talk a little bit about the value proposition of OptumCare and what people are seeking at this important time, and why this model is the one that they are pursuing. Wyatt?\nWyatt Decker: Dave, thanks, and Josh, thanks for the question. You\u2019re absolutely right, Dave - we have seen continued interest and growth in our OptumCare model, which has become really the nation\u2019s predominant physician-led, value-based, patient-centered ambulatory medical practice. That may sound like a mouthful, but it\u2019s really focused on doing what\u2019s right for patients, delivering care in both more convenient and lower cost settings in a value-based construct, keeping the patient at the center of everything we do. We\u2019ve seen, to the second question, Josh, around the performance of OptumCare, we\u2019ve seen that our large geographic footprint combined with our both risk-based and fee-for-service model has created substantial resiliency in the business, and as John Rex mentioned, we saw some countervailing financial performances when fee-for-service got quieter during the peak of the pandemic. We\u2019re now seeing very rapid recovery in part because of our tremendous support of our frontline providers. The other piece that I would want to underscore is our incredible gratitude to our frontline providers that have done an incredible job caring for both COVID patients and helping us effectively navigate through this complex pandemic. Your first question around ongoing recruitment of physician groups and individual physicians, your implied assumption is correct - we are seeing substantial interest in our practice model as well as in becoming part of OptumCare, and this is part of a multi-year trend that we have continued to grow, and as you know, we have relationships with multiple physician groups that are either affiliated or employed today, over 52,000 doctors in both categories combined, and we have seen continued interest and expect a pipeline of affiliated and employed physicians to grow robustly. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you Josh, appreciate your question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Well go next to AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAJ Rice: Hi everybody. Maybe just to ask, a number of your business lines - commercial, large group commercial, OptumRx and OptumInsight are driven by large RFP activity, and I wonder--I think last time you had alluded to the fact that especially in OptumInsight, some of that RFP activity had been put on hold. Can you comment about how it\u2019s returned to normal? Is this going to end up being a normal year in those segments, or are you seeing people put off for a year making large decisions until there\u2019s some clarity around what\u2019s happening with the pandemic?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure, well why don\u2019t we give you color from a number of different angles here, AJ. We\u2019ll start with Dirk to give you a sense of what\u2019s going on with UnitedHealthcare and their self-funded business and the RFP activity there, and maybe even as it relates to some of the government programs based business, then I\u2019m going to pivot over to John Prince to talk about Rx, and then Robert Musslewhite to comment on the activities in the market segments of OptumInsight. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Yes, thanks Dave. AJ, hi. As I look at national accounts and I think about this selling season, what we really saw was that we\u2019re about 60 days behind normal in terms of people making decisions for 1/1/21. As we sit here today, not all the decisions have been made, and as we handicap our wins and losses, what we expect will be roughly flat to a little bit up in terms of group wins and losses for 1/1/21, but really the tale is going to be told with respect to national accounts as to what attrition occurs throughout the remainder of the year.  I think that\u2019s really it. I would say in terms of general RFP activity, I think I would say that in national accounts, these sorts of things just progressed, just at a little bit slower than what we had seen previously.  As it relates to Medicaid, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim Spilker, who will just give us quick thoughts on the RFP activity in \u2018caid.\nTim Spilker: Yes, thanks Dirk, and thanks for the question. Yes, we\u2019re excited about the activity that we\u2019re seeing. As we mentioned earlier, both Kentucky and Indiana were really nice wins, and of course we were thrilled to see that North Carolina finalized its Medicaid funding for a 7/1/21 start. So understandably, as you suggested, states have delayed some of their procurement timelines, but overall we\u2019re starting to see those pick up here over the next couple of months. We believe our value proposition is strong and well positioned for growth, and we\u2019ll be ready for those procurements as they come through.\nDavid Wichmann: By the way, that was Tim Spilker. He\u2019s our new CEO of Community & State. You probably recall that Heather Cianfrocco was the former CEO. She was promoted to oversee Optum Health\u2019s health services sector as its leader, and as you might suspect, we are positioning some of our strongest leaders into the Optum Health segment given the rapid growth expectations of that business over the next decade or so.  Maybe just touch on group Medicare too. Brian Thompson, you want to touch on that?\nBrian Thompson: Yes, thanks Dave. As we look forward, group Medicare Advantage is shaping up to be a very strong year to 2021. Obviously a lot of large customers looking for value as they go through this time, and we\u2019re really encouraged by a strong pipeline and some wins, and feeling very good about next year in that space as well. \nDavid Wichmann: Yes, the team has done really well in the government program space around growth, and they have a substantial amount of momentum and continue to capitalize on that momentum going forward. John Prince, you want to touch on Rx?\nJohn Prince: Sure. Hey AJ, it\u2019s John Prince. As you know, in the OptumRx business we\u2019re in the middle of our selling season right now. We continue to have a very healthy pipeline and are very excited about the opportunities in the market. In the first half of the year, we had some good wins, especially in the commercial market, the labor market and the health plan market. As we pivot to the back half of the year, we\u2019re more in the smaller size opportunities. As we look to the big opportunities we\u2019re pursuing right now, most of them are for 2022 selling season, so there is a robust pipeline for 2022. As you know, in the health plan business, this is the time frame where they make those types of decisions. In terms of movement in the market, we\u2019re going to see less movement in the 2021 selling season, as we have seen in previous years. Overall, I think our retention is going to be very strong, as it has been for the last four years. We\u2019re going to be tracking to the high 90s, as we\u2019ve been tracking before, so we\u2019re going to see strong growth. I think our story is resonating in the market. We\u2019re seeing strong focus on client affordability, our tools around making sure members stay healthy and get healthy, and creating a great client experience, so overall strong growth in the market. \nDavid Wichmann: Then I\u2019ll ask Robert Musslewhite to round it up here, really talking about both the activity with health systems, who have been extremely busy, and then also with health plans.\nRobert Musslewhite: On the provider side of the business, and thanks AJ for the question, we have felt like while there\u2019s certainly been some disruption during the quarter in some of our smaller technology deals, on the larger deals the pipeline continues to be strong and interest remains high. Given what\u2019s happened with health systems during the quarter, we think that these larger comprehensive partnerships will continue to be very attractive to health systems that align with us across our commitment to total cost of care reductions and affordability, patient quality, and consumer centricity. These types of partnerships, as we\u2019ve seen in the past, not only help mitigate liquidity and cash flow issues in the near term, but importantly accelerate the broader transformational clinical and structure work in the medium and longer term. In that light, we\u2019re particularly pleased to be, having announced yesterday our partnership with Boulder Community Health, which is again a comprehensive new relationship focused on multiple things, including and importantly sharing outcomes in the clinical domain, and really see this as indicative of the broader pipeline that we see across our health system clients. We feel very good about the ability to continue to support them there. On the payor side, again a similar story. Obviously there have been places during the quarter where we\u2019ve had some impact on payors\u2019 willingness to step forward with large deals, but still feel very good about the pipeline going forward where we\u2019re able to provide a lot of value and support to our payor partners going forward, and feel good about the pipeline there in the second half of the year.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you Robert. AJ, hopefully that was responsive. Thank you for the question.  Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open. \nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking questions. Just wanted to follow up on someone\u2019s earlier question. If we think about the additional billion dollar and premium rebates you guys are looking to push out, should we think about that as a starting point for additional rebates, and what\u2019s the timing as we think that runs through the P&L? As we think about that, are there some states, I think that are excluded since--you know, we\u2019ve spoken with some experts, they suggest some states have anti-kickback or anti-rebate rules that limit your ability to rebate premiums back intra-year. Can you give us some thoughts around that, how that kind of plays out across your business? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Sure, so the additional billion--or the billion in premium rebates is a best estimate at this point in time. As these things move and we continue to deal with the evolution of the pandemic, as well as the impacts on the economy, that number will shift around. It\u2019s required to be reflected in your results on a current term basis, so it\u2019s reflected in the results that you see so far year-to-date, so it\u2019s already through.  Then as it relates to rebates, yes, there are anti-kickback rules, and all those things we have a very complex set of engagements that we need to make with insurance commissioners and others to make sure that we can return these funds. We have engaged in that and have been successful at getting concurrence with them around providing these rebates. Obviously it\u2019s a lot easier to give money back than it is to ask for new, and so they\u2019ve been very receptive and very collaborative and extremely appreciative that we were as proactive as we were and as early as we were in providing needed relief to our commercial members, as well as the actions that we took on the Medicare front. Thank you for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRobert Jones: Great, thanks for the question. Maybe I just wanted to ask on dis-enrolment, enrolment in the commercial and Medicaid books. It seems like the heightened unemployment environment has obviously having an impact on commercial enrolment, so I was hoping maybe you could share your thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about this enrolment in the commercial book in the back half.  Then relatedly, do you feel that so far you\u2019ve been able to capture commensurate market share on the increased Medicaid market, particularly as we think about recent evidence that previously furloughed employees are becoming more permanently laid off and potentially, obviously, entering that Medicaid space?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, so what we\u2019re seeing so far is a lot of furloughs versus layoffs to reduce costs in the short term. In many cases, clearly this allows them to maintain medical benefits throughout. What also has benefited our overall enrolment is the impact of the stimulus actions. The impact on commercial enrolment hasn\u2019t been as great as we would have otherwise thought based on the unemployment data, just because of the stimulus as well as the furloughs. We\u2019re looking and we\u2019re continuing to work with our broker partners and with our employers to try to find folks--to try to find other coverages for folks if they don\u2019t stay in commercial.  What I would say is in the Medicaid space, what we\u2019ve seen so far is the redeterminations have been put on hold, so we\u2019ll see. People go to our commercial products as we--our individual products as we pace forward, and we have a fairly broad commercial and individual products as well, so we may be able to recapture our share, but there\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s going to be sort of delayed impact because of the stimulus actions and it will be a little bit more pronounced in the second half, but we think we\u2019ve held our own so far. Thank you Robert. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. [Indiscernible] cost shifts between \u201920 and \u201921. How much of the [indiscernible] \u201920 versus \u201921, is there any SG&A that can be pulled forward into \u201920 from \u201921, and are you making any changes in completion factor assumptions? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: John Rex?\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Sarah, how are you doing? A few things, comments on that in terms of just thinking about how those costs play out. I guess I\u2019d first point out, as you can appreciate, we\u2019re quite respectful of the highly fluid situation and mindful of how rapidly the situation is evolving. [Indiscernible] sets up a view that as the maintained earnings outlook would imply [indiscernible] the carrier that we had expected to be delivered in 2020, you know, we look into the back half of the year. [Indiscernible] that way or not, or whether as you suggest, some of that moves into 2021 also is in part a component of how quickly systems, health delivery systems reopen and how fully they stay open, and also just the consumer preference in terms of their comfort of going into these settings. All those are elements that play out in this thing, so we\u2019re being quite respectful of that situation as we look forward on that and how that plays out into \u201921. Certainly some of that could end up in \u201921. In terms of cost, I think what you\u2019re referring to is investments that we would choose to make being heavily, and we\u2019re investing heavily in part in response to COVID-19 and in response to the pandemic. You probably saw some of that even in our operating cost ration this quarter in terms of the investments we\u2019re making on a current period basis to serve people and to enhance and strengthen our capabilities as we look forward. Those are the main components that I\u2019d point out in terms of how we\u2019re acting and how we\u2019re looking ahead to serve.\nDavid Wichmann: And Sarah, one of the things we did was we maintained our full workforce, so nobody\u2019s been laid off or furloughed or dismissed because of COVID-19, and in part because we knew that on the other side of this initial activity that the health system would come back online and consumers would be accessing care, so we needed to make sure that we were prepared to respond to the market demands just as quickly as possible.  Because of all that, the service through this time period, we [indiscernible] virtually all the lines of business at Optum and the same thing with--I\u2019m sorry, UnitedHealthcare and the same with Optum. We\u2019ve seen a nice improvement, so we\u2019re making sure that we utilize this time well and make those investments provide the right kinds of returns, so that we\u2019re creating additional trust with the marketplace. I think that\u2019s playing out nicely.  Thank you for your question, Sarah. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Interested if you can talk a bit about the NaviHealth deal and give us an update maybe on your broader post-acute strategy. Just in particular, interested around whether you would envision Optum moving further to continue to acquire more direct home health and provider assets, or whether you would see the strategy for post acute being more of a convener, like NaviHealth is right now. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: I think a little bit of both. Wyatt?\nWyatt Decker: Yes Scott, thanks for the question. First, I would tell you how excited we are and pleased we are to welcome the team of NaviHealth to Optum United Health Group. Second, I would say just to frame it, when you look at seniors in the United States, there\u2019s over a $60 billion spend in the post acute space, which historically has not been well managed both in terms of the patient experience and expenses. We think there is a tremendous opportunity, and you can look forward with NaviHealth as well as our own capabilities and our colleagues at Sound Physicians, which is a hospital staffing group focused on hospitalists who are very engaged in the post acute transition, to continue to build capabilities to help both patients and people manage that post hospitalization period with the best outcomes and the best experience. More to come, but we\u2019re very excited about this combination of our colleagues at NaviHealth.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, we leaned in a lot to the digital activities and the way in which we\u2019re engaging or assembling our resources across our company to really create a unique and distinctive home clinical experience. That includes the engagement of our physical resources, our nurses that already go into homes, so I could see us very much being a home through ambulatory, surgical capacity company. As it relates to the home in particular, our interest would be primarily in deploying skilled health services, so we would not be as inclined around the other home-based care services around ADL management and things of that nature. We probably would continue our focus on skilled clinical resources.  Thanks for the question, Scott. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. My guess is that at this point, you\u2019re not going to give a point estimate, but just want to conceptually understand about next year\u2019s earnings. This year, you\u2019ve done a lot to make sure that you don\u2019t capitalize on COVID, making sure that you serve the customers and the providers to make sure that you\u2019re not earning more than what your guidance was going to be this year. As we think about next year, is there conceptually any reason why you wouldn\u2019t expect to be earning target margins on your different products? If we\u2019re still hitting a recession but didn\u2019t have COVID, would you expect to be hitting the same kind of margins you normally would in a scenario like that, or is there any reason to believe that next year\u2019s margins across your businesses would be somehow different than normal?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, it\u2019s really hard to tell. We normally don\u2019t give guidance at this stage, Kevin, for 2021. Sometimes we give impressions, but given the volatility of the market as it stands right now and more the near term focus that we have in making sure that we\u2019re serving our patients, members, customers, and then keeping our people safe, including 120,000 clinical resources out on the front line of care, we\u2019re just not really in a position to talk about 2021. We\u2019ll probably give you some sense of that in the Q3 call, but maybe not quite as clear as what we may have given in the past, just looking forward. I would see our investor conference as being the place where I think we can give you the best sense of things. As it relates to our core performance of our businesses, they\u2019re performing well. We\u2019re not talking about their individual performances anymore because there is nothing normal about how any of them are performing at this stage. Collectively, they\u2019re doing a great job and they\u2019re right on expectations, and they\u2019re right on the expectations that informed the guidance that we gave you back in December, maybe a little bit ahead. So they\u2019re performing really well, I just don\u2019t think at this time it\u2019s the right time for us to be thinking about where we\u2019ll land in 2021 on margins. We\u2019ll try to do a better job of that for you in the Q3 call and in the conference later this winter.  Thank you Kevin. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser : Yes, hi. Good morning. As we had into the election, we\u2019re getting a lot of questions from investors around a potential public option. Can you maybe discuss your thoughts on the dynamics of the health insurer market should a public option be instituted? \nDavid Wichmann: Sure Ricky, thank you for the question. I\u2019ll just go ahead and take it. We\u2019ve seen at the state level some indications of efforts around public options. I think the one that\u2019s probably most prominent is the one that occurred in the State of Washington, which ended up being an augmentation of their exchange, a set of product offerings on that. You probably have noticed that we bid and we were one of the successful bidders, and are currently in contract negotiations to provide an offering on that exchange. What\u2019s interesting about that from our standpoint is that we have a very strong relationship with the State of Washington. We have significant care delivery capacities in that state and we serve 220,000 Medicaid and over 40,000 dually eligible individuals as well. There is kind of a unique program design there that really uses, I\u2019ll call it roughly a reference based pricing, and we\u2019re curious to see how we perform in competing on a reference based pricing basis because it\u2019s not unusual for us to have a disadvantage on discounts when we\u2019re competing [indiscernible] given the size and significance of those players in the overall market. We actually think this will be a nice test to see what the [indiscernible] our business will be. Generally speaking, we\u2019re not a strong supporter of these public option proposals, and primarily because they disrupt current coverage platforms which consumers value and appreciate. We believe there\u2019s a near universal coverage system already in America today. It\u2019s obviously not complete and it has some gaps, but we believe those gaps can be closed and think that consumers much prefer that we leverage the existing commercial Medicare and Medicaid markets to provide the types of coverage options and coverages that are necessary for America. The areas that [indiscernible] around Medicaid, and we\u2019re obviously strong supporters of the states that have not expanded to expand, we believe Medicaid is a strong coverage option for--you know, encourage [indiscernible] that occurs. The other area would be that we see a lot of the uninsured are actually folks that have an affordable coverage option available to them, but they don\u2019t necessarily enroll, and particularly in Medicare where there\u2019s--Medicaid, excuse me, where there\u2019s about 8.5 million people that are currently uninsured but have Medicaid option available to them, so we\u2019d be strong proponents of passive enrollment as well to ensure that Americans are getting the coverages that are made available to them by states, federal governments, and the private insurance system. With that, thank you for the question, Ricky. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Back of the envelope type math for the full year, EPS guidance to remain at [indiscernible] MLR in the back half of 2021 would have to be maybe somewhere in the 80s [indiscernible]. I guess really my question is just given the trends that you\u2019re seeing in June and July around utilization, I guess I\u2019m curious whether you\u2019re generally assuming that the MLRs will be fairly consistent in both third quarter and fourth quarter, or would you perhaps see more of your proactive spending gravitate more towards the fourth quarter when thinking about the mechanics of this for the back half? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Yes, good morning Steven. A few impacts going on as we think about the progression. Definitely there are the proactive actions that we\u2019re taking to help people that have impact in the quarters here. Typically we would think about there still being a ramp, though, in terms of the system reopening, so as we--as we exited June and we were trying to give you as much clarity and transparency as we could in terms of what we\u2019re seeing real time, seeing systems reopening, that at this point they\u2019re still not fully open. They are getting close, they are near normal, but not what we\u2019d call fully reopened. That will continue to track over the course of the second half, and we would continue that, so I would expect there would be some trajectory that would go on just from that component as those reopen.  Creating some offset in that, certainly we have a lot of actions also that are impacting and will impact in the near term as they come on and seniors are able to access care and move through using the co-pay eliminations that we\u2019ve put into place. All of those have quite a bit of impact. At this distance, I would tell you we\u2019re kind of in the--just given the variability, we\u2019re kind of in a zone where those impacts probably have offsetting impacts, and we\u2019re kind of sitting in a zone of we\u2019d look for relatively consistent levels throughout. Typically we have more--you know, you get a little more impact, though, as you get into 4Q. Our historical patterns would show that. \nSteven Valiquette: Okay, appreciate the extra color. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you Steven. We have time for just a couple more questions. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Ralph Jacoby [ph] with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Jacoby: Thanks, good morning. You mentioned June returning to near normal levels, but I think I heard John also say that it continued into July despite the COVID spikes. Is that correct, and why do you think that would be the case versus retrenching again? Then you mentioned acuity. Any help on how meaningful a driver that could be on trend in the second half, given deferral, and if you\u2019ve already seen that? Thanks. \nJohn Rex: Morning Ralph, John Rex. Yes, you\u2019re accurate in terms of my commentary in the prepared comments here. The trends we\u2019re referring to are national trends. You are absolutely correct - if we were to go into pockets, into certain metro regions in the country where you\u2019ve seen some spiking in terms of infection rates and such, we\u2019re seeing impact in those particular regions, but those are very particular regions in terms of that [indiscernible]. When we\u2019re talking about what we\u2019re seeing through July, it\u2019s very much at a national level in terms of impact.  Dirk has a little additional color commentary also. \nDirk McMahon: I would say we would expect the infection rates to ebb and flow based on geography [indiscernible] broad-based shutdown. Those places where that ebb and flow occurs, we would expect [indiscernible] impact. Obviously [indiscernible] more markets individual [indiscernible] but overall, like we said on the call today, utilization is going to come back during the second half of the year.\nJohn Rex: And Ralph, on your question on acuity, a little too soon to really call that one right now. When we expect individuals with chronic conditions that have missed treatments, and as they come back into the system and coming back potentially with a higher acuity level, it\u2019s a little too soon to really be seeing that in the current trending that we are looking at as we sit here today. It really isn\u2019t showing up yet, but we expect that to show up as systems continue to reopen, and really importantly, consumer comfort level increases.\nDirk McMahon: I mean, it\u2019s kind of hard to ignore the number of new diagnoses that dropped off. It\u2019s hard to ignore the drop-off in heart attack, stroke. You can imagine it was fear of consumers going to an ER that caused them not to access the health system, so we--it may be speculative here, but I think the data that we see suggests that there will be some intensity in the services that people receive. We\u2019re prepared to make sure that we facilitate them receiving those services.\nOperator: [Indiscernible] with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning guys, and thanks for sneaking me in at the end. I guess just to wrap it up, could you guys talk a little bit about the AbleTo acquisition, kind of how you think it fits into your primary care delivery model that you guys have constructed, your other telehealth partnerships, and the digital health initiatives? Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Wyatt, you want to take it?\nWyatt Decker: You bet. We\u2019re also very pleased to welcome the team from AbleTo, and as you alluded, there is enormous capabilities there in providing [indiscernible] to those suffering from mild, moderate, and in some cases even severe behavioral and substance use disorder conditions. [Indiscernible] leverage the capabilities in a more comprehensive fashion with other capabilities, including [indiscernible] care, which we have seen an enormous uptick in as well. Today, [indiscernible] visits, over half are being provided in the outpatient setting using digital capabilities, and AbleTo has very sophisticated tools that allow individuals to address their behavior healthcare needs, so we\u2019re very pleased about the partnership and we look forward to continuing to build out both their and our capabilities. Finally, to your point about embedded solutions in primary care, we have begun that journey, and in fact within OptumCare you\u2019ll find a number of our practices have embraced this today and able to provide more advanced capabilities to use digital tools in that setting as well. So yes, we will continue that integration.  Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, both NaviHealth and AbleTo are organizations that we\u2019ve aligned to in the past, so we have a history of a strong working relationship and knowledge--good strong, intimate knowledge of the performance of these businesses and where their innovative capacities lie. They just have really strong management teams and do a very good job managing their respective markets. Thank you for your engagement today. This is a unique time in our history and in the history of healthcare. As you have come to expect from us, we will continue to meet this unprecedented environment with the highest level of integrity, compassion, and agility. UnitedHealth Group is built to be an adaptable company, and as we\u2019ve seen in the past several months, you can expect the following from us, that we will continue to lean into challenges of the current environment with the full capacity of this enterprise and proactively seek ways to collaborate and partner with others.  As we work together to serve society through COVID-19, we will fairly resolve any economic imbalances that may arise while we continue to lead in the development of the next generation health system in a socially conscious way so that everyone can be served equally, one person, one provider, one health system at a time. With your continued support, we expect to grow and emerge an even stronger company in the years to come. Thank you. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "content": "Yes, thanks Dave. AJ, hi. As I look at national accounts and I think about this selling season, what we really saw was that we're about 60 days behind normal in terms of people making decisions for 1/1/21. As we sit here today, not all the decisions have been made, and as we handicap our wins and losses, what we expect will be roughly flat to a little bit up in terms of group wins and losses for 1/1/21, but really the tale is going to be told with respect to national accounts as to what attrition occurs throughout the remainder of the year.  I think that's really it. I would say in terms of general RFP activity, I think I would say that in national accounts, these sorts of things just progressed, just at a little bit slower than what we had seen previously.  As it relates to Medicaid, I'll turn it over to Tim Spilker, who will just give us quick thoughts on the RFP activity in \u2018caid. I would say we would expect the infection rates to ebb and flow based on geography [indiscernible] broad-based shutdown. Those places where that ebb and flow occurs, we would expect [indiscernible] impact. Obviously [indiscernible] more markets individual [indiscernible] but overall, like we said on the call today, utilization is going to come back during the second half of the year. I mean, it's kind of hard to ignore the number of new diagnoses that dropped off. It's hard to ignore the drop-off in heart attack, stroke. You can imagine it was fear of consumers going to an ER that caused them not to access the health system, so we--it may be speculative here, but I think the data that we see suggests that there will be some intensity in the services that people receive. We're prepared to make sure that we facilitate them receiving those services."

            "content": "Dave, thanks, and Josh, thanks for the question. You're absolutely right, Dave - we have seen continued interest and growth in our OptumCare model, which has become really the nation's predominant physician-led, value-based, patient-centered ambulatory medical practice. That may sound like a mouthful, but it's really focused on doing what's right for patients, delivering care in both more convenient and lower cost settings in a value-based construct, keeping the patient at the center of everything we do. We've seen, to the second question, Josh, around the performance of OptumCare, we've seen that our large geographic footprint combined with our both risk-based and fee-for-service model has created substantial resiliency in the business, and as John Rex mentioned, we saw some countervailing financial performances when fee-for-service got quieter during the peak of the pandemic. We're now seeing very rapid recovery in part because of our tremendous support of our frontline providers. The other piece that I would want to underscore is our incredible gratitude to our frontline providers that have done an incredible job caring for both COVID patients and helping us effectively navigate through this complex pandemic. Your first question around ongoing recruitment of physician groups and individual physicians, your implied assumption is correct - we are seeing substantial interest in our practice model as well as in becoming part of OptumCare, and this is part of a multi-year trend that we have continued to grow, and as you know, we have relationships with multiple physician groups that are either affiliated or employed today, over 52,000 doctors in both categories combined, and we have seen continued interest and expect a pipeline of affiliated and employed physicians to grow robustly. Thank you. Yes Scott, thanks for the question. First, I would tell you how excited we are and pleased we are to welcome the team of NaviHealth to Optum United Health Group. Second, I would say just to frame it, when you look at seniors in the United States, there's over a $60 billion spend in the post acute space, which historically has not been well managed both in terms of the patient experience and expenses. We think there is a tremendous opportunity, and you can look forward with NaviHealth as well as our own capabilities and our colleagues at Sound Physicians, which is a hospital staffing group focused on hospitalists who are very engaged in the post acute transition, to continue to build capabilities to help both patients and people manage that post hospitalization period with the best outcomes and the best experience. More to come, but we're very excited about this combination of our colleagues at NaviHealth. You bet. We're also very pleased to welcome the team from AbleTo, and as you alluded, there is enormous capabilities there in providing [indiscernible] to those suffering from mild, moderate, and in some cases even severe behavioral and substance use disorder conditions. [Indiscernible] leverage the capabilities in a more comprehensive fashion with other capabilities, including [indiscernible] care, which we have seen an enormous uptick in as well.

As we mentioned earlier, both Kentucky and Indiana were really nice wins, and of course we were thrilled to see that North Carolina finalized its Medicaid funding for a 7/1/21 start. So understandably, as you suggested, states have delayed some of their procurement timelines, but overall we're starting to see those pick up here over the next couple of months. We believe our value proposition is strong and well positioned for growth, and we'll be ready for those procurements as they come through."

We're going to continue our longstanding approach to pricing - you know, we're disciplined and we're pricing to our best estimate of future cost trends. We have extensively modeled the potential impact to covid-19, including our testing and treatment costs, potential vaccine costs, and costs that will be expected to be deferred into 2021, which includes the potential higher severity because of the deferred care and also the potential for continued depressed demand for healthcare services in some regions and states. All this is built into our forward view of medical cost trends, and we're working very closely with our customers right now into August as we start to put out our renewals for 2021. Our clients are really expecting and appreciating consistent and stable pricing from us.  Thank you."

            "name": "David Wichmann",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. When we last met in this forum 90 days ago, the challenges of COVID-19 in the Americas were just beginning to emerge. Now some four months into the evolving pandemic, the individual health system, social and economic implications of the virus are better understood and significant, especially the impact of longstanding health disparities affecting the underserved populations hit hardest by the pandemic.  In uncharted periods such as these, we lean on our mission and culture of values to guide us. That mission and those values call on us to help people, to help health systems, to help everyone with integrity, compassion, innovation, relationships, and performance. I am grateful to and proud of our 325,000 diverse team members as they continue to provide vital support, caring for those we serve and working with the health system partners to combat this disease and the many other daily health challenges that have not gone away, they've just been deferred and possibly become more complicated. We deeply appreciate the tireless service of our 120,000 doctors, nurses, medical and behavioral professionals, social workers, pharmacists, and other healthcare workers on the front lines of care. They serve in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Portugal. They serve in New York City, Seattle, southern California, Phoenix, Texas, Florida, and other communities confronted by COVID-19. Their compassion for our patients and members has saved lives and helped make the lives of countless other people better. UnitedHealth Group was built to be adaptable, an instinctive enterprise capable of anticipating change, rapidly evolving and re-configuring capabilities to meet both challenges and opportunities. The past several months have only highlighted the importance of this agility so long core to how we operate, and deepened our resolve to cultivate it. We've witnessed our people helping in ways and advancing innovations and solutions at an unprecedented pace, scope and scale.  Today, I'd like to provide insights into how our business is both responding and advancing, share what we've learned in the past several months, describe how these lessons enhance our ability to serve even more people more deeply, and as a result we expect to grow and emerge stronger in the years to come.  UnitedHealthcare and Optum have both experienced the effects of an unprecedented decline in healthcare services. Among early actions we undertook to help people were opening new enrolment periods so more people could be covered, waiving all consumer COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment costs, accelerating $2 billion in needed funding to care providers, and providing over $1.5 billion in direct consumer and customer assistance, including premium forgiveness and suspension of member cost sharing to help people manage their health conditions. These amounts are in addition to the $1 billion in estimated rebates to be paid in coming periods. Throughout this pandemic, we have taken extraordinary measures to ensure people get the essential care they need. As we speak with you today, care access patterns are nearing more normal levels, an encouraging sign for people's health. We see the system operating just short of its normal baseline now, far above the lows experienced as the second quarter began. We currently expect care access patterns, while somewhat more volatile than in the past, to moderately exceed normal baselines in the second half as people seek previously deferred care, and a pandemic with high testing and treatment costs per affected consumer is expected to continue to run its course throughout 2020 and into 2021. Consistent with the proactive actions we've already undertaken, we will continue to act swiftly to address any further financial imbalances arising from the pandemic and related effects.  We are further advancing broad health equity initiatives tapping into our data, information and analytics capacities to guide scientific efforts to help eliminate longstanding health disparities. This is a course we have pursued for many years and are now even more intentional as we see underserved populations disproportionately impacted by this health crisis. We established an innovative community-based care model to provide COVID-19 testing, education and other necessary services to some of the highest risk and least served communities in the country. We are focusing on locations with high mortality along with local community challenges, including poverty, crowding, food insecurity, homelessness, and other existing social determinants of health. Our service includes special deployments in the underserved communities of Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Orleans Parish, alongside many other similar communities we serve through our core Medicare and Medicaid programs. We are researching new treatment approaches in partnership with prominent academic institutions. For example, working with the Morehouse School of Medicine, we're studying the effect of COVID-19 on those with sickle cell trait, a condition which is prevalent in 8% to 10% of Black Americans. We're conducting an ACE inhibitor virtual clinical trial with the Yale School of Medicine. Artificial intelligence applied to our data showed that seniors on ACE inhibitors who test positive for COVID-19 are 40% less likely to need hospitalizations than those who are not. Understanding that there's a significant racial disparity in the use of ACE inhibitors to manage hypertension, we're working rapidly to scale this 10,000 person virtual clinical trial, believed to be the first of its type. We're partnering with a growing number of state governments and employers who are using Optum's rapid response resources to stand up mobile and fixed testing sites. To date, we have helped conduct more than a half a million tests across more than 500 sites, most often in rural and underserved communities. We committed another $100 million in affordable housing to address homelessness, bringing our total investments to more than $500 million to build nearly 5,400 units over the past seven years, and we will do more, focused on working with others to eradicate longstanding health disparities in America and to create a more diverse U.S. health workforce. The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the adoption of new technologies and approaches to care. We're serving people where they want to be served and more often in the home, which is becoming a preferred additional care setting, through new innovative digital offerings. At peak care system closure in April, UnitedHealthcare facilitated more than 4 million digital care visits, the number of visits we enabled in January. We expect digital and homecare to persist and expand in coming years. We are rapidly assembling our next generation comprehensive platform, leveraging the digital signaling and monitor capacities of Vivify, the market-leading engagement capabilities of Rally, our AI-enabled individual health record, the pharmacy ecommerce capabilities of OptumRx on community-based clinical resources, and importantly a proprietary, scalable direct to your own doctor's telemedicine platform.  The understandable and expected rise in stress, anxiety and social isolation [indiscernible] services, digital platforms are proving to be increasingly effective in remotely diagnosing and caring for people with such needs with a rapidly expanding scope. Optum is among the largest providers of digital behavioral healthcare services in the country, now with more than 10,000 care providers using our virtual visit platform. Our digital psychiatry offerings extend to community behavioral health clinics and [indiscernible] and complements our more than 500 community-based behavioral health pharmacies.  Optum nurses are meeting the increasing need for infusion services in the comfort and safety of people's homes, [indiscernible] will accelerate for years to come, and our nurses offer fully equivalent clinical efficacy, greater patient convenience and satisfaction, and reduced risk of immuno-compromised people at up to one half the cost of traditional settings, and our house call services include extensive digital clinical care visits supplementing in-home visits by Optum nurses.  As clinical techniques and technologies advance, ambulatory surgical care is expanding as an appropriate care setting for high acuity members and procedures, like cardiovascular surgeries. Partly as a result of convenience, safety, and better patient and surgeon experience [indiscernible]. For example, in just the last two months, [indiscernible] new surgeons to our centers and have opened new and higher acuity service lines. We [indiscernible] this care model to accelerate. The recent months have served as a compelling example of why care delivery has [indiscernible] OptumCare continues as a physician partner of choice with over 6,500 additional clinicians, primarily PCPs, specialists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants added so far this year. These clinicians are seeking alignment with the entity best equipped to help move to high performing and more stable accountable debt entity is OptumCare.  These are a few example of how we have and continue to innovate to help make people healthier to help make health systems work better for everyone. The information and technology capacities of Optum, leveraged and deployed by United Healthcare and other payors in other health systems holds significant promise for the future of the U.S. health system.  Now I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. Thank you John. Today in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, foremost on our minds is the safely of our team members and their families and the need to continue adapting rapidly, innovating and delivering for those we serve. [Indiscernible] begin to focus at this time on what will come in 2021 and beyond. At this distance, the evolution of the pandemic, when and to what extent the economy will improve are very much open questions. We expect the macroeconomic impacts of the broader unemployment and actions we have taken to assist customers and communities to continue well into next year. Helping our customers through an unexpected macro environment and the extended impact from disruptions in care has and will continue to be an area of intense focus for our business leaders and care providers. During this period, our diversified businesses are creating unique opportunities to serve, and we don't believe these are just passing trends. They bring more effective clinical outcomes, satisfaction and convenience for people at lower cost, a significant contribution to the next generation health system, one that operates in a socially conscious way. These are accelerating and durable trends, well supportive of our 13% to 16% long-term growth objective in the years to come.  Public sector and senior benefits programs, our care delivery businesses, our digital and at-home based initiatives, pharmacy care services, data and analytics, and health banking and payment platforms will continue contributing as significant growth factors long into the future.  Thank you for your time today. Operator, can you please open the lines for questions? Okay, well maybe we'll start with John and then as it relates to 2021, I'm sure you can talk about the commercial markets, and we'll have Dirk address that. Okay. Great, thank you. Then as it relates to pricing, I think we'll start with Medicare with Tim Noel and then we'll go to commercial with Bill Golden. Tim? Thanks Tim. I'd just add to that, I think the way the year is setting up, and I know it's relatively early, but in terms of the overall positioning is to continue the pace of growth that we have been seeing across the individual Medicare Advantage lines, and then obviously we're deeply focused on the group Medicare market and growth there as well. Bill Golden, do you want to handle commercial? Thank you Bill, and thank you Justin for your question. Next question, please. Good questions, Josh, appreciate them. We did try to lean into this a little bit in the script in terms of giving a general impression that there's a kind of movement afoot of physicians, advanced practice clinicians towards stable models that allow them to preserve their independence practice at the top of their license, achieve the triple-A in the healthcare, and we've clearly seen that. Then we've also, as you probably can suspect, had a fair agenda around inorganic build to access new geographies, and we've made a decent amount of progress on that front during this time frame as well.  But I think I'll send it to Wyatt Decker here, he can talk a little bit about the value proposition of OptumCare and what people are seeking at this important time, and why this model is the one that they are pursuing. Wyatt? Thank you Josh, appreciate your question. Next question, please. Sure, well why don't we give you color from a number of different angles here, AJ. We'll start with Dirk to give you a sense of what's going on with UnitedHealthcare and their self-funded business and the RFP activity there, and maybe even as it relates to some of the government programs based business, then I'm going to pivot over to John Prince to talk about Rx, and then Robert Musslewhite to comment on the activities in the market segments of OptumInsight. Dirk? By the way, that was Tim Spilker. He's our new CEO of Community & State. You probably recall that Heather Cianfrocco was the former CEO. She was promoted to oversee Optum Health's health services sector as its leader, and as you might suspect, we are positioning some of our strongest leaders into the Optum Health segment given the rapid growth expectations of that business over the next decade or so.  Maybe just touch on group Medicare too. Brian Thompson, you want to touch on that? Yes, the team has done really well in the government program space around growth, and they have a substantial amount of momentum and continue to capitalize on that momentum going forward. John Prince, you want to touch on Rx? Then I'll ask Robert Musslewhite to round it up here, really talking about both the activity with health systems, who have been extremely busy, and then also with health plans. Thank you Robert. AJ, hopefully that was responsive. Thank you for the question.  Next question, please. Sure, so the additional billion--or the billion in premium rebates is a best estimate at this point in time. As these things move and we continue to deal with the evolution of the pandemic, as well as the impacts on the economy, that number will shift around. It's required to be reflected in your results on a current term basis, so it's reflected in the results that you see so far year-to-date, so it's already through.  Then as it relates to rebates, yes, there are anti-kickback rules, and all those things we have a very complex set of engagements that we need to make with insurance commissioners and others to make sure that we can return these funds. We have engaged in that and have been successful at getting concurrence with them around providing these rebates. Obviously it's a lot easier to give money back than it is to ask for new, and so they've been very receptive and very collaborative and extremely appreciative that we were as proactive as we were and as early as we were in providing needed relief to our commercial members, as well as the actions that we took on the Medicare front. Thank you for the question. Next question, please. Yes, so what we're seeing so far is a lot of furloughs versus layoffs to reduce costs in the short term. In many cases, clearly this allows them to maintain medical benefits throughout. What also has benefited our overall enrolment is the impact of the stimulus actions. The impact on commercial enrolment hasn't been as great as we would have otherwise thought based on the unemployment data, just because of the stimulus as well as the furloughs. We're looking and we're continuing to work with our broker partners and with our employers to try to find folks--to try to find other coverages for folks if they don't stay in commercial.  What I would say is in the Medicaid space, what we've seen so far is the redeterminations have been put on hold, so we'll see. People go to our commercial products as we--our individual products as we pace forward, and we have a fairly broad commercial and individual products as well, so we may be able to recapture our share, but there's no doubt that there's going to be sort of delayed impact because of the stimulus actions and it will be a little bit more pronounced in the second half, but we think we've held our own so far. Thank you Robert. Next question, please. John Rex? And Sarah, one of the things we did was we maintained our full workforce, so nobody's been laid off or furloughed or dismissed because of COVID-19, and in part because we knew that on the other side of this initial activity that the health system would come back online and consumers would be accessing care, so we needed to make sure that we were prepared to respond to the market demands just as quickly as possible.  Because of all that, the service through this time period, we [indiscernible] virtually all the lines of business at Optum and the same thing with--I'm sorry, UnitedHealthcare and the same with Optum. We've seen a nice improvement, so we're making sure that we utilize this time well and make those investments provide the right kinds of returns, so that we're creating additional trust with the marketplace. I think that's playing out nicely.  Thank you for your question, Sarah. Next question, please. I think a little bit of both. Wyatt? Yes, we leaned in a lot to the digital activities and the way in which we're engaging or assembling our resources across our company to really create a unique and distinctive home clinical experience. That includes the engagement of our physical resources, our nurses that already go into homes, so I could see us very much being a home through ambulatory, surgical capacity company. As it relates to the home in particular, our interest would be primarily in deploying skilled health services, so we would not be as inclined around the other home-based care services around ADL management and things of that nature. We probably would continue our focus on skilled clinical resources.  Thanks for the question, Scott. Next question, please. Yes, it's really hard to tell. We normally don't give guidance at this stage, Kevin, for 2021. Sometimes we give impressions, but given the volatility of the market as it stands right now and more the near term focus that we have in making sure that we're serving our patients, members, customers, and then keeping our people safe, including 120,000 clinical resources out on the front line of care, we're just not really in a position to talk about 2021. We'll probably give you some sense of that in the Q3 call, but maybe not quite as clear as what we may have given in the past, just looking forward. I would see our investor conference as being the place where I think we can give you the best sense of things. As it relates to our core performance of our businesses, they're performing well. We're not talking about their individual performances anymore because there is nothing normal about how any of them are performing at this stage. Collectively, they're doing a great job and they're right on expectations, and they're right on the expectations that informed the guidance that we gave you back in December, maybe a little bit ahead. So they're performing really well, I just don't think at this time it's the right time for us to be thinking about where we'll land in 2021 on margins. We'll try to do a better job of that for you in the Q3 call and in the conference later this winter.  Thank you Kevin. Next question, please. Sure Ricky, thank you for the question. I'll just go ahead and take it. We've seen at the state level some indications of efforts around public options. I think the one that's probably most prominent is the one that occurred in the State of Washington, which ended up being an augmentation of their exchange, a set of product offerings on that. You probably have noticed that we bid and we were one of the successful bidders, and are currently in contract negotiations to provide an offering on that exchange. What's interesting about that from our standpoint is that we have a very strong relationship with the State of Washington. We have significant care delivery capacities in that state and we serve 220,000 Medicaid and over 40,000 dually eligible individuals as well. There is kind of a unique program design there that really uses, I'll call it roughly a reference based pricing, and we're curious to see how we perform in competing on a reference based pricing basis because it's not unusual for us to have a disadvantage on discounts when we're competing [indiscernible] given the size and significance of those players in the overall market. We actually think this will be a nice test to see what the [indiscernible] our business will be. Generally speaking, we're not a strong supporter of these public option proposals, and primarily because they disrupt current coverage platforms which consumers value and appreciate. We believe there's a near universal coverage system already in America today. It's obviously not complete and it has some gaps, but we believe those gaps can be closed and think that consumers much prefer that we leverage the existing commercial Medicare and Medicaid markets to provide the types of coverage options and coverages that are necessary for America. The areas that [indiscernible] around Medicaid, and we're obviously strong supporters of the states that have not expanded to expand, we believe Medicaid is a strong coverage option for--you know, encourage [indiscernible] that occurs. The other area would be that we see a lot of the uninsured are actually folks that have an affordable coverage option available to them, but they don't necessarily enroll, and particularly in Medicare where there's--Medicaid, excuse me, where there's about 8.5 million people that are currently uninsured but have Medicaid option available to them, so we'd be strong proponents of passive enrollment as well to ensure that Americans are getting the coverages that are made available to them by states, federal governments, and the private insurance system. With that, thank you for the question, Ricky. Next question, please. Thank you Steven. We have time for just a couple more questions. Next question, please. Wyatt, you want to take it? Yes, both NaviHealth and AbleTo are organizations that we've aligned to in the past, so we have a history of a strong working relationship and knowledge--good strong, intimate knowledge of the performance of these businesses and where their innovative capacities lie. They just have really strong management teams and do a very good job managing their respective markets. Thank you for your engagement today. This is a unique time in our history and in the history of healthcare. As you have come to expect from us, we will continue to meet this unprecedented environment with the highest level of integrity, compassion, and agility. UnitedHealth Group is built to be an adaptable company, and as we've seen in the past several months, you can expect the following from us, that we will continue to lean into challenges of the current environment with the full capacity of this enterprise and proactively seek ways to collaborate and partner with others.  As we work together to serve society through COVID-19, we will fairly resolve any economic imbalances that may arise while we continue to lead in the development of the next generation health system in a socially conscious way so that everyone can be served equally, one person, one provider, one health system at a time. With your continued support, we expect to grow and emerge an even stronger company in the years to come. Thank you. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter."

We expect this temporary impact [indiscernible] by the proactive assistance measures we have already taken, the resumption of more normal care patterns, and future COVID-19 impacts both within the healthcare sector and the economy at large. Looking more specifically, Optum revenue and earnings for fee-for-service care delivery and the OptumInsight and OptumRx volume-based businesses [indiscernible]. For the company as a whole, this was more than offset by the disrupted care patterns within the United Healthcare and the Optum Health risk-based businesses.  Prior period development of $1.4 billion arose primarily from the lower than expected care levels in the second half of March, contributing to the lower medical care ratio this quarter. The impact of this care disruption is reduced by factors such as COVID-related treatment and testing and the financial assistance we are providing. Notably, the assistance component has a more [indiscernible]. For example, the suspension of member cost share will have an accelerating benefit and corresponding impact for the people we serve as care delivery systems further reopen and they seek care again.  At the lowest point in April, in-patient care inclusive of COVID-19 related care was [indiscernible]. In June, this recovered to nearly 95%. At the same lowest point, outpatient and physician services fell to roughly 60% of normal levels. As we exited [indiscernible] tracking above 90%. These national trends [indiscernible] even as certain states are seeing short-term deferral of services where there are elevated levels of infection and hospitalization.  [Indiscernible] each of the three businesses performed well, while they were affected in different ways by care deferral and the economic downturn. Second quarter earnings increased 22% year-over-year. The impact of the lower patient [indiscernible] mostly offset by the same temporary deferral of care effects on [indiscernible]. OptumInsight second quarter earnings increased 7% year-over-year while the revenue backlog grew by nearly $1 billion to $19.4 billion. Many of OptumInsights payor and care provider clients have volume-based contracts for technology and managed services. After an expected slowing of such volumes early in the second quarter due to care deferral, we're now seeing activity rebound and [indiscernible] again, as evidenced by the new partnership with Boulder Community [indiscernible]. OptumRx earnings declined by 6% year-over-year in the second quarter as script volumes were impacted by [indiscernible]. Unsurprisingly given the sharp drop in primary care and specialist visits, first fills of prescriptions declined by about one-third early in the second quarter, but began to recover as the quarter progressed and have continued to do so as care activity increases.  Turning to UnitedHealthcare, second quarter operating earnings were significantly higher due to the temporary care [indiscernible] continue to serve more people through our public sector and senior businesses, including an increase through the second quarter of nearly 600,000 people year to date. As [indiscernible] commercial enrolment declined, albeit [indiscernible] might have suggested [indiscernible] for furloughed employees.  During the second quarter, growth in sales of individual polices and Medicaid membership accelerated, the latter as states eased redetermination requirements to ensure sustainable coverage for people. We were also awarded contracts to serve Medicaid members in Kentucky in 2021, serve the Medicaid population in Indiana, and are pleased to continue serving in Philadelphia. After a strong annual enrolment period for Medicare Advantage, the pacing of new enrollees in April and May eased as traditional in-person sales slowed. Sales have accelerated with the current level of Medicare Advantage enrollment activity having rebounded to [indiscernible]. Our liquidity and financial position have remained strong [indiscernible] reached $10 billion or 1.5 times net earnings. Both cash flows and days and clients payable were impacted by the swift moves we undertook to provide enhanced liquidity by accelerating payments to individual care providers and health systems. Offsetting this impact was the timing of second quarter income tax payments, which will now occur in the third quarter. As noted in our press release this morning, we are maintaining our full year earnings per share outlook in anticipation of the delivery of previously deferred and potentially even higher acuity care as well as continued costs to address COVID-19 in the second half of the year. We are encouraged by the rapid pacing of the reopening of care delivery systems and are proactively working to help people quickly obtain the care they need. In addition, we incorporate a second half view for a more pronounced impact from the consumer, customer and care provider assistance initiatives already undertaken. As Dave stated, we will act to address further imbalances, should they arise over the duration of this pandemic. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave. Good morning, John Rex here, Justin. Just a few comments here in terms of medical cost ratio and the impacts of customer assistance and how they flow through the year. Yes, you are right - clearly we expect higher than historically normal medical cost ratios as we move into the second quarter of the year, and that's certainly implied in our maintained guidance view. You can see as you look at it versus historical levels of a typical second half, we're running in the zone of a couple hundred basis points above what we would consider kind of historical medical cost ratios in the second half of the year, to kind of give you a little color in terms of how that flows through. In terms of the customer assistance initiatives and how those play out, among some of the more significant customer assistance initiatives that we are taking on are the waiving of co-pays for seniors for both primary care and very importantly on the specialist component, as that's a very significant burden for seniors. Those really have much more impact as we get into the second half from the perspective of as care delivery systems reopen, that's when those costs will be incurred, so you're incurring those costs as seniors and people are really accessing that care, and that's where the assistance component comes in. That component, which is one of the more significant components of the customer assistance initiatives we've undertaken, is really more weighted to the back half of the year than the first half of the year. Good morning, Sarah, how are you doing? A few things, comments on that in terms of just thinking about how those costs play out. I guess I'd first point out, as you can appreciate, we're quite respectful of the highly fluid situation and mindful of how rapidly the situation is evolving. [Indiscernible] sets up a view that as the maintained earnings outlook would imply [indiscernible] the carrier that we had expected to be delivered in 2020, you know, we look into the back half of the year. [Indiscernible] that way or not, or whether as you suggest, some of that moves into 2021 also is in part a component of how quickly systems, health delivery systems reopen and how fully they stay open, and also just the consumer preference in terms of their comfort of going into these settings. All those are elements that play out in this thing, so we're being quite respectful of that situation as we look forward on that and how that plays out into '21. Certainly some of that could end up in '21. In terms of cost, I think what you're referring to is investments that we would choose to make being heavily, and we're investing heavily in part in response to COVID-19 and in response to the pandemic. You probably saw some of that even in our operating cost ration this quarter in terms of the investments we're making on a current period basis to serve people and to enhance and strengthen our capabilities as we look forward. Those are the main components that I'd point out in terms of how we're acting and how we're looking ahead to serve. Yes, good morning Steven. A few impacts going on as we think about the progression. Definitely there are the proactive actions that we're taking to help people that have impact in the quarters here. Typically we would think about there still being a ramp, though, in terms of the system reopening, so as we--as we exited June and we were trying to give you as much clarity and transparency as we could in terms of what we're seeing real time, seeing systems reopening, that at this point they're still not fully open. They are getting close, they are near normal, but not what we'd call fully reopened. That will continue to track over the course of the second half, and we would continue that, so I would expect there would be some trajectory that would go on just from that component as those reopen.  Creating some offset in that, certainly we have a lot of actions also that are impacting and will impact in the near term as they come on and seniors are able to access care and move through using the co-pay eliminations that we've put into place. All of those have quite a bit of impact. At this distance, I would tell you we're kind of in the--just given the variability, we're kind of in a zone where those impacts probably have offsetting impacts, and we're kind of sitting in a zone of we'd look for relatively consistent levels throughout. Typically we have more--you know, you get a little more impact, though, as you get into 4Q. Our historical patterns would show that. Morning Ralph, John Rex. Yes, you're accurate in terms of my commentary in the prepared comments here. The trends we're referring to are national trends. You are absolutely correct - if we were to go into pockets, into certain metro regions in the country where you've seen some spiking in terms of infection rates and such, we're seeing impact in those particular regions, but those are very particular regions in terms of that [indiscernible]. When we're talking about what we're seeing through July, it's very much at a national level in terms of impact.  Dirk has a little additional color commentary also. And Ralph, on your question on acuity, a little too soon to really call that one right now. When we expect individuals with chronic conditions that have missed treatments, and as they come back into the system and coming back potentially with a higher acuity level, it's a little too soon to really be seeing that in the current trending that we are looking at as we sit here today. It really isn't showing up yet, but we expect that to show up as systems continue to reopen, and really importantly, consumer comfort level increases."

            "content": "On the provider side of the business, and thanks AJ for the question, we have felt like while there's certainly been some disruption during the quarter in some of our smaller technology deals, on the larger deals the pipeline continues to be strong and interest remains high. Given what's happened with health systems during the quarter, we think that these larger comprehensive partnerships will continue to be very attractive to health systems that align with us across our commitment to total cost of care reductions and affordability, patient quality, and consumer centricity. These types of partnerships, as we've seen in the past, not only help mitigate liquidity and cash flow issues in the near term, but importantly accelerate the broader transformational clinical and structure work in the medium and longer term. In that light, we're particularly pleased to be, having announced yesterday our partnership with Boulder Community Health, which is again a comprehensive new relationship focused on multiple things, including and importantly sharing outcomes in the clinical domain, and really see this as indicative of the broader pipeline that we see across our health system clients. We feel very good about the ability to continue to support them there. On the payor side, again a similar story. Obviously there have been places during the quarter where we've had some impact on payors' willingness to step forward with large deals, but still feel very good about the pipeline going forward where we're able to provide a lot of value and support to our payor partners going forward, and feel good about the pipeline there in the second half of the year."

            "name": "Tim Noel",
            "content": "Morning Justin, Tim Noel, thanks for the question. As we talked a little bit last quarter about pricing for 2021 in Medicare, and as a reminder, pre-COVID we talked about total revenue related items roughly on part with our estimates of forward trend, and we also have the repeal, the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax in 2021, so if you take those things, all else equal we would expect that 2021 to be a benefit investment year on the Medicare Advantage. Certainly COVID creates some challenges with diagnosis collection, given the utilization patterns that we're seeing and talking about, and also CMS has not provided any discrete adjustments in the final notice to account for that, nor have they done anything since. It's still too early to get specific on our bid offerings for 2021. Bids aren't final, nor are they public; but again, our top priority is providing stable and reliable benefits for the members that we serve, and we feel really good about 2021 and expect to continue our multi-year momentum in Medicare Advantage. Thanks."

            "content": "Sure. Hey AJ, it's John Prince. As you know, in the OptumRx business we're in the middle of our selling season right now. We continue to have a very healthy pipeline and are very excited about the opportunities in the market. In the first half of the year, we had some good wins, especially in the commercial market, the labor market and the health plan market. As we pivot to the back half of the year, we're more in the smaller size opportunities. As we look to the big opportunities we're pursuing right now, most of them are for 2022 selling season, so there is a robust pipeline for 2022. As you know, in the health plan business, this is the time frame where they make those types of decisions. In terms of movement in the market, we're going to see less movement in the 2021 selling season, as we have seen in previous years. Overall, I think our retention is going to be very strong, as it has been for the last four years. We're going to be tracking to the high 90s, as we've been tracking before, so we're going to see strong growth. I think our story is resonating in the market. We're seeing strong focus on client affordability, our tools around making sure members stay healthy and get healthy, and creating a great client experience, so overall strong growth in the market."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Here's some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risk and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the earnings reports and SEC filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 15, 2020, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. With all that is going on, we've structured things a bit differently today. We'll get directly to what's likely top of mind for all of you, the impact of COVID-19, global health crisis on our businesses and the actions we're taking to support our communities, members, patients, care providers, customers, government partners, and team members and their family. These are still the early days in the response to COVID-19 and we anticipate we will experience and learn more as events unfold in the months ahead. UnitedHealth Group was consciously built, with the restless mindset, adaptable capabilities, culture and the enduring human values to respond and serve in meeting challenges such as we are seeing today. The commitment, ingenuity, compassion and engagement of the 325,000 people of UnitedHealth Group has never been stronger. I'll start today by expressing my gratitude and admiration to this restless team for the extraordinary efforts and personal sacrifices being made every day. They are doctors, nurses, pharmacists, social workers and other clinical and nonclinical healthcare workers on the front lines of care, as well as customer care representatives, transaction processors, supply chain experts, technology engineers, data scientists and others supporting them, the health system and our communities. The COVID-19 pandemic is deeply personal to them and to all of us. They're connected digitally, triaging people with symptoms, engaging directly with our most vulnerable patients, ensuring essential chronic and COVID-19 related medical and behavioral health services are available and accessed, while helping keep the health system coordinated, connected and working for individuals and their doctors. They're enhancing safety for those most at risk, making sure the right medicines are getting to the right patients, when and where they need it, and the right testing and protective gear is available to properly safeguard the health workforce. They're driving innovative solutions around testing, healthcare workforce safety, improving critical product supply and services availability, helping develop and evaluate therapies and applying advanced analytics to identify, predict and combat COVID-19. For our heroic clinical team, we have further hardened our safety first workforce environment for those caring for patients across our more than 1,500 facilities and those providing medications and services caring for people in their homes. Like all of us, they are concerned about the health and safety of their own families and friends. Yet, they remain front and center engaging fully each day to serve many selflessly away from their families for weeks, so they can ensure care is provided to those most in need. I have never been more proud or more humbled to be on their team. Every team member at UnitedHealth Group remains fully employed, supported, protected and engaged in the COVID-19 crisis. Let me pause to acknowledge and add a note of deep gratitude to Andrew Witty, who has announced this morning will be taking a leave of absence to provide leadership for the efforts of the World Health Organization to find and distribute a vaccine for COVID-19. Our gratitude for Andrew is grounded in all he has done to guide the UnitedHealth Group and Optum so effectively and sensitively for all who we serve and all who work at this enterprise and his willingness to apply his leadership and phenomenal talents to this new assignment for which he is so aptly suited. We couldn't be more proud to call one of our own to see one of our own serve in this way and we look forward to both his success in leading this effort and his return to our company once this important work is done. He is on the call with us today and available to respond to your questions before he reports to duty with the World Health Organization. From the outset of COVID-19 outbreak, we mobilized to keep our entire enterprise fully intact and functioning at the highest performance levels. As we stand today, we are supporting all of our products, services and commitments across all of our businesses and markets. We have long had a high proportion of our more than 200,000 person, nonclinical team working from home and we were able to quickly move nearly all of the rest to work at home as well. They have been performing well and our service levels remain strong for our clients, members, patients and the health system broadly. For the millions of people we are privileged to serve through United HealthCare. We have taken every step possible to broaden access to care. We have offered additional enrollment opportunities to those who previously declined employer sponsored offerings, eliminated all COVID-19 related cost sharings and removed prior authorizations to speed patient transitions of care, so health systems can diagnose, treat, and redirect patients. We have developed revised payment timeframes to help people sustain coverage and we are helping people displaced from their job to smoothly transition to affordable coverage which meets their needs. Last week we moved to provide nearly $2 billion in liquidity to the health system, accelerating payments to care providers whose clinical operations have been impacted. We have been partnering with other companies and academic institutions to develop and validate protocols and processes to more rapidly and frequently test healthcare professionals on the frontline, applying new technology to ensure safe and full availability of this critical workforce. This leverages the self-administered collection innovation we developed, which is simplifying COVID-19 testing and we have been tracking infectious disease pattern to identify supply-demand inequities and resource needs in every major metropolitan statistical area across the U.S. health system. This will emerge as a new capability to provide enhanced disease surveillance in the future. Our high-risk members have been identified and we are surrounding them with services to reduce the impacts of social isolation on their access to physical and behavioral care, while keeping them as safe as possible. And we have provided over $50 million in initial domestic and global grant funding and investments to advance health workforce safety, support those in geographies most afflicted, aid seniors secluded in their homes, and help communities address rising levels of homelessness and food and security. Like the broader health system in recent weeks, we have seen a reduction in elective care, which is impacting both the UnitedHealthcare benefits and the OptumCare delivery businesses. Most traditional procedure work has been postponed at our SCA ambulatory surgery centers. Likewise, the UnitedHealthcare and Optum at-risk care delivery businesses have seen lower demand for these services. We are seeing timeframes and discussions for new business opportunities being extended as most business partners focus on crisis response. Many employers have had to furlough employees, driving higher levels of unemployment, which may ultimately affect the outlook for growth in our Group Benefits business, while increasing our membership in individual lines and Medicaid coverages. While it feels awkward to be talking about earnings outlook at this moment, you saw our press release; we are maintaining our 2020 earnings per share outlook established at our Investor Conference. We view this as the most reasonable baseline posture in these uncertain times as we continue to grow and operate our businesses, while assessing the multitude of potentially offsetting factors across our uniquely diverse enterprise. These factors will become clear in the months to come. The related financial effects on our business will clarify as well. As they do, we commit to providing swift relief, even as we consider the uncertainty of the environment going forward. While there is still much to understand, we can be very clear with you today that we are committed to ensuring that any financial imbalances, which arise from this situation, are reconciled proactively and addressed fairly and timely for all those we serve. Let me now share a few of the specific actions underway at Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum has cared directly for more than 10,000 COVID-19 patients to-date and is operating more than 400 test sites across the country. We quickly shifted more than 4,000 additional OptumCare physicians to our digital care clinics on our way to more than 10,000 in the weeks to come. These rapid responses was made possible by the swift work of the regulatory agencies, allowing flexibility in state licensure requirements for clinicians across service categories and state lines. We thank and commend them for these actions and encourage long-term continuation of these policies. Our digital health consumer engagement has accelerated in many directions. For example, we\u2019ve applied new COVID-19 clinical pathways for our device based remote monitoring services to identify and prioritize high-risk individuals for follow-up care. Our newly developed COVID-19 symptom checker provides people with recommendations on how to proceed, based on the results. And we\u2019ve provided access to our digital behavioral healthcare services, which give clients on-demand help for stress, anxiety, and depression. All content, coping tools and peer support are free to everyone. Because it\u2019s critical everyone receives their needed medications, we are providing early refills, extended authorizations and increased home delivery options. We also extended hours at our behavioral health pharmacies to ensure medication adherence for those with mental health and substance abuse challenges. The spread of the virus has created a significant health risk for those receiving life-sustaining infusion services traditionally administered in the hospital or hospital clinic settings. For these patients, we\u2019re providing infusion services through our Optum Infusion ambulatory suites and in their homes through our nurse infusion specialists. Finally, Optum is innovating on the frontlines of care delivery, developing screening protocols to identify patients who are likely to need hospitalizations and collaborating with health and care delivery organizations to share this knowledge. UnitedHealthcare is working at full speed as well with partners across the health system to address the current global emergency. For consumers, UnitedHealthcare has made it simple and easy to access care, waiving cost sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment and eliminating many administrative requirements. Tens of thousands of people have taken advantage of the special enrollment period we opened for those needing coverage for health benefits, and more than 2 million consumers took advantage of our offer to obtain early prescription drug refills to ensure no one experienced gaps in treatment. UnitedHealthcare digital and telehealth services were ready, and as a result, extensively used as a safe simple and free way to connect with care providers, either through a partner or directly with the patients\u2019 own doctor. UnitedHealthcare is paying careful attention to vulnerable members especially in Medicare and Medicaid by expanding access to our personalized digital care platforms, which provide up-to-date information about prevention, coverage and care. People can quickly talk to a nurse, refill and schedule home delivery for prescriptions and get access to emotional support 24 hours a day. We are also helping federal, state and local authorities address system capacity shortages by supporting them with the main operating experience. One example involves two UHC Community and State leaders, Dr. Jeffrey Brenner and Kathleen Stillo, who are now working exclusively with the State of New Jersey, for the next several months to establish a critically needed field-based hospital system. These are just a few examples of how the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare have mobilized to respond to this public health challenge. There are many more and they are happening every day. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to John Rex, our Chief Financial Officer.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dave. I know you\u2019ve had an opportunity to look through our first quarter financial results this morning. And as such, given the unique circumstances, I\u2019ll be brief about the quarter. As Dave said, while it feels somewhat uncomfortable to be speaking of the financial aspects of this challenging situation, we know this is what you need to understand for your work. Given the timing of the COVID-19 outbreak and its progression in United States, the first quarter financial impact was limited. As you know, incidence rates in the U.S. only started moving meaningfully in mid-March. And elective care trends did not begin to be meaningfully impacted until later in the month. At the segment level, UnitedHealthcare and the OptumHealth, Insight, and Rx businesses all reported first quarter operating earnings that were in line with our own expectations going into the year. Looking ahead, we are maintaining our full-year 2020 earnings per share outlook. As I\u2019m sure you would expect this view is subject to a number of key considerations that yet to play fully out, including the full incidents and intensity levels we experience, the duration and ultimate impact on economic, employment, and business activity levels, and the duration and extent of disrupted care patterns as the virus runs its course. Beyond our maintained earnings per share outlook, we anticipate other key Investor Conference metrics likely will play out differently than we expected at that time. And our quarterly progression will likely vary from historical patterns. For example, the environment today suggests the second quarter could be the lowest medical care ratio of the year, potentially, meaningfully so with elective care demand still restrained. Offsetting this impact, we would anticipate the second half medical care ratio could be meaningfully elevated. Among some of the factors we consider, people will hopefully have more comprehensive care access by the second half of the year. And some of the currently deferred care can be restored. Individuals with chronic conditions are among those for whom we have considerable concern in this environment. While we are mitigating the impact through other means, mistreatments can aggravate health status, resulting in initially more intensive care needs as the system reopens. We will proactively work to help them quickly seek care and the impact of testing and coverage expansion such as serologic tests. These are just a few of the factors we must consider, and I\u2019m confident you are eager to probe into all of these areas and likely more. We appreciate your understanding of our need to defer on providing point estimates and even ranges today, given the evolving situation, the multi-variables at play and their interdependencies and our regard for the mini thoughtful views that will shape the situation. Our strong financial position and liquidity enable us to fully meet both of our operational and strategic needs. We ended the quarter with an intentionally higher excess cash balance and a higher than normal debt-to-capital ratio. This was a prudent response to what we saw in more volatile financial markets during the month of March. When considering our quarter ending excess corporate cash position, we size our debt to total capital ratio at about 40.5%. As markets become more normal, we will return to our previous cash management and leverage position. Given our critical relationship with our healthcare delivery partners, we moved quickly to implement policies to provide enhanced liquidity for care providers, by accelerating nearly $2 billion in payments, provided needed support to health systems and individual care providers. These types of actions are important to help provide more financial stability for the system. We expect some metrics such as days in medical claims payable and cash flow will be impacted as a result of these actions. Well, that will be transitory as we move through this situation together. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. I hope this gives you some insight into what we are seeing and the actions we are taking to serve people, communities and the health system during these unprecedented times. We are committed to applying the full capacity of our enterprise to serve, not just our patients, members, and customers, but also the hundreds of millions of people impacted across the nation and around the world. We will continue to protect our team members and their families, apply our skills, energy and broad capabilities to serve and aid others in this time of crisis. Our mission is to help people live healthier lives and to make the health system work better for everyone. This moment of challenge is proof of the resolve of the 325,000 women and men of UnitedHealth Group to achieve this mission, and you can also expect us to be fully prepared to excel on the other side of COVID-19, ready to respond to demand for health system resources and adapt our strategic priorities to emerging opportunities to lead in the development of the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. Let\u2019s open it up to questions please. One per person, so we can get to as many as possible. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Thank you very much. I'm wondering if we could get the quarter end IBNR before the quarter. And if you could just comment on OptumHealth\u2019s performance from 2007 to 2011? And how the business is different today in terms of more risk-based business? You've added some fee for service businesses. But how you'd expect the performance of OptumHealth to track versus how it performed back in the financial crisis? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Gary, could you \u2013 can you clarify the first part of your question please?\nGary Taylor: Yes. I\u2019m just hoping within the medical claims payable number you could give us the IBNR number that typically shows up in the Q?\nDavid Wichmann: Do you want the dollar estimate?\nGary Taylor: The dollar amount. Yes.\nJohn Rex: So Gary, this is John Rex here. We get our Q up very, very quickly and we'll have that for you. And you can follow-up with Brett also if you need any color on that particular metric.\nDavid Wichmann: And so, as for \u2013 I think you can see that our days payable are consistent with quarter end last quarter and then also slightly elevated year-over-year as well. So I think you can take something from that. And then also just generally speaking, what's gone on with development in terms of the continued conservative posture of the business and how it records its year \u2013 quarter end, year end and other IBNR estimates. Just also rely on the fact that it's [inconsistently] [ph] applied to the best of our ability as always and then formed not just by claim lags, but other things as well. So on OptumHealth I might suggest that rather than responding directly to your question, I just suggest it is right on our expectations. I know there's some commentary about it this morning, but it was definitely on our expectations. What people, I don't think realize about this business is that the elective and chronic disease management deferrals work both ways in a business that has two-thirds of its business, our revenues are risk-based and third of them are fee for service space. So you might want to think about that as you think about the performance expectations of this business going forward. I just want you to know I'm very proud of this team and how they've served and how they've adapted. And if I can, I'd ask Wyatt Decker to provide you with a few examples of how the team has performed.\nWyatt Decker: Thank you, David and thank you Gary for the question. Yes, to characterize the response to COVID-19 of Optum and OptumHealth, I would use four adjectives, courage, compassion, collaboration and a can do spirit. The over 65,000 doctors, nurses and advanced practitioners and others of this team had been on the front lines of the COVID response as you heard earlier from Dave and has stood up over 436 testing centers. We have dramatically scaled our ability to care for patients digitally, including through telehealth vehicles, and will by the end of this month have over 10,000 providers on telehealth platforms and solutions. We have been proud to be also on the front lines of innovation, collaborating with R&D on a whole host of solutions. And just as an example in New York and New Jersey, we have over 329 care sites including 49 urgent care centers and stood up the first drive through testing solution for the state of New Jersey and continued to work very closely with those States and the cities within them to respond effectively to COVID. So much more to come, we anticipate to emerge on the other side of this, a even more sophisticated digitally enabled national provider of health care that is focused on serving our patients and delivering value-based healthcare. Thank you, Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: So that was Dr. Wyatt Decker. I think most of you know Dr. Decker well enough by now having been with us for a while. But just as a reminder, he was the CEO of Mayo, Scottsdale, which is obviously one of their strongest flagship locations. He is also an emergency room physician, which clearly showed through in this crisis or showing through in this crisis, he is intensely calm right in the middle of the crisis. And if you think about the numbers and things they've had to deal with let's just say it's been an honor and privilege to have him here with us today. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First I wanted to dig into early trends on commercial membership. We'd love to hear what you're seeing in the commercial risk, both for instance, in terms of premium collections in April through mid month, right? How much have you collected in April, given all the uncertainty here versus a typical collection? And how many of your members you think have been furloughed? We're just trying to understand the impact of furlough versus unemployment. And then I know there is a lot of uncertainty out there, but if you go into commercial renewals that have to be priced for 7-1 and have to set Medicare bids in the next four to six weeks; a lot of questions on how you're going to bid or set price relative to the potential for deferred utilization coming back next year, possibility of a COVID return during flu season et cetera. So, any color you can give us on pricing as well will be really helpful. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. Thanks, Justin, for the question. So, on a premium relief, we're working with our customers on a daily basis to find the right solutions to ensure their employees can continue to have access to the care they need. I'll give you a little bit of numerical context. In a typical month, we extend grace periods or offer payment plans to customers. That represent about 0.4% of our premium base. For March one premiums, we collected most of the premiums prior to the COVID impact really kicking in. And these extensions increased to about 1% of our premium base. So for April 1 premium so far, the amount of extensions have grown to about 3% of our premium base. So, a little bit elevated, but we're going to continue to work with our customers on payment plans to give them the options for coverage that they need. Let me switch to your second question. You talked a little bit about commercial pricing. Of course, we're in the process of developing our pricing for 2021. We're closely monitoring the emerging COVID-19 information and including things like the claim experience from our members who have been diagnosed with the disease, as well as the abatement of other procedures. We're going to continue our commitment to pricing to our forward-look of costs, including estimates of things like significantly increased testing costs as well as hopefully the cost of the vaccine. Our view of the 2021 costs will continue to evolve as we learn more about the virus. The majority of our member [months] [ph] they should note are really priced after September. So, we'll have time to get a better view on what the 2021 environment will look like.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. And if it's okay, Dirk, the one of the more immediate needs as well as what we're doing on pricing for Medicare. So, Tim, do you want to take it?\nTim Noel: Good morning, Justin. Thanks for the question. As you know, some of the key inputs to the 2021 Medicare Advantage bid process were published by CMS only last week. So, really early in the process and we never harden our position at this stage. In 2021, as always, we strive to provide consistency and benefits for the members that we serve. We have a long track record of stable-to-improving benefits and have accomplished this in some challenging circumstances in the past. The HIT dynamics that played out over years are an example. So, too early to talk in detail about our benefits and some of the assumptions there. But our clear goal is stability. Stability is always extremely important to our members and it's especially important at a time like this.\nDavid Wichmann: Good, thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. Hope everyone is staying safe. So just a follow-up further around the commercial enrollment trends. And I guess I'm curious for 1Q 2020, curious how that membership shook out relative to your own expectations. I think there wasn't any impact yet related to the rise in unemployment in late March in those 1Q numbers. And how are you thinking about unemployment impact that overall membership for the overall company as the year progresses? I know you claimed that you may recapture or gain some members in the Medicaid book as well. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Dirk, you want to take that?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. So, thanks for the question. As I said in January, we were expecting to be down for both fully insured and self-funded membership in the first quarter. But we expected to gain that membership in both areas as we paced through the year. With the current COVID crisis, we expect to be down for the year as business is closed and employers reduced payroll associated in driving group attrition. At this early stage, I can't tell you what that will be. Again, I will say we'll continue with our pricing discipline and remain focused on delivering the unique value proposition for both our customers and consumers. We do expect to see, as you noted, increases in Medicaid and our individual products to ultimately offset some of the losses we experienced in the commercial group business.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. Just one quick confirmation question. Just on that $2 billion of accelerated payments to care providers, that's certainly commendable and very much appreciated on the receiving end. Just from an accounting standpoint, does that have any impact on the reported MLR of 81% in 1Q? Or does the timing, that change in your P&L from a cost recognition perspective around?\nJohn Rex: Hi, this John Rex here. No, it didn't have any impact on that.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. Just wanted to make sure.\nDavid Wichmann: It could affect our cash flows in the Q2. That maybe the way to think about it. Next question please. Thank you, Steven.\nOperator: And next is A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. And I'll also echo about everyone staying safe. John, you mentioned in your comments about the slowdown in some re-contracting RFPs. And that makes sense that people can have face-to-face meetings when they're considering big deals. I assume that, that would impact potentially group sales on the insurance side, the OptumRx selling season and the OptumInsight selling. Can you just maybe flesh out a little bit more of how big an impact that is? What you're seeing in those different businesses with respect to large sale activity?\nDavid Wichmann: So, A.J., it's Dave. [Indiscernible]. So, yes, just as this hit, there was a lot of activity in the commercial markets, let's call it, where folks were trying to get their employees to safe place, work at home, and to kind of reestablish our operations as you would expect. It isn't as if everything dried up, but it did slow down a lot. And at least as it relates to the commercial markets, I would expect that, that will come back online here as we get to the other side of COVID-19 or at least for a period of time. Where I think the other place I'd like you to have commentary on would be with Andrew Witty, if Andrew might want to talk a little bit about the impact of the COVID-19 on the appetite for health systems and health plans and others, I mean what their availability has been for business as well.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Thanks very much Dave. And A.J., thanks for the question. As Dave said, it's very interesting situation. I would say pipeline opportunities for Rx and for OptumInsight, very strong. The timings of meetings obviously disrupted by the COVID crisis, as Dave just referred to. Our focus really just now on the OptumInsight portfolio and pipeline, we're actually seeing significant engagement and interest, I'd say actually a step-up in terms of general interest for innovation of how to start thinking through to improve healthcare delivery, how to try and improve their economics as different players in the system become under pressure. We've seen particularly more and more interest in the John Muir type deal that we announced last year, the more comprehensive engaged system. So, timing is unpredictable. We just don't know. But in terms of appropriateness of our offering, well, the needs that we're hearing our clients and customers express, feel very good about that. And I would also say the team led by Robert Musslewhite at OptumInsight are working super hard in terms of innovating our offerings in response to the some of the new needs that are being expressed by our clients at this time. So I would say overall, feels like a continued meaningful opportunities for OptumInsight, timing unpredictable and we have to wait for a little bit more time to go by before we can be certain of when some of these things get closed.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, A.J. So my view is that we'll see a strong demand for Optum\u2019s value proposition, once we get to the other side of this situation. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I appreciate the commentary about the seasonality in MLR, lower in Q2 and then higher in the back half of the year. Do you guys have any just general thoughts and framework about, whenever things do get back to normal, I know that's still a moving target, but how much of what is deferred actually comes back when you see disruptions like this and how long does it take for that deferred volume to actually come back into the system?\nDavid Wichmann: You know, it'd be very difficult for us to project that at this stage, given all the uncertainties that are out there. Kevin, it's a really great question. It's something that we're going to monitor closely and I think by the time we get to the second quarter call, we would probably have a better view of all that. John, do you have anything you want to add?\nJohn Rex: I would just add that, this situation is just so different than anything we've seen before, when we look back at prior situations, when you've seen a cessation in demand, it's a different event. It's a hurricane, it's some other event where the system shuts down and when the system opens up, that demand comes back quite quickly actually as long as everything's up and operating. But this is one of the times where we just haven't been through it before either. So in terms of us trying to step out and understand, both when systems are up open and operating, when comfort levels are there to reengage with systems are elements that we certainly haven't experienced yet. And so I wouldn't want to step out and kind of predict the past that the past events that we've seen when something like this has occurred are predictive at all of that.\nDavid Wichmann: So, it'll have a lot to do with whether it comes back in the fall, what the timeframes are wearing off, whether the elective procedures come back online at what pace, there are just so many unknowns right now, Kevin. So I wish we could answer your question more fully and we hope to be able to provide you guys more guidance going forward. Next question please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. Just want to, first one was a clarification, when you're saying guidance is unchanged despite the moving parts and the metrics moving, is that just at this point you view the COVID impacts to be offsetting? Or is this just simply we're going to wait to change anything overall? And then my real question is just on the physician groups, you talked about two-thirds of the payments being capitated, so obviously that's a huge help from a liquidity perspective to the providers, but did that two-thirds of the total dollars of the OptumCare physicians or you talking about just two-thirds of the dollars from United HealthCare to the OptumCare providers?\nDavid Wichmann: Its cost the entire business, Josh.\nJohn Rex: And Josh, its John Rex, two-thirds of OptumHealth revenues are with our premium revenues, capitated revenues.\nJosh Raskin: Okay.\nDavid Wichmann: So obviously there's deferrals of services, their utilization is lower against their capitated base as an example. So as it relates to the guidance going forward, based upon what we see at this stage, we're maintaining that guidance is really not a whole lot more to be said about it, but I think John articulated well, which suggest that the elective deferrals today are offsetting COVID-19 costs. And what we are committed to today is to the extent that, that drives any imbalances in terms of performance or economics across the system. We're committed to rectifying those as swiftly as possible. Obviously we have to be thoughtful about how we go about that. But that's one of the commitments that we're making today.\nJohn Rex: Josh, clearly we have a number of surveillance tools that we use and kind of both the data and the direct communication. We have members, patients, our clinical workers, and all these are going to continue to inform our response and our forward planning.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Josh. Next question please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify and understand the commentary around sort of that what you just said in terms of ensuring financial imbalances are reconciled. Does that mean potentially rebating back this year beyond any MLR triggered or just hoping to understand the context a bit more there? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, it could be. So there's a number of things to take into consideration, there is challenges with health system funding and liquidity at the beginning, so we put $2 billion to work. There was clearly homelessness and insecurity issues evolving, so we put a fair amount of dollars to that. There was a shortage of PPE broadly across the country, including with our own care delivery capacity and we were remained resolved and committed to making sure that not only our health workforce, but the health workforce broadly stays protected. So not only did we source PPE, but we\u2019re also focused on generating new and innovative testing capacities that would resolve PPE use as well as keep broadly the health workforce safe across the globe. So those are all good examples of what I'll characterize as imbalances that occurred throughout and obviously there's the possibility of financial imbalances to occur as well. And, so as we think about those, employers are having furlough employees, they have no revenues today, they need and want to keep people in coverage. And it very well could be that in under the circumstances, deferrals of services outweigh COVID-19 costs, in those situations not only would there be normal MLR rebate situations, but we very may well find ourselves in a position where we can provide some additional premium relief to those clients. It remains to be seeing whether or not we are able to do so and to what extent, but it is something that we're deeply committed to doing. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone. My question is just thinking about the individual business and your current footprint there and if we assume that the economic impacts persist for a period of time and that impacts commercial group enrollment, just interested in your thinking about potential appetite for reentering the ACA exchange markets, that you had exited. And I guess just given the timing of when you need to submit those filings, I would assume that's probably the decision that, even though there's a lot of uncertainty right now, you guys are probably going to have to start thinking about right now. And just interested in how your thought process is right now on that?\nDavid Wichmann: Well, what you can count on is, it will make no staff reactions to this situation in terms of making strategic decisions about Group going into markets. But we have given this considerable thought leading up to the crisis and through it all. Dirk, would you want to comment?\nDirk McMahon: Yes, sure. Thanks Dave. Yes, we began to look at participating in more exchanges prior to the COVID-19 crisis. And so we're still in the process of going through market-by-market, evaluating the relative efficiency of our network, our ability to compete and states where we would like to extend Medicaid. You asked me that we\u2019ll have a more hardened view of our individual exchange intentions on the second quarter earnings call.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, one follow-up question and a real question. So first of all, understood obviously that it's very difficult to predict now the, when procedures are going to come back. But when you think about the capacity of the system to catch up on elective procedures, if we're going to see things coming back into fall or this is just kind of a 2Q phenomenon, how much capacity is there, to catch up by end of year versus what might spill over to second quarter? And, the follow-up question was on the pricing, your membership guidance provided in the 4Q assume some level of midyear renewals. So any color about pricing from midyear in light of all the puts and takes off the situation?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, I'll give the second question to Dirk. The first, we just don't know exactly when elective deferrals will come online and what the overall capacities are, broadly for them to come online given the circumstances, I think you just think about the evolution of this disease, how fast it came on in the United States, which is where 95% of our revenues are across our company. But think about the evolution of that and then think about the tail and then the possibility of it coming back or not. And the timing of the vaccine and the number of other things that need to be taken into consideration that they just create an uncertain future to get specific around things, our ability to respond to questions like you just asked. So I apologize that we can't, but it's just very difficult for us to give you the responses to those kinds of details. Dirk, you want to talk about mid-years?\nDirk McMahon: Yes, well, like I said, to begin with, the majority of our member months to start off with were \u2013 pricing for the majority of our member months, for 2021 we are going to be priced after September. So we'll have a little bit better view. Now, many of the midyear renewals are sort of going out the door. So that's sort of the scenario we're in.\nDavid Wichmann: And let's say, as it relates to our care delivery practices, we've been evolving the ways in which we provide care and ensuring that our chronic members who have also deferred treatment, that they have the option to get treatment through these telehealth capacities, the way in which we're working on OptumRx to make sure that they are compliant with their pharmacy solutions and the way in which general pharmacies are available and community mental health centers and federally qualified health centers to ensure that those patients who have high needs are attended to as well. So there's evolutions that are going on underneath, what's happened here to make sure that we're opening up capacities in new and different ways. And then the only other thing I would say is that when we get to the other side of COVID-19, our operations are all standing ready to respond to the demands that might be there. So our ambulatory surgical care centers will be available immediately to respond to the demands, the pent up demands that will exist for joint replacements and the number of other things that they do so well. So part of what we're doing is, making sure that when we get to the other side, we're ready. And not only ready to respond to the immediate demands, but also we're ready to adjust and evolve our business strategies to respond to the things that we've learned through this crisis. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: And next is Charles Rhyee with Cowen, please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. So I know you guys have been hesitant to put hard numbers around how you expect elected procedures to sort of rebound back, particularly in the back half of this year, but Johnson & Johnson on its earnings calling yesterday noted that, there was a slide on the presentation like the procedure volumes to be down about 55% to 80%, in second quarter, but third quarter also down about 40%, with the rebound really above baseline coming in 4Q of around 15%. This seems sort of more conservative in terms of a rebound than you\u2019re kind of noting. Maybe can you kind of give us some of your thoughts on what\u2019s behind your assumptions? And \u2013 or is your thoughts on how they\u2019re looking at the situation perhaps? And then, John, I know you said that this is not like other situations; obviously, in natural disasters, things bounce back fairly quickly because the demand hasn\u2019t really gone away. Is may be looking at something like the financial crisis a better proxy then or how we might think about elective procedures kind of coming back? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Hey, thanks, Charles. So a couple of thoughts, and then I won\u2019t opine on anyone else\u2019s, any other company\u2019s comments they put out there. But let me just kind of try to give you a few of our comments. I think one of the very important things to keep in mind in this extremely different situation are the co-dependencies and the interplays across a business like us, in terms of all the things you\u2019re describing. And so, when we talk about, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know right now and we\u2019re actually not going to try to make calls to some of those. Keep in mind that there are factors that move differently in a diverse enterprise like this. Intensity levels, durations of the virus impact also the duration and intensity of the deferral of elective procedures. So, there are factors in there as you go across the range of options that we consider the multi-variable factors that we look at when considering our outlook that interplay. And so, that informs kind of how we think about \u2013 how we just think about trying to consider different way that things would play out. And certainly, Dave did mention that, yes, and I mentioned also that we did \u2013 we have seen declines in procedural volumes and we saw those starting kind of late in March and those continued into April. But trying to use some of these other examples, even as you mentioned, the financial crisis as a measure, from our perspective aren\u2019t necessarily still measures that we think are all that instructive because we haven\u2019t seen a cessation in activity before like this. And the reasons for this cessation in activity are very, very different and the duration of those also is quite different. So, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d even go to that one as kind of \u2013 as the instructive measure for us.\nCharles Rhyee: Great. Thank you, John.\nDavid Wichmann: Next question please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wondered, my question\u2019s on capital deployment. I wondered if you might comment on how the crisis is impacting your thinking around that with maybe two opposing specific thoughts, one being your comments around conservation of liquidity at the corporate level, but then also the thought around say larger health systems being more capable of responding to a crisis like this and the strain on some providers perhaps presenting some consolidation opportunities? So, wondering if you might comment on capital deployment.\nDavid Wichmann: John.\nJohn Rex: Sure. So, I think our long-term capital deployment strategies remain. Our long-term capital deployment strategy is absolutely in terms of how we think about allocation of capital into our businesses, into new organic growth opportunities, M&A opportunities, and as we think about things like dividend and share repurchase also. And clearly, you saw, we responded, we are in the fortunate position of being able to respond to what we saw as some instability in the financial markets in March, by increasing our cash position in order to fortify that, and in part and kind of given the role that we play in being reliable partners for the broad health care delivery community. And so, that part being important, you can be sure that as we think about things in kind of the very near term, we\u2019re respectful of markets, that is financial markets and how they\u2019re behaving, and we\u2019ll continue to be respectful of those and understand kind of that they are functioning and functioning fluidly as we consider those elements. And that may impact the timing of how we think about different capital allocation activities. We\u2019re going to be super respectful of that because of the important role that we play in the health system and our obligations to be \u2013 provide health security for the people we serve and to be ready, enable and reliable partners for the health care delivery community broadly.\nDave Windley: Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. My comments would be that is exceptionally well capitalized company. It\u2019s been maintained with the capital structure, been maintained very consistently with high integrity. And I think it\u2019s one of the strengths of an organization going into the situation to have the capital structure that we have today and the financial backing broadly. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question is from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, good morning. I appreciate all that you guys are doing. I thought it was a great job outlining the number of things that you are contributing to the system. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions, really more OptumHealth OptumCare related. And it\u2019s just one variant of the same question. For right now, could you describe how you\u2019re standing up telehealth enablement and virtual care delivery within the services? And then before you get to the kind of post-COVID, as you\u2019re thinking about that transition period as you\u2019re ramping back \u2013 as the economy is ramping back into service, have you guys come up with perhaps how you will scale back? Meaning, are you going to be doing temperatures, masks for patients, things like that to try to get a sense of how quickly you can start to ramp back in the ASC business and some of the other physician businesses?\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Lance and appreciate your comments about the company\u2019s performance during this timeframe. Dr. Wyatt Decker?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thank you, Lance, for your question. And on the digital health and telemedicine side, we have both our internal capabilities, which we\u2019re leveraging extensively including telepsychiatry, that\u2019s the nation\u2019s largest telepsychiatry platform. We\u2019re also working with partners, collaborators and vendors and have over half a dozen national partners who are assisting us to stand up solutions quickly. I would also add that we believe that telemedicine is not all created equal and we\u2019re very focused on keeping the personal and intimate nature of healthcare alive and well. One of the ways we\u2019re doing that is by making sure whatever possible that our OptumCare patients can reach out to their already established provider using telemedicine, which is a very different experience than a random or unknown provider, as an example. So, we\u2019ll continue to leverage this. We\u2019re also leveraging the Internet of Things, caring for people in their home and AI-enabled symptom checkers as other examples of how we\u2019re really dramatically accelerating our digital health solutions. And then to your second part of your question around the other side of this and how do we adapt? Obviously, that\u2019s something that is evolving. We will, of course, work and have been working hand-in-glove with local, state and federal recommendations and authorities on when is it safe to resume elective and scheduled care and procedures. We will also, as Dave mentioned, are taking great care of our health care workforce, so that they are able to resume activities really quickly, which we expect to be a differentiator. And then the final thing I\u2019d say is that when you look at OptumHealth, one of the remarkable things is what a resilient and diversified health care business it is. So, we\u2019re in 43 states. We have ambulatory care surgical centers, we have primary care, we have specialty care and because the COVID epidemic and pandemic is playing out differently across the United States, we feel we\u2019re really well positioned and have been able to keep our workforce busy, contributing to the communities they serve, while we adapt to this changing environment. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: And one of the things we did was, as part of all, is we created a \u2013 leveraging that swabbing testing capability, so it allows for self-administration in a clinical setting. We also, alongside that developed a new test \u2013 set of testing protocols, procedures and applied technologies for the health workforce. And part of it was to ensure that that workforce is safe to apply their services, but also that we were able to ensure that they were as fully available as possible, which I know is on the top of mind for each and every one of them. So that technology, those protocols, that process that was developed, likely find its way not only into a clinical setting but also could find its way into other essential business settings as well, as a normal course of business going forward. So, we could see applying those types of concepts across OptumCare but frankly across the industry. We have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you. You\u2019ve had a lot of success with engaging physicians to taking risk. And I\u2019m just curious how do you think this long-term impact of the pandemic will affect the interest from physicians in participating in the risk model? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: I think as it relates to this one, at least so far, they probably have performed just fine. Obviously, it will remind a number of them about how important it is to align with certain partners that have a strong financial standing. And I would characterize UnitedHealth Group, in particular, Optum and OptumCare as being those kinds of entities. So, I hope what they do is they seek a greater sense of alignment towards, with partners or choose their partners based upon the strength of them in multiple different dimensions. And I think Wyatt has done a great job of building that business in a multi-dimensional way with a great number of strength. So, hopefully we\u2019ll see greater alignment to UnitedHealth Group.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for your questions and thank you all for your time and your questions today. As we\u2019ve shared with you, we\u2019re going to continue to apply the full breadth of our resources, technologies, innovations, and compassion to support our members, our patients, provider partners, our team and the broader health system as we see our way through this global health crisis together. Please be safe each and every one of you and thank you for your time today.\nOperator: And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

            "name": "Dirk McMahon",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Justin, for the question. So, on a premium relief, we're working with our customers on a daily basis to find the right solutions to ensure their employees can continue to have access to the care they need. I'll give you a little bit of numerical context. In a typical month, we extend grace periods or offer payment plans to customers. That represent about 0.4% of our premium base. For March one premiums, we collected most of the premiums prior to the COVID impact really kicking in. And these extensions increased to about 1% of our premium base. So for April 1 premium so far, the amount of extensions have grown to about 3% of our premium base. So, a little bit elevated, but we're going to continue to work with our customers on payment plans to give them the options for coverage that they need. Let me switch to your second question. You talked a little bit about commercial pricing. Of course, we're in the process of developing our pricing for 2021. We're closely monitoring the emerging COVID-19 information and including things like the claim experience from our members who have been diagnosed with the disease, as well as the abatement of other procedures. We're going to continue our commitment to pricing to our forward-look of costs, including estimates of things like significantly increased testing costs as well as hopefully the cost of the vaccine. Our view of the 2021 costs will continue to evolve as we learn more about the virus. The majority of our member [months] [ph] they should note are really priced after September. So, we'll have time to get a better view on what the 2021 environment will look like. Yes. So, thanks for the question.

            "content": "Thank you, David and thank you Gary for the question. Yes, to characterize the response to COVID-19 of Optum and OptumHealth, I would use four adjectives, courage, compassion, collaboration and a can do spirit. The over 65,000 doctors, nurses and advanced practitioners and others of this team had been on the front lines of the COVID response as you heard earlier from Dave and has stood up over 436 testing centers. We have dramatically scaled our ability to care for patients digitally, including through telehealth vehicles, and will by the end of this month have over 10,000 providers on telehealth platforms and solutions. We have been proud to be also on the front lines of innovation, collaborating with R&D on a whole host of solutions. And just as an example in New York and New Jersey, we have over 329 care sites including 49 urgent care centers and stood up the first drive through testing solution for the state of New Jersey and continued to work very closely with those States and the cities within them to respond effectively to COVID. So much more to come, we anticipate to emerge on the other side of this, a even more sophisticated digitally enabled national provider of health care that is focused on serving our patients and delivering value-based healthcare. Thank you, Dave. Yes. Thank you, Lance, for your question. And on the digital health and telemedicine side, we have both our internal capabilities, which we're leveraging extensively including telepsychiatry, that's the nation's largest telepsychiatry platform. We're also working with partners, collaborators and vendors and have over half a dozen national partners who are assisting us to stand up solutions quickly. I would also add that we believe that telemedicine is not all created equal and we're very focused on keeping the personal and intimate nature of healthcare alive and well. One of the ways we're doing that is by making sure whatever possible that our OptumCare patients can reach out to their already established provider using telemedicine, which is a very different experience than a random or unknown provider, as an example. So, we'll continue to leverage this. We're also leveraging the Internet of Things, caring for people in their home and AI-enabled symptom checkers as other examples of how we're really dramatically accelerating our digital health solutions. And then to your second part of your question around the other side of this and how do we adapt? Obviously, that's something that is evolving. We will, of course, work and have been working hand-in-glove with local, state and federal recommendations and authorities on when is it safe to resume elective and scheduled care and procedures. We will also, as Dave mentioned, are taking great care of our health care workforce, so that they are able to resume activities really quickly, which we expect to be a differentiator. And then the final thing I'd say is that when you look at OptumHealth, one of the remarkable things is what a resilient and diversified health care business it is. So, we're in 43 states. We have ambulatory care surgical centers, we have primary care, we have specialty care and because the COVID epidemic and pandemic is playing out differently across the United States, we feel we're really well positioned and have been able to keep our workforce busy, contributing to the communities they serve, while we adapt to this changing environment. Thank you."

            "name": "David Wichmann",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With all that is going on, we've structured things a bit differently today. We'll get directly to what's likely top of mind for all of you, the impact of COVID-19, global health crisis on our businesses and the actions we're taking to support our communities, members, patients, care providers, customers, government partners, and team members and their family. These are still the early days in the response to COVID-19 and we anticipate we will experience and learn more as events unfold in the months ahead. UnitedHealth Group was consciously built, with the restless mindset, adaptable capabilities, culture and the enduring human values to respond and serve in meeting challenges such as we are seeing today. The commitment, ingenuity, compassion and engagement of the 325,000 people of UnitedHealth Group has never been stronger. I'll start today by expressing my gratitude and admiration to this restless team for the extraordinary efforts and personal sacrifices being made every day. They are doctors, nurses, pharmacists, social workers and other clinical and nonclinical healthcare workers on the front lines of care, as well as customer care representatives, transaction processors, supply chain experts, technology engineers, data scientists and others supporting them, the health system and our communities. The COVID-19 pandemic is deeply personal to them and to all of us. They're connected digitally, triaging people with symptoms, engaging directly with our most vulnerable patients, ensuring essential chronic and COVID-19 related medical and behavioral health services are available and accessed, while helping keep the health system coordinated, connected and working for individuals and their doctors. They're enhancing safety for those most at risk, making sure the right medicines are getting to the right patients, when and where they need it, and the right testing and protective gear is available to properly safeguard the health workforce. They're driving innovative solutions around testing, healthcare workforce safety, improving critical product supply and services availability, helping develop and evaluate therapies and applying advanced analytics to identify, predict and combat COVID-19. For our heroic clinical team, we have further hardened our safety first workforce environment for those caring for patients across our more than 1,500 facilities and those providing medications and services caring for people in their homes. Like all of us, they are concerned about the health and safety of their own families and friends. Yet, they remain front and center engaging fully each day to serve many selflessly away from their families for weeks, so they can ensure care is provided to those most in need. I have never been more proud or more humbled to be on their team. Every team member at UnitedHealth Group remains fully employed, supported, protected and engaged in the COVID-19 crisis. Let me pause to acknowledge and add a note of deep gratitude to Andrew Witty, who has announced this morning will be taking a leave of absence to provide leadership for the efforts of the World Health Organization to find and distribute a vaccine for COVID-19. Our gratitude for Andrew is grounded in all he has done to guide the UnitedHealth Group and Optum so effectively and sensitively for all who we serve and all who work at this enterprise and his willingness to apply his leadership and phenomenal talents to this new assignment for which he is so aptly suited. We couldn't be more proud to call one of our own to see one of our own serve in this way and we look forward to both his success in leading this effort and his return to our company once this important work is done. He is on the call with us today and available to respond to your questions before he reports to duty with the World Health Organization. From the outset of COVID-19 outbreak, we mobilized to keep our entire enterprise fully intact and functioning at the highest performance levels. As we stand today, we are supporting all of our products, services and commitments across all of our businesses and markets. We have long had a high proportion of our more than 200,000 person, nonclinical team working from home and we were able to quickly move nearly all of the rest to work at home as well. They have been performing well and our service levels remain strong for our clients, members, patients and the health system broadly. For the millions of people we are privileged to serve through United HealthCare. We have taken every step possible to broaden access to care. We have offered additional enrollment opportunities to those who previously declined employer sponsored offerings, eliminated all COVID-19 related cost sharings and removed prior authorizations to speed patient transitions of care, so health systems can diagnose, treat, and redirect patients. We have developed revised payment timeframes to help people sustain coverage and we are helping people displaced from their job to smoothly transition to affordable coverage which meets their needs. Last week we moved to provide nearly $2 billion in liquidity to the health system, accelerating payments to care providers whose clinical operations have been impacted. We have been partnering with other companies and academic institutions to develop and validate protocols and processes to more rapidly and frequently test healthcare professionals on the frontline, applying new technology to ensure safe and full availability of this critical workforce. This leverages the self-administered collection innovation we developed, which is simplifying COVID-19 testing and we have been tracking infectious disease pattern to identify supply-demand inequities and resource needs in every major metropolitan statistical area across the U.S. health system. This will emerge as a new capability to provide enhanced disease surveillance in the future. Our high-risk members have been identified and we are surrounding them with services to reduce the impacts of social isolation on their access to physical and behavioral care, while keeping them as safe as possible. And we have provided over $50 million in initial domestic and global grant funding and investments to advance health workforce safety, support those in geographies most afflicted, aid seniors secluded in their homes, and help communities address rising levels of homelessness and food and security. Like the broader health system in recent weeks, we have seen a reduction in elective care, which is impacting both the UnitedHealthcare benefits and the OptumCare delivery businesses. Most traditional procedure work has been postponed at our SCA ambulatory surgery centers. Likewise, the UnitedHealthcare and Optum at-risk care delivery businesses have seen lower demand for these services. We are seeing timeframes and discussions for new business opportunities being extended as most business partners focus on crisis response. Many employers have had to furlough employees, driving higher levels of unemployment, which may ultimately affect the outlook for growth in our Group Benefits business, while increasing our membership in individual lines and Medicaid coverages. While it feels awkward to be talking about earnings outlook at this moment, you saw our press release; we are maintaining our 2020 earnings per share outlook established at our Investor Conference. We view this as the most reasonable baseline posture in these uncertain times as we continue to grow and operate our businesses, while assessing the multitude of potentially offsetting factors across our uniquely diverse enterprise. These factors will become clear in the months to come. The related financial effects on our business will clarify as well. As they do, we commit to providing swift relief, even as we consider the uncertainty of the environment going forward. While there is still much to understand, we can be very clear with you today that we are committed to ensuring that any financial imbalances, which arise from this situation, are reconciled proactively and addressed fairly and timely for all those we serve. Let me now share a few of the specific actions underway at Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum has cared directly for more than 10,000 COVID-19 patients to-date and is operating more than 400 test sites across the country. We quickly shifted more than 4,000 additional OptumCare physicians to our digital care clinics on our way to more than 10,000 in the weeks to come. These rapid responses was made possible by the swift work of the regulatory agencies, allowing flexibility in state licensure requirements for clinicians across service categories and state lines. We thank and commend them for these actions and encourage long-term continuation of these policies. Our digital health consumer engagement has accelerated in many directions. For example, we've applied new COVID-19 clinical pathways for our device based remote monitoring services to identify and prioritize high-risk individuals for follow-up care. Our newly developed COVID-19 symptom checker provides people with recommendations on how to proceed, based on the results. And we've provided access to our digital behavioral healthcare services, which give clients on-demand help for stress, anxiety, and depression. All content, coping tools and peer support are free to everyone. Because it's critical everyone receives their needed medications, we are providing early refills, extended authorizations and increased home delivery options. We also extended hours at our behavioral health pharmacies to ensure medication adherence for those with mental health and substance abuse challenges. The spread of the virus has created a significant health risk for those receiving life-sustaining infusion services traditionally administered in the hospital or hospital clinic settings. For these patients, we're providing infusion services through our Optum Infusion ambulatory suites and in their homes through our nurse infusion specialists. Finally, Optum is innovating on the frontlines of care delivery, developing screening protocols to identify patients who are likely to need hospitalizations and collaborating with health and care delivery organizations to share this knowledge. UnitedHealthcare is working at full speed as well with partners across the health system to address the current global emergency. For consumers, UnitedHealthcare has made it simple and easy to access care, waiving cost sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment and eliminating many administrative requirements. Tens of thousands of people have taken advantage of the special enrollment period we opened for those needing coverage for health benefits, and more than 2 million consumers took advantage of our offer to obtain early prescription drug refills to ensure no one experienced gaps in treatment. UnitedHealthcare digital and telehealth services were ready, and as a result, extensively used as a safe simple and free way to connect with care providers, either through a partner or directly with the patients' own doctor. UnitedHealthcare is paying careful attention to vulnerable members especially in Medicare and Medicaid by expanding access to our personalized digital care platforms, which provide up-to-date information about prevention, coverage and care. People can quickly talk to a nurse, refill and schedule home delivery for prescriptions and get access to emotional support 24 hours a day. We are also helping federal, state and local authorities address system capacity shortages by supporting them with the main operating experience. One example involves two UHC Community and State leaders, Dr. Jeffrey Brenner and Kathleen Stillo, who are now working exclusively with the State of New Jersey, for the next several months to establish a critically needed field-based hospital system. These are just a few examples of how the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare have mobilized to respond to this public health challenge. There are many more and they are happening every day. Now, I'll turn it over to John Rex, our Chief Financial Officer. Thank you, John. I hope this gives you some insight into what we are seeing and the actions we are taking to serve people, communities and the health system during these unprecedented times. We are committed to applying the full capacity of our enterprise to serve, not just our patients, members, and customers, but also the hundreds of millions of people impacted across the nation and around the world. We will continue to protect our team members and their families, apply our skills, energy and broad capabilities to serve and aid others in this time of crisis. Our mission is to help people live healthier lives and to make the health system work better for everyone. This moment of challenge is proof of the resolve of the 325,000 women and men of UnitedHealth Group to achieve this mission, and you can also expect us to be fully prepared to excel on the other side of COVID-19, ready to respond to demand for health system resources and adapt our strategic priorities to emerging opportunities to lead in the development of the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. Let's open it up to questions please. One per person, so we can get to as many as possible. Thank you. Gary, could you \u2013 can you clarify the first part of your question please? Do you want the dollar estimate? And so, as for \u2013 I think you can see that our days payable are consistent with quarter end last quarter and then also slightly elevated year-over-year as well. So I think you can take something from that. And then also just generally speaking, what's gone on with development in terms of the continued conservative posture of the business and how it records its year \u2013 quarter end, year end and other IBNR estimates. Just also rely on the fact that it's [inconsistently] [ph] applied to the best of our ability as always and then formed not just by claim lags, but other things as well. So on OptumHealth I might suggest that rather than responding directly to your question, I just suggest it is right on our expectations. I know there's some commentary about it this morning, but it was definitely on our expectations. What people, I don't think realize about this business is that the elective and chronic disease management deferrals work both ways in a business that has two-thirds of its business, our revenues are risk-based and third of them are fee for service space. So you might want to think about that as you think about the performance expectations of this business going forward. I just want you to know I'm very proud of this team and how they've served and how they've adapted. And if I can, I'd ask Wyatt Decker to provide you with a few examples of how the team has performed. So that was Dr. Wyatt Decker. I think most of you know Dr. Decker well enough by now having been with us for a while. But just as a reminder, he was the CEO of Mayo, Scottsdale, which is obviously one of their strongest flagship locations. He is also an emergency room physician, which clearly showed through in this crisis or showing through in this crisis, he is intensely calm right in the middle of the crisis. And if you think about the numbers and things they've had to deal with let's just say it's been an honor and privilege to have him here with us today. Next question, please. Okay, Dirk? Yes. And if it's okay, Dirk, the one of the more immediate needs as well as what we're doing on pricing for Medicare. So, Tim, do you want to take it? Good, thank you. Next question, please. Dirk, you want to take that? It could affect our cash flows in the Q2. That maybe the way to think about it. Next question please. Thank you, Steven. So, A.J., it's Dave. [Indiscernible]. So, yes, just as this hit, there was a lot of activity in the commercial markets, let's call it, where folks were trying to get their employees to safe place, work at home, and to kind of reestablish our operations as you would expect. It isn't as if everything dried up, but it did slow down a lot. And at least as it relates to the commercial markets, I would expect that, that will come back online here as we get to the other side of COVID-19 or at least for a period of time. Where I think the other place I'd like you to have commentary on would be with Andrew Witty, if Andrew might want to talk a little bit about the impact of the COVID-19 on the appetite for health systems and health plans and others, I mean what their availability has been for business as well. Thank you, A.J. So my view is that we'll see a strong demand for Optum's value proposition, once we get to the other side of this situation. Next question please. You know, it'd be very difficult for us to project that at this stage, given all the uncertainties that are out there. Kevin, it's a really great question. It's something that we're going to monitor closely and I think by the time we get to the second quarter call, we would probably have a better view of all that. John, do you have anything you want to add? So, it'll have a lot to do with whether it comes back in the fall, what the timeframes are wearing off, whether the elective procedures come back online at what pace, there are just so many unknowns right now, Kevin. So I wish we could answer your question more fully and we hope to be able to provide you guys more guidance going forward. Next question please. Its cost the entire business, Josh. So obviously there's deferrals of services, their utilization is lower against their capitated base as an example. So as it relates to the guidance going forward, based upon what we see at this stage, we're maintaining that guidance is really not a whole lot more to be said about it, but I think John articulated well, which suggest that the elective deferrals today are offsetting COVID-19 costs. And what we are committed to today is to the extent that, that drives any imbalances in terms of performance or economics across the system. We're committed to rectifying those as swiftly as possible. Obviously we have to be thoughtful about how we go about that. But that's one of the commitments that we're making today. Thank you, Josh. Next question please. Yes, it could be. So there's a number of things to take into consideration, there is challenges with health system funding and liquidity at the beginning, so we put $2 billion to work. There was clearly homelessness and insecurity issues evolving, so we put a fair amount of dollars to that. There was a shortage of PPE broadly across the country, including with our own care delivery capacity and we were remained resolved and committed to making sure that not only our health workforce, but the health workforce broadly stays protected. So not only did we source PPE, but we're also focused on generating new and innovative testing capacities that would resolve PPE use as well as keep broadly the health workforce safe across the globe. So those are all good examples of what I'll characterize as imbalances that occurred throughout and obviously there's the possibility of financial imbalances to occur as well. And, so as we think about those, employers are having furlough employees, they have no revenues today, they need and want to keep people in coverage. And it very well could be that in under the circumstances, deferrals of services outweigh COVID-19 costs, in those situations not only would there be normal MLR rebate situations, but we very may well find ourselves in a position where we can provide some additional premium relief to those clients. It remains to be seeing whether or not we are able to do so and to what extent, but it is something that we're deeply committed to doing. Next question please. Well, what you can count on is, it will make no staff reactions to this situation in terms of making strategic decisions about Group going into markets. But we have given this considerable thought leading up to the crisis and through it all. Dirk, would you want to comment? Okay. Next question please. Yes, I'll give the second question to Dirk. The first, we just don't know exactly when elective deferrals will come online and what the overall capacities are, broadly for them to come online given the circumstances, I think you just think about the evolution of this disease, how fast it came on in the United States, which is where 95% of our revenues are across our company. But think about the evolution of that and then think about the tail and then the possibility of it coming back or not. And the timing of the vaccine and the number of other things that need to be taken into consideration that they just create an uncertain future to get specific around things, our ability to respond to questions like you just asked. So I apologize that we can't, but it's just very difficult for us to give you the responses to those kinds of details. Dirk, you want to talk about mid-years? And let's say, as it relates to our care delivery practices, we've been evolving the ways in which we provide care and ensuring that our chronic members who have also deferred treatment, that they have the option to get treatment through these telehealth capacities, the way in which we're working on OptumRx to make sure that they are compliant with their pharmacy solutions and the way in which general pharmacies are available and community mental health centers and federally qualified health centers to ensure that those patients who have high needs are attended to as well. So there's evolutions that are going on underneath, what's happened here to make sure that we're opening up capacities in new and different ways. And then the only other thing I would say is that when we get to the other side of COVID-19, our operations are all standing ready to respond to the demands that might be there. So our ambulatory surgical care centers will be available immediately to respond to the demands, the pent up demands that will exist for joint replacements and the number of other things that they do so well. So part of what we're doing is, making sure that when we get to the other side, we're ready. And not only ready to respond to the immediate demands, but also we're ready to adjust and evolve our business strategies to respond to the things that we've learned through this crisis. Thank you. Next question please. Next question please. John. Thank you. My comments would be that is exceptionally well capitalized company. It's been maintained with the capital structure, been maintained very consistently with high integrity. And I think it's one of the strengths of an organization going into the situation to have the capital structure that we have today and the financial backing broadly. Next question please. Great. Thank you, Lance and appreciate your comments about the company's performance during this timeframe. Dr. Wyatt Decker? And one of the things we did was, as part of all, is we created a \u2013 leveraging that swabbing testing capability, so it allows for self-administration in a clinical setting. We also, alongside that developed a new test \u2013 set of testing protocols, procedures and applied technologies for the health workforce. And part of it was to ensure that that workforce is safe to apply their services, but also that we were able to ensure that they were as fully available as possible, which I know is on the top of mind for each and every one of them. So that technology, those protocols, that process that was developed, likely find its way not only into a clinical setting but also could find its way into other essential business settings as well, as a normal course of business going forward. So, we could see applying those types of concepts across OptumCare but frankly across the industry. We have time for one more question, please. I think as it relates to this one, at least so far, they probably have performed just fine. Obviously, it will remind a number of them about how important it is to align with certain partners that have a strong financial standing. And I would characterize UnitedHealth Group, in particular, Optum and OptumCare as being those kinds of entities. So, I hope what they do is they seek a greater sense of alignment towards, with partners or choose their partners based upon the strength of them in multiple different dimensions. And I think Wyatt has done a great job of building that business in a multi-dimensional way with a great number of strength. So, hopefully we'll see greater alignment to UnitedHealth Group. Thank you for your questions and thank you all for your time and your questions today. As we've shared with you, we're going to continue to apply the full breadth of our resources, technologies, innovations, and compassion to support our members, our patients, provider partners, our team and the broader health system as we see our way through this global health crisis together. Please be safe each and every one of you and thank you for your time today."

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks very much Dave. And A.J., thanks for the question. As Dave said, it's very interesting situation. I would say pipeline opportunities for Rx and for OptumInsight, very strong. The timings of meetings obviously disrupted by the COVID crisis, as Dave just referred to. Our focus really just now on the OptumInsight portfolio and pipeline, we're actually seeing significant engagement and interest, I'd say actually a step-up in terms of general interest for innovation of how to start thinking through to improve healthcare delivery, how to try and improve their economics as different players in the system become under pressure. We've seen particularly more and more interest in the John Muir type deal that we announced last year, the more comprehensive engaged system. So, timing is unpredictable. We just don't know. But in terms of appropriateness of our offering, well, the needs that we're hearing our clients and customers express, feel very good about that. And I would also say the team led by Robert Musslewhite at OptumInsight are working super hard in terms of innovating our offerings in response to the some of the new needs that are being expressed by our clients at this time. So I would say overall, feels like a continued meaningful opportunities for OptumInsight, timing unpredictable and we have to wait for a little bit more time to go by before we can be certain of when some of these things get closed."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. I know you've had an opportunity to look through our first quarter financial results this morning. And as such, given the unique circumstances, I'll be brief about the quarter. As Dave said, while it feels somewhat uncomfortable to be speaking of the financial aspects of this challenging situation, we know this is what you need to understand for your work. Given the timing of the COVID-19 outbreak and its progression in United States, the first quarter financial impact was limited. As you know, incidence rates in the U.S. only started moving meaningfully in mid-March. And elective care trends did not begin to be meaningfully impacted until later in the month. At the segment level, UnitedHealthcare and the OptumHealth, Insight, and Rx businesses all reported first quarter operating earnings that were in line with our own expectations going into the year. Looking ahead, we are maintaining our full-year 2020 earnings per share outlook. As I'm sure you would expect this view is subject to a number of key considerations that yet to play fully out, including the full incidents and intensity levels we experience, the duration and ultimate impact on economic, employment, and business activity levels, and the duration and extent of disrupted care patterns as the virus runs its course. Beyond our maintained earnings per share outlook, we anticipate other key Investor Conference metrics likely will play out differently than we expected at that time. And our quarterly progression will likely vary from historical patterns. For example, the environment today suggests the second quarter could be the lowest medical care ratio of the year, potentially, meaningfully so with elective care demand still restrained. Offsetting this impact, we would anticipate the second half medical care ratio could be meaningfully elevated. Among some of the factors we consider, people will hopefully have more comprehensive care access by the second half of the year. And some of the currently deferred care can be restored. Individuals with chronic conditions are among those for whom we have considerable concern in this environment. While we are mitigating the impact through other means, mistreatments can aggravate health status, resulting in initially more intensive care needs as the system reopens. We will proactively work to help them quickly seek care and the impact of testing and coverage expansion such as serologic tests. These are just a few of the factors we must consider, and I'm confident you are eager to probe into all of these areas and likely more. We appreciate your understanding of our need to defer on providing point estimates and even ranges today, given the evolving situation, the multi-variables at play and their interdependencies and our regard for the mini thoughtful views that will shape the situation. Our strong financial position and liquidity enable us to fully meet both of our operational and strategic needs. We ended the quarter with an intentionally higher excess cash balance and a higher than normal debt-to-capital ratio. This was a prudent response to what we saw in more volatile financial markets during the month of March. When considering our quarter ending excess corporate cash position, we size our debt to total capital ratio at about 40.5%. As markets become more normal, we will return to our previous cash management and leverage position. Given our critical relationship with our healthcare delivery partners, we moved quickly to implement policies to provide enhanced liquidity for care providers, by accelerating nearly $2 billion in payments, provided needed support to health systems and individual care providers. These types of actions are important to help provide more financial stability for the system. We expect some metrics such as days in medical claims payable and cash flow will be impacted as a result of these actions. Well, that will be transitory as we move through this situation together. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave. So Gary, this is John Rex here. We get our Q up very, very quickly and we'll have that for you. And you can follow-up with Brett also if you need any color on that particular metric. Hi, this John Rex here. No, it didn't have any impact on that. I would just add that, this situation is just so different than anything we've seen before, when we look back at prior situations, when you've seen a cessation in demand, it's a different event. It's a hurricane, it's some other event where the system shuts down and when the system opens up, that demand comes back quite quickly actually as long as everything's up and operating. But this is one of the times where we just haven't been through it before either. So in terms of us trying to step out and understand, both when systems are up open and operating, when comfort levels are there to reengage with systems are elements that we certainly haven't experienced yet. And so I wouldn't want to step out and kind of predict the past that the past events that we've seen when something like this has occurred are predictive at all of that. And Josh, its John Rex, two-thirds of OptumHealth revenues are with our premium revenues, capitated revenues. Josh, clearly we have a number of surveillance tools that we use and kind of both the data and the direct communication. We have members, patients, our clinical workers, and all these are going to continue to inform our response and our forward planning. Sure. Hey, thanks, Charles. So a couple of thoughts, and then I won't opine on anyone else's, any other company's comments they put out there. But let me just kind of try to give you a few of our comments. I think one of the very important things to keep in mind in this extremely different situation are the co-dependencies and the interplays across a business like us, in terms of all the things you're describing. And so, when we talk about, there's a lot we don't know right now and we're actually not going to try to make calls to some of those. Keep in mind that there are factors that move differently in a diverse enterprise like this. Intensity levels, durations of the virus impact also the duration and intensity of the deferral of elective procedures. So, there are factors in there as you go across the range of options that we consider the multi-variable factors that we look at when considering our outlook that interplay. And so, that informs kind of how we think about \u2013 how we just think about trying to consider different way that things would play out. And certainly, Dave did mention that, yes, and I mentioned also that we did \u2013 we have seen declines in procedural volumes and we saw those starting kind of late in March and those continued into April. But trying to use some of these other examples, even as you mentioned, the financial crisis as a measure, from our perspective aren't necessarily still measures that we think are all that instructive because we haven't seen a cessation in activity before like this. And the reasons for this cessation in activity are very, very different and the duration of those also is quite different. So, I don't know that I'd even go to that one as kind of \u2013 as the instructive measure for us. Sure. So, I think our long-term capital deployment strategies remain. Our long-term capital deployment strategy is absolutely in terms of how we think about allocation of capital into our businesses, into new organic growth opportunities, M&A opportunities, and as we think about things like dividend and share repurchase also. And clearly, you saw, we responded, we are in the fortunate position of being able to respond to what we saw as some instability in the financial markets in March, by increasing our cash position in order to fortify that, and in part and kind of given the role that we play in being reliable partners for the broad health care delivery community. And so, that part being important, you can be sure that as we think about things in kind of the very near term, we're respectful of markets, that is financial markets and how they're behaving, and we'll continue to be respectful of those and understand kind of that they are functioning and functioning fluidly as we consider those elements. And that may impact the timing of how we think about different capital allocation activities. We're going to be super respectful of that because of the important role that we play in the health system and our obligations to be \u2013 provide health security for the people we serve and to be ready, enable and reliable partners for the health care delivery community broadly."

So, really early in the process and we never harden our position at this stage. In 2021, as always, we strive to provide consistency and benefits for the members that we serve. We have a long track record of stable-to-improving benefits and have accomplished this in some challenging circumstances in the past. The HIT dynamics that played out over years are an example. So, too early to talk in detail about our benefits and some of the assumptions there. But our clear goal is stability. Stability is always extremely important to our members and it's especially important at a time like this."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the Company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 19, 2022, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the Company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to start by recognizing our colleagues, the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare for delivering strong results throughout 2021 and creating the momentum that is carrying us through as we enter into this year. For example, performance in two key elements of our growth strategy, accelerating the transition of patients to Optum-led value-based care and strong United Healthcare growth in serving Medicare Advantage consumers are both tracking well with the expectations we shared with you at our recent investor conference. These, and the broader performance across the enterprise, confirm our comfort in our ability to advance our stated growth strategies and to support our long-term 13% to 16% EPS growth rate. When you look back at the prevailing themes for 2021, you see a story of accelerating growth, strong collaboration between Optum and UnitedHealthcare and with our many external partners helped us grow in serving both commercial and government markets, unlock new innovation, introduce integrated products and services to the marketplace and significantly increase the number of people benefiting from value-based models of care. Last year, we leveraged our technology capabilities to help physician and hospital systems better serve their patients and communities. And we sharpened our focus on the consumer working to elevate and improve the end-to-end experience. Taken together, these efforts helped us add more than $30 billion in revenue for the year, about $10 billion above our initial outlook. And you should expect similar growth in the year ahead. We see an even greater demand for integration to bring together the fragmented pieces of the health system, to harness the tremendous innovation occurring in the marketplace, to help better align the incentives for providers, payers and consumers and to organize the system around value. A healthcare system that is more connected, more informed, more human and more responsive to every person's unique needs. At our investor conference, we shared five key areas for growth and for differentiated experiences across our portfolio. These growth opportunities will guide our strategy this year and for many years to come. First is care delivery. More specifically, value-based care. For UnitedHealth Group, this is more than a primary care strategy. It's a comprehensive clinical strategy encompassing our growing behavioral, home, ambulatory and virtual care capabilities. Our second growth area is health benefits, advancing the quality, innovation and consumer appeal of our benefit offerings and bringing our value-based strategy to life. We enter '22 having generated strong consumer growth in Medicare Advantage and saw further progress in Medicaid and growing momentum in our commercial business. Next, health technology. Our major partnerships across the country help health systems improve their performance and returns, all to better support their missions. We're energized by the potential to bring these comprehensive tailored solutions to a greater number of system partners in 2022 and beyond. Fourth, health financial services, vastly improved in the health payment sector, streamlining and simplifying payments for providers, payers and consumers while reducing friction and increasing speed and convenience. And finally, pharmacy services, where people interact most often with the health care system. We can better use the significant breadth, volume and value of our foundational pharmacy services and data capabilities and integrate our medical pharmacy and behavioral capabilities. All of this to provide whole person care, support the discovery of new drugs and treatments and support value-based models of care. In sum, we enter 2022 with heightened confidence in our ability to execute upon the objectives we set forth in late November. And with that, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. I thought I would take a few minutes providing you with some additional details on our first growth priority, value-based care, how we have prepared for it, the investments we have made and how we see it working in the near future. This has been something we have been working on and building over the course of a decade. For example, there was significant operational groundwork and investment that went into supporting the 0.5 million new patients for whom OptumHealth will become accountable in 2022. Successful execution requires a lot of detailed planning, investing and building. It has become a distinctive competency of our enterprise, which we can now increasingly apply at scale. So what does it take to prepare for moving to a fully accountable arrangement? Investments can be significant. As an example, in '21, we incurred over $100 million in preparation expense. Within this, there are three major work streams involved: Clinical training and staff preparation, technology and data enhancement, and third is network coordination. The first work stream focuses on physician education. It begins well more than a year prior. It's important to provide the resources and knowledge for physicians to begin approaching their patients differently. They engage in their patients\u2019 whole help well ahead of taking on greater accountability. We find it to be an essential and sometimes complex shift in what our long-held fee-for-service practices. Beyond education, we ramp up our capacity in the form of physicians, nurses and other clinicians to meet the requirements of our business. The second area focuses on the technology systems and information needed to support patient care and effective clinical management. This includes things like patient portals and utilization management systems as well as reporting systems for teams to effectively manage. Finally, is the planning and network coordination work to support clinical oversight beyond primary care and ensure true continuity of care. This planning and coordination includes initiatives such as identifying the patients most in need and ensuring a seamless transition to high-touch clinical care services that improve health and quickly pairing patients with a personal care navigator to assist in supporting complex health needs, appointment scheduling and timely medication support on day one. These foundational preparations and investments have been critical in creating strong results across a variety of geographies and practices we have transitioned. We expect this expertise will serve us well as we transition even larger groups of patients in the years to come. Before handing it over to John, I'd like to update you on how COVID has impacted our operations. Like other businesses, we have experienced moderately higher levels of attrition and more unplanned absences. We had prepared for this situation through increased recruiting capacity as well as meaningfully upgraded digital capabilities to improve customer experience and reduce call volumes. As a result, in the first two weeks of '22, traditionally, our most demanding period, we were able to service the needs of our patients and customers. At the same time, we responded swiftly to the federal mandate for cash-free COVID test for consumers, a highly complex undertaking. With four days notice, UnitedHealthcare created a customer digital experience for ease of reimbursement and established a partnership with Walmart and now Rite Aid that eliminates cash outlays by consumers at point of purchase. We expect more partnerships in the days ahead. As we look forward, we believe we have the right capacity in place to execute our business priorities and meet our customers' expectations. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk, and Happy New Year, everyone. I'll start by expanding a bit on Dirk's comments on the COVID impacts we're seeing. In the most recent weeks, inpatient hospitalization levels for our members are similar to the January 2021 levels, even with national COVID case rates about 4x higher. For those people needing inpatient care, severity is seemingly lower as we are seeing shorter lengths of stay compared to that earlier period. At the same time, we are observing familiar correlations of care activity patterns to other periods of elevated infection rates experienced over the past two years. For example, in these early weeks of January, we are seeing slowing in primary care, elective visit and procedural volumes. Activity over the past several weeks shows primary care visits having declined about 10% and an even higher rate of decline in specialist visits. As always, our prime focus is on helping people get the care they need when they need it. Moving now to our specific business performance. OptumHealth's revenue per consumer grew by over 30% in '21, driven by the increasing number of our patients served under value-based arrangements. Consistent with the expectations we shared in late November, we had a strong start to the year and continue to expect to add 500,000 new patients in accountable value-based relationships, benefiting from the groundwork laid over the past many years. OptumInsight earnings grew 25% in '21, with operating margins approaching 28% for the year. We ended the year with a revenue backlog of $22.4 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion over the prior year. Our expanding relationships serving health systems has been a key factor driving this growth, and we expect these partnerships to continue to grow in '22 and beyond. OptumRx earnings grew 6% for the year, driven by the continued expansion of our pharmacy services businesses, supply chain initiatives and strong cost management activity and benefiting from strong customer retention. In addition, we continue to see the impact of OptumRx' movement to a higher value pharmacy care and specialty services orientation. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Full year revenues of $223 billion grew 11%. As noted, our 2022 Medicare Advantage member growth outlook is very positive and consistent with the objectives we established at our November investor conference. Within the up to 800,000 new members we will serve in '22, about 3/4 will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans. And given the steady strides we've made in quality performance, we have the opportunity to enroll people in our newly rated five-star plans throughout the entirety of this year. Our Medicaid membership outlook for '22 continues to incorporate an expectation that states resume eligibility redeterminations, resulting in modest net attrition. In January, we began serving the citizens of Minnesota and continue to support the Missouri expansion this year as well as renewed relationships with Ohio, Tennessee and Nevada. Over the course of the year, we will look to continue to expand upon the nearly 8 million individuals we serve across 31 states. We concluded '21 with commercial membership, about 200,000 people ahead of the original outlook provided. Creating this momentum is the strong response we are seeing to the new innovative products you have heard us discuss. Products such as Navigate Now, which use the Optum virtual network as a first option. Our capital capacities remain strong. Full year '21 cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion or 1.3x net income, about $2 billion above the initial outlook we shared a year ago. We continue to expect our 2022 cash flow to approach $24 billion, about 1.2x net income. And we ended '21 with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 38%. These ample capital capacities allow us to continue to accelerate our investments, while remaining committed to an advancing shareholder dividend and supporting our expected repurchase of between $5 billion and $6 billion of stock in '22. Our 2022 adjusted earnings per share outlook of $21.10 to $21.60 is consistent with the view we offered seven weeks ago. From this distance in contrast to the past two years, we expect the seasonal pattern to be more consistent with our historical experience with just under 50% of full year earnings in the first half and the first two quarters comparably even. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Before we transition to the Q&A portion of the call, I hope you've already taken away the strong sense of confidence John, Dirk and I share in the growth potential of this company, rooted in the growing number of people we're serving in value-based models, the depth of relationships we're building with local health systems, our pharmacy capabilities and the innovation and consumer focus that's driving growth across our government programs, individual and commercial businesses. As demand for innovation and integrated solutions, products and services only continues to grow, we've never been in a better position to help bring together the fragmented pieces of health care and create more value for the people we try to serve. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Scott, go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Good morning. Thank you. My question was just a little follow-up just on the Medicare Advantage environment. And if you could just talk about, from your perspective, whether you've seen any material change in the level of competition in the market for 2022 relative to 2021? Then just would also be interested. And for United, whether there's been any types of shifts in the distribution channels through which you're driving your MA growth just as we think about some of the evolving trends in Medicare? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Scott. Listen, thanks so much for the question. Before I hand it over to Tim Noel, who runs that part of our organization, let me just reiterate how pleased we are with the overall performance through the selling cycle. The number of folks who have chosen UnitedHealthcare continues to grow super well ahead of market, growing market share once again. And as we said a couple of times in our opening commentary, very much in line with the expectations that we set out for the year. So really, big picture, super positive. I'll hand over to Tim to give you a little bit more background to all of that, Tim.\nTim Noel: Good. Great. Hey, thanks, Scott, for the question. This is Tim Noel. Yes, the way I see the MA market is it's been highly competitive for a number of years. And I don't see 2022 as a step function increase and that level of competitiveness. The trend of more entrants, better benefits has really been a multiyear one. And we see this trend as being one that's very good for seniors and also one that's very good for the overall growth of the Medicare Advantage industry. Seniors are shopping for more value as they should be. And for our part, we're really focused on differentiating our offerings in the marketplace. And what we're doing is we're driving things, not only around benefits, but also around capabilities. Better digital tools, ease of payment, product innovation, better and more personalized service experiences, better clinical quality, more value-based and aligned care provider relationships are all part of that. And our approach continues to resonate in the marketplace. So, we really like our performance and our positioning inside a very strong and growing marketplace.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks so much. And Scott, just your secondary on distribution. I think it's fair to say nothing's changed in terms of our approach to distribution. In fact, I think we've never had more distributors, agents working on our behalf across the country. So, no change there, whatsoever, and we are super grateful for all of the support we get from agents and brokers and others who help us get the message across well to seniors who are looking for MA as an option. So really very positive about that environment. Let's go to next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My question relates to OptumHealth and the disclosures around the top line growth, have been really helpful. But I'm curious more on the margin side, and specifically, how margins trend over time when you take 100% global capitation. And maybe specifically, if you're making money on the totality of that business today and maybe how that migrates over time?\nAndrew Witty: Josh, thanks so much. Let me pass it over to Dr. Wyatt Decker, who looks after OptumHealth. Wyatt?\nDr. Wyatt Decker: Yes, Josh, thanks for the question. Absolutely, we are positioned, the OptumHealth, as a growth platform. And we're investing in new markets and deeper penetration into established markets. As we do that and expand the capabilities, you'll continue to see us delivering on an 8% to 10% margin range. So you can anticipate us to continue to generate strong performance while investing in what will be a multiyear growth platform. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: John Rex, I think maybe add a little?\nJohn Rex: Sure. And just, Josh, getting at your point of how does that progress over time, and Dirk did offer some nice commentary on the call in terms of the investments that we make as we're looking to move to capitation. And that does tell a kind of a multiyear story of investments as we get ready to move to capitalization. So that's even before any revenue comes into the picture we're making, we're making those investments. And significant -- very significant ahead in a couple of years ahead, especially in the year ahead of those transitions before there's any kind of revenue view. So that is creating kind of that impact. And what Dr. Decker was describing there. So as we seek to do that and those movements occur, we're always bearing within that a fairly significant investment load. This year, it was obviously fairly significant with the 0.5 million members that we transitioned. And we continue to accelerate, those investments continue also, while we start getting leverage on those as we do more of it. So we're kind of bearing that within the 8% to 10% that Wyatt was describing there.\nJosh Raskin: Yes. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Absolutely. I think both sets of comments really point to what's happening, Josh. One way that helps me think this through a little bit is to think about vintages. So every year, there's a different number of folks who transition into the capitated environment. Of course, that number grows every time. So this year will be almost double what we did last year. Last year was almost double what we did the year before. As you think about it, the margin associated or the economics associated with each vintage changes year-by-year as those populations of folks stay in OptumCare for sustained periods of time. So, as you think about the longer-term evolution of the economics of OptumCare, I'd encourage you to think about it reflect on how those vintages are aging into their stabilization within the value-based environment. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate your comments on how trends is kind of starting the year with COVID. Can you give us a view of how you ended the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of five business segments? I remember correctly, commercial was running a little bit hotter than Medicare and Medicaid in the third quarter. And then anything you could tell us in terms of what you think maybe a rough number might be on the cost of the new home testing requirements? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much Justin. I'll ask Brian Thompson, President of UHC to comment in a second. I think overall, those trends we saw segment by segment didn't get too different as we roll through here. I would just say, as we go into the last part of the year, the last couple of weeks as Omicron really started to show its face, that still -- we're still kind of learning exactly what the impact of that. As you can imagine, we can see some things very quickly like physician visits. A little harder to know exactly what kind of complexity of claims might look like in hospitals, that will become clearer the next few weeks. But let me ask Brian to go a little deeper on all of that.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, Andrew. Thanks for the question, Justin. Brian here. As Andrew alluded to, I would say our results for COVID in the fourth quarter were in line with our expectations. As you said, similar to the dialogue we had for the third quarter as well as at the investor conference with commercial largely at baseline performance in both care and caid modestly below, still with that same dynamic of Medicaid being slightly below Medicare. So not much change there. As you suggested, and as we had reiterated in our opening comments, Omicron obviously emerging here in December and I think John Rex said it well. While there's certainly some differences in contagiousness and severity, the impact of abatement following these swells and infections is consistent with what we've seen in Delta and other strains prior, double-digit declines in both physician visits as well as specialist visits. So we're continuing to see that dynamic play out. What we may not have anticipated an increased testing and costs are offset with beneficial unanticipated levels of abatement. So that seems to be holding here in the early stages of Omicron. To your point, with respect to at-home testing, our focus right now is really the consumer experience. As you know, these rules came out just a week ago. Our goal has been how can we ensure that our members know where they can go and get access to those at-home tests without a cash outlay. We've really been pleased with the various retailers that we've been working with, Walmart and Rite Aid, in particular, but many to follow of getting this capability stood up in a matter of four days. We're encouraged by that. And at the same time, creating a really easy digital experience for those that do shop and need reimbursement when they go to UnitedHealthcare and My UHC, they're able to easily understand how to get that reimbursement. That's been our focus. I think isolating the cost of the COVID test from this distance isn't really instructive. I think if and when it remains durable, as a function of not only supply and demand, but how this plays out over the course of the year. And again, I'm comforted by this offsetting dynamic of care deferral that has followed any of these unanticipated waves. Thanks, Justin.\nAndrew Witty: Brian, thanks so much. And I also just want to express thanks to the folks at Walmart and Rite Aid and others who will join shortly in helping get this preferred network up so quickly. The fact that we were in a position with our partners to be able to respond to patient need from Saturday, the very first day that this was requested from the federal government, I think, speaks well to the capabilities of the private sector, the participants within the health care sector to respond and solve problems on behalf of the country. And I think that's an example which we see repeated across the landscape, and we're very, very proud of being able to work with Walmart and Rite Aid in this particular case. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. I just want to go back to the MA conversation for a second. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the margins in that business? And whether you think any differently about the appropriate margin or acceptable margin in that business now that you've got an ability to earn additional earnings streams through decapitation, the value-based care arrangements that you have?\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Kevin. Let me ask John Rex to reflect on that.\nJohn Rex: Yes, Kevin, it's John here. So yes, when we think about kind of our business structure, we have separate businesses across the Company. And as you know well, extremely important to us is remaining -- is retaining bright lines across those businesses. We serve over 100 payers in OptumCare. We serve many payers across the OptumInsight businesses. And so when we think about our business, they stand alone from a margin perspective, all of our businesses. And that's very important to how we operate the Company, how we serve others and how we approach the marketplace.\nAndrew Witty: Absolutely, John. Thanks so much. And Kevin, thanks for the question. It's also really important to remember that every single one of our service lines, business lines is literally tested and challenged at 24/7, 365 days a year through all of its multi-payer relationships, the competitive environment we're in. I don't think there's really any space where we don't have multiple competitors at some level. that we service, we are constantly being tested in terms of our ability to serve, making sure that we are priced competitively and the like. So I think it's a well-established and highly successful separation between the two businesses, which has performed extremely well. And most importantly, consistently delivers great value to patients, consumers, system partners who we are privileged to work with and increasingly is scoring well in areas like NPS and other measures of consumer experience and service experience.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Wanted to come back to the rapid testing question. I guess, are you guys thinking about this as a definite net cost? Are you thinking the potential offsets from less expensive other testing? And then there does seem to be a push and pull between the supply and the market of rapid test today. And then the Biden Administration distributed 1 billion of these tests for free. I guess, how are you thinking about the supply that your partners are going to have access to as you have these discussions?\nAndrew Witty: Stephen, thanks so much for the question. Yes. As Brian alluded to earlier on, I mean, at this point, a little hard to know exactly, obviously, partly because of the demand and supply dynamic exactly what the kind of scale of the testing program could be. But given you would logically expect that if there was a high sustained demand, there's probably a lot of Omicron or some kind of area in the system that would probably lead to what Brian was talking about earlier with abatement elsewhere in the system. So at this level, I think we kind of expect these two things to somewhat offset. Obviously, we don't know. But at this level, I think it kind of makes sense. The demand and supply, obviously, that has been a challenge across the system historically. We're very fortunate to have very established, experienced supply chain partners in this in the shape already of companies like Walmart, and Rite Aid, and I'm sure they're very much focused on ensuring as much supply as they can get. But I think it's inevitable that we're going to continue to see outages as you go through these geographic kind of surges that we've characterized this pandemic from the get-go. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: So as we think about the MA environment, you're growing above market. Can you talk a little bit about the role that OptumCare plays in the ability to gain share? Maybe if you have any data points that compare the stickiness or attrition among United MA members that are within the OptumCare network.\nAndrew Witty: Ricky, thanks so much. Before I hand that to Brian to maybe reflect on a little bit, one of the things that I think we really are pleased about is the way in which OptumCare has developed a whole set of capabilities to deliver really enhanced focus on MA patients. Obviously, these patients have a high medical need very often. They need high touch. I've been super impressed with the development, not just in the clinic, but also through the at-home programs where we're able to continue to make sure folks are looked after properly. And actually, particularly as we've gone through the pandemic environment, people's preference to have care delivered in the home has become clearer and clearer. But Brian, maybe you could reflect a little more on how that plays through in terms of the attractiveness of what you're able to offer.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. I appreciate that. I think Tim really laid out a long list of things that we focus on to make sure that we remain competitive in this space. And as I think about OptumCare specifically, first and foremost, for us, it's predictability. But beyond that, where we have our best satisfaction, which in turn leads to our best persistency, our members that stay with us the longest is with our OptumCare partners. And I think, first and foremost, that's a benefit for us. I think beyond that, our journey on quality from, as you might remember, just a short decade ago of under 10% to almost nearly 100% was certainly at the support and health from OptumCare, not only in our relationship with them, but how we establish incentives with providers outside of OptumCare. So the list is pretty long. And I would say if I was to point to one differentiation for UnitedHealthcare, it's certainly OptumCare.\nAndrew Witty: Wyatt, would you like to maybe add from your perspective?\nDr. Wyatt Decker: Yes. Well, BT touched on it, but our focus on the consumer and patient experience is relentless. And we are continuing to deploy new capabilities all the time. And Andrew, you mentioned home and community. When you look at the quality of the care that we provide, as Brian mentioned, it's now 99% of UHC members with OptumCare or enforce or higher level plans. And we don't stop there. And so now we have unveiled our virtual care platform that brings behavioral care to the forefront, brings virtual care and physical care and connects people to their own trusted providers. So you'll see us continuing to focus on how do we meet the needs of our members and how do we reduce friction for our patients.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks, Wyatt. Thanks so much for the question, Ricky. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Obviously, labor pressures across the health care industry is a big topic. You have involvement in that in OptumHealth as well as in UHC and your discussions with your nonaffiliated providers. I wondered how -- what -- how that's impacting your business, perhaps the shift of people from -- to OptumHealth from UHC maybe a mitigating factor. But any comments about what you're seeing as you try to add your clinicians in OptumHealth? And then also what you're hearing from your provider networks and how that might impact your outlook in UHC?\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, A.J. Let me ask Dirk to start that one off.\nDirk McMahon: Yes. Thanks, A.J. Look, let me just take this a little bit more broad. As we look across our labor markets, it's a hot market for things like clinical talent, technology and customer service. And one of the things we and Optum did really early in the process is we scaled up our recruiting capacity. We got -- we retained -- we set up attention for some key staff. And one of the other things is we've had pretty decent retention because we have a pretty good mission along those lines. So a lot of additional staffing, a lot of sort of getting ahead of this proactively has been major -- our major action. As it relates to other providers in UnitedHealthcare, we talked about this in the last earnings call. The -- our contracts are negotiated every three years. So it's sort of from our perspective, yes, we're hearing that there are shortages. But we're working with those folks in the shortages, and there's a little bit of inflation, but we ultimately price for that. And like anything else in the market, the market will sell that out. And we're just being very aware of what the implications on a little bit tight labor market are. And hopefully, it will loosen up as we pace forward.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Dirk. And A.J., thanks so much for your question. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.\nMatt Borsch: I guess, I was hoping you could maybe just talk a little bit more about the Medicaid redeterminations and what you're expecting in terms of the timing and the impact because I know you touched on modest. I'm just wondering how you're seeing mitigating factors there.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Matt, thanks so much. I'm going to have Tim Spilker, who leads our CNS organization to respond to that. Tim, could I pass over to you?\nTim Spilker: Thank you for the question. At the investor conference, we indicated that we thought states would resume redeterminations in mid-'22. I think based on what we're seeing at this point, that assumption seems even more likely than we thought at that point. Important to note though that we're also working closely with our state customers to better understand the timing and the approach that they will take once they do resume. And probably, most importantly, based on the breadth of UHC's products across commercial coverage, exchange as well as Medicaid, we're confident that we'll pick up our fair share as folks transition from Medicaid to other types of coverage. So thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks. Matt, thank you also. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Just following up on some of the comments on Medicare Advantage. A couple of your peers are talking about changing how they go to market next year, both from a benefit design as well as distribute standpoint. I know it's early to talk about 2023, but I'd just be curious how this informs your approach as you strive to maintain that value differential that your plans provide?\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Nathan, for the question. Let me ask Tim Noel to make a couple of comments on that.\nTim Noel: Yes. Thanks, Nathan, for the question. As we think about 2023, certainly a little bit too early to get into a lot of depth there given that we haven't even seen an indication of rates from CMS yet. However, when I think about broad strategic goals around distribution and product, I'm not seeing any shift in the stance that we've gone to market with in 2022 and even 2021 and years prior. We are very comfortable with our multichannel distribution approach. And as I indicated earlier, our approach on differentiating our products in a very robust industry continuing to resonate. So, no deviation from what's been a successful formula for us and providing really great value to consumers.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. I think that's exactly it, Tim. And Nathan, the focus on sustained delivery of value is incredibly important, I think, for the underpinning of UnitedHealthcare have done so well in this environment. It's really important from a distribution broker perspective. People understand what we're offering, but it's not volatile. It's even more important after people sign up. People get what they expect. And that is really -- that served us super well. We believe the way in which we put together this benefit package really serves the needs of the members. And it really speaks to why it's so popular. And it's why United, we've been able to grow market share consistently year after year after year. We'll do so again this year. We'll deliver our objectives in MA growth, and we're extremely positive about this part of our performance. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Just wanted to return to OptumHealth for a minute around the fourth quarter. If we look year-to-date, OI was growing 35% almost every quarter. It was up about 17% this quarter. And then I think for next year, you have it growing almost 30%. So was there anything else in the quarter? I know Wyatt talked about some of those incremental investments. I guess it makes sense, a little more of those could have been in the fourth quarter, but anything else on the cost side at OptumCare or anything at the MedSurg or the ASC business to call out impacting 4Q?\nAndrew Witty: I think overall, no, but let me ask Wyatt just to give you a little bit more detail.\nDr. Wyatt Decker: Yes. Thanks, Gary, for the question. And by far, the biggest component that you're referring to is what we've touched on, which is the investment in future growth and the platforms for managing 500,000 new risk lives in '22. We saw some modest uptick in our labor costs that were not really material to our performance, but just because I know that's on people's minds. So as we continue to address that. And you'll see us continue to invest in technologies like our virtual care delivery platform, behavioral health care and home and communities. So it isn't just the risk lives in a senior clinic model. It's this comprehensive care delivery model that has multiple components of investment that will yield fruit, not only in '22, but in following years. So thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Wyatt. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Wanted to talk a little bit about OptumRx. And just wanted to get a sense as to the rate of growth of specialty home delivery and what the margin profile is looking like there. And maybe what the outlook is for specialty generics and biosimilars and the impacts on margin.\nAndrew Witty: Lance, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather Cianfrocco, who looks after OptumRx for us to respond. Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Yes. So the -- I would definitely say that the specialty and home delivery business are contributing to earnings and our margin. We've seen growth in specialty from a few things. First of all, it's been rate of capture. Second, we've seen growth with our PBM clients, which of course drives growth when they use our specialty service, as well as we've really been investing in automation. So I'll give you an example of that. Our home delivery and our specialty businesses today are really benefiting from our investment in digital and a better consumer experience. In fact, today, 50% more of our specialty consumers are using our online and digital experience to fill their meds and refill their meds. So we're glad to see that it's resulting in a better consumer experience, but it's also contributing to the earnings of the business. I guess I'd tell you, as I look forward on that business, I think about two things. The first one is continued automation and improvement in experience integrated with the rest of our pharmacies, think about investing with our multi-dose, our investment in regional integrated pharmacies closer to members' homes so that we can get medication to them faster. We're processing and filling over 80% of prescriptions same day today. So, we'll continue to see that cost per script and refill cost per script improve quarter after quarter like we've seen over the last quarter. But to your point, I think the other really exciting part about our specialty business is that in '22, we're going to see a robust pipeline of generic specialty coming to market, mostly in the oncology space. And then we know in '23, we'll see additional opportunities in not just specialty generics, but additional brands in specialty pluses and biosimilar. So together with the automation, the consumer service and the clinical programs that we offer in the specialty business together with just more options affordably to our consumers, we'll continue to see that contribute meaningfully to OptumRx growth and earnings and margin.\nAndrew Witty: Heather, thanks so much. I'll just add to that. I think the work that's going on inside the OptumRx team, particularly around some of the specialty areas as well as the development of our new GPO and readiness for what is likely to be a very interesting period of loss of exclusivity on a lot of very significant pharmaceutical products, some of which are in categories which have really not had competition for many years, I think it sets up the next 24, 36 months, a very interesting period. We're super committed to delivering medicines at the lowest possible net cost to our members and their clients. And it's an area where we expect significant potential as we roll through over the next two or three years. So I think Heather's organization is doing some great foundational work for a next wave of opportunity in the pharmaceutical space. We have time for one last question, operator. So if we could maybe go to the last question.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: So there was so much focus over the past year on the $1.80 EPS headwind for the Company related to COVID in '21. Is the $1.80 essentially where that final number shook out for last year? Was there any deviation in either direction on any key components as we think about the reversal of roughly half of that total headwind in '22?\nAndrew Witty: Steven, thanks so much. Let me ask John to respond to that.\nJohn Rex: Yes, it was materially in that zone of $1.80 is where it fell out. Look, if I would tell you where we thought it was going to be back in November, we said it and the components that would comprise that $1.80 and how they actually fell and they went through all those components. Yes, certainly, a number of them played out a little bit differently than we would have thought back at that period. Perhaps the important learning we got over that period, though, were just the various -- the correlations that we see across the components as those -- as different case rate volumes would occur over the course of the period and such and the impacts on care activity levels and other areas. So definitely, probably didn't step into the year, a year ago, predicting there would be a summer wave actually even. But the correlations held very true over that period. It was the important factor for us. So yes, within that zone of the $1.80 and -- but -- and the components that they played out certainly where it instructed and are instructing how we even think about 2022 and the impacts that we've talked about for that also.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, great. Thanks so much, John. And Steven, thanks very much for that last question. I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time to participate in the call this morning, and we certainly appreciate your time and attention. And I hope that what you've heard from John, Dirk and our colleagues on the call today helps you see why we're so confident in our ability to continue to deliver high-quality growth while helping to improve the lives of the people we serve. And we look forward to sharing our progress with you again in April. In the meantime, thanks so much for your attention, and Jennifer, thanks for hosting the call. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. I thought I would take a few minutes providing you with some additional details on our first growth priority, value-based care, how we have prepared for it, the investments we have made and how we see it working in the near future. This has been something we have been working on and building over the course of a decade. For example, there was significant operational groundwork and investment that went into supporting the 0.5 million new patients for whom OptumHealth will become accountable in 2022. Successful execution requires a lot of detailed planning, investing and building. It has become a distinctive competency of our enterprise, which we can now increasingly apply at scale. So what does it take to prepare for moving to a fully accountable arrangement? Investments can be significant. As an example, in '21, we incurred over $100 million in preparation expense. Within this, there are three major work streams involved: Clinical training and staff preparation, technology and data enhancement, and third is network coordination. The first work stream focuses on physician education. It begins well more than a year prior. It's important to provide the resources and knowledge for physicians to begin approaching their patients differently. They engage in their patients' whole help well ahead of taking on greater accountability. We find it to be an essential and sometimes complex shift in what our long-held fee-for-service practices. Beyond education, we ramp up our capacity in the form of physicians, nurses and other clinicians to meet the requirements of our business. The second area focuses on the technology systems and information needed to support patient care and effective clinical management. This includes things like patient portals and utilization management systems as well as reporting systems for teams to effectively manage. Finally, is the planning and network coordination work to support clinical oversight beyond primary care and ensure true continuity of care. This planning and coordination includes initiatives such as identifying the patients most in need and ensuring a seamless transition to high-touch clinical care services that improve health and quickly pairing patients with a personal care navigator to assist in supporting complex health needs, appointment scheduling and timely medication support on day one. These foundational preparations and investments have been critical in creating strong results across a variety of geographies and practices we have transitioned. We expect this expertise will serve us well as we transition even larger groups of patients in the years to come. Before handing it over to John, I'd like to update you on how COVID has impacted our operations. Like other businesses, we have experienced moderately higher levels of attrition and more unplanned absences. We had prepared for this situation through increased recruiting capacity as well as meaningfully upgraded digital capabilities to improve customer experience and reduce call volumes. As a result, in the first two weeks of '22, traditionally, our most demanding period, we were able to service the needs of our patients and customers. At the same time, we responded swiftly to the federal mandate for cash-free COVID test for consumers, a highly complex undertaking. With four days notice, UnitedHealthcare created a customer digital experience for ease of reimbursement and established a partnership with Walmart and now Rite Aid that eliminates cash outlays by consumers at point of purchase. We expect more partnerships in the days ahead. As we look forward, we believe we have the right capacity in place to execute our business priorities and meet our customers' expectations. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. Yes. Thanks, A.J. Look, let me just take this a little bit more broad. As we look across our labor markets, it's a hot market for things like clinical talent, technology and customer service. And one of the things we and Optum did really early in the process is we scaled up our recruiting capacity. We got -- we retained -- we set up attention for some key staff. And one of the other things is we've had pretty decent retention because we have a pretty good mission along those lines. So a lot of additional staffing, a lot of sort of getting ahead of this proactively has been major -- our major action. As it relates to other providers in UnitedHealthcare, we talked about this in the last earnings call. The -- our contracts are negotiated every three years. So it's sort of from our perspective, yes, we're hearing that there are shortages. But we're working with those folks in the shortages, and there's a little bit of inflation, but we ultimately price for that. And like anything else in the market, the market will sell that out. And we're just being very aware of what the implications on a little bit tight labor market are. And hopefully, it will loosen up as we pace forward."

            "name": "Brian Thompson",
            "content": "Sure, Andrew. Thanks for the question, Justin. Brian here. As Andrew alluded to, I would say our results for COVID in the fourth quarter were in line with our expectations. As you said, similar to the dialogue we had for the third quarter as well as at the investor conference with commercial largely at baseline performance in both care and caid modestly below, still with that same dynamic of Medicaid being slightly below Medicare. So not much change there. As you suggested, and as we had reiterated in our opening comments, Omicron obviously emerging here in December and I think John Rex said it well. While there's certainly some differences in contagiousness and severity, the impact of abatement following these swells and infections is consistent with what we've seen in Delta and other strains prior, double-digit declines in both physician visits as well as specialist visits. So we're continuing to see that dynamic play out. What we may not have anticipated an increased testing and costs are offset with beneficial unanticipated levels of abatement. So that seems to be holding here in the early stages of Omicron. To your point, with respect to at-home testing, our focus right now is really the consumer experience. As you know, these rules came out just a week ago. Our goal has been how can we ensure that our members know where they can go and get access to those at-home tests without a cash outlay. We've really been pleased with the various retailers that we've been working with, Walmart and Rite Aid, in particular, but many to follow of getting this capability stood up in a matter of four days. We're encouraged by that. And at the same time, creating a really easy digital experience for those that do shop and need reimbursement when they go to UnitedHealthcare and My UHC, they're able to easily understand how to get that reimbursement. That's been our focus. I think isolating the cost of the COVID test from this distance isn't really instructive. I think if and when it remains durable, as a function of not only supply and demand, but how this plays out over the course of the year. And again, I'm comforted by this offsetting dynamic of care deferral that has followed any of these unanticipated waves. Thanks, Justin. Sure. I appreciate that. I think Tim really laid out a long list of things that we focus on to make sure that we remain competitive in this space. And as I think about OptumCare specifically, first and foremost, for us, it's predictability. But beyond that, where we have our best satisfaction, which in turn leads to our best persistency, our members that stay with us the longest is with our OptumCare partners. And I think, first and foremost, that's a benefit for us. I think beyond that, our journey on quality from, as you might remember, just a short decade ago of under 10% to almost nearly 100% was certainly at the support and health from OptumCare, not only in our relationship with them, but how we establish incentives with providers outside of OptumCare. So the list is pretty long. And I would say if I was to point to one differentiation for UnitedHealthcare, it's certainly OptumCare."
        },
        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to start by recognizing our colleagues, the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare for delivering strong results throughout 2021 and creating the momentum that is carrying us through as we enter into this year. For example, performance in two key elements of our growth strategy, accelerating the transition of patients to Optum-led value-based care and strong United Healthcare growth in serving Medicare Advantage consumers are both tracking well with the expectations we shared with you at our recent investor conference. These, and the broader performance across the enterprise, confirm our comfort in our ability to advance our stated growth strategies and to support our long-term 13% to 16% EPS growth rate. When you look back at the prevailing themes for 2021, you see a story of accelerating growth, strong collaboration between Optum and UnitedHealthcare and with our many external partners helped us grow in serving both commercial and government markets, unlock new innovation, introduce integrated products and services to the marketplace and significantly increase the number of people benefiting from value-based models of care. Last year, we leveraged our technology capabilities to help physician and hospital systems better serve their patients and communities. And we sharpened our focus on the consumer working to elevate and improve the end-to-end experience. Taken together, these efforts helped us add more than $30 billion in revenue for the year, about $10 billion above our initial outlook. And you should expect similar growth in the year ahead. We see an even greater demand for integration to bring together the fragmented pieces of the health system, to harness the tremendous innovation occurring in the marketplace, to help better align the incentives for providers, payers and consumers and to organize the system around value. A healthcare system that is more connected, more informed, more human and more responsive to every person's unique needs. At our investor conference, we shared five key areas for growth and for differentiated experiences across our portfolio. These growth opportunities will guide our strategy this year and for many years to come. First is care delivery. More specifically, value-based care. For UnitedHealth Group, this is more than a primary care strategy. It's a comprehensive clinical strategy encompassing our growing behavioral, home, ambulatory and virtual care capabilities. Our second growth area is health benefits, advancing the quality, innovation and consumer appeal of our benefit offerings and bringing our value-based strategy to life. We enter '22 having generated strong consumer growth in Medicare Advantage and saw further progress in Medicaid and growing momentum in our commercial business. Next, health technology. Our major partnerships across the country help health systems improve their performance and returns, all to better support their missions. We're energized by the potential to bring these comprehensive tailored solutions to a greater number of system partners in 2022 and beyond. Fourth, health financial services, vastly improved in the health payment sector, streamlining and simplifying payments for providers, payers and consumers while reducing friction and increasing speed and convenience. And finally, pharmacy services, where people interact most often with the health care system. We can better use the significant breadth, volume and value of our foundational pharmacy services and data capabilities and integrate our medical pharmacy and behavioral capabilities. All of this to provide whole person care, support the discovery of new drugs and treatments and support value-based models of care. In sum, we enter 2022 with heightened confidence in our ability to execute upon the objectives we set forth in late November. And with that, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon. Before we transition to the Q&A portion of the call, I hope you've already taken away the strong sense of confidence John, Dirk and I share in the growth potential of this company, rooted in the growing number of people we're serving in value-based models, the depth of relationships we're building with local health systems, our pharmacy capabilities and the innovation and consumer focus that's driving growth across our government programs, individual and commercial businesses. As demand for innovation and integrated solutions, products and services only continues to grow, we've never been in a better position to help bring together the fragmented pieces of health care and create more value for the people we try to serve. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please. Hey, Scott, go ahead. Yes, Scott. Listen, thanks so much for the question. Before I hand it over to Tim Noel, who runs that part of our organization, let me just reiterate how pleased we are with the overall performance through the selling cycle. The number of folks who have chosen UnitedHealthcare continues to grow super well ahead of market, growing market share once again. And as we said a couple of times in our opening commentary, very much in line with the expectations that we set out for the year. So really, big picture, super positive. I'll hand over to Tim to give you a little bit more background to all of that, Tim. Tim, thanks so much. And Scott, just your secondary on distribution. I think it's fair to say nothing's changed in terms of our approach to distribution. In fact, I think we've never had more distributors, agents working on our behalf across the country. So, no change there, whatsoever, and we are super grateful for all of the support we get from agents and brokers and others who help us get the message across well to seniors who are looking for MA as an option. So really very positive about that environment. Let's go to next question. Josh, thanks so much. Let me pass it over to Dr. Wyatt Decker, who looks after OptumHealth. Wyatt? John Rex, I think maybe add a little? Absolutely. I think both sets of comments really point to what's happening, Josh. One way that helps me think this through a little bit is to think about vintages. So every year, there's a different number of folks who transition into the capitated environment. Of course, that number grows every time. So this year will be almost double what we did last year. Last year was almost double what we did the year before. As you think about it, the margin associated or the economics associated with each vintage changes year-by-year as those populations of folks stay in OptumCare for sustained periods of time. So, as you think about the longer-term evolution of the economics of OptumCare, I'd encourage you to think about it reflect on how those vintages are aging into their stabilization within the value-based environment. Next question. Thanks so much Justin. I'll ask Brian Thompson, President of UHC to comment in a second. I think overall, those trends we saw segment by segment didn't get too different as we roll through here. I would just say, as we go into the last part of the year, the last couple of weeks as Omicron really started to show its face, that still -- we're still kind of learning exactly what the impact of that. As you can imagine, we can see some things very quickly like physician visits. A little harder to know exactly what kind of complexity of claims might look like in hospitals, that will become clearer the next few weeks. But let me ask Brian to go a little deeper on all of that. Brian, thanks so much. And I also just want to express thanks to the folks at Walmart and Rite Aid and others who will join shortly in helping get this preferred network up so quickly. The fact that we were in a position with our partners to be able to respond to patient need from Saturday, the very first day that this was requested from the federal government, I think, speaks well to the capabilities of the private sector, the participants within the health care sector to respond and solve problems on behalf of the country. And I think that's an example which we see repeated across the landscape, and we're very, very proud of being able to work with Walmart and Rite Aid in this particular case. Next question. Thanks so much, Kevin. Let me ask John Rex to reflect on that. Absolutely, John. Thanks so much. And Kevin, thanks for the question. It's also really important to remember that every single one of our service lines, business lines is literally tested and challenged at 24/7, 365 days a year through all of its multi-payer relationships, the competitive environment we're in. I don't think there's really any space where we don't have multiple competitors at some level. that we service, we are constantly being tested in terms of our ability to serve, making sure that we are priced competitively and the like. So I think it's a well-established and highly successful separation between the two businesses, which has performed extremely well. And most importantly, consistently delivers great value to patients, consumers, system partners who we are privileged to work with and increasingly is scoring well in areas like NPS and other measures of consumer experience and service experience. Stephen, thanks so much for the question. Yes. As Brian alluded to earlier on, I mean, at this point, a little hard to know exactly, obviously, partly because of the demand and supply dynamic exactly what the kind of scale of the testing program could be. But given you would logically expect that if there was a high sustained demand, there's probably a lot of Omicron or some kind of area in the system that would probably lead to what Brian was talking about earlier with abatement elsewhere in the system. So at this level, I think we kind of expect these two things to somewhat offset. Obviously, we don't know. But at this level, I think it kind of makes sense. The demand and supply, obviously, that has been a challenge across the system historically. We're very fortunate to have very established, experienced supply chain partners in this in the shape already of companies like Walmart, and Rite Aid, and I'm sure they're very much focused on ensuring as much supply as they can get. But I think it's inevitable that we're going to continue to see outages as you go through these geographic kind of surges that we've characterized this pandemic from the get-go. Next question. Ricky, thanks so much. Before I hand that to Brian to maybe reflect on a little bit, one of the things that I think we really are pleased about is the way in which OptumCare has developed a whole set of capabilities to deliver really enhanced focus on MA patients. Obviously, these patients have a high medical need very often. They need high touch. I've been super impressed with the development, not just in the clinic, but also through the at-home programs where we're able to continue to make sure folks are looked after properly. And actually, particularly as we've gone through the pandemic environment, people's preference to have care delivered in the home has become clearer and clearer. But Brian, maybe you could reflect a little more on how that plays through in terms of the attractiveness of what you're able to offer. Wyatt, would you like to maybe add from your perspective? Great. Thanks, Wyatt. Thanks so much for the question, Ricky. Next question. Thanks, A.J. Let me ask Dirk to start that one off. Great. Thanks so much, Dirk. And A.J., thanks so much for your question. Next question. Yes, Matt, thanks so much. I'm going to have Tim Spilker, who leads our CNS organization to respond to that. Tim, could I pass over to you? Tim, thanks. Matt, thank you also. Next question. Thanks so much, Nathan, for the question. Let me ask Tim Noel to make a couple of comments on that. Yes. I think that's exactly it, Tim. And Nathan, the focus on sustained delivery of value is incredibly important, I think, for the underpinning of UnitedHealthcare have done so well in this environment. It's really important from a distribution broker perspective. People understand what we're offering, but it's not volatile. It's even more important after people sign up. People get what they expect. And that is really -- that served us super well. We believe the way in which we put together this benefit package really serves the needs of the members. And it really speaks to why it's so popular. And it's why United, we've been able to grow market share consistently year after year after year. We'll do so again this year. We'll deliver our objectives in MA growth, and we're extremely positive about this part of our performance. Next question. I think overall, no, but let me ask Wyatt just to give you a little bit more detail. Thanks, Wyatt. Next question. Lance, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather Cianfrocco, who looks after OptumRx for us to respond. Heather? Heather, thanks so much. I'll just add to that. I think the work that's going on inside the OptumRx team, particularly around some of the specialty areas as well as the development of our new GPO and readiness for what is likely to be a very interesting period of loss of exclusivity on a lot of very significant pharmaceutical products, some of which are in categories which have really not had competition for many years, I think it sets up the next 24, 36 months, a very interesting period. We're super committed to delivering medicines at the lowest possible net cost to our members and their clients. And it's an area where we expect significant potential as we roll through over the next two or three years. So I think Heather's organization is doing some great foundational work for a next wave of opportunity in the pharmaceutical space. We have time for one last question, operator. So if we could maybe go to the last question. Steven, thanks so much. Let me ask John to respond to that. Yes, great. Thanks so much, John. And Steven, thanks very much for that last question. I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time to participate in the call this morning, and we certainly appreciate your time and attention. And I hope that what you've heard from John, Dirk and our colleagues on the call today helps you see why we're so confident in our ability to continue to deliver high-quality growth while helping to improve the lives of the people we serve. And we look forward to sharing our progress with you again in April. In the meantime, thanks so much for your attention, and Jennifer, thanks for hosting the call. Goodbye."

            "name": "Dr. Wyatt Decker",
            "content": "Yes, Josh, thanks for the question. Absolutely, we are positioned, the OptumHealth, as a growth platform. And we're investing in new markets and deeper penetration into established markets. As we do that and expand the capabilities, you'll continue to see us delivering on an 8% to 10% margin range. So you can anticipate us to continue to generate strong performance while investing in what will be a multiyear growth platform. Thanks. Yes. Well, BT touched on it, but our focus on the consumer and patient experience is relentless. And we are continuing to deploy new capabilities all the time. And Andrew, you mentioned home and community. When you look at the quality of the care that we provide, as Brian mentioned, it's now 99% of UHC members with OptumCare or enforce or higher level plans. And we don't stop there. And so now we have unveiled our virtual care platform that brings behavioral care to the forefront, brings virtual care and physical care and connects people to their own trusted providers. So you'll see us continuing to focus on how do we meet the needs of our members and how do we reduce friction for our patients. Yes. Thanks, Gary, for the question. And by far, the biggest component that you're referring to is what we've touched on, which is the investment in future growth and the platforms for managing 500,000 new risk lives in '22. We saw some modest uptick in our labor costs that were not really material to our performance, but just because I know that's on people's minds. So as we continue to address that. And you'll see us continue to invest in technologies like our virtual care delivery platform, behavioral health care and home and communities. So it isn't just the risk lives in a senior clinic model. It's this comprehensive care delivery model that has multiple components of investment that will yield fruit, not only in '22, but in following years. So thank you."

            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you, Dirk, and Happy New Year, everyone. I'll start by expanding a bit on Dirk's comments on the COVID impacts we're seeing. In the most recent weeks, inpatient hospitalization levels for our members are similar to the January 2021 levels, even with national COVID case rates about 4x higher. For those people needing inpatient care, severity is seemingly lower as we are seeing shorter lengths of stay compared to that earlier period. At the same time, we are observing familiar correlations of care activity patterns to other periods of elevated infection rates experienced over the past two years. For example, in these early weeks of January, we are seeing slowing in primary care, elective visit and procedural volumes. Activity over the past several weeks shows primary care visits having declined about 10% and an even higher rate of decline in specialist visits. As always, our prime focus is on helping people get the care they need when they need it. Moving now to our specific business performance. OptumHealth's revenue per consumer grew by over 30% in '21, driven by the increasing number of our patients served under value-based arrangements. Consistent with the expectations we shared in late November, we had a strong start to the year and continue to expect to add 500,000 new patients in accountable value-based relationships, benefiting from the groundwork laid over the past many years. OptumInsight earnings grew 25% in '21, with operating margins approaching 28% for the year. We ended the year with a revenue backlog of $22.4 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion over the prior year. Our expanding relationships serving health systems has been a key factor driving this growth, and we expect these partnerships to continue to grow in '22 and beyond. OptumRx earnings grew 6% for the year, driven by the continued expansion of our pharmacy services businesses, supply chain initiatives and strong cost management activity and benefiting from strong customer retention. In addition, we continue to see the impact of OptumRx' movement to a higher value pharmacy care and specialty services orientation. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Full year revenues of $223 billion grew 11%. As noted, our 2022 Medicare Advantage member growth outlook is very positive and consistent with the objectives we established at our November investor conference. Within the up to 800,000 new members we will serve in '22, about 3/4 will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans. And given the steady strides we've made in quality performance, we have the opportunity to enroll people in our newly rated five-star plans throughout the entirety of this year. Our Medicaid membership outlook for '22 continues to incorporate an expectation that states resume eligibility redeterminations, resulting in modest net attrition. In January, we began serving the citizens of Minnesota and continue to support the Missouri expansion this year as well as renewed relationships with Ohio, Tennessee and Nevada. Over the course of the year, we will look to continue to expand upon the nearly 8 million individuals we serve across 31 states. We concluded '21 with commercial membership, about 200,000 people ahead of the original outlook provided. Creating this momentum is the strong response we are seeing to the new innovative products you have heard us discuss. Products such as Navigate Now, which use the Optum virtual network as a first option. Our capital capacities remain strong. Full year '21 cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion or 1.3x net income, about $2 billion above the initial outlook we shared a year ago. We continue to expect our 2022 cash flow to approach $24 billion, about 1.2x net income. And we ended '21 with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 38%. These ample capital capacities allow us to continue to accelerate our investments, while remaining committed to an advancing shareholder dividend and supporting our expected repurchase of between $5 billion and $6 billion of stock in '22. Our 2022 adjusted earnings per share outlook of $21.10 to $21.60 is consistent with the view we offered seven weeks ago. From this distance in contrast to the past two years, we expect the seasonal pattern to be more consistent with our historical experience with just under 50% of full year earnings in the first half and the first two quarters comparably even. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew. Sure. And just, Josh, getting at your point of how does that progress over time, and Dirk did offer some nice commentary on the call in terms of the investments that we make as we're looking to move to capitation. And that does tell a kind of a multiyear story of investments as we get ready to move to capitalization. So that's even before any revenue comes into the picture we're making, we're making those investments. And significant -- very significant ahead in a couple of years ahead, especially in the year ahead of those transitions before there's any kind of revenue view. So that is creating kind of that impact. And what Dr. Decker was describing there. So as we seek to do that and those movements occur, we're always bearing within that a fairly significant investment load. This year, it was obviously fairly significant with the 0.5 million members that we transitioned. And we continue to accelerate, those investments continue also, while we start getting leverage on those as we do more of it. So we're kind of bearing that within the 8% to 10% that Wyatt was describing there. Yes, Kevin, it's John here. So yes, when we think about kind of our business structure, we have separate businesses across the Company. And as you know well, extremely important to us is remaining -- is retaining bright lines across those businesses. We serve over 100 payers in OptumCare. We serve many payers across the OptumInsight businesses. And so when we think about our business, they stand alone from a margin perspective, all of our businesses. And that's very important to how we operate the Company, how we serve others and how we approach the marketplace. Yes, it was materially in that zone of $1.80 is where it fell out. Look, if I would tell you where we thought it was going to be back in November, we said it and the components that would comprise that $1.80 and how they actually fell and they went through all those components. Yes, certainly, a number of them played out a little bit differently than we would have thought back at that period. Perhaps the important learning we got over that period, though, were just the various -- the correlations that we see across the components as those -- as different case rate volumes would occur over the course of the period and such and the impacts on care activity levels and other areas. So definitely, probably didn't step into the year, a year ago, predicting there would be a summer wave actually even. But the correlations held very true over that period. It was the important factor for us. So yes, within that zone of the $1.80 and -- but -- and the components that they played out certainly where it instructed and are instructing how we even think about 2022 and the impacts that we've talked about for that also."

            "content": "Good. Great. Hey, thanks, Scott, for the question. This is Tim Noel. Yes, the way I see the MA market is it's been highly competitive for a number of years. And I don't see 2022 as a step function increase and that level of competitiveness. The trend of more entrants, better benefits has really been a multiyear one. And we see this trend as being one that's very good for seniors and also one that's very good for the overall growth of the Medicare Advantage industry. Seniors are shopping for more value as they should be. And for our part, we're really focused on differentiating our offerings in the marketplace. And what we're doing is we're driving things, not only around benefits, but also around capabilities. Better digital tools, ease of payment, product innovation, better and more personalized service experiences, better clinical quality, more value-based and aligned care provider relationships are all part of that. And our approach continues to resonate in the marketplace. So, we really like our performance and our positioning inside a very strong and growing marketplace. Yes. Thanks, Nathan, for the question. As we think about 2023, certainly a little bit too early to get into a lot of depth there given that we haven't even seen an indication of rates from CMS yet. However, when I think about broad strategic goals around distribution and product, I'm not seeing any shift in the stance that we've gone to market with in 2022 and even 2021 and years prior. We are very comfortable with our multichannel distribution approach. And as I indicated earlier, our approach on differentiating our products in a very robust industry continuing to resonate. So, no deviation from what's been a successful formula for us and providing really great value to consumers."

        "content": "Operator: Please standby, we're about to begin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 14, 2021, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the President and Chief Operating Officer for UnitedHealth Group, Dirk McMahon. Please go ahead, sir.\nDirk McMahon: Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. Unfortunately, our CEO and colleague, Andrew, is not with us this morning since he had an urgent but straightforward procedure last night for a kidney stone. All went very well and we expect him fully back in just a few days. I'm quite confident he's listening now. So I hope you're doing well, boss. John Rex and I will be subbing for Andrew this morning and we have our management team with us, as usual, to help with your questions. We're here today to discuss third-quarter results and the expanding opportunities we see looking ahead. As a result of the progress at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we have increased our 2021 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of 1865 to 1890 per share. We continue to prioritize 3 things Andrew has discussed before which are foundational to the growth of our enterprise. First, unlocking the collaborative potential within Optum and UnitedHealthcare for the benefit of all. Second, further developing our technology in data science platform to aid patient care and experience and to help the system run better. Third, strengthening our consumer experience, capabilities, and values. I'll briefly highlight a couple of items for you. You likely have seen the CMS Medicare advantage/quality ratings showing 95% of our UnitedHealthcare members will be in four-star rated plans or better for 2023, up from 78% for 2022 and a new high for our Company. with Optum Care on behalf of the many payers, we serve 99% of Medicare Advantage patients will be enforced our plans or better for 2023. A second important highlight in the quarter, we were encouraged by the ongoing strength in our employer and individual business, which has now grown by over 330,000 people this year with revenue up 7% year-over-year. We continue to see active interest in our product innovations, such as our All Savers level-funded offering and are encouraged by our competitiveness in the market and momentum heading into '22. We also elevated consumer connectivity by incorporating fitness offerings from industry-leading partners. OptumHealth continues to build momentum as well. Entering the open enrollment period for Medicare advantage, we have more than 2.2 million people served under physician-led, fully accountable arrangements, and expect '22 to be another year of record expansion in this key part of our portfolio. Our broad home-based clinical care initiatives at Optum and UnitedHealthcare are central to improving near and longer-term health outcomes for people with medical, behavioral, and social needs. These efforts include Optum at home, which delivers high-quality primary care services in the convenience of the home setting and supports recovery after hospitalizations. Senior served by our home and community offers experienced a 14% lower rate of hospital admissions and about a 4% higher rate of physician encounters. In addition to carrying for people in their homes, we continued to expand capabilities in other optimal sites of care, including via digital means. Optum is distinctively enabling virtual care for patients using their own primary care physicians and behavioral clinicians. For example, a physician engaging in a virtual visit with a patient can easily bring in a behavioral health professional for real-time consultation. UnitedHealthcare is using opt-ins virtual capabilities to introduce a new suite of digital-first products offering a near seamless experience between virtual and traditional primary, specialty, and urgent care. We expect, during 2022 and beyond, to further build on these opportunities to connect and integrate multiple channels of care. Simplify the experience for patients and providers, and deliver quality care that is affordable and in the optimal setting. Let me now go a little deeper in a few areas to give you an assessment of how we were doing on the themes I mentioned at the outset. OptumInsight continues to drive better clinical and operational performance at the health system level. Last week, we reached a new multi-year partnership with a leading and innovative health system, SSM Health, whose 40,000 employees, 33 hospitals and post-acute facilities, and 300 physician clinics, serve the people of Missouri, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Illinois. OptumInsight brings real value in helping the system strengthen and scale essential functions such as care coordination, revenue cycle management, and digital modernization, all to improve health outcomes in patients' care experiences. These and similar efforts to simplify processes, reduce administrative burdens, and help our partners focus more attention on their care, on their core missions of patient care. OptumRx continues to deliver to health system partners such as its new multi-year agreement with 0.32 health, which serves more than 2 million people in New England through its founding organizations, Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, and Tufts Health Plan. OptumRx will provide integrated pharmacy benefit and specialty offerings that will enhance services and deliver improved affordability for their plan members. OptumRx is having a substantial impact through its community behavioral health pharmacies, which now serve nearly 700,000 people with mental health, addiction, and other conditions through more than 600 dispensaries across 47 states. The pharmacies deliver a high-touch approach to care that contributes to a more than 90% medication adherence rate and lower emergency room visits and hospitalizations by 18 and 40% respectively, driving better health outcomes and a lower total cost of care. Within our UnitedHealthcare government businesses, we have increased processing efficiency by 25% over the last year by using Optum technology to improve auto adjudication rates and intelligent work distribution to appropriately skilled channels. We have many such initiatives underway across the enterprise in affordability, provider experience, and product development as we employ advanced technology in data analytics to drive even greater value for the people we serve and the health system. Before turning over the call to John, a quick word on our pending combination with Change Healthcare. We continue to work diligently to satisfy regulatory requests and now believe, based on our experience so far, the transaction should close in the first part of 2022. We are highly energized about the positive impact we can have working together with the exceptional change team. A team aligned with our mission and values and focused on delivering substantial benefits for the healthcare system. These benefits will include helping clinicians by simplifying access to real-time evidence-based guidance as they are serving patients. Closing gaps in care more rapidly to improve health outcomes and lower costs, reducing unnecessary complexity by removing administrative waste and obstruction to make the care process simpler, more cost-effective, and more transparent. And bringing greater convenience, and simplicity to managing consumer health finances while ensuring care providers get paid more quickly and accurately. Optum and Change Healthcare's capabilities fundamentally are complementary in distinct, because both companies already successfully serve health plans and state governments, care providers, and consumers in a highly competitive market. We believe this combination will make the healthcare system work better for everyone and bring exceptional value to those we serve. With that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. This morning, we reported third quarter and year-to-date revenues of 72 and 214 billion respectively. Growth of 11 and 12% over last year. This growth was led by OptumHealth, primarily our care businesses. In the third quarter, the Optum platform comprised 54% of enterprise operating earnings and continues to show strong growth momentum. Our performance reflects the diverse and complementary strengths of our business, setting the stage for growth in the years ahead. Our updated full-year '21 outlook includes unfavorable COVID impacts consistent with the expectations we have discussed throughout the year. During the third quarter, while direct COVID care and testing costs ran above the expectations we had nearly a year ago, we again saw elective care offsetting the impacts of higher case rates, much like previous cycles in the pandemic. This quarter, there were approximately 60,000 COVID hospitalizations, meaningfully above the second quarter, with the month of August peaking at nearly 30,000 and then declining in September. Looking at specific business performance. OptumHealth's third-quarter revenue and earnings increased 32% and 37%, respectively, year-over-year. Revenue per consumer grew by 30%. This reflects the increasing impact and number of value-based relationships within Optum Care. The expansion of our in-home and community health platform, as well as the growing acuity of the needs we can serve. OptumInsight revenue grew 13% in the quarter, and earnings grew 15%, as the revenue backlog increased by 12% to 22.3 billion. We see overall business development sourcing and activity levels increasing, particularly with care provider customers. And for our software and analytics offerings. OptumRx revenue and scripts grew 6% year-over-year and earnings 5%. OptumRx is seeing both strong customer retention levels and sale success for the largely completed 22 selling season and early activity for 23. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, the third quarter showed increasing member growth in our commercial offerings, particularly in employer-sponsored benefits. Increased employment is a broad underlying contributor, but we are particularly encouraged by the growth we are achieving in our affordable consumer-centric offerings. Medicare advantage membership has grown 745,000 this year. Inclusive of plans which serve dual special needs numbers, we expect to add a total of over 900,000 Medicare advantage members. The number of people served through managed Medicaid grew by more than 1 million members over last year. As we began to serve people in new regions such as North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana, and as state-based redetermination activities remained popped, we were honored to begin serving people in the Missouri Medicaid expansion this month. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with third-quarter cash flows from operations at 7.6 billion or 1.8 times net income. And we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39%. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance, this morning, we updated our 2021 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.65 to $18.90 per share. Now, with the close of the third quarter, your attention understandably turns to next year. As is our custom, we will offer a few early observations here. While reserving the majority of this conversation for our November 30 Investor Conference, which we hope will be held in person and in New York. Our businesses are both growing and operating well with strong momentum heading into next year. While the pandemic-related impacts remain difficult to predict, given the current trends, we would expect a lower unfavorable COVID impact than experienced in '21. Still, as the dramatic variation of the last 20 months has demonstrated to all, prudent management suggests we should offer an outlook respectful of the fact that the current situation is without precedent. Taking all elements together at this distance, we see current analyst consensus as reasonably beginning to calibrate a '22 outlook. Envisioning that consensus as being towards the upper end of our initial adjusted earnings per share outlook range. With the range being similar to that offered initially for '21. There's still untapped collaborative potential between UnitedHealthcare and Optum to benefit individuals and the system. The power of applied technology to advanced care and service. Improved opportunities in consumer health and experience, and the passion of our people. These and so many other elements lead us to believe our performance expectations for the years ahead remained fully supportive of our long-term 13% to 16% earnings-per-share growth outlook. We look forward to going into more detail on both our view of '22 and the many years of growth beyond at our Investor Conference. With that, Operator, let's open up for questions. One for the caller, please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The floor is now open for questions. At this time, if you have a question or comment, [Operator Instructions]. We ask that you limit yourselves to 1 question. If you ask multiple questions we'll only be answering the first question so we can respond to everyone in the queue this morning. So we'll go ahead and take our first caller, Matt Dosch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatt Borsch: All right. Thank you. Squeaky clean quarter. I was hoping maybe you could just talk about how united and to the extent your visibility on others are approaching group commercial, fully insured rate increases for 2022.\nDirk McMahon: Why don't we let Brian time to take that question. Go ahead.\nBrian Thompson: Thanks for the question, Matt. Certainly as we look forward to 2022, the picture is a lot more clear than as we look at the past 20 months. I would say that we feel optimistic not only about our pricing and the rationality of the market, but most importantly the value that we're bringing to customers. So we're optimistic as we look forward.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Let's go to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJoshua Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. My question relates to the value-based care, but more from the UnitedHealthcare side. And so how does UHC think about the use of value-based care providers and maybe some expectations on the movement of membership into fully cap arrangements in 2022. I think you saved 250,000 lives this year, so curious how you're thinking about next year. And then maybe as part of that, what advantages you see of using Optum Care as a partner over some of the others and how you evaluate partners in the markets.\nBrian Thompson: Yeah, appreciate the question. A - Brian Thompson here again. I would say we certainly are encouraged by continuing our advanced care penetration with partners. OptumCare certainly being one of several. When we partner with OptumCare, we see not only our highest satisfaction, but our best benefits and overall performance. And you heard that in our star quality results as well. And we're encouraged not only by what we have done, but also by what's on the horizon.  Historically, you've looked at our combinations largely in a traditional Medicare advantage space, and you're seeing us expand into complex populations and duals. And we're also really encouraged with what we're doing in the commercial marketplace as well. We've got some new offerings coming in that space. So I would say the key takeaway here is breadth and impact. We continue to scale and expand in that space and it's important. We really see this value-based aligned care as a way to drive good value for those that we support and serve.\nWyatt Decker: Thanks, BT and Josh, thanks for the question to A - Wyatt Decker. I would just add that at Optum Health and Care, we are very pleased to be playing a role in reinventing the U.S. healthcare system focused around patients as consumers and value-based care as a major pillar. As you mentioned, we've grown by 250,000 fully capitated lives this year. And we're excited to our partnership with UHC, as well as collaboration partnership with over 90 payers in total to continue to grow our value-based care delivery construct. The other point I'd make is you'll see us increasingly weaving together all of our assets in a comprehensive care delivery paradigm that we feel is unique and differentiated in the marketplace. Thank you.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you for that, BT and Wyatt. Let's go to the next question, Operator, please.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to go to the guidance commentary and I guess just clarify, John, is it inclusive or exclusive of the $1.80 headwind from this year? When you talked about reasonable relative to consensus, maybe at the higher end, do you factor in the $1.80? Or can you just provide some guardrails around how you're thinking about that $1.80. Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Hi, Ralph. Good morning. So yes. So as it relates to this year's $1.80, look, our expectation is that will clearly be lower than it was in 2021, as we think about it. We also don't think that will be nothing. I can't imagine we hit January 1 and everything ceases up immediately. So we don't think that will be the case at all. So inclusive of that, when you think about going to that, I think getting inclusive. And as we look at where the where the analyst consensus currently centers, that seems like kind of a reasonable starting point in terms of how we think about -- how we think about that and how we would anticipate and be respectful of the fact that we don't know exactly how this will progress as we move into the new year. Thanks, Ralph.\nDirk McMahon: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Coming back to the topic that Josh touched on in value-based care, but perhaps more Optum Care focused. I'm wondering if you could talk about, one, the providers within the 53,000 that are responsible for the 2.2 million fully capitalized, like how does that interweave? And then secondly, if you could talk about the call it the margin on the global cap revenue. So how capable or how much impact are those providers having on consumption of downstream care such that Optum Care makes a margin on the capitated revenue? Thanks.\nDirk McMahon: Yeah, we'll go to light on that. But let me first start by saying, of course, all of the providers within Optum Care, they are responsible for managing the downstream spend, whether it'd be at specialists, whether it'd be at hospitals. [Indiscernible] And one of the key things that we do within Optum Care is we made investments in our systems to absorb, take, and manage risk. It's just not a paper transfer. It's actually a system where the providers are fully aware of the capitated arrangements and they're managing accordingly. So Wyatt, why don't you add on top of that? You're more on the details.\nWyatt Decker: Yeah. Thanks for the question. And as Dirk mentioned, we focus relentlessly on the quadruple lame, including lowering total cost of care, and providing better outcomes and outstanding patient experiences. And we are relentless in monitoring specific data points that help deliver that out, those outcomes. Specifically, what we see is the members that are in fully capitated arrangements overall have about a 30% lower hospitalization rate and about 40% lower skilled nursing facility occupation rate than their counterparts and fee-for-service, Medicare, as an example. So we'll continue to drive that value proposition.  And as I touched on in the previous question but I'll go a little deeper, as you think about us with our home and community assets increasingly meeting people in their terms, in their homes to deliver components of value-based and primary care, preventive care, and wellness care, and identify early conditions that otherwise might have led to an ER visit or hospitalization. You'll also see us continuing to bring onboard very innovative behavioral health care delivery solutions that are integrated with the primary care providers that again, identify and treat mental health and substance use disorders by identifying them early and treating them in lower acuity settings when that's appropriate. Those are just a couple of examples of how we're creating value for those that we served. Thank you.\nDirk McMahon: Perfect. That's great, Wyatt. Thank you very much for the question. Can we have the next question, Operator, please?\nOperator: Sure. Next, we'll go to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right. Great. Thanks. I wonder if you could provide just a little bit more color about utilization trends in the quarter and maybe do that by product line, and breaking it out by COVID and non-COVID utilization where you are versus baseline. Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Kevin, this is John. Good morning. Yes. A few perspective on that, as we think about utilizations, trends in the quarter. And I gave some broad indication just in terms of where we were with COVID inpatient stays, and that's for our members. Maybe to give a little kind of further commentary. So as we sit here today, about 5,000 of our members are in an inpatient setting for a COVID-related condition right now. And I'd say versus the peak that we experienced during the quarter. That's probably just a little more than 50% of the peak in that zone, probably a little of that we experienced over the course of the period.  That fell across categories, probably categories, much like you would have observed and the reports coming out nationally in terms of the types of individuals who are in these settings. An average age that was considerably younger than we saw in prior set -- in prior periods for COVID, so similar to what you would have noticed across the board. In terms of broad utilization trends, similar to what we would have described in 2Q where we did describe where, we continue to see commercial members be more active in elective care, and public sector or government program members a little bit less active.  And so kind of similar, just trending at different levels given the prevalence of COVID. It's been interesting over the course of the 20 month. There has been a consistent, fairly rapid reaction when COVID cases go up nationally in terms of the preference of patients to whether or not to seek elective care. That again happen this quarter where it comes in fairly quickly in terms of the hesitation in the system to access, so probably similar along those ranges. Hopefully that provides a little additional color for you on what we're seeing across the full book of business. Thanks for your, Kevin, question. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Next we've got Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First let me just follow up there. John, if you've talked about I think on the previous calls, your guidance assumed about a 101, 102 percent of normal. in the back half of this year. If you could run that by, it sounds like you're saying commercial might have been on a little higher and Medicare, Medicaid a little lower. But if you can give us those numbers specifically, just we have kind of a read through to the rest of the industry, that might be helpful in what you saw in the quarter. And then what do you price, would it be fair that for you to share what you priced for, for next year in terms of trend due to priced to 101, 102% for next year, similar conservatism versus this year? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Justin. So a few other elements on that. Similar broad trends to what we observed in 2Q, just shifting because of the COVID prevalence. Downshifting a bit in terms of elective -- in terms of COVID prevalence but then really fully offset by COVID. That is elective downshifting because of COVID prevalence and then fully offset as we saw, COVID Care become a more important part of the business. That really flowed across the businesses with those trends across the book, like I described, in terms of the general outlook on that. And let me turn to Dirk here to talk about some implications to how we would have anticipated that in our forward pricing.\nDirk McMahon: I mean, Justin, I mean, we of course, are going to always price to our best estimates of forward trend and we're going to take into consideration all the variables that we've talked about. That toggle that John just talked about between COVID, and what we expect with abatement. I don't want to get into the specific details clearly, that's competitive. But at the end of the day, just be aware that we've considered all factors as we priced our forward business within our books. Thanks. Next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Yeah. Wanted to ask a little bit about employer growth and was interested in for the third quarter, how much of that was new wins versus in accounts. And then as you're looking at '22 and you're getting visibility on national accounts and middle market. If you can just give a little color on those individual segments and what's driving wins in 2022 in particular? is it product features or is it all savers products, maybe just a little more color on why you're getting wins? Thanks.\nDirk McMahon: Okay. Why don't we send that question to Bill Golden, who will talk about all three of those. Not only the quarter, but also why do you think we're having some success.\nBill Golden: Yes. So thank you for the question. So we're excited about the traction we're seeing in our third quarter enrollment, membership growth for the quarter was really attributed to what I would say a three main components. One is in-group growth was net positive for the quarter. Our wins versus losses, was also positive for the third consecutive quarter, and obviously the preferred one acquisition contributed to overall growth. We're expecting continued commercial growth in 2022 across both our fully-insured and self-funded segments. We're confident in the value story. It is resonating in the market and we're getting good traction with our broad product portfolio. And so products like Bind and Care Cash, and Harmony, and Motion, and All Savers are all contributing to that growth. 1/1/22 for middle market is obviously a little early to predict exactly how all those products will perform in the market, but we're very confident in our ability to continue to perform well in the commercial market for 2022.\nDirk McMahon: And I would just add on to what Bill said. I mean, the new products are important, but one of the fundamental things within the commercial group is clearly affordability. And as we sit back, we have a good program where we manage utilization, we manage medical cost initiatives. We work hard on our network contracts. So a lot of things contribute to success in commercial and some product and a lot affordability. So thanks for your question. Operator. Next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly next, we'll go to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Thanks. Good morning. Interested if you can maybe talk a bit about the labor and staffing environment right now in healthcare and, one, how that's impacting the OptumCare provider business is, whether you're seeing an impact as the vaccine mandates are going into effect as well? But just more broadly as we look at just some of the tightness around labor and staffing in the system. How is that influencing your thoughts in terms of where overall health system capacity is right now? It feels like we're pretty much maxed out right and we sorted just shift between COVID and non - COVID, but seems like the system itself is running pretty much at full capacity right now in terms of just the staffing dynamics. Thanks.\nWyatt Decker: Scott, this is A - Wyatt Decker. Very key question. And as you point out, the U.S. healthcare market is very tight right now. For us in our care delivery assets, we are seeing good both retention, engagement and recruitment of physicians and care providers. A couple of examples like give you, we mentioned at the start of the year, our intend to bring on-board 10,000 additional physicians to our ranks and we've already brought onboard about 8,000 year-to-date. So just as a high level indicator, why, what do we attribute this to?  And I would say in partnership with Patricia Lewis and our Human Capital team, we are relentlessly focused on supporting our front-line care provider teams throughout the pandemic. And they know this, and I haven't been deeply appreciative of it. And we work very hard and this precedes the pandemic, but has yielded dividends during the pandemic to support them in an environment that decreases clerical burden and allows them to focus on the work they love, which is actually taking care of patients, which is what we all want. So overall, we're managing through this. I won't kid you. It's tight and we're keeping a close eye on it throughout all of our operations in our 43 states where we provide care. Thank you.\nBrian Thompson: Yeah. And I would just say as Wyatt said, we're managing through this. From an environmental standpoint, it's not just clinicians, it's in all workers. But one thing I would say is, we had a fairly significant work at home presence before the pandemic even started. So sort of our employee value proposition sort of was we had a good value proposition before. It started net sort of carried through. And I think like all employers, what we're trying to do is take care of our people, do the right things from a reasonable in this standpoint and continue to focus on our mission. And that's what we're continuing to do. So I'm optimistic that we're going to continue to be able to staff our operation and provide the services that we need to all of our patients and members across the country.\nDirk McMahon: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly next, we'll go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning. Just a quick follow-up question on the 2022 early comments. A couple of variables there. One is, we think about Change transaction. I think you said, you expect it to close in the first half of the year. If you can give us an updated Change accretion number, I think was 20 to $0.50 previously for 2021. So how should we think about for 2022? And then I understand that there are a lot of uncertainties around COVID and $1.80 in net COVID headwinds but I think previously you quantified about $0.70 as coming from risk adjustments, so should we think that these at least are going to reverse next year and maybe how are you tracking with the annual wellness visits completion versus where you were last year or where you were in 2019.\nBrian Thompson: Thanks for the question, Ricky, I think a few components there and what get -- try to get it all those. So just in terms of the relates to change an impact, I just point out that we don't bring in acquisitions into our outlook until those close. So my commentary, doesn't anticipate change in there and we would look to bring that until it closes. When that is complete, we've no reason to expect that we wouldn't be trending along the same levels that we talked about prior. When that does come in, it's just a question of when it comes in and year and how the benefits play\nJohn Rex: They're just timing impacts in terms about when it would actually close during the year, but not incorporated in that outlook. As it relates to the $1.80 that we articulated last year, yeah, we broke out a number of different components that were important in that element. And frankly, my hope would be not talking about a COVID number by the time we get into '22, that we move beyond that and we can just move beyond to business as normal as we can while being always ready to address the environment that's at hand. But that would be certainly our intent as we'd step out here, that we'd be moving beyond that view. In terms of elements such as annual wellness visits and things, I'd ask BT to comment, A - Brian Thompson to comment a moment on that also.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, John. As you laid out at the beginning, while both our Medicaid and Medicare businesses are running still below baseline on a net basis, we are encouraged by the encounters with the physicians of primary care visits and annual wellness visits, as well as in-home clinical visits. Those have been encouraging. So I certainly expect less of a headwind in 2022 due to those encounters, certainly getting traction, certainly compared to 2021.\nJohn Rex: Excellent. Thank you, Ricky. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Next, we'll go to Kevin Caliendo with UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Can you talk a little bit about elective trends in September and as they moved into October, how that's changed at all, if you've seen any uptick. Also just on your commercial market growth, your membership growth in the quarter. Can you break it out between small group versus large group? Thank you.\nDirk McMahon: So thanks, Kevin. Let's let A - Brian Thompson address a couple of those.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Hey, Kevin, Brian here. As I think about elective care, what we've really seen is a pretty steady return to normal. We don't really see what I'll call as an unnatural suppression, nor have we seen a significant bounce back suggesting a big catch up. In fact, when you think about scheduled care, what we have found is it most of that cycles through in about 4 to 6 months, we look at things like colonoscopies and joint replacements as good leading indicators.  And those are running pretty close to baseline, obviously with the spike that we saw in September, there's a little bit of that, but we would expect to flow through in the fourth quarter, but that's fully accounted for in our outlook. And I would just say from a commercial perspective, maybe echoing what Bill said, feeling really balanced, really across our fully insured growth for the quarter. So just optimistic that that was across not only our group business, but we also saw a return of our non-exchange individual growth. So a really good quarter from a fully-insured perspective.\nKevin Caliendo: Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Yes. Next, we'll go to AJ Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just to drill down a little bit on the OptumRx and what's incorporated in '22 outlook headwinds and tailwinds, I know we had the vaccine this year probably helped script trends a little bit. We had some specialty conversions, maybe that helped, and obviously what was the dynamic around renewing contracts and so forth? What do you thinking about for '22 for OptumRx?\nHeather Cianfrocco : Hey, Heather. San Franco here. Thanks A.J for the question. So you mentioned, we talked in the second quarter a bit about vaccine. We saw a little bit of that this quarter in growth, but it's proportionately down. The last quarter I think was about a third of the growth this quarter, it's down to about call it between 20% and 25%. So you are seeing really our growth. First of all, in this quarter as a result of modest PBM growth together with continued in membership growth together with continued pharmacy services growth, when we look at '22, we're going to see that to continue.  Our pharmacy services growth, remember that's our home delivery specialty, infusion, the multi-dose, as well as our direct-to-consumer community, businesses, those will continue to grow in '22. We see those [Indiscernible] outpacing growth of the rest of OptumRx pharmacy. And I guess I'll call out a few things when I think about '22. First of all, we've made those investments and so we're seeing that we talked about [Indiscernible] in our community pharmacies. Dirk talked about those this morning and how they're growing, not just an expanded sites, but our existing sites are continuing to show really strong growth as they expand services to existing members, and expand in different types of health centers.  We'll continue to see that in '22. And we think the solutions we're bringing in an integrated way together with our consumer experience and our real push to make drugs, therapeutics affordable, and easy to access for our members will continue to see that. And I just put you -- point you back to our long-range growth, where we'll continue to be as in stable with our revenue on our earnings growth in '22 as we look towards our long-range plan. So thanks for the question.\nJohn Rex: That was great. And I think AJ, what that points out clearly a broad pharmacy portfolio with clearly a laser-focus on affordability and laser-focus on serving people, getting their medications and people sales where they need them, and basically servicing the entire, what I'll call pharmacy landscape with effective products and services. Thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much, and good morning. I just want to go back to your comments around virtual care and a digital first product in 2022, can you talk about what that will entail first up? And then secondly, when you talk about connecting multiple channels of care in 2022, I would assume that's primarily keeping the patient in the home, but can you maybe just give a little more detail around what those programs would look like and what the potential cost savings could be?\nJohn Rex: First of all, let me hit on the virtual products that we have. I talked about it before, we're getting into from version 1 to version 2. The second version is really not telehealth as a standalone service, but really effectively integrated into physical delivery in total, courses of care. And so as I think about how we might -- how we're organizing our products, what we would have is a virtual PCP available to some people. And many people across the country don't have relationships with PCPs. So a product based on having virtual PCP, having that PCP managed like a Brick-and-mortar PCP.  And then manage the downstream expenses, being able to refer to digital properties, be able to, as I said, bringing a behavioral specialists, where needed. And as we sit and we look at some of the products that we have and we're designing, we're expecting probably about a 15% price advantage to other similar products in the market. So we're kind of excited about the efficiency of virtual in that context. So give me your second question again, Lisa. I was focused on virtual.\nLisa Gill: No. Just more around when you talk about connecting multiple channels of care in 2022. Should I assume that that's primarily connecting care in the home or is there something that I'm not thinking about?\nJohn Rex: No. You're thinking of this multi-modality, it's home, it's digital, it's what we do in the office. That's one of the things that we're trying to do. And I'm glad you hit on that. Our ability to serve people where they want to be served is something that we're really focused on across all three of our lines of business is very important. And clearly, people have different care needs and they have different preferences for care, and we want to provide that access across the board.\nDirk McMahon: Yeah. We say within OptumHealth or Optum Care, the build out of the home and community platform is one of the more important areas that Wyatt and his team are focused on. There has been lots of development there. Wyatt, maybe you could add a little color.\nWyatt Decker: Absolutely. So we're very excited about bringing virtual care, as Dirk said, in a differentiated way into people's homes so that they can access care. We can help TRIOS them and onboard them. We can provide primary care and when needed, we can provide care delivery in appropriate in some instances in the home, or we're leveraging particularly our urgent care platform to provide nearby physical care. And then we blended in our virtual and physical behavioral care deliveries as well. So we're now live in all 50 states, we're serving over 7 million members today, and we look forward to continue to expand these offerings. Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Operator. Next question, please. And I think we have time for about two more questions here as we approach the bottom of the hour.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So you touched on the topic, Medicare risk adjuster payments earlier. This was also a little bit more topical about a month ago with The Wall Street Journal putting a spotlight on it. So I guess I'm just curious if you have any updated high-level thoughts on MRI payments conceptually for the managed care industry overall. And do you see any potential reform of MRI near-term or do you expect status quo going forward? Thanks.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you very much for the question. First, let me point to the value proposition that Medicare Advantage provides, I think that's important context. MA serves 27 million Americans with very high quality care, and compared to fee-for-service Medicare it may cost less. It's more equitable, has better quality access and outcomes, and greater coverage and benefits with nearly 100% consumer satisfaction. Very important to the care that seniors receive, and it's important that we preserve the stability of this program that so many people rely on. And we think about the risk adjustment model in the payment system, the model has been critical to providing broad and equitable access to MA. Risk adjustment levels the playing field and ensures that there's no disincentives to care for the most vulnerable. So we really feel that it's an essential part of encouraging the right incentives in the program and think that it's something to build on and broadly support that we need to think about how to build on these positive elements and aspects of the program for which this is one of them.\nDirk McMahon: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please. Next and final question.\nOperator: All right. We'll take our last question from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, thanks. I wanted to come back to the labor market and some of the things that we're reading new about provider financials. I was wondering what you're hearing from your network partners on this issue and how you think it will or will not influence rate negotiations over the next couple of years? Thanks.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thanks for the question. I think, yeah. What we're hearing from network partners is that their cost of labor is higher, so that comes up in the negotiations and like anything else, it's part of what we negotiate and how we try to work with our network partners on coming up with the right pricing and negotiating accordingly. Yes, we're hearing that there is obviously, there's staffing shortages. Obviously, many of the hospitals and other providers have to pay more for their input. And that's going to be reflected in the economics as we go forward. And of course, all that is reflected in how we price going forward. So yes, that occurs.\nJohn Rex: Thank you for the question with that, what I would just like to close with is as follows. Thanks everybody for your time and your questions today. We hope you're taking away the impression of a Company that's confident, it's opportunities and the ability to grow. And we're deeply aware of where and how we need to improve and we're fully committed to our mission of helping people lead healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. We look forward to sharing with you a more at our November 30th Investor Conference, hopefully in-person in New York. Thanks for your time today.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk McMahon",
            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. Unfortunately, our CEO and colleague, Andrew, is not with us this morning since he had an urgent but straightforward procedure last night for a kidney stone. All went very well and we expect him fully back in just a few days. I'm quite confident he's listening now. So I hope you're doing well, boss. John Rex and I will be subbing for Andrew this morning and we have our management team with us, as usual, to help with your questions. We're here today to discuss third-quarter results and the expanding opportunities we see looking ahead. As a result of the progress at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we have increased our 2021 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of 1865 to 1890 per share. We continue to prioritize 3 things Andrew has discussed before which are foundational to the growth of our enterprise. First, unlocking the collaborative potential within Optum and UnitedHealthcare for the benefit of all. Second, further developing our technology in data science platform to aid patient care and experience and to help the system run better. Third, strengthening our consumer experience, capabilities, and values. I'll briefly highlight a couple of items for you. You likely have seen the CMS Medicare advantage/quality ratings showing 95% of our UnitedHealthcare members will be in four-star rated plans or better for 2023, up from 78% for 2022 and a new high for our Company. with Optum Care on behalf of the many payers, we serve 99% of Medicare Advantage patients will be enforced our plans or better for 2023. A second important highlight in the quarter, we were encouraged by the ongoing strength in our employer and individual business, which has now grown by over 330,000 people this year with revenue up 7% year-over-year. We continue to see active interest in our product innovations, such as our All Savers level-funded offering and are encouraged by our competitiveness in the market and momentum heading into '22. We also elevated consumer connectivity by incorporating fitness offerings from industry-leading partners. OptumHealth continues to build momentum as well. Entering the open enrollment period for Medicare advantage, we have more than 2.2 million people served under physician-led, fully accountable arrangements, and expect '22 to be another year of record expansion in this key part of our portfolio. Our broad home-based clinical care initiatives at Optum and UnitedHealthcare are central to improving near and longer-term health outcomes for people with medical, behavioral, and social needs. These efforts include Optum at home, which delivers high-quality primary care services in the convenience of the home setting and supports recovery after hospitalizations. Senior served by our home and community offers experienced a 14% lower rate of hospital admissions and about a 4% higher rate of physician encounters. In addition to carrying for people in their homes, we continued to expand capabilities in other optimal sites of care, including via digital means. Optum is distinctively enabling virtual care for patients using their own primary care physicians and behavioral clinicians. For example, a physician engaging in a virtual visit with a patient can easily bring in a behavioral health professional for real-time consultation. UnitedHealthcare is using opt-ins virtual capabilities to introduce a new suite of digital-first products offering a near seamless experience between virtual and traditional primary, specialty, and urgent care. We expect, during 2022 and beyond, to further build on these opportunities to connect and integrate multiple channels of care. Simplify the experience for patients and providers, and deliver quality care that is affordable and in the optimal setting. Let me now go a little deeper in a few areas to give you an assessment of how we were doing on the themes I mentioned at the outset. OptumInsight continues to drive better clinical and operational performance at the health system level. Last week, we reached a new multi-year partnership with a leading and innovative health system, SSM Health, whose 40,000 employees, 33 hospitals and post-acute facilities, and 300 physician clinics, serve the people of Missouri, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Illinois. OptumInsight brings real value in helping the system strengthen and scale essential functions such as care coordination, revenue cycle management, and digital modernization, all to improve health outcomes in patients' care experiences. These and similar efforts to simplify processes, reduce administrative burdens, and help our partners focus more attention on their care, on their core missions of patient care. OptumRx continues to deliver to health system partners such as its new multi-year agreement with 0.32 health, which serves more than 2 million people in New England through its founding organizations, Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, and Tufts Health Plan. OptumRx will provide integrated pharmacy benefit and specialty offerings that will enhance services and deliver improved affordability for their plan members. OptumRx is having a substantial impact through its community behavioral health pharmacies, which now serve nearly 700,000 people with mental health, addiction, and other conditions through more than 600 dispensaries across 47 states. The pharmacies deliver a high-touch approach to care that contributes to a more than 90% medication adherence rate and lower emergency room visits and hospitalizations by 18 and 40% respectively, driving better health outcomes and a lower total cost of care. Within our UnitedHealthcare government businesses, we have increased processing efficiency by 25% over the last year by using Optum technology to improve auto adjudication rates and intelligent work distribution to appropriately skilled channels. We have many such initiatives underway across the enterprise in affordability, provider experience, and product development as we employ advanced technology in data analytics to drive even greater value for the people we serve and the health system. Before turning over the call to John, a quick word on our pending combination with Change Healthcare. We continue to work diligently to satisfy regulatory requests and now believe, based on our experience so far, the transaction should close in the first part of 2022. We are highly energized about the positive impact we can have working together with the exceptional change team. A team aligned with our mission and values and focused on delivering substantial benefits for the healthcare system. These benefits will include helping clinicians by simplifying access to real-time evidence-based guidance as they are serving patients. Closing gaps in care more rapidly to improve health outcomes and lower costs, reducing unnecessary complexity by removing administrative waste and obstruction to make the care process simpler, more cost-effective, and more transparent. And bringing greater convenience, and simplicity to managing consumer health finances while ensuring care providers get paid more quickly and accurately. Optum and Change Healthcare's capabilities fundamentally are complementary in distinct, because both companies already successfully serve health plans and state governments, care providers, and consumers in a highly competitive market. We believe this combination will make the healthcare system work better for everyone and bring exceptional value to those we serve. With that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. Why don't we let Brian time to take that question. Go ahead. Thank you, Matt, next question, please. Thank you for that, BT and Wyatt. Let's go to the next question, Operator, please. Next question, please. Yeah, we'll go to light on that. But let me first start by saying, of course, all of the providers within Optum Care, they are responsible for managing the downstream spend, whether it'd be at specialists, whether it'd be at hospitals. [Indiscernible] And one of the key things that we do within Optum Care is we made investments in our systems to absorb, take, and manage risk. It's just not a paper transfer. It's actually a system where the providers are fully aware of the capitated arrangements and they're managing accordingly. So Wyatt, why don't you add on top of that? You're more on the details. Perfect. That's great, Wyatt. Thank you very much for the question. Can we have the next question, Operator, please? I mean, Justin, I mean, we of course, are going to always price to our best estimates of forward trend and we're going to take into consideration all the variables that we've talked about. That toggle that John just talked about between COVID, and what we expect with abatement. I don't want to get into the specific details clearly, that's competitive. But at the end of the day, just be aware that we've considered all factors as we priced our forward business within our books. Thanks. Next question. Okay. Why don't we send that question to Bill Golden, who will talk about all three of those. Not only the quarter, but also why do you think we're having some success. And I would just add on to what Bill said. I mean, the new products are important, but one of the fundamental things within the commercial group is clearly affordability. And as we sit back, we have a good program where we manage utilization, we manage medical cost initiatives. We work hard on our network contracts. So a lot of things contribute to success in commercial and some product and a lot affordability. So thanks for your question. Operator. Next question, please. Operator, next question, please. So thanks, Kevin. Let's let A - Brian Thompson address a couple of those. Yeah. We say within OptumHealth or Optum Care, the build out of the home and community platform is one of the more important areas that Wyatt and his team are focused on. There has been lots of development there. Wyatt, maybe you could add a little color. Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please. Next and final question."

            "name": "Wyatt Decker",
            "content": "Thanks, BT and Josh, thanks for the question to A - Wyatt Decker. I would just add that at Optum Health and Care, we are very pleased to be playing a role in reinventing the U.S. healthcare system focused around patients as consumers and value-based care as a major pillar. As you mentioned, we've grown by 250,000 fully capitated lives this year. And we're excited to our partnership with UHC, as well as collaboration partnership with over 90 payers in total to continue to grow our value-based care delivery construct. The other point I'd make is you'll see us increasingly weaving together all of our assets in a comprehensive care delivery paradigm that we feel is unique and differentiated in the marketplace. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for the question. And as Dirk mentioned, we focus relentlessly on the quadruple lame, including lowering total cost of care, and providing better outcomes and outstanding patient experiences. And we are relentless in monitoring specific data points that help deliver that out, those outcomes. Specifically, what we see is the members that are in fully capitated arrangements overall have about a 30% lower hospitalization rate and about 40% lower skilled nursing facility occupation rate than their counterparts and fee-for-service, Medicare, as an example. So we'll continue to drive that value proposition.  And as I touched on in the previous question but I'll go a little deeper, as you think about us with our home and community assets increasingly meeting people in their terms, in their homes to deliver components of value-based and primary care, preventive care, and wellness care, and identify early conditions that otherwise might have led to an ER visit or hospitalization. You'll also see us continuing to bring onboard very innovative behavioral health care delivery solutions that are integrated with the primary care providers that again, identify and treat mental health and substance use disorders by identifying them early and treating them in lower acuity settings when that's appropriate. Those are just a couple of examples of how we're creating value for those that we served. Thank you. Scott, this is A - Wyatt Decker. Very key question. And as you point out, the U.S. healthcare market is very tight right now. For us in our care delivery assets, we are seeing good both retention, engagement and recruitment of physicians and care providers. A couple of examples like give you, we mentioned at the start of the year, our intend to bring on-board 10,000 additional physicians to our ranks and we've already brought onboard about 8,000 year-to-date. So just as a high level indicator, why, what do we attribute this to?  And I would say in partnership with Patricia Lewis and our Human Capital team, we are relentlessly focused on supporting our front-line care provider teams throughout the pandemic. And they know this, and I haven't been deeply appreciative of it. And we work very hard and this precedes the pandemic, but has yielded dividends during the pandemic to support them in an environment that decreases clerical burden and allows them to focus on the work they love, which is actually taking care of patients, which is what we all want. So overall, we're managing through this. I won't kid you. It's tight and we're keeping a close eye on it throughout all of our operations in our 43 states where we provide care. Thank you. Absolutely. So we're very excited about bringing virtual care, as Dirk said, in a differentiated way into people's homes so that they can access care. We can help TRIOS them and onboard them. We can provide primary care and when needed, we can provide care delivery in appropriate in some instances in the home, or we're leveraging particularly our urgent care platform to provide nearby physical care. And then we blended in our virtual and physical behavioral care deliveries as well. So we're now live in all 50 states, we're serving over 7 million members today, and we look forward to continue to expand these offerings. Thank you."

            "content": "Yes. So thank you for the question. So we're excited about the traction we're seeing in our third quarter enrollment, membership growth for the quarter was really attributed to what I would say a three main components. One is in-group growth was net positive for the quarter. Our wins versus losses, was also positive for the third consecutive quarter, and obviously the preferred one acquisition contributed to overall growth. We're expecting continued commercial growth in 2022 across both our fully-insured and self-funded segments. We're confident in the value story. It is resonating in the market and we're getting good traction with our broad product portfolio. And so products like Bind and Care Cash, and Harmony, and Motion, and All Savers are all contributing to that growth. 1/1/22 for middle market is obviously a little early to predict exactly how all those products will perform in the market, but we're very confident in our ability to continue to perform well in the commercial market for 2022."

            "content": "Hey, Heather. San Franco here. Thanks A.J for the question. So you mentioned, we talked in the second quarter a bit about vaccine. We saw a little bit of that this quarter in growth, but it's proportionately down. The last quarter I think was about a third of the growth this quarter, it's down to about call it between 20% and 25%. So you are seeing really our growth. First of all, in this quarter as a result of modest PBM growth together with continued in membership growth together with continued pharmacy services growth, when we look at '22, we're going to see that to continue.  Our pharmacy services growth, remember that's our home delivery specialty, infusion, the multi-dose, as well as our direct-to-consumer community, businesses, those will continue to grow in '22. We see those [Indiscernible] outpacing growth of the rest of OptumRx pharmacy. And I guess I'll call out a few things when I think about '22. First of all, we've made those investments and so we're seeing that we talked about [Indiscernible] in our community pharmacies. Dirk talked about those this morning and how they're growing, not just an expanded sites, but our existing sites are continuing to show really strong growth as they expand services to existing members, and expand in different types of health centers.  We'll continue to see that in '22. And we think the solutions we're bringing in an integrated way together with our consumer experience and our real push to make drugs, therapeutics affordable, and easy to access for our members will continue to see that. And I just put you -- point you back to our long-range growth, where we'll continue to be as in stable with our revenue on our earnings growth in '22 as we look towards our long-range plan. So thanks for the question."

            "name": "Brian Thompson",
            "content": "Thanks for the question, Matt. Certainly as we look forward to 2022, the picture is a lot more clear than as we look at the past 20 months. I would say that we feel optimistic not only about our pricing and the rationality of the market, but most importantly the value that we're bringing to customers. So we're optimistic as we look forward. Yeah, appreciate the question. A - Brian Thompson here again. I would say we certainly are encouraged by continuing our advanced care penetration with partners. OptumCare certainly being one of several. When we partner with OptumCare, we see not only our highest satisfaction, but our best benefits and overall performance. And you heard that in our star quality results as well. And we're encouraged not only by what we have done, but also by what's on the horizon.  Historically, you've looked at our combinations largely in a traditional Medicare advantage space, and you're seeing us expand into complex populations and duals. And we're also really encouraged with what we're doing in the commercial marketplace as well. We've got some new offerings coming in that space. So I would say the key takeaway here is breadth and impact. We continue to scale and expand in that space and it's important. We really see this value-based aligned care as a way to drive good value for those that we support and serve. Yeah. And I would just say as Wyatt said, we're managing through this. From an environmental standpoint, it's not just clinicians, it's in all workers. But one thing I would say is, we had a fairly significant work at home presence before the pandemic even started. So sort of our employee value proposition sort of was we had a good value proposition before. It started net sort of carried through. And I think like all employers, what we're trying to do is take care of our people, do the right things from a reasonable in this standpoint and continue to focus on our mission. And that's what we're continuing to do. So I'm optimistic that we're going to continue to be able to staff our operation and provide the services that we need to all of our patients and members across the country. Thanks for the question, Ricky, I think a few components there and what get -- try to get it all those. So just in terms of the relates to change an impact, I just point out that we don't bring in acquisitions into our outlook until those close. So my commentary, doesn't anticipate change in there and we would look to bring that until it closes. When that is complete, we've no reason to expect that we wouldn't be trending along the same levels that we talked about prior. When that does come in, it's just a question of when it comes in and year and how the benefits play Sure, John. As you laid out at the beginning, while both our Medicaid and Medicare businesses are running still below baseline on a net basis, we are encouraged by the encounters with the physicians of primary care visits and annual wellness visits, as well as in-home clinical visits. Those have been encouraging. So I certainly expect less of a headwind in 2022 due to those encounters, certainly getting traction, certainly compared to 2021. Sure. Hey, Kevin, Brian here. As I think about elective care, what we've really seen is a pretty steady return to normal. We don't really see what I'll call as an unnatural suppression, nor have we seen a significant bounce back suggesting a big catch up. In fact, when you think about scheduled care, what we have found is it most of that cycles through in about 4 to 6 months, we look at things like colonoscopies and joint replacements as good leading indicators.  And those are running pretty close to baseline, obviously with the spike that we saw in September, there's a little bit of that, but we would expect to flow through in the fourth quarter, but that's fully accounted for in our outlook. And I would just say from a commercial perspective, maybe echoing what Bill said, feeling really balanced, really across our fully insured growth for the quarter. So just optimistic that that was across not only our group business, but we also saw a return of our non-exchange individual growth. So a really good quarter from a fully-insured perspective."

            "name": "Unidentified Company Representative",
            "content": "Thank you very much for the question. First, let me point to the value proposition that Medicare Advantage provides, I think that's important context. MA serves 27 million Americans with very high quality care, and compared to fee-for-service Medicare it may cost less. It's more equitable, has better quality access and outcomes, and greater coverage and benefits with nearly 100% consumer satisfaction. Very important to the care that seniors receive, and it's important that we preserve the stability of this program that so many people rely on. And we think about the risk adjustment model in the payment system, the model has been critical to providing broad and equitable access to MA. Risk adjustment levels the playing field and ensures that there's no disincentives to care for the most vulnerable. So we really feel that it's an essential part of encouraging the right incentives in the program and think that it's something to build on and broadly support that we need to think about how to build on these positive elements and aspects of the program for which this is one of them. Thanks for the question. I think, yeah. What we're hearing from network partners is that their cost of labor is higher, so that comes up in the negotiations and like anything else, it's part of what we negotiate and how we try to work with our network partners on coming up with the right pricing and negotiating accordingly. Yes, we're hearing that there is obviously, there's staffing shortages. Obviously, many of the hospitals and other providers have to pay more for their input. And that's going to be reflected in the economics as we go forward. And of course, all that is reflected in how we price going forward. So yes, that occurs."

            "content": "Thank you, Dirk. This morning, we reported third quarter and year-to-date revenues of 72 and 214 billion respectively. Growth of 11 and 12% over last year. This growth was led by OptumHealth, primarily our care businesses. In the third quarter, the Optum platform comprised 54% of enterprise operating earnings and continues to show strong growth momentum. Our performance reflects the diverse and complementary strengths of our business, setting the stage for growth in the years ahead. Our updated full-year '21 outlook includes unfavorable COVID impacts consistent with the expectations we have discussed throughout the year. During the third quarter, while direct COVID care and testing costs ran above the expectations we had nearly a year ago, we again saw elective care offsetting the impacts of higher case rates, much like previous cycles in the pandemic. This quarter, there were approximately 60,000 COVID hospitalizations, meaningfully above the second quarter, with the month of August peaking at nearly 30,000 and then declining in September. Looking at specific business performance. OptumHealth's third-quarter revenue and earnings increased 32% and 37%, respectively, year-over-year. Revenue per consumer grew by 30%. This reflects the increasing impact and number of value-based relationships within Optum Care. The expansion of our in-home and community health platform, as well as the growing acuity of the needs we can serve. OptumInsight revenue grew 13% in the quarter, and earnings grew 15%, as the revenue backlog increased by 12% to 22.3 billion. We see overall business development sourcing and activity levels increasing, particularly with care provider customers. And for our software and analytics offerings. OptumRx revenue and scripts grew 6% year-over-year and earnings 5%. OptumRx is seeing both strong customer retention levels and sale success for the largely completed 22 selling season and early activity for 23. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, the third quarter showed increasing member growth in our commercial offerings, particularly in employer-sponsored benefits. Increased employment is a broad underlying contributor, but we are particularly encouraged by the growth we are achieving in our affordable consumer-centric offerings. Medicare advantage membership has grown 745,000 this year. Inclusive of plans which serve dual special needs numbers, we expect to add a total of over 900,000 Medicare advantage members. The number of people served through managed Medicaid grew by more than 1 million members over last year. As we began to serve people in new regions such as North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana, and as state-based redetermination activities remained popped, we were honored to begin serving people in the Missouri Medicaid expansion this month. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with third-quarter cash flows from operations at 7.6 billion or 1.8 times net income. And we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39%. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance, this morning, we updated our 2021 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.65 to $18.90 per share. Now, with the close of the third quarter, your attention understandably turns to next year. As is our custom, we will offer a few early observations here. While reserving the majority of this conversation for our November 30 Investor Conference, which we hope will be held in person and in New York. Our businesses are both growing and operating well with strong momentum heading into next year. While the pandemic-related impacts remain difficult to predict, given the current trends, we would expect a lower unfavorable COVID impact than experienced in '21. Still, as the dramatic variation of the last 20 months has demonstrated to all, prudent management suggests we should offer an outlook respectful of the fact that the current situation is without precedent. Taking all elements together at this distance, we see current analyst consensus as reasonably beginning to calibrate a '22 outlook. Envisioning that consensus as being towards the upper end of our initial adjusted earnings per share outlook range. With the range being similar to that offered initially for '21. There's still untapped collaborative potential between UnitedHealthcare and Optum to benefit individuals and the system. The power of applied technology to advanced care and service. Improved opportunities in consumer health and experience, and the passion of our people. These and so many other elements lead us to believe our performance expectations for the years ahead remained fully supportive of our long-term 13% to 16% earnings-per-share growth outlook. We look forward to going into more detail on both our view of '22 and the many years of growth beyond at our Investor Conference. With that, Operator, let's open up for questions. One for the caller, please. Hi, Ralph. Good morning. So yes. So as it relates to this year's $1.80, look, our expectation is that will clearly be lower than it was in 2021, as we think about it. We also don't think that will be nothing. I can't imagine we hit January 1 and everything ceases up immediately. So we don't think that will be the case at all. So inclusive of that, when you think about going to that, I think getting inclusive. And as we look at where the where the analyst consensus currently centers, that seems like kind of a reasonable starting point in terms of how we think about -- how we think about that and how we would anticipate and be respectful of the fact that we don't know exactly how this will progress as we move into the new year. Thanks, Ralph. Kevin, this is John. Good morning. Yes. A few perspective on that, as we think about utilizations, trends in the quarter. And I gave some broad indication just in terms of where we were with COVID inpatient stays, and that's for our members. Maybe to give a little kind of further commentary. So as we sit here today, about 5,000 of our members are in an inpatient setting for a COVID-related condition right now. And I'd say versus the peak that we experienced during the quarter. That's probably just a little more than 50% of the peak in that zone, probably a little of that we experienced over the course of the period.  That fell across categories, probably categories, much like you would have observed and the reports coming out nationally in terms of the types of individuals who are in these settings. An average age that was considerably younger than we saw in prior set -- in prior periods for COVID, so similar to what you would have noticed across the board. In terms of broad utilization trends, similar to what we would have described in 2Q where we did describe where, we continue to see commercial members be more active in elective care, and public sector or government program members a little bit less active.  And so kind of similar, just trending at different levels given the prevalence of COVID. It's been interesting over the course of the 20 month. There has been a consistent, fairly rapid reaction when COVID cases go up nationally in terms of the preference of patients to whether or not to seek elective care. That again happen this quarter where it comes in fairly quickly in terms of the hesitation in the system to access, so probably similar along those ranges. Hopefully that provides a little additional color for you on what we're seeing across the full book of business. Thanks for your, Kevin, question. Operator, next question please. Good morning, Justin. So a few other elements on that. Similar broad trends to what we observed in 2Q, just shifting because of the COVID prevalence. Downshifting a bit in terms of elective -- in terms of COVID prevalence but then really fully offset by COVID. That is elective downshifting because of COVID prevalence and then fully offset as we saw, COVID Care become a more important part of the business. That really flowed across the businesses with those trends across the book, like I described, in terms of the general outlook on that. And let me turn to Dirk here to talk about some implications to how we would have anticipated that in our forward pricing. They're just timing impacts in terms about when it would actually close during the year, but not incorporated in that outlook. As it relates to the $1.80 that we articulated last year, yeah, we broke out a number of different components that were important in that element. And frankly, my hope would be not talking about a COVID number by the time we get into '22, that we move beyond that and we can just move beyond to business as normal as we can while being always ready to address the environment that's at hand. But that would be certainly our intent as we'd step out here, that we'd be moving beyond that view. In terms of elements such as annual wellness visits and things, I'd ask BT to comment, A - Brian Thompson to comment a moment on that also. Excellent. Thank you, Ricky. Operator, next question, please. Thank you. Operator, next question please. That was great. And I think AJ, what that points out clearly a broad pharmacy portfolio with clearly a laser-focus on affordability and laser-focus on serving people, getting their medications and people sales where they need them, and basically servicing the entire, what I'll call pharmacy landscape with effective products and services. Thank you very much for the question. Next question, please. First of all, let me hit on the virtual products that we have. I talked about it before, we're getting into from version 1 to version 2. The second version is really not telehealth as a standalone service, but really effectively integrated into physical delivery in total, courses of care. And so as I think about how we might -- how we're organizing our products, what we would have is a virtual PCP available to some people. And many people across the country don't have relationships with PCPs. So a product based on having virtual PCP, having that PCP managed like a Brick-and-mortar PCP.  And then manage the downstream expenses, being able to refer to digital properties, be able to, as I said, bringing a behavioral specialists, where needed. And as we sit and we look at some of the products that we have and we're designing, we're expecting probably about a 15% price advantage to other similar products in the market. So we're kind of excited about the efficiency of virtual in that context. So give me your second question again, Lisa. I was focused on virtual. No. You're thinking of this multi-modality, it's home, it's digital, it's what we do in the office. That's one of the things that we're trying to do. And I'm glad you hit on that. Our ability to serve people where they want to be served is something that we're really focused on across all three of our lines of business is very important. And clearly, people have different care needs and they have different preferences for care, and we want to provide that access across the board. Thank you, Operator. Next question, please. And I think we have time for about two more questions here as we approach the bottom of the hour. Thank you for the question with that, what I would just like to close with is as follows. Thanks everybody for your time and your questions today. We hope you're taking away the impression of a Company that's confident, it's opportunities and the ability to grow. And we're deeply aware of where and how we need to improve and we're fully committed to our mission of helping people lead healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. We look forward to sharing with you a more at our November 30th Investor Conference, hopefully in-person in New York. Thanks for your time today."

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 15, 2021, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrew Witty: Good morning and thank you for joining us. As we discuss our enterprise today, I hope you sense its growing momentum as we advance on our path of improving the quality, cost and experience of healthcare for everyone we serve. Both Optum and United Healthcare grew and delivered on our longstanding strategy, and we\u2019ve increased our outlook for the year to a range of $18.30 to $18.80 per share.  We continue to prioritize three key themes that we believe will underpin the next era of growth for our enterprise: first, unlock the collaborative opportunities within and between Optum and United Healthcare; second, increasingly apply technology to improve patient care and experience and to help the system run better; and third, strengthen our consumer focus, capabilities and value. During the quarter, we accelerated our efforts to develop and deploy new and innovative products informed by the insights of both Optum and United Healthcare in areas such as oncology care delivery, rare disease drug management, Optum Virtual, Optum Financial Services and many others. We are doubling down on efforts to both expand and link services where it creates value for consumers and patients to make their healthcare journey easier, simpler, and more intuitive.  We constantly challenge ourselves to develop capabilities which lead to improved care, better value, and a simpler system. Our sales to clients and partners across all parts of the health system demonstrate the strong relevance of our innovation and the strengthening of our sales pipeline is a key opportunity as we emerge from the COVID market pause.  A good example of bringing our collective strengths together at scale is the Optum home and community care platform, through which we care for nearly 10 million people. This platform includes our well-known HouseCalls service, comprehensive post-acute care for smoother transitions to home, and integrated primary and behavioral care for Medicare Advantage patients who prefer to receive their care at home. Home and community platform services can reduce post-acute medical care costs by a quarter, unnecessary readmissions by up to a fifth, and hospital admissions by up to 25%.  In Medicaid, we are addressing consumer needs by expanding our long-term collaboration with public housing authorities, working with government agencies and community-based organizations to identify and address specific healthcare issues for people who are hard to reach and support. In just the past six months, we\u2019ve introduced new partnerships in over 20 communities to close gaps in care and address health equity challenges. Using data and analytic capabilities, we\u2019re able to rapidly identify local health trends and gaps and then work with community partners to inform guidelines, training materials, processes, and create better tools to advance health. We believe this will result in better health of community members and help to optimize limited state resources. These and other targeted initiatives on the social determinants of health are essential elements and illustrative of our natural and longstanding ESG impact. Our recently published sustainability report captures the full range of efforts we\u2019ve dedicated ourselves to in areas of crucial concern to our stakeholders, none more so than advancing health and health equity. This agenda is an essential part of our way of doing business. I\u2019d like to thank our 330,000 colleagues from across the company for the passion and diligence they show every day in helping to deliver improvements in serving our members, clients and patients. I\u2019ve great confidence that we\u2019re emerging from the last 18 months of disruption with an unprecedented set of opportunities to help improve the health system for all of those we can serve. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to provide more detail on initiatives to drive performance across the organization.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. In an enterprise with our breadth of market engagement, we have many ways to assess how we\u2019re doing. I\u2019d like to share some of those metrics with you, picking up on Andrew\u2019s commentary on our three key strategic themes. First, collaboration. United Healthcare\u2019s value proposition is rooted in lower costs, better outcomes, and a better experience. Optum supports this value proposition for United Healthcare and other health plans with ambulatory services, which patients and their doctors value. In this quarter, we met the ambulatory surgery needs of over 250,000 patients, delivering exceptional care in convenient and affordable settings, with revenue growth approaching 20% over the non-pandemic affected 2019 second quarter. These centers are meeting higher acuity and more complex needs such as total joint replacement, spine and cardiovascular procedures, which are performed at an increasing number of centers. Our ambulatory settings receive a consumer NPS of 92 and we deliver better and more consistent quality outcomes at about half the cost of traditional settings. Optum Care has over 1,600 clinics and is rapidly expanding virtual offerings to serve patients in settings where they feel the most comfortable, and importantly with their own physician. Seniors served by Optum Care under our integrated care approach spend considerably more time with their primary care physicians than seniors in traditional Medicare and, as a result, spend one-third fewer days in a hospital. Second is our strategy to increase the application of technology to improve patient care and help the system run better. We recently announced the partnership with Bassett Healthcare, another strong example of how OptumInsight is helping health systems to expand and scale essential capabilities, including revenue cycle management and digital modernization to improve health outcomes and patients\u2019 healthcare experiences. We expect to continue to add new partnerships like this. Also at OptumInsight, we\u2019ve been tackling the most resource-intensive operations through the deployment of advanced technology and other approaches. For example, we have transformed what were once largely manual chart review processes into highly automated operations.  Third, we have been hard at work advancing our consumer capabilities. United Healthcare has made significant advances in the management of complex conditions. We\u2019re focused on making sure that patients with the highest acute care needs are able to access the most appropriate site of care by assigning them advocates to help navigate the system. Nearly one million of these members are matched with a personal navigator to help them manage and improve their health. OptumRx continues to improve access and affordability of home delivery for patients, leading to significant improvements in continuity of care and having already reduced the cost to process and dispense prescriptions by nearly 20% in just the past two years. Also, along consumer cost savings lines, for those who prefer an in-store retail experience, we now offer tools to find the lowest cost prescriptions near them regardless of the health benefits \u2013 of their health benefits coverage status. These tools can save self-paying consumers up to 80% on their medications.  Consumer preference is also having an impact in behavioral health. Already this year, the OptumHealth behavioral platform has delivered over 500,000 virtual visits, an option we initiated in just the last year. Many consumers and clinicians prefer these virtual encounters since they offer enhanced accessibility, flexibility and simplicity. Care encounters delivered through our dedicated channel have a patient satisfaction of 98%.  These are just a few of the many initiatives we are executing on as we apply technology, data and analytics to make our strategic growth agenda come alive. We look forward to updating you on our progress over the quarters to come. With that, now I\u2019ll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you Dirk. Our first half performance supports the foundation for strong and expanding growth for the remainder of this year and beyond. Before I review business performance, I\u2019ll offer a brief perspective on the pandemic-driven trends we\u2019re observing. The core takeaway is that our outlook for COVID-19 impacts is consistent with our past commentary. The second quarter showed overcall care activity continuing to trend toward baseline or normalized levels, albeit with variation across lines of business. For example, in commercial markets care activity was above baseline as members were willing and able to obtain needed care, some of which was deferred from prior periods. Our public sector markets continued to run below baseline, even as we are actively encouraging people to get their need. We were gratified to see care activity for these populations begin to progress over the course of the quarter as vaccination rates advanced. We continue to estimate approximately $1.80 per share of unfavorable COVID-19 impacts for full year 2021 and to expect the majority of these effects to occur in the second half.  Moving to overall business performance, OptumHealth second quarter revenue and earnings increased 46% and 34% respectively year-over-year. Revenue per consumer grew by 43%, reflecting the impact of accountable arrangements and our expanding home and community health platform combined with the growing complexity of the needs we\u2019re serving. Of the 20 million patients we serve through Optum Care, over 2 million are in fully accountable or capitated care arrangements, an increase of 17% from a year ago, and we expect this pacing to accelerate strongly in the years ahead. OptumInsights revenue grew 12% in the quarter and earnings grew 36% with the revenue backlog increasing by $1.9 billion to $21.3 billion. Key growth drivers were managed services, the continued recovery of care activity to more normal levels, and further implementations of technology-enabled services. In particular, we are seeing strong sales momentum in the services, software and analytics business, which serve care providers. OptumRx revenue and earnings increased 5% and 19% year-over-year and script growth was 8%, with this comparison impacted by last year\u2019s pandemic-affected care patterns. Our expanding pharmacy care and specialty services continue to grow strongly, now comprising just under half of OptumRx revenues. Turning to United Healthcare, we are encouraged by the receptivity to our expanding set of responsive commercial benefits centered around virtual first, on demand and physician-led offerings. Year to date, we have added about 150,000 members in such innovative commercial offerings, even with the evolving and uneven labor market trends which impacted second quarter membership.  Medicare Advantage membership has grown by 675,000 year to date, tracking well to our full year outlook. Our house calls clinicians have been able to provide their vital services to seniors, conducting over 1.1 million home visits in the first half, more than double the year-ago level. People served in managed Medicaid programs grew by nearly 920,000 over the year-ago quarter, in part as state-based redetermination activities remained on hold. Our Medicaid offerings continue to deliver a positive consumer experience and demonstrable cost effectiveness for our state government partners, and we look for this momentum to build heading into next year. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with second quarter cash flows from operations at $5.5 billion or 1.3 times net income, and we ended the quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 40%. In early June, our board of directors increased the dividend by 16%. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance, we\u2019ve updated our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $18.30 to $18.80 per share, inclusive of the COVID-19 impact incorporated into our full year view. Within this, we expect the pacing through the second half to be fairly level. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. What we\u2019ve tried to provide you with this quarter, as we do each time, is a sense not only of what United Health Group\u2019s results are but how we achieved them. The examples we\u2019ve referenced and countless others throughout this enterprise, along with the consistent execution by our colleagues, are what underpin our confidence in our long term 13% to 16% EPS growth rate target and in our ability to help people live healthier lives and help the health system work better for everyone over the years to come. With that, Operator, let\u2019s open up the call for questions. One question per caller, please. Alan, over to you.\nOperator: Certainly, sir. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] The first person we\u2019ll take a question from will be Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right. Great. Thanks. I guess you guys reported two good quarters in a row but raised guidance both times by less than the beat. You singled out the $1.80 headwind included in the guidance. Is there any other kind of major one-time positives or negatives in the guidance that we should think about when thinking about this year as a base for how to forecast future numbers? And is there anything offsetting the upside in the first half that we should think about in the back half?\nAndrew Witty: Kevin, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask John to give a little bit more detail, I mean a couple of things. Obviously, still too early to give you kind of real shaping for 2022, so you won\u2019t be surprised we won\u2019t go there.  And I would say, the overwhelming story for this year is of course the dynamic of COVID in terms of the various puts and takes, which are taking place under the surface. And as we\u2019ve done for the last several quarters, we\u2019ve tried to kind of dimension that within the $1.80. But as we\u2019ve also said repeatedly, the bulk of that $1.80 sits in the rest of the year, the year to go between now and the end of 2021. And so really, really pleased with the momentum and underlying performance of the company in the first two quarters of this year, but also respectful of uncertainties that remain around the COVID puts and takes. And of course, that all feeds into how we make the judgment on raising the earnings expectation for the rest of the year. I think where I sit, I feel great about that underlying performance so far. Broadly speaking, the COVID dynamic has played the way we would have anticipated more or less, but there\u2019s still a way to go and there are uncertainties within that. Maybe John, you might go a little further and take that $1.80 apart and maybe reflect a little bit on how you\u2019re seeing those different elements of the driver of that.\nJohn Rex: Kevin, good morning, it\u2019s John Rex. Yes, just to get a little further into those. So within the $1.80, we still expect about 70% of that to occur in the second half of the year, so the vast majority. A lot to be seen on how that $1.80 really plays out. Keep in mind kind of the main elements that, that comprises: It\u2019s the direct treatment and testing costs that we see, offset by elective care deferrals that might continue to occur or not in the rest of the year; the potential for higher acuity for those that have missed or deferred care; and at least within 2021, the impact of the care deferrals that occurred last year. So those are all super important components here. Within those elements, the things to play out would be most around the direct treatment and testing costs and the potential for higher acuity and how much care occurs in the back half.  The other elements within the $1.80, I would say, are more steady throughout the course of the year. So that point being around care deferral in 2020 and the related revenue impacts for 2021, those should be relatively steady, and I would say are running in line with the expectations that were set out for you back in December. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a surprise on that element within our outlook. And I would say, the kind of economic impacts also pretty relatively steady over the course of the year in terms of the quarterly progression, so those are really the elements that we continue to look for. You\u2019re right. Look, we saw good strength in a lot of the business, growth across the platform - really, we could point to every business. But it\u2019s that look out to really understanding how those trends play in the second half of the year. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. And Kevin, thanks very much for the question. Appreciate it. Next question?\nOperator: We\u2019ll next go to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Here with Mr. Percher as well. So our question again this quarter is around Optum Care. And I think the question is really how do you think about the capacity constraints for Optum Care? Is that more on the provider side, or gaining consumers in the totality of OptumHealth? And with all of these sort of new options or what appear to be new options available to physicians, how are you convincing docs that Optum is the best solution? And lastly, and I know I apologize for the last part here. But is there an argument to be made that Optum Care, not Optum overall, but just the Optum Care segment, would be more valuable to shareholders as a standalone company because of the physician independence issue that comes up?\nAndrew Witty: So, Josh, thanks so much for the questions. And before I -- I\u2019m going to ask Dr. Decker to make a few comments in a minute or two, but maybe just make a couple of introductory observations. So first off, I think, you\u2019re really starting to see OptumHealth broadly. And within that business, in particular, Optum Care and, of course, home and community really starting to demonstrate their capacity for growth because of the scale of the footprint that they now establish across the country. And I think you\u2019re starting to see these businesses move into a kind of critical mass dynamic, that\u2019s reflected in its overall growth. It\u2019s also reflected in this very rapid expansion of OptumHealth revenue per consumer, up over 40% this quarter. That\u2019s reflective of the quality of services, which are being delivered and the perceived value that they obviously reflect, so we feel very good about that. Your question around capacity constraints is a really good question. We continue to expand rapidly the number of physicians and clinicians in our organization, either directly or through affiliation. This year, we expect to add about 10,000, we\u2019re well over halfway through that journey, so going super well on that front. I would say one of the key elements is really making sure that those practices, as rapidly as possible, start to develop the skills to be able to manage capitated risk, which is really what then drives a tremendous amount of the distinctive behavior and value creation for patients and, of course, for the system. That process, I think, has been continually refined. As you would be well aware, in the marketplace people have tried different models, they don\u2019t always work super well. I\u2019ll maybe ask Dr. Decker in a second to dive a little bit more detail into some of the work they\u2019re doing there to accelerate that dimension of capacity, because it\u2019s not simply having the practices and the clinicians, it\u2019s having that way of working which really drives the change in what we\u2019re able to do. As far as your last question is concerned, I actually think that the OptumCare clinics within the broader Optum and UHG organization, that\u2019s where some of the magic really sits here in terms of being able to leverage many different aspects. And as you see these elements of OptumHealth and Optum Care, in particular, develop. You\u2019re also seeing significant amounts of support and help, if you will, being provided by other businesses across the organization. Payment integrity is a good example, beginning to be adopted by parts of Optum Care. So with all of that, I\u2019d like Dr. Decker maybe just to go a little deeper on how we move or how we help practices develop the capabilities, which allow them to deliver the value we\u2019re now seeing.\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks, Josh, for the question. To Andrew\u2019s comments, we are increasingly bringing our depth and breadth in value-based care delivery to new markets that have been historically fee-for-service. And you\u2019ll see this unfolding right now and over the next year or two in markets like the Pacific Northwest and Northeast, where we have - we\u2019ve acquired and grown considerable clinical delivery assets. But we are now bringing the expertise in markets like Texas and Southern California, that have been delivering value-based and full risk capitated care for years. And so that really is a differentiator for us.  And the other piece I\u2019d build on is Andrew\u2019s comment around how we are creating a comprehensive set of offerings that address virtually every aspect of an individual\u2019s healthcare journey, from a focus on primary care and keeping you healthy and well, to post-acute care to end of life care and complex care in all environments, virtual, home, and in the clinic. And that to us, as we bring that together, connect the dots, is a differentiator in all markets. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Wyatt, thanks so much, and Josh, thanks so much for the questions. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes, hi. Good morning. Many of the initiatives that you are putting in place and the assets that you\u2019re putting together are leading to lower utilization, at least in the hospital setting and a move to lower cost settings. Keeping this in mind, when we see the lower utilization at least on the public side, do you still think that 2019 is the right baseline for utilization?\nAndrew Witty: Ricky, that\u2019s a great question. You\u2019re quite right that a lot of what we focus on is--well, first and foremost, to try and understand what is the very best care that an individual need and to make sure that they get access to that, and one of the big things we\u2019ve been doing this year is trying to get people, particularly seniors, back into the system, those who maybe held back because of the pandemic, and as you heard earlier, we\u2019re glad to see some of that moving, albeit some way to go. Now within that, we also recognize there are a whole series of places where, frankly, there are better, more effective ways to deliver care. I\u2019m going to pick out one very simple example just to build on what you described. If I think about some of the work that\u2019s going into OptumRx and within our Optum infusion business, you can take drugs where perhaps $10,000, $15,000 per treatment for a hospital outpatient, exactly the same drug being delivered by Optum at-home infusion, $3,500. That\u2019s the kind of impact that we can deliver through really thoughtful application of location of delivery and the like, and that\u2019s just one example. UHC are very much focused on this in much of their guidance, and of course Optum is building a variety of different capabilities.  Having said all of that, I think the reality is it\u2019s very early days, even for us, in terms of changing behaviors against the overall trend of the healthcare system, so I think that baseline of 2019 probably is the right rational piece. Over time, I think these practices will start to bear down on the overall trend of cost, but of course that will happen as we see those capabilities spread more broadly, as we see them get more adoption and they start to change the price point in the marketplace for some of these treatments or therapies which are, frankly, overpriced. What our clients are looking for us to do, both through United Healthcare and Optum, is find ways to get great care at lower cost, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re focused on doing.  Ricky, thanks so much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to AJ Rice with Credit Suisse.\nAJ Rice: Hi everybody. I might just continue to focus on OptumRx - you\u2019ve got good script growth and a pick-up in margin there. There are two things that are sort of impacting script growth, it seems like to me, across some of the companies that are reporting it. One is how quickly we\u2019re seeing the rebound of the acute scripts as people start going back to their doctor and getting new prescriptions. Can you comment on where we\u2019re at relative to pre-pandemic levels on that? And then vaccines in some of the script reporting is having an impact - I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s relevant for you guys in OptumRx, but can you parse that out in any way? And then I guess just any comments on the selling season for OptumRx for this year going into next that you see.\nAndrew Witty: Listen, that\u2019s a great question, AJ, and before I hand it over to Heather Cianfrocco, our head of OptumRx, let me just make a couple of introductory remarks. That 8% script growth, about half of that is, we would estimate, kind of bounce back from the suppression at this time last year caused by the COVID--initial waves of the COVID disruption. But even having said that, the 4% residual growth is great and we feel very good about the performance of the OptumRx business across its breadth of businesses, so within the core PBM but also across all of its various other pharmacy services business, which the company has been investing in over the last several years. We did about 10 million vaccine prescriptions, I think, year to date. To give you a little bit more detail on that and a little bit further into selling season observations, maybe hand over to Heather. Heather, go ahead.\nHeather Cianfrocco: Thanks Andrew. Thanks, AJ, for the question. Yes, I think as Andrew said, maybe I\u2019ll take script volume quickly just to finish that off, and then maybe talk a little bit about selling season.  As Andrew said, really if you look at, whether ours is indicative of other things you\u2019ve seen, what I\u2019d say is specific to us, what you\u2019ve seen over the last year is, yes, about half of that is the rebound from compression and the rest of that is really a little bit of vaccine volume, and Andrew gave you the number there. But that really hits volumes for us more than anything else because of the ratio of revenue to scripts there. In addition to that, there is continued double-digit growth in the pharmacy services business, so that\u2019s making up the bulk of the additional growth that you\u2019re seeing year over year there.  As far as the split of acute maintenance, etc., I guess I would say--you know, we just had this discussion about what baseline is. I can specifically say that we\u2019re seeing second quarter looks more like \u201919 than it certainly did looking like second quarter of 2020, and we basically don\u2019t see anything unique there as far as acute versus--as far as acute ratio, kind of back to what we saw pre-pandemic for this quarter. Maybe let me switch quickly to selling season. We\u2019re still in the midst of it this year, and that\u2019s for all segments - that\u2019s for employer, it\u2019s for health plan, public sector and coalition. I\u2019d say generally same activity, maybe a little different pacing of decision making right now, but really in the midst of it. The biggest thing I would say about the selling season is clients very interested in solutions to address high cost of specialty drugs and getting to medications and therapies that really help on the medical and the pharmacy side, so for us we\u2019re very focused on those solutions and we\u2019re finding that our site of care services for alternative sites and alternative therapies, like biosimilars, together with some of our specialty programs that work through OptumHealth and OptumRx and straddle the medical and pharmacy benefit are really resonating, together with our really intense clinical client consulting that we\u2019re bringing to the market right now, so we\u2019re finding that resonating in the selling season and we think we\u2019ve got a lot of value to add there. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Heather, really appreciate it. I might just add, AJ, one other dimension that\u2019s under Heather\u2019s leadership, which is really pertinent to behavioral health. As I think we all recognize, that\u2019s a huge issue across the U.S. I think many of us anticipate the COVID pandemic and various impacts from that may well exacerbate some of the trend there, but I just wanted to call out the progress of Genoa Pharmacy within that. It\u2019s a business that came into our organization two or three years ago. We\u2019re going to open 60 more of those centers this year. We\u2019re already up to 582 of those centers, we\u2019re well on the way to close to double what we had when they first became part of the organization, and the impact that that group has is extraordinary, both from a consumer NPS score of 95, provider NPS score of 80, the impact they have in terms of helping improve adherence for highly complex patients, particularly those patients who are served through our Medicaid books of business is super important. So just wanted to mention that alongside the other elements of OptumRx, another key part of the growth, and a key part of where OptumRx is really helping our Medicaid business deliver really high-quality service for folks who need it. Next question?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the helpful comment that John gave during the prepared remarks on medical cost trends. For instance, John, you mentioned that commercial utilization was back above typical. Would love to know how that progressed during the quarter and how far above typical you saw it coming out of the quarter, what you\u2019re thinking for the rest of the year, and then any other commentary on Medicare and Medicaid there. Then also, if you could give us your view on this new Biogen Alzheimer\u2019s drug in terms of how you think things developed in terms of pricing and physician take-up or patient take-up rates, and how you think you\u2019re going to manage this process, would be great as well. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes Justin, thanks so much. I\u2019ll address the Alzheimer\u2019s drug issue in a second, but first of all I\u2019d like John maybe to pick up on your broader MCR questions.\nJohn Rex: Justin, good morning. A little color perhaps on how the progression occurred in the quarter here. As it relates particularly, thinking about the quarterly progression that we saw, perhaps not unsurprisingly COVID testing and treatment costs were highest in the month of April, actually trending up a little bit from what we saw in March, and that tracks with the incidence rate and the hospitalization rates that we would have been seeing, and then that trending down pretty rapidly in May and June in terms of the number of individuals in hospital beds and the treatment costs. In terms of utilization in commercial populations, interestingly that was also highest in the month of April, trending down a bit over the course of the quarter but still just marginally, very marginally above baseline as we end June, as we exited June, just to give you a little color commentary on how that was progressing. That was really the trending that we saw within that, and Andrew, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.\nAndrew Witty: Great, thanks John. The other thing I\u2019d say, Justin, is there\u2019s plenty of noise within those numbers that John just described, so you see inpatient, outpatient, physician visit trends by different books of business, it\u2019s a more complex picture than it looks on the surface.  As far as the Alzheimer\u2019s drug is concerned, I\u2019m going to--in a second, I\u2019m going to ask Dr. Migliori, our Chief Medical Officer, to make a couple of comments on this particular thing. Overall, bottom line from our perspective is this remains obviously a super important area for patients, families to look for progress in. We all want to see that progress happen. I think from where we stand today, there\u2019s still a lot of information that we need to be able to make really clear decisions, and I think we\u2019re not the only ones in that regard looking for greater clarity in this arena.  Maybe Dr. Migliori, you might give a perspective from the medical perspective, please.\nDr. Richard Migliori: Yes, thanks Andrew, and you said it well - we are encouraged to see meaningful progress being made against this devastating disease and advances in its treatment. We are continuing to develop our clinical policy as well as our ultimate position on coverage, but in doing so we\u2019re looking forward to getting the guidance that we need from Medicare, and also looking at the continually contributing clinical outcomes that are coming from--the clinical evidence that comes from the ongoing clinical trials.  But most importantly, we\u2019re looking for the advice from those expert, professional organizations, the physicians who have committed their careers to helping people with this devastating disease.  Andrew?\nAndrew Witty: Yes, thanks so much, Dr. Migliori. Justin, I think bottom line is I think this has some way to go before we get to real clarity, so I wouldn\u2019t guide you to expect very rapid decision making on this piece, not because we don\u2019t want to see these good effective treatments being made available - of course we do, but it\u2019s really important to have a real clear understanding of really how they should be used, what their value is in utilization, and as Dr. Migliori said really well, really understanding where CMS get recognized in that the MA population likely to be very significant fraction of utilizers, we need to understand where all of that fits. So I think this is potentially good news, but it\u2019s still early days and we have a lot more to learn before we can be more definitive than that, so can\u2019t be too much more helpful at this point, I\u2019m afraid, Justin, but thank you so much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks, good morning. I want to stick onto that last question. Sounds like commercial was marginally above baseline for the quarter. Hoping you can give us similar comments on magnitude of how much lower Medicare and Medicaid are, and then also if you could provide any sense of magnitude of the rising utilization you embed in guidance at this point for the second half of the year, if you could frame that just in terms of what normal growth would be and maybe what you\u2019re embedding, or how much higher guidance contemplates. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes Ralph, thanks so much. I\u2019m going to ask John to reflect on the second part of your question, in terms of forward-looking for the second half of the year. Just to nail this first part, though, the commercial book, as you\u2019ve heard already now from John a couple of times, basically right on baseline, maybe a hair above but right there, and then the two government books of business a few percentage points below, so I won\u2019t go further than that. Maybe John, you could give some insight into how you\u2019re seeing things within the next six months.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Ralph. Yes, so then you blend to a little bit--just a little bit below overall when you blend the books and you weight our books across in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the second quarter. Then as you might expect, that trends up progressively every quarter. Every quarter, you\u2019d see rising in that overall level of utilization and the expectations as we had into the end of the year. Embedded in that is also a view in terms of what happens with intensity, acuity levels. One comment--question that we\u2019ve often received is what are we seeing currently in acuity levels as we progress, and part of the impact as we progress in the second half is an expectation that you do see rising acuity levels. I\u2019ll tell you, we haven\u2019t observed that yet, but it still is probably a little bit early to say. Among the things we look at, we look at new cancer diagnoses, new cardiac diagnoses - those are still running below baseline levels that we\u2019d expect, but a view is that could continue to progress as we get into the back half of the year.  The other element in terms of just thinking about utilization and rising in the back of the year, and ultimately this is [indiscernible] what occurs with COVID testing and treatment costs. Clearly there\u2019s been the evidence of the new variants and their impacts in other countries and then also moving into the U.S., and even in our own data we can see that, but I would tell you still fairly limited in terms of impact. As I sit here and look at number of members, of our members that we have receiving treatment today, in hospital beds today as we sit here this morning, still well below the levels even as we sit here in mid-July what we were seeing in the April levels, but that could be a trend back factor also in the second half of the year as we see that progression. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: John, thanks so much, and Ralph, thanks for the question. Next question?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to just ask a question around Medicare Advantage, and just interested in terms of what you\u2019ve been seeing progressing year to date around the risk scores and how that\u2019s been normalizing relative to the post pandemic disruption. Then, just also interested if you\u2019ve received the update yet from CMS on the midyear risk score updates, and if you could share how those came out relative to expectations.\nAndrew Witty: Scott, thanks so much for your question. I\u2019m going to pass that over to our new CEO of UnitedHealthcare, BT. BT, you and Tim might like to address those two points from Scott. BT?\nBrian Thompson: Sure, I\u2019ll start. I think as a follow-on, perhaps--this is Brian Thompson, thanks for the question. To the question around engagement levels, I think the piece that I am most encouraged by is the physician engagement levels, and in particular in our senior communities. We\u2019re really seeing strong receptivity, certainly reflective of the vaccination rates, and I think that\u2019s really giving us encouraging signals overall not only to 2022, but just the population and health at large. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim to talk a little bit more specifically about MA.\nTim Spilker: Good morning Scott, thanks for the question. The revenue for 2021 and the risk scores that support those are totally in line with our expectation, as John indicated in his remarks, and yes, we did receive the midyear payment from CMS which gives us a more fulsome view into what 2021 revenue is. Again, that aligns to our expectations, and at this point we consider 2021 revenue to be pretty complete in terms of what we\u2019re know about risk scores.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, BT, thanks so much. Scott, thanks for the question. Next question?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDave Windley: Thanks very much. I wonder, relative to your conversations about the relative headwinds, does your view of your ability to recoup the $1.80 in \u201922, is that influenced at all by the timing of when these things hit, if they do, in the second half of \u201921? I\u2019d be curious about your comments there, please.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, and I\u2019ll ask John in a second to give you more on this. First off, obviously again we\u2019re not going to be really shining a light on our expectation for \u201922 yet. Having said that, we also think the majority of the $1.80 headwind will have been utilized this year, will essentially be non-recurring. Of course, that depends on some assumptions around the pandemic itself remaining under control, so that is an observation which has to be taken in that context; but as we sit today, I think that is a prudent view. John, you may want to go a little deeper on how each of the elements perhaps you think about.\nJohn Rex: Sure, a few factors on that and how timing might impact those. Maybe just to refresh a little bit on that, Tim did a nice job describing the impacts in terms of the revenue impacts from particularly Medicare Advantage members being able to be seen by their physicians. We are encouraged by what\u2019s going on in our house calls activity - very strong receptivity to those. BT just mentioned we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in terms of seniors and their receptivity to even going in and seeing their physicians - that\u2019s all super important. I don\u2019t know if timing is so important on that piece, it just needs to occur during the year in terms of when that activity occurs, so that would be the more important factor as it relates to 2022 - does it occur in 2021, do they get in, so that\u2019s an important factor. Other factors here, I would say, there is care that didn\u2019t occur in 2020 and probably hasn\u2019t occurred in 2021 yet, that was deferred and needs to occur, so that\u2019s more about also an element of does it not occur at all in this year, does it work its way into 2022, and the potential for that and the revenue impact of whether or not there\u2019s an increase in acuity from those populations. Those are really the main elements, I would say, in terms of what I would call timing related. The other elements are more just--would be around this concept around the occurrence of COVID-19 incidence, direct treatment and testing costs, how that progresses over the back half of the year too. But those would be the elements that would be sensitive to timing factors.\nAndrew Witty: Right. John, thanks so much, and Dave, thanks for asking the clarifying question. Appreciate that. Next question?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, you made a comment about virtual first offerings helping to drive incremental membership growth this year. Can you talk a little bit about what the digital first and/or virtual first offerings look like, and then is that contribution in \u201921 and, if it is, could you talk a little bit about in the sales cycle, how it\u2019s looking for uptake in \u201922?\nAndrew Witty: Great question, Lance, thanks. I\u2019m going to ask Dirk in a second to make a couple of comments around the overall shift towards digital first, virtual first, and may also ask Dr. Decker to refer to some of further what\u2019s going on within OptumHealth, which is important around OptumVirtual.  As I\u2019ve made super clear over the last couple of quarters, really elevating our consumer focus is a top priority for the whole company, and that really speaks to ensuring that we\u2019re delivering simpler, more intuitive experiences, that we\u2019re thinking about the journey of the consumer and the patient in an end-to-end sense, that we\u2019re making it easier for them to make all of the very sequential decisions, and we also want to meet the consumer where they want to be met, whether that be outside of a facility, in their home, online or in person. We fully recognize how the premium the patients and consumers in particular, being able to talk to the physicians they know rather just any physician, and so how we start to pull all that together is essentially reflected in many of the different initiatives we have. Over the last few quarters, you\u2019ve seen us build up things like OptumVirtual - Dr. Decker will talk to you in a second, but things like OptumStore just being rolled out under the OptumRx organization really starts to bring together a ton of access for consumers in terms of what they\u2019re able to do with us. With that introduction, Dirk, love to get your perspective, and then maybe Wyatt. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Yes, thanks Andrew, and Lance for the question. Of course, we continue to see telehealth be a broadly desired consumer access vehicle to the health system. We\u2019ve seen that grow. We\u2019re hoping we get to sort of the next generation, and we think a lot of that begins with--like for example, with OptumCare physicians being able to deliver that, because as Andrew said, people have a good preference to go to their own physician. The product with respect to virtual first, to answer your specific question, we plan on rolling that on in eight, nine markets in UnitedHealthcare at the end of this year. What it will basically be is--think of it as sort of a virtual PCP with an OptumCare doc being the quarterback, with the UnitedHealthcare navigate network backing it up for the physical access. We\u2019re starting to sort of, what I would refer to as productize this, and we\u2019re hopeful it will--which will aide to UnitedHealthcare\u2019s commercial growth. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Dirk, thanks. Wyatt, we\u2019d like to just get a little more on OptumVirtual and what you\u2019ve been building inside OptumHealth. \nWyatt Decker: Yes, thanks Lance for the question. We are bringing together the virtual care experience that we stood up rapidly during the pandemic with over 18,000 providers onto, as Dirk mentioned, a next generation technical solution that we\u2019ve created, which creates the opportunity to seamlessly onboard and triage an individual virtually, so we make sure they\u2019re getting the right care in the right environment, whether that\u2019s a virtual, physical or behavioral healthcare need. We believe that that is a differentiated patient experience. The second, which Dirk mentioned but I\u2019ll underscore, is a focus on primary care delivery and keeping people tethered to their trusted and known providers. As this matures--and we\u2019re live today in all 50 states, to be clear, and we\u2019ll continue to roll this out in a more comprehensive way to our OptumCare patients as well as members of UHC and other payors, and look forward to continued conversations about our capabilities here. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Wyatt. I think Lance, just to close this out, this is--I\u2019m excited about what\u2019s been built in OptumHealth here. If you think about this build-out of ambulatory clinic facilities and other attendant services, perhaps in the pharmacy space, you think about the home and community agenda, really investing to make sure that folks who want to spend as much time at home as possible are able to do that, and then you see OptumVirtual essentially pulling all of that together, you\u2019ve got to think about this as all three of those elements essentially all at play at the same time. I think it\u2019s a very important step forward that gives us a really significant opportunity to ensure that we deliver a much more seamless experience, we\u2019re much more responsive to consumer need, and we can focus on bringing costs down and delivering better care. That\u2019s what we really believe we can do here. You\u2019re going to hear a lot more about this. It\u2019s an important step up in the energy around our OptumHealth strategy. We just have time, I\u2019m afraid, for one last question, so Alan, if you could ask for a last question, please.\nOperator: Sure. We\u2019ll take our last question from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.\nMatt Borsch: Okay, thank you. I realize you\u2019re parsing through everything that happened last year and now the catch-up in care this year. Are you getting a perspective yet on how much of the care was unnecessary, that would have happened but is not actually going to occur, and I guess you could put that in two categories - care that you can see in hindsight was unnecessary, but maybe was necessary at the time because the person didn\u2019t know, and care that was just unnecessary proactively and in hindsight?\nAndrew Witty: Matt, thanks so much for the question. Really, it\u2019s a great question, and you would have to expect that the answer is that some of it would have been unnecessary. I think at this distance, it\u2019s a little hard to really call that at this point. I mean, there are some tantalizing signals in some of the trends, so if you look at emergency department use, for example, it looks pretty sustained down and doesn\u2019t seem to be coming back, and certainly if you look at our advisory board surveys that we\u2019re running with many, many non-UHC providers and institutions across American healthcare, people don\u2019t--a lot of people don\u2019t expect that ED utilization to come back. Now, that may be because they were being unnecessarily used, maybe folks have realized that urgent care centers are a much better option, maybe virtual is a much better option that they can get what they need at much lower cost.  Whether it\u2019s unnecessary, whether or not the pandemic has disturbed people\u2019s allegiance to certain types of sites of care and people are a little bit more open minded about where to go, all of that I think is in play. I would say it\u2019s premature to call it. I think we\u2019re watching it really carefully. I could build those theories I just shared with you. I\u2019m not going to tell you that those are proven. I think there is tantalizing signals in the data, but it\u2019s going to take another six, 12 months before you can really settle out how this all plays. But Matt, thanks for the question, and we\u2019ll probably loop back on that once again, I\u2019m sure.\nAndrew Witty: Listen everybody, I want to say thank you for all of your attention today, for your participation, very much appreciated. We hope very much that what you\u2019ve heard from out team gives you a flavor of why we have such confidence in the outlook for our company and for the ability of Optum and UnitedHealthcare separately and together to improve the lives of those we serve and the health system overall. With that, I\u2019d like to say thank you very much, and to close this morning\u2019s call.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. In an enterprise with our breadth of market engagement, we have many ways to assess how we're doing. I'd like to share some of those metrics with you, picking up on Andrew's commentary on our three key strategic themes. First, collaboration. United Healthcare's value proposition is rooted in lower costs, better outcomes, and a better experience. Optum supports this value proposition for United Healthcare and other health plans with ambulatory services, which patients and their doctors value. In this quarter, we met the ambulatory surgery needs of over 250,000 patients, delivering exceptional care in convenient and affordable settings, with revenue growth approaching 20% over the non-pandemic affected 2019 second quarter. These centers are meeting higher acuity and more complex needs such as total joint replacement, spine and cardiovascular procedures, which are performed at an increasing number of centers. Our ambulatory settings receive a consumer NPS of 92 and we deliver better and more consistent quality outcomes at about half the cost of traditional settings. Optum Care has over 1,600 clinics and is rapidly expanding virtual offerings to serve patients in settings where they feel the most comfortable, and importantly with their own physician. Seniors served by Optum Care under our integrated care approach spend considerably more time with their primary care physicians than seniors in traditional Medicare and, as a result, spend one-third fewer days in a hospital. Second is our strategy to increase the application of technology to improve patient care and help the system run better. We recently announced the partnership with Bassett Healthcare, another strong example of how OptumInsight is helping health systems to expand and scale essential capabilities, including revenue cycle management and digital modernization to improve health outcomes and patients' healthcare experiences. We expect to continue to add new partnerships like this. Also at OptumInsight, we've been tackling the most resource-intensive operations through the deployment of advanced technology and other approaches. For example, we have transformed what were once largely manual chart review processes into highly automated operations.  Third, we have been hard at work advancing our consumer capabilities. United Healthcare has made significant advances in the management of complex conditions. We're focused on making sure that patients with the highest acute care needs are able to access the most appropriate site of care by assigning them advocates to help navigate the system. Nearly one million of these members are matched with a personal navigator to help them manage and improve their health. OptumRx continues to improve access and affordability of home delivery for patients, leading to significant improvements in continuity of care and having already reduced the cost to process and dispense prescriptions by nearly 20% in just the past two years. Also, along consumer cost savings lines, for those who prefer an in-store retail experience, we now offer tools to find the lowest cost prescriptions near them regardless of the health benefits \u2013 of their health benefits coverage status. These tools can save self-paying consumers up to 80% on their medications.  Consumer preference is also having an impact in behavioral health. Already this year, the OptumHealth behavioral platform has delivered over 500,000 virtual visits, an option we initiated in just the last year. Many consumers and clinicians prefer these virtual encounters since they offer enhanced accessibility, flexibility and simplicity. Care encounters delivered through our dedicated channel have a patient satisfaction of 98%.  These are just a few of the many initiatives we are executing on as we apply technology, data and analytics to make our strategic growth agenda come alive. We look forward to updating you on our progress over the quarters to come. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. Yes, thanks Andrew, and Lance for the question. Of course, we continue to see telehealth be a broadly desired consumer access vehicle to the health system. We've seen that grow. We're hoping we get to sort of the next generation, and we think a lot of that begins with--like for example, with OptumCare physicians being able to deliver that, because as Andrew said, people have a good preference to go to their own physician. The product with respect to virtual first, to answer your specific question, we plan on rolling that on in eight, nine markets in UnitedHealthcare at the end of this year.

            "name": "Wyatt Decker",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks, Josh, for the question. To Andrew's comments, we are increasingly bringing our depth and breadth in value-based care delivery to new markets that have been historically fee-for-service. And you'll see this unfolding right now and over the next year or two in markets like the Pacific Northwest and Northeast, where we have - we've acquired and grown considerable clinical delivery assets. But we are now bringing the expertise in markets like Texas and Southern California, that have been delivering value-based and full risk capitated care for years. And so that really is a differentiator for us.  And the other piece I'd build on is Andrew's comment around how we are creating a comprehensive set of offerings that address virtually every aspect of an individual's healthcare journey, from a focus on primary care and keeping you healthy and well, to post-acute care to end of life care and complex care in all environments, virtual, home, and in the clinic. And that to us, as we bring that together, connect the dots, is a differentiator in all markets. Thanks. Yes, thanks Lance for the question. We are bringing together the virtual care experience that we stood up rapidly during the pandemic with over 18,000 providers onto, as Dirk mentioned, a next generation technical solution that we've created, which creates the opportunity to seamlessly onboard and triage an individual virtually, so we make sure they're getting the right care in the right environment, whether that's a virtual, physical or behavioral healthcare need.

The revenue for 2021 and the risk scores that support those are totally in line with our expectation, as John indicated in his remarks, and yes, we did receive the midyear payment from CMS which gives us a more fulsome view into what 2021 revenue is. Again, that aligns to our expectations, and at this point we consider 2021 revenue to be pretty complete in terms of what we're know about risk scores."

            "name": "Heather Cianfrocco",
            "content": "Thanks Andrew. Thanks, AJ, for the question. Yes, I think as Andrew said, maybe I'll take script volume quickly just to finish that off, and then maybe talk a little bit about selling season.  As Andrew said, really if you look at, whether ours is indicative of other things you've seen, what I'd say is specific to us, what you've seen over the last year is, yes, about half of that is the rebound from compression and the rest of that is really a little bit of vaccine volume, and Andrew gave you the number there. But that really hits volumes for us more than anything else because of the ratio of revenue to scripts there. In addition to that, there is continued double-digit growth in the pharmacy services business, so that's making up the bulk of the additional growth that you're seeing year over year there.  As far as the split of acute maintenance, etc., I guess I would say--you know, we just had this discussion about what baseline is. I can specifically say that we're seeing second quarter looks more like '19 than it certainly did looking like second quarter of 2020, and we basically don't see anything unique there as far as acute versus--as far as acute ratio, kind of back to what we saw pre-pandemic for this quarter. Maybe let me switch quickly to selling season. We're still in the midst of it this year, and that's for all segments - that's for employer, it's for health plan, public sector and coalition. I'd say generally same activity, maybe a little different pacing of decision making right now, but really in the midst of it. The biggest thing I would say about the selling season is clients very interested in solutions to address high cost of specialty drugs and getting to medications and therapies that really help on the medical and the pharmacy side, so for us we're very focused on those solutions and we're finding that our site of care services for alternative sites and alternative therapies, like biosimilars, together with some of our specialty programs that work through OptumHealth and OptumRx and straddle the medical and pharmacy benefit are really resonating, together with our really intense clinical client consulting that we're bringing to the market right now, so we're finding that resonating in the selling season and we think we've got a lot of value to add there. Hopefully, that answers your question."

To the question around engagement levels, I think the piece that I am most encouraged by is the physician engagement levels, and in particular in our senior communities. We're really seeing strong receptivity, certainly reflective of the vaccination rates, and I think that's really giving us encouraging signals overall not only to 2022, but just the population and health at large. With that, I'll turn it over to Tim to talk a little bit more specifically about MA."

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. As we discuss our enterprise today, I hope you sense its growing momentum as we advance on our path of improving the quality, cost and experience of healthcare for everyone we serve. Both Optum and United Healthcare grew and delivered on our longstanding strategy, and we've increased our outlook for the year to a range of $18.30 to $18.80 per share.  We continue to prioritize three key themes that we believe will underpin the next era of growth for our enterprise: first, unlock the collaborative opportunities within and between Optum and United Healthcare; second, increasingly apply technology to improve patient care and experience and to help the system run better; and third, strengthen our consumer focus, capabilities and value. During the quarter, we accelerated our efforts to develop and deploy new and innovative products informed by the insights of both Optum and United Healthcare in areas such as oncology care delivery, rare disease drug management, Optum Virtual, Optum Financial Services and many others. We are doubling down on efforts to both expand and link services where it creates value for consumers and patients to make their healthcare journey easier, simpler, and more intuitive.  We constantly challenge ourselves to develop capabilities which lead to improved care, better value, and a simpler system. Our sales to clients and partners across all parts of the health system demonstrate the strong relevance of our innovation and the strengthening of our sales pipeline is a key opportunity as we emerge from the COVID market pause.  A good example of bringing our collective strengths together at scale is the Optum home and community care platform, through which we care for nearly 10 million people. This platform includes our well-known HouseCalls service, comprehensive post-acute care for smoother transitions to home, and integrated primary and behavioral care for Medicare Advantage patients who prefer to receive their care at home. Home and community platform services can reduce post-acute medical care costs by a quarter, unnecessary readmissions by up to a fifth, and hospital admissions by up to 25%.  In Medicaid, we are addressing consumer needs by expanding our long-term collaboration with public housing authorities, working with government agencies and community-based organizations to identify and address specific healthcare issues for people who are hard to reach and support. In just the past six months, we've introduced new partnerships in over 20 communities to close gaps in care and address health equity challenges. Using data and analytic capabilities, we're able to rapidly identify local health trends and gaps and then work with community partners to inform guidelines, training materials, processes, and create better tools to advance health. We believe this will result in better health of community members and help to optimize limited state resources. These and other targeted initiatives on the social determinants of health are essential elements and illustrative of our natural and longstanding ESG impact. Our recently published sustainability report captures the full range of efforts we've dedicated ourselves to in areas of crucial concern to our stakeholders, none more so than advancing health and health equity. This agenda is an essential part of our way of doing business. I'd like to thank our 330,000 colleagues from across the company for the passion and diligence they show every day in helping to deliver improvements in serving our members, clients and patients. I've great confidence that we're emerging from the last 18 months of disruption with an unprecedented set of opportunities to help improve the health system for all of those we can serve. And now, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to provide more detail on initiatives to drive performance across the organization. Thanks John. What we've tried to provide you with this quarter, as we do each time, is a sense not only of what United Health Group's results are but how we achieved them. The examples we've referenced and countless others throughout this enterprise, along with the consistent execution by our colleagues, are what underpin our confidence in our long term 13% to 16% EPS growth rate target and in our ability to help people live healthier lives and help the health system work better for everyone over the years to come. With that, Operator, let's open up the call for questions. One question per caller, please. Alan, over to you. Kevin, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask John to give a little bit more detail, I mean a couple of things. Obviously, still too early to give you kind of real shaping for 2022, so you won't be surprised we won't go there.  And I would say, the overwhelming story for this year is of course the dynamic of COVID in terms of the various puts and takes, which are taking place under the surface. And as we've done for the last several quarters, we've tried to kind of dimension that within the $1.80. But as we've also said repeatedly, the bulk of that $1.80 sits in the rest of the year, the year to go between now and the end of 2021. And so really, really pleased with the momentum and underlying performance of the company in the first two quarters of this year, but also respectful of uncertainties that remain around the COVID puts and takes. And of course, that all feeds into how we make the judgment on raising the earnings expectation for the rest of the year. I think where I sit, I feel great about that underlying performance so far. Broadly speaking, the COVID dynamic has played the way we would have anticipated more or less, but there's still a way to go and there are uncertainties within that. Maybe John, you might go a little further and take that $1.80 apart and maybe reflect a little bit on how you're seeing those different elements of the driver of that. Thanks, John. And Kevin, thanks very much for the question. Appreciate it. Next question? So, Josh, thanks so much for the questions. And before I -- I'm going to ask Dr. Decker to make a few comments in a minute or two, but maybe just make a couple of introductory observations. So first off, I think, you're really starting to see OptumHealth broadly. And within that business, in particular, Optum Care and, of course, home and community really starting to demonstrate their capacity for growth because of the scale of the footprint that they now establish across the country. And I think you're starting to see these businesses move into a kind of critical mass dynamic, that's reflected in its overall growth. It's also reflected in this very rapid expansion of OptumHealth revenue per consumer, up over 40% this quarter. That's reflective of the quality of services, which are being delivered and the perceived value that they obviously reflect, so we feel very good about that. Your question around capacity constraints is a really good question. We continue to expand rapidly the number of physicians and clinicians in our organization, either directly or through affiliation. This year, we expect to add about 10,000, we're well over halfway through that journey, so going super well on that front. I would say one of the key elements is really making sure that those practices, as rapidly as possible, start to develop the skills to be able to manage capitated risk, which is really what then drives a tremendous amount of the distinctive behavior and value creation for patients and, of course, for the system. That process, I think, has been continually refined. As you would be well aware, in the marketplace people have tried different models, they don't always work super well. I'll maybe ask Dr. Decker in a second to dive a little bit more detail into some of the work they're doing there to accelerate that dimension of capacity, because it's not simply having the practices and the clinicians, it's having that way of working which really drives the change in what we're able to do. As far as your last question is concerned, I actually think that the OptumCare clinics within the broader Optum and UHG organization, that's where some of the magic really sits here in terms of being able to leverage many different aspects. And as you see these elements of OptumHealth and Optum Care, in particular, develop. You're also seeing significant amounts of support and help, if you will, being provided by other businesses across the organization. Payment integrity is a good example, beginning to be adopted by parts of Optum Care. So with all of that, I'd like Dr. Decker maybe just to go a little deeper on how we move or how we help practices develop the capabilities, which allow them to deliver the value we're now seeing. Wyatt, thanks so much, and Josh, thanks so much for the questions. Next question, please. Ricky, that's a great question. You're quite right that a lot of what we focus on is--well, first and foremost, to try and understand what is the very best care that an individual need and to make sure that they get access to that, and one of the big things we've been doing this year is trying to get people, particularly seniors, back into the system, those who maybe held back because of the pandemic, and as you heard earlier, we're glad to see some of that moving, albeit some way to go. Now within that, we also recognize there are a whole series of places where, frankly, there are better, more effective ways to deliver care. I'm going to pick out one very simple example just to build on what you described. If I think about some of the work that's going into OptumRx and within our Optum infusion business, you can take drugs where perhaps $10,000, $15,000 per treatment for a hospital outpatient, exactly the same drug being delivered by Optum at-home infusion, $3,500. That's the kind of impact that we can deliver through really thoughtful application of location of delivery and the like, and that's just one example. UHC are very much focused on this in much of their guidance, and of course Optum is building a variety of different capabilities.  Having said all of that, I think the reality is it's very early days, even for us, in terms of changing behaviors against the overall trend of the healthcare system, so I think that baseline of 2019 probably is the right rational piece. Over time, I think these practices will start to bear down on the overall trend of cost, but of course that will happen as we see those capabilities spread more broadly, as we see them get more adoption and they start to change the price point in the marketplace for some of these treatments or therapies which are, frankly, overpriced. What our clients are looking for us to do, both through United Healthcare and Optum, is find ways to get great care at lower cost, and that's exactly what we're focused on doing.  Ricky, thanks so much for the question. Next question, please. Listen, that's a great question, AJ, and before I hand it over to Heather Cianfrocco, our head of OptumRx, let me just make a couple of introductory remarks. That 8% script growth, about half of that is, we would estimate, kind of bounce back from the suppression at this time last year caused by the COVID--initial waves of the COVID disruption. But even having said that, the 4% residual growth is great and we feel very good about the performance of the OptumRx business across its breadth of businesses, so within the core PBM but also across all of its various other pharmacy services business, which the company has been investing in over the last several years. We did about 10 million vaccine prescriptions, I think, year to date. To give you a little bit more detail on that and a little bit further into selling season observations, maybe hand over to Heather. Heather, go ahead. Thanks Heather, really appreciate it. I might just add, AJ, one other dimension that's under Heather's leadership, which is really pertinent to behavioral health. As I think we all recognize, that's a huge issue across the U.S. I think many of us anticipate the COVID pandemic and various impacts from that may well exacerbate some of the trend there, but I just wanted to call out the progress of Genoa Pharmacy within that. It's a business that came into our organization two or three years ago. We're going to open 60 more of those centers this year. We're already up to 582 of those centers, we're well on the way to close to double what we had when they first became part of the organization, and the impact that that group has is extraordinary, both from a consumer NPS score of 95, provider NPS score of 80, the impact they have in terms of helping improve adherence for highly complex patients, particularly those patients who are served through our Medicaid books of business is super important. So just wanted to mention that alongside the other elements of OptumRx, another key part of the growth, and a key part of where OptumRx is really helping our Medicaid business deliver really high-quality service for folks who need it. Next question? Yes Justin, thanks so much. I'll address the Alzheimer's drug issue in a second, but first of all I'd like John maybe to pick up on your broader MCR questions. Great, thanks John. The other thing I'd say, Justin, is there's plenty of noise within those numbers that John just described, so you see inpatient, outpatient, physician visit trends by different books of business, it's a more complex picture than it looks on the surface.  As far as the Alzheimer's drug is concerned, I'm going to--in a second, I'm going to ask Dr. Migliori, our Chief Medical Officer, to make a couple of comments on this particular thing. Overall, bottom line from our perspective is this remains obviously a super important area for patients, families to look for progress in. We all want to see that progress happen. I think from where we stand today, there's still a lot of information that we need to be able to make really clear decisions, and I think we're not the only ones in that regard looking for greater clarity in this arena.  Maybe Dr. Migliori, you might give a perspective from the medical perspective, please. Yes, thanks so much, Dr. Migliori. Justin, I think bottom line is I think this has some way to go before we get to real clarity, so I wouldn't guide you to expect very rapid decision making on this piece, not because we don't want to see these good effective treatments being made available - of course we do, but it's really important to have a real clear understanding of really how they should be used, what their value is in utilization, and as Dr. Migliori said really well, really understanding where CMS get recognized in that the MA population likely to be very significant fraction of utilizers, we need to understand where all of that fits. So I think this is potentially good news, but it's still early days and we have a lot more to learn before we can be more definitive than that, so can't be too much more helpful at this point, I'm afraid, Justin, but thank you so much for the question. Next question, please. Yes Ralph, thanks so much. I'm going to ask John to reflect on the second part of your question, in terms of forward-looking for the second half of the year. Just to nail this first part, though, the commercial book, as you've heard already now from John a couple of times, basically right on baseline, maybe a hair above but right there, and then the two government books of business a few percentage points below, so I won't go further than that. Maybe John, you could give some insight into how you're seeing things within the next six months. John, thanks so much, and Ralph, thanks for the question. Next question? Scott, thanks so much for your question. I'm going to pass that over to our new CEO of UnitedHealthcare, BT. BT, you and Tim might like to address those two points from Scott. BT? Tim, BT, thanks so much. Scott, thanks for the question. Next question? Yes, and I'll ask John in a second to give you more on this. First off, obviously again we're not going to be really shining a light on our expectation for '22 yet. Having said that, we also think the majority of the $1.80 headwind will have been utilized this year, will essentially be non-recurring. Of course, that depends on some assumptions around the pandemic itself remaining under control, so that is an observation which has to be taken in that context; but as we sit today, I think that is a prudent view. John, you may want to go a little deeper on how each of the elements perhaps you think about. Right. John, thanks so much, and Dave, thanks for asking the clarifying question. Appreciate that. Next question? Great question, Lance, thanks. I'm going to ask Dirk in a second to make a couple of comments around the overall shift towards digital first, virtual first, and may also ask Dr. Decker to refer to some of further what's going on within OptumHealth, which is important around OptumVirtual.  As I've made super clear over the last couple of quarters, really elevating our consumer focus is a top priority for the whole company, and that really speaks to ensuring that we're delivering simpler, more intuitive experiences, that we're thinking about the journey of the consumer and the patient in an end-to-end sense, that we're making it easier for them to make all of the very sequential decisions, and we also want to meet the consumer where they want to be met, whether that be outside of a facility, in their home, online or in person. We fully recognize how the premium the patients and consumers in particular, being able to talk to the physicians they know rather just any physician, and so how we start to pull all that together is essentially reflected in many of the different initiatives we have. Over the last few quarters, you've seen us build up things like OptumVirtual - Dr. Decker will talk to you in a second, but things like OptumStore just being rolled out under the OptumRx organization really starts to bring together a ton of access for consumers in terms of what they're able to do with us. With that introduction, Dirk, love to get your perspective, and then maybe Wyatt. Dirk? Dirk, thanks. Wyatt, we'd like to just get a little more on OptumVirtual and what you've been building inside OptumHealth. Thanks Wyatt. I think Lance, just to close this out, this is--I'm excited about what's been built in OptumHealth here. If you think about this build-out of ambulatory clinic facilities and other attendant services, perhaps in the pharmacy space, you think about the home and community agenda, really investing to make sure that folks who want to spend as much time at home as possible are able to do that, and then you see OptumVirtual essentially pulling all of that together, you've got to think about this as all three of those elements essentially all at play at the same time. I think it's a very important step forward that gives us a really significant opportunity to ensure that we deliver a much more seamless experience, we're much more responsive to consumer need, and we can focus on bringing costs down and delivering better care. That's what we really believe we can do here. You're going to hear a lot more about this. It's an important step up in the energy around our OptumHealth strategy. We just have time, I'm afraid, for one last question, so Alan, if you could ask for a last question, please. Matt, thanks so much for the question. Really, it's a great question, and you would have to expect that the answer is that some of it would have been unnecessary. I think at this distance, it's a little hard to really call that at this point. I mean, there are some tantalizing signals in some of the trends, so if you look at emergency department use, for example, it looks pretty sustained down and doesn't seem to be coming back, and certainly if you look at our advisory board surveys that we're running with many, many non-UHC providers and institutions across American healthcare, people don't--a lot of people don't expect that ED utilization to come back. Now, that may be because they were being unnecessarily used, maybe folks have realized that urgent care centers are a much better option, maybe virtual is a much better option that they can get what they need at much lower cost.  Whether it's unnecessary, whether or not the pandemic has disturbed people's allegiance to certain types of sites of care and people are a little bit more open minded about where to go, all of that I think is in play. I would say it's premature to call it. I think we're watching it really carefully. I could build those theories I just shared with you. I'm not going to tell you that those are proven. I think there is tantalizing signals in the data, but it's going to take another six, 12 months before you can really settle out how this all plays. But Matt, thanks for the question, and we'll probably loop back on that once again, I'm sure. Listen everybody, I want to say thank you for all of your attention today, for your participation, very much appreciated. We hope very much that what you've heard from out team gives you a flavor of why we have such confidence in the outlook for our company and for the ability of Optum and UnitedHealthcare separately and together to improve the lives of those we serve and the health system overall. With that, I'd like to say thank you very much, and to close this morning's call."

            "content": "Thank you Dirk. Our first half performance supports the foundation for strong and expanding growth for the remainder of this year and beyond. Before I review business performance, I'll offer a brief perspective on the pandemic-driven trends we're observing. The core takeaway is that our outlook for COVID-19 impacts is consistent with our past commentary. The second quarter showed overcall care activity continuing to trend toward baseline or normalized levels, albeit with variation across lines of business. For example, in commercial markets care activity was above baseline as members were willing and able to obtain needed care, some of which was deferred from prior periods. Our public sector markets continued to run below baseline, even as we are actively encouraging people to get their need. We were gratified to see care activity for these populations begin to progress over the course of the quarter as vaccination rates advanced. We continue to estimate approximately $1.80 per share of unfavorable COVID-19 impacts for full year 2021 and to expect the majority of these effects to occur in the second half.  Moving to overall business performance, OptumHealth second quarter revenue and earnings increased 46% and 34% respectively year-over-year. Revenue per consumer grew by 43%, reflecting the impact of accountable arrangements and our expanding home and community health platform combined with the growing complexity of the needs we're serving. Of the 20 million patients we serve through Optum Care, over 2 million are in fully accountable or capitated care arrangements, an increase of 17% from a year ago, and we expect this pacing to accelerate strongly in the years ahead. OptumInsights revenue grew 12% in the quarter and earnings grew 36% with the revenue backlog increasing by $1.9 billion to $21.3 billion. Key growth drivers were managed services, the continued recovery of care activity to more normal levels, and further implementations of technology-enabled services. In particular, we are seeing strong sales momentum in the services, software and analytics business, which serve care providers. OptumRx revenue and earnings increased 5% and 19% year-over-year and script growth was 8%, with this comparison impacted by last year's pandemic-affected care patterns. Our expanding pharmacy care and specialty services continue to grow strongly, now comprising just under half of OptumRx revenues. Turning to United Healthcare, we are encouraged by the receptivity to our expanding set of responsive commercial benefits centered around virtual first, on demand and physician-led offerings. Year to date, we have added about 150,000 members in such innovative commercial offerings, even with the evolving and uneven labor market trends which impacted second quarter membership.  Medicare Advantage membership has grown by 675,000 year to date, tracking well to our full year outlook. Our house calls clinicians have been able to provide their vital services to seniors, conducting over 1.1 million home visits in the first half, more than double the year-ago level. People served in managed Medicaid programs grew by nearly 920,000 over the year-ago quarter, in part as state-based redetermination activities remained on hold. Our Medicaid offerings continue to deliver a positive consumer experience and demonstrable cost effectiveness for our state government partners, and we look for this momentum to build heading into next year. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with second quarter cash flows from operations at $5.5 billion or 1.3 times net income, and we ended the quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 40%. In early June, our board of directors increased the dividend by 16%. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance, we've updated our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $18.30 to $18.80 per share, inclusive of the COVID-19 impact incorporated into our full year view. Within this, we expect the pacing through the second half to be fairly level. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew. Kevin, good morning, it's John Rex. Yes, just to get a little further into those. So within the $1.80, we still expect about 70% of that to occur in the second half of the year, so the vast majority. A lot to be seen on how that $1.80 really plays out. Keep in mind kind of the main elements that, that comprises: It's the direct treatment and testing costs that we see, offset by elective care deferrals that might continue to occur or not in the rest of the year; the potential for higher acuity for those that have missed or deferred care; and at least within 2021, the impact of the care deferrals that occurred last year. So those are all super important components here. Within those elements, the things to play out would be most around the direct treatment and testing costs and the potential for higher acuity and how much care occurs in the back half.  The other elements within the $1.80, I would say, are more steady throughout the course of the year. So that point being around care deferral in 2020 and the related revenue impacts for 2021, those should be relatively steady, and I would say are running in line with the expectations that were set out for you back in December. So I don't think we've had a surprise on that element within our outlook. And I would say, the kind of economic impacts also pretty relatively steady over the course of the year in terms of the quarterly progression, so those are really the elements that we continue to look for. You're right. Look, we saw good strength in a lot of the business, growth across the platform - really, we could point to every business. But it's that look out to really understanding how those trends play in the second half of the year. Thank you. Justin, good morning. A little color perhaps on how the progression occurred in the quarter here. As it relates particularly, thinking about the quarterly progression that we saw, perhaps not unsurprisingly COVID testing and treatment costs were highest in the month of April, actually trending up a little bit from what we saw in March, and that tracks with the incidence rate and the hospitalization rates that we would have been seeing, and then that trending down pretty rapidly in May and June in terms of the number of individuals in hospital beds and the treatment costs. In terms of utilization in commercial populations, interestingly that was also highest in the month of April, trending down a bit over the course of the quarter but still just marginally, very marginally above baseline as we end June, as we exited June, just to give you a little color commentary on how that was progressing. That was really the trending that we saw within that, and Andrew, I'll turn it back to you. Good morning, Ralph. Yes, so then you blend to a little bit--just a little bit below overall when you blend the books and you weight our books across in terms of what we're seeing in the second quarter. Then as you might expect, that trends up progressively every quarter. Every quarter, you'd see rising in that overall level of utilization and the expectations as we had into the end of the year. Embedded in that is also a view in terms of what happens with intensity, acuity levels. One comment--question that we've often received is what are we seeing currently in acuity levels as we progress, and part of the impact as we progress in the second half is an expectation that you do see rising acuity levels. I'll tell you, we haven't observed that yet, but it still is probably a little bit early to say. Among the things we look at, we look at new cancer diagnoses, new cardiac diagnoses - those are still running below baseline levels that we'd expect, but a view is that could continue to progress as we get into the back half of the year.  The other element in terms of just thinking about utilization and rising in the back of the year, and ultimately this is [indiscernible] what occurs with COVID testing and treatment costs. Clearly there's been the evidence of the new variants and their impacts in other countries and then also moving into the U.S., and even in our own data we can see that, but I would tell you still fairly limited in terms of impact. As I sit here and look at number of members, of our members that we have receiving treatment today, in hospital beds today as we sit here this morning, still well below the levels even as we sit here in mid-July what we were seeing in the April levels, but that could be a trend back factor also in the second half of the year as we see that progression. Thank you. Sure, a few factors on that and how timing might impact those. Maybe just to refresh a little bit on that, Tim did a nice job describing the impacts in terms of the revenue impacts from particularly Medicare Advantage members being able to be seen by their physicians. We are encouraged by what's going on in our house calls activity - very strong receptivity to those. BT just mentioned we're encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of seniors and their receptivity to even going in and seeing their physicians - that's all super important. I don't know if timing is so important on that piece, it just needs to occur during the year in terms of when that activity occurs, so that would be the more important factor as it relates to 2022 - does it occur in 2021, do they get in, so that's an important factor. Other factors here, I would say, there is care that didn't occur in 2020 and probably hasn't occurred in 2021 yet, that was deferred and needs to occur, so that's more about also an element of does it not occur at all in this year, does it work its way into 2022, and the potential for that and the revenue impact of whether or not there's an increase in acuity from those populations. Those are really the main elements, I would say, in terms of what I would call timing related. The other elements are more just--would be around this concept around the occurrence of COVID-19 incidence, direct treatment and testing costs, how that progresses over the back half of the year too. But those would be the elements that would be sensitive to timing factors."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I would like to introduce your host for today's program, Andrew Witty. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrew Witty: (Audit Start)Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results and positive outlook as we continue to execute on UnitedHealth Group's long-standing mission and strategies. The exceptional dedication of the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare again defined this period. They have adapted swiftly and creatively to demand and rapidly changing circumstances, implemented new ideas, and importantly remain focused on serving people exceptionally well. As a result, adjusted earnings per share were $5.31, reflecting strong execution at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. In light of our strong start to the year, balanced with continued respect for the potential pandemic-related effects we have previously described, we are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.10 to $18.60 per share. I will touch briefly on two highlights among many in the quarter that illustrate the increased momentum our colleagues at UnitedHealth Group are driving. People served with our employer and individual offerings grew nearly 100,000 in the quarter, even within the context of a challenged U.S. employment environment, and this underscores the growing consumer orientation affordability and breadth of our products. OptumInsight revenues increased 14% and operating income increased 45% compared to the year-ago period as more normal activity levels among healthcare system customers returned leading to expansion in how we help them advance clinical and operational excellence. Significant innovation and automation in the OptumInsight businesses drove strong productivity gains. We have the right capabilities, assets, and strategies in place, and we remain restless to innovate, evolve, and further integrate our offerings to serve more people more effectively, both directly and with our many external partners throughout the healthcare environment. To achieve this, we have been sharpening our focus in three key areas. First, delivering even greater value to those we serve throughout the healthcare system by better harnessing the collaborative capabilities of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We believe we can develop new products and services we support people more effectively by bringing to bear greater application and adoption of the combined offerings of these two distinct and complementary organizations. Optum Care's work supporting Medicare Advantage patients illustrates this well and I will speak more to this shortly. The second area of focus, increase in the application of our technology and related resources to improve care for people and the operational health systems. There are benefits for everyone in helping to make the healthcare system work more like an actual system. Improving the natural flow accessibility and use of information is essential to that goal, all within a secure and protected framework. We can help care providers and payers better serve patients by more effectively simplifying key administrative processes and by providing timely access to relevant information. The third focus is making healthcare work better for consumers. We are ambitious to meet the rising expectations of healthcare consumers, and we will continue to improve our offerings included in such critical zones is greatly simplified, intuitive, and satisfying consumer digital experiences and advanced healthcare banking and payments services that enable people to find, price, and pay for care digitally. You will hear more from us about these approaches in the months ahead. But today, I would like to focus on the first, unlocking greater value for customers at the intersection of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, including through our ability to develop new useful service offerings. One of the most effective ways of doing so is through stronger alignment of the high-quality clinical services of Optum Care to address the needs of patients we serve for our nearly 90 health plan customers. A key foundation is increasing the clinical outcome accountability of our Optum Care practices. Of the four million patients who Optum Care serves in some form of accountable arrangement today, two million are being served under a fully capitated arrangement, and this demonstrates the strong growth and progress. But Optum Care serves 20 million patients in total, which is one reason why we view the potential of Optum Care as only beginning to be harnessed. These accountable arrangements drive measurably better patient outcomes and experiences, all at lower cost. For example, seniors served by Optum Care physicians under such arrangements spend on average one-third fewer days in the hospital and have 40% fewer days in skilled nursing facilities than seniors in traditional Medicare. We expect the growth in the number of Optum Care patients served under accountable arrangements to accelerate. A further example of using our combined expertise to advance more beneficial service offerings is the recent opening of a first of its kind Optum integrated care facility in Riverside County, California. While we have long offered and continue to actively develop our senior focused clinics, this new clinic and community center offers a comprehensive range of primary care led services including a pharmacy, all under a single roof; and importantly, it is especially orientated around supporting Medicaid, Medicare, commercial, and individual members of all ages. This comprehensive health center provides improved care access with modern on-site services, including annual wellness visits, chronic disease management support, coordinated care with trusted specialists, and laboratory, imaging and pharmacy services. The adjacent community center includes a full-service gym and meeting rooms for health education. We see Optum and our payer partners as uniquely positioned to be able to offer these types of impactful venues and look forward to learning from the community and expanding these services. To sum up, we continue to organize and apply the unique capabilities of this organization in ways that enable us to execute on the goals we established for 2021 and beyond and to continue to deliver on our 13% to 16% long-term earnings growth objective. Now, I will turn it over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to give more color on initiatives to drive greater performance across the organization.\nDirk McMahon: Thanks Andrew. As Andrew noted, we continue to drive growth by supporting more affordable, simpler, quality care across Optum and United Healthcare. These are themes you have heard us cover before, and we continue to see the benefits of this approach for the people we serve. Let me turn those themes into some specific examples across Optum and UnitedHealthcare that illustrate how our approach is working. First is how we have been simplifying the consumer experience over the past year. We have driven greater engagement with seniors by increasing adoption of digital tools. Monthly active users of our digital offerings have risen double digit with similar increases in online transactions. This has led to greater adoption of our digital therapeutic offerings. In the first quarter, high-risk chronic disease patients in our home monitoring program logged over 1.5 million biometric measurements such as glucose level, enabling 99% medication compliance and an NPS of 84. (Audit End) We have also made it easier for people to get and maintain behavioral health support by expanding traditional and provider network and combined them with modern digital therapeutic services. Behavioral health needs have increased significantly during the pandemic. And as a result, we have seen substantial adoption in our digital behavioral platform that provides on-demand emotional support, logging a rise of over 100% in utilization. Always accompanying our work to simplify healthcare is Optum and UnitedHealthcare's sharp focus on delivering high-quality care. We have talked to you before about the advances we are making to integrate patient specific health data and plan information directly into the physician's workflow. Clinicians can see gaps in care and act to close them during the patient's visit in addition to other steps that facilitate more efficient care and better outcomes. We now support over eight million of these insight-enabled digital interactions each month with rapidly expanding physician adoption. Delivering high-quality care has been central in our response to the COVID pandemic. Our most recent effort to help members access vaccines is a prime example. We launched a vaccine locator tool, helping people find and sign up for a vaccination. And we have made millions of outbound contacts to engage members and help them get the information they need. Lastly, making care more affordable remains central for the people we serve and the health system overall and is essential for increasing access. For instance, through our medication sourcing program, high cost providers now source drugs at a network specialty pharmacy including OptumRx or charge market rates only for the drug. Early work on this has generated substantial savings for our customers. Our work to make health care simpler, higher quality and more affordable drives strong growth for our business. At the end of January, for example, UnitedHealthcare was awarded an Oklahoma SoonerCare Medicaid contract to serve nearly 200,000 people. Oklahoma previously operated under a fee-for-service program. The award affirms the value we bring to state partners and consumers and reflects our commitment to expand access to care for all Americans. We look forward to working with our new partners in Oklahoma and sharing with you on future calls new examples as our work on simplicity, quality and affordability continues to create improvements and new growth opportunities. With that, now I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you Dirk. Before I review the performance of our businesses, as in recent quarters I would like to provide an update on the care patterns we are seeing as the pandemic continues to evolve. Over the course of the first quarter, total care activity including COVID-19 related care ran marginally below seasonal baseline. Pacing of elective care activity through the quarter generally track and in opposite directions with the rise and decline of COVID incidence rates which were much higher in the early part of the quarter than in the latter part. To put this in perspective, February and March showed COVID-related care at about half the level experienced in January. Since the quarter's end, we have again began to see a rise in COVID-related care while at this time not approaching the January level. Outpatient care activity was moderately below seasonal baseline for the full quarter, running in counterpoint to the COVID incidence patterns over the three months and reflecting a well below average influenza and respiratory illness season. And total inpatient activity was modestly above seasonal baseline with over 55,000 COVID-19 related admissions during the quarter compared to 65,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Moving to business unit performance. OptumHealth's first quarter revenue and earnings increased 35% year-over-year. Revenue per consumer served grew 31% over the year ago quarter. The growth in this metric continues to reflect the expanding number of people served under value-based care arrangements and the increasing acuity of the care services we offer. OptumInsight's revenue grew 14% in the quarter and earnings 45%, due to growth in our services and technology offerings and improved productivity. The revenue backlog at $20.8 billion grew $1.6 billion over the first quarter 2020, as more normalized business activity started to return among our provider and payer customers. OptumRx revenue and earnings were relatively consistent year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Adjusted scripts declined modestly from the year ago quarter, a period during which we provided advanced medications to the people we serve as the pandemic began. Pharmacy care and specialty services continue to grow strongly, in particular home infusion and our community behavioral health pharmacies. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. First quarter operating result reflected strong execution and continued membership growth. In addition to the growth in commercial and Medicare Advantage offerings noted earlier, people served in managed Medicaid programs grew by nearly 1.1 million over the year ago quarter. Of the 900,000 new seniors we expect to serve within Medicare Advantage this year, about 775,000 are in individual and group and 125,000 in dual special needs offering. Of importance to this, senior customers we serve, our HouseCalls clinicians have been considerably more able compared to this time last year to provide their vital services. We conducted nearly 600,000 home visits in the quarter as more seniors and care givers were vaccinated and comfortable having in-person visits. That's up by a third compared to first quarter 2020 and about four times higher than what was achieved in the second quarter 2020. Our liquidity and capital positions remained strong, with first quarter cash flows from operations at $6 billion or 1.2 times net income. As we look forward towards the combination with Change Healthcare, we intend to maintain our longstanding capital policies. These include our approach to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and an advancing dividend with ample capacity to continue building upon our strategic growth platform. We now expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18.10 to $18.60, an increase of $0.35 from the outlook we offered at our Investor Conference. This outlook continues to include an estimated $1.80 per share of unfavorable COVID-19 related effects, the substantial majority of which we still expect to occur in the latter part of the year, largely as care is more freely able to be delivered to people. Now I will turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. The story you heard about this quarter is the story you have heard for many years and will continue to do so about UnitedHealth Group, a focus on better serving people and organizations in healthcare using the combined capabilities of Optum and UnitedHealthcare to improve care, cost and experience and an unwavering attention to execute for excellence in all that we do. Operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator: (Audit Start)Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please.\nMatt Borsch: Hi. Yes. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. I have a question for you on the prior-year reserve development which is obviously a very large number. Can you just talk to where that emanated from in terms of components, whether by program or by quarter in 2020, and how that may be influencing your posture on forward reserving?\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks for the query. I am glad you asked that. I know a lot of people probably have that in mind. John, you should answer that, I think.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Matt, good morning. It's John Rex.\nMatt Borsch: Good morning.\nJohn Rex: Let me give a little color on that. So, yes, prior development, $1 billion favorable versus $850 million in the 4Q. As I am sure you would expect, that emanates heavily from the second half of 2020 and a lot from the fourth quarter. It was favorable really across the businesses. The elements there that would be driving that would be largely along care deferral activity that would have occurred in the quarter. I think when you think about impacts to the company and P&L impact, certainly there are significant mitigating factors that I know you are well aware, MLR rebates, risk order arrangements, reserve reestablishment that occurs. When I look at it and take it all together with those mitigating factors, P&L impact would have been in a similar zone to last year's first quarter with those elements coming in. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. Thanks Matt. Next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your question, please. Sorry, our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Jones: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question and congrats to Andrew and Brian on the new roles. Actually, I just wanted to ask one on OptumHealth. I think you said 35% of the growth there was driven by global cap. You also shared two million risk patients in OptumCare are now in global cap. Just curious if you could give a little bit more on kind of where you think this number could get to? The number of patients in global cap arrangements within OptumCare this year and then maybe over time, and then it would be helpful to understand a little bit just how many of the 20 million patients you highlighted are actually in MA today? Thanks so much.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Listen, Robert, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask Wyatt Decker to add, you put your finger on a really key part of the growth strategy going forward. Clearly, you are going to see over this year and next year an accelerating move towards more capitated patients within the OptumCare universe. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, there's a tremendous opportunity as we look at those 20 million and growing number of patients who we look after migrating towards what we believe to a better mechanism to help them manage both their care outcome and also the cost implications. So, you will see that continue to accelerate as we expand our OptumCare networks. We are rapidly transitioning our capabilities clinic-by-clinic to be able to do this, and it's one of the areas I think we feel extremely optimistic about future momentum. But to give you a little bit more detail, Dr. Decker, who leads OptumHealth, please?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thank you, Robert, for the question. And Andrew, I think you set it up nicely. OptumCare has become the nation's preeminent ambulatory delivery of value-based care. It is physician-led and increasingly you will see us bringing comprehensive services to bear to meet the needs of all of our patients with a particular focus on value base and a particular focus on the fully capitated individual. We will continue to grow over 250,000 lives this year, and you can expect that to accelerate in the years to come as we continue to attract individuals through organic growth as well as through our partnership with UHC, and as Andrew mentioned nearly 90 other providers. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Wyatt. And thanks Robert, for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.\nAndrew Witty: Hi Lisa. Go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I am just curious how we think about digital and telehealth impacting medical costs? What you have seen thus far? And what's the future role post the pandemic when we think about helping to control costs from a telehealth perspective?\nAndrew Witty: Lisa, that's a great question, I am going to ask in a second Dr. Decker. And also I think will ask Dirk McMahon to make a couple of comments, but let me just preface that. So, we have obviously seen telehealth develop as a set of capabilities over the last several years. We have been a very extensive user of those capabilities, but I think one of the things we have seen from 2020 and the pandemic is really a kind of shift in terms of people's thinking and willingness to utilize telehealth. We also think that the way in which they are being utilized is evolving. And so, what you are going to see from us and it is one of the examples I might cite in terms of the opportunity for new product development between Optum and UnitedHealthcare is, you are going to see UnitedHealth Group lean forward into much more integrated telehealth capabilities. We have got a number of new initiatives in deployment as we speak operating between the two companies. And with that introduction, let me pass it over to Wyatt to maybe give you a little bit more detail on that. And then, I think it would be good to hear from Dirk the perspective he has on this. So, Wyatt first.\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Well, thanks for the question. And as you heard us mention before, we are very proud of how quickly we stood up over 17,000 providers during the pandemic on telehealth solutions, but that really just is the beginning and of course across the country, we have seen a massive shift in consumer adoption and willingness to engage in virtual health solutions as well as with our providers more broadly. (Audit End) So our philosophy is that, not all telehealth is created equally and as we continue to develop our new products, you will see us integrating physical care, virtual care, home care and behavioral care in a way that is innovative and differentiated. And in fact, we have already launched a product we call Optum Virtual Care that is live in all 50 states and is doing just that. And what will really differentiate our product to those that we serve is the ability to offer virtual solutions but then, if necessary, immediately connect them to a live bricks-and-mortar solution for more complex or thorough care as well as identifying and triaging both physical and behavioral health care needs and offering comprehensive behavioral health care. We are seeing continued sustainability of virtual care solutions which as you may know peaked during the height of the pandemic have declined some but are still probably 10x where they were pre-pandemic and certain conditions or behavior or areas like behavioral health care are now seeing about 50% utilization through virtual services. So we are very excited about where we are going to take this. I will turn it over to Dirk.\nDirk McMahon: Yes. Thanks Wyatt. I think Andrew and Wyatt pretty will drained it. But let me say a couple of things. First, we know that people want to meet with their doctor and we have been focused on facilitating that with OptumCare. And people, basically, as you look at how things evolve, the brick-and-mortar physician, that's the vast majority of the tele business today. I would also say that I do see a tremendous opportunity for new models and new products strategies with OptumCare and others where we lean towards those providers who have again the best outcomes and provide the most efficient care. So like any other doctors in our network, we at UnitedHealthcare going to be looking at that strongly and we think OptumCare can provide that very well. That's it. Thanks Lisa.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Dirk. Thanks Wyatt. I have got to say, Lisa, I have been keeping an eye on the patient verbatims as we have been deploying the Optum Virtual platform that Wyatt referred to and really the feedback is really extraordinary in terms of how patients are seeing this, the benefit they feel from that and the ease with which they are able to engage with it. So this is exactly the kind of thing you are going to see going forward. I think Optum is in an extremely advantaged position being able to bring together this notion of integrated telehealth with physical and behavioral health. And that's going to be the path we go. And I think we are on the verge of kind of next generation of what this looks like versus what we have seen previously. So Lisa, thanks so much for raising the question. And next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your question please.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I guess one clarification first I guess. Does your guidance assume anything for sequestration delay? But then I guess the real question is, the $1. 80 that you guys are still including in your guidance, it sounds like things are starting off the year relatively well with the overall utilization coming in better and membership growing and some of the OptumInsight things kind of normalizing. I guess, how do you think about that $1.80? How is that progressing? And what kind of signposts you need to kind of see before you feel like that number might come in lower than that?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Listen, Kevin, thanks for the question. I am going to ask John in a second to refer to the $1.80, the math I guess behind that and the underlying trends. As far as sequestrations comes in, obviously we are keeping a close eye on the guidance from the administration. We have clearly seen the extensions. But the guidance raise we have given today is not caveated by that in anyway. So we have our assumptions on that but the guidance stands not withstanding any outcome there. John, on the $1.80?\nJohn Rex: Yes. Kevin, it's John Rex. Good morning. Let me talk a little bit about that and how we think about that progressing throughout the course of the year. So a few impacts here. I think the first, the important impact, I suggested that if a significant majority, I would call it, 70% of our projected COVID impact is really occurs in the second half of the year. And just to be frank, we just don't know enough now about what is going to happen later in the year to kind of have a very meaningfully different projection of what our full year results will be in terms of, will it be better in terms of better than the original projections, except for what we have experienced thus far which we expected some stronger underlying business performance growth across the number of businesses. We have executed well on productivity measures. And maybe just very modestly less impact in the 1Q unfavorable impact than we would have anticipated. But the important component there being that is really much more a back half weighted view in terms of COVID-19 impact. That's really premised upon our expectation that as we get later in the year, people are going to be more able to access previously deferred care and at higher acuity levels as a result of missed or postponed treatments. And that's what we have build into that view in terms of an expectation. But that's really unusual time still, no question. And we have therefore increased our full year estimate by what we know today.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. And Kevin, thanks so much for asking the question. I mean I think John really summarized it super well. We have raised our expectations for the year based on our experience so far this year and we have retained that $1.80 assumption, if you will, in terms of what could happen. But we obviously don't have the detailed visibility of that yet. But we feel that's the right balanced stance to take in terms of the rest of this year. So I hope that's clear and thanks so much for the question, Kevin. Next question?\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Your question, please?\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning here with Eric Percher as well. So our question this quarter again on OptumHealth and appreciate the comments in the prepared remarks and the Q&A. But I want to speak to the ultimate strategy around the accumulation of employed physicians. And if this is all about a move to global capitation and we are really more interested in the how, right. Is this more center based like what you are talking about in Riverside, California? Is this more of a technology overlay that enables the physicians to do this? And then I would again, how many of this 20 million, I understand 250,000 will move this year, but how many of those 20 million will ultimately end up in global cap, in your mind?\nAndrew Witty: Josh, thanks for the question. And before I pass it to Wyatt again to respond to the specifics, let me just give you a sense of how we see this play now. And I think the answer to your question is really both. So we absolutely see tremendous opportunity to continue to develop a variety of different clinic types. And if you look at the, I cited one particular example but we have been open in a wide number of different type of clinics depending on the environment over locality that we are operating in. And you should continue to expect to see that degree of customization according to the need of the geography. It's not a one size fits all model, by any means. So you will continue to see that. But at the same time, we strongly believe there is opportunity over the next few years. And this is why I focused in my kind of second there over going deeper around technology. How we can then help those clinics operate more efficiently? How we can ensure they are better connected, both locally with other clinics that we may own or to a high level of information support. So we see this as being a highly activated network of clinics and centers. The center, the network itself will have a high degree of diversity in it because it needs to be responsive to the needs of the locality, the community that we are operating in. And of course, as sensitive to the previous comments, it will have a very significant telehealth capability deployed alongside it. But Wyatt, maybe you could talk a little bit to how you see the progression within the 20 million?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thank you Andrew. Thanks Josh. Great question. We will continue to evolve. And one of the pieces that will differentiate us as comprehensive care providers is just that, being comprehensive. And so you will see us continuing to weave together products and services that meet people's needs in new and innovative ways. And telehealth and digital solutions are a big piece but not the only piece. The other part that I would call out is, we are increasingly leveraging technology to bring advanced decision support to our physicians and providers. And you may have heard previously about OptumCare. This is a value-based care delivery set of decision tools that are yielding real results, giving people the best, highest quality care that eliminates what we tend to call low value care and is a differentiator. So we will continue to deploy those technologies. As you know, we are on track to grow by over 10,000 physicians. We are now at 56,000 doctors, both affiliated, contracted and employed and we will leverage all of those models as we go forward and we continue to evolve and employ doctors who are really actually quite attracted to our model of value-based primary care. We eliminate much of the clerical burden in our physicians in advanced practitioners' practice and let them focus on the work they love. So this is really gaining traction among our physician workforce. And then to your point around how much of the 20 million lives that we serve today will ultimately be capitated, we anticipate that not only will a significant portion, you heard the number two million today and 0.25 million as we mentioned growing. So as we continue to grow, we also expect that we will always offer a host of modalities including fee-for-service. And that actually is a feeder system, as we think about value-based care being kind of the core of what we offer and fully capitated, the core of the core, if you will. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Wyatt. And maybe I will just ask Dan Schumacher to briefly add to the comments and talk a little bit about Optum At-Home which is a further dimension of this. So go ahead.\nDan Schumacher: Thanks Andrew. And great question, Josh. To the question around sort of center-based, tech-based, data-enabled and different versions of that that Wyatt was talking about, Optum At-Home is a great example of a collaboration between UnitedHealthcare and Optum that's in relatively early stages. But we focused on Medicare Advantage members that are in dual special needs plans initially. And that's a full risk offering and we are doing it in markets where we don't currently have local OptumCare practices. So what we are doing in the program is really both providing care but also arranging and coordinating care. So we are trying to address medical, behavioral and social needs and the results initially have been great. We have improved access for people with more than 80% having in-home visit and more than half of them getting connected back into office-based care, social services referrals and so forth as well as great health quality and outcome. So today we have got a little under 100,000 lives across six markets. We are looking to expand that across the Medicare Advantage Dual SNP but also into the individual MA we are doing with UnitedHealthcare and ultimately look to do that with other health plans. So another growth vector for us as we look at building out our value-based orientation.\nAndrew Witty: So Josh, I mean I know that was a little bit of a long answer from the three of us, but you asked a really important question. And this is really one of the core elements of the future of the company. And it's why you have heard us talk so much about OptumHealth, OptumCare and you can see the growth potential. We are at that two million life level now. We clearly see the capitation strategy as a highly effective strategy to deliver both quality and cost management for patients. That movement is really significant and it's really moving strongly. And with the development of the diverse sets of clinics and skills, the development of the technology support that you have just heard refer to, we believe we are in a very strong position to be able to be the leader in ability to manage those patients in the best possible way and ensure that they get the kind of health care they deserve. So Josh, thanks so much for asking the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi. Good morning. If we think about the utilization, you gave us some data on how utilization is tracking. But can you give us little bit more details on how it's tracking across the different patient population? And also we talked about acuity levels, your expectations for acuity level to step up second half of the year. But from the experience to-date, as you are starting to see individuals that are coming back, what type of acuity you are seeing for those that haven't received care for the last year? And I think the final one there, if you can just remind us as you think about that guidance for the full year, are you assuming that utilization by year-end is going to be above the 2019 baseline?\nAndrew Witty: So great question, Ricky. I am going to ask Brian Thompson, who has recently been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare, to respond to that. So, BT?\nBrian Thompson: Yes. Thanks for the question there. When I think about baseline, what I can say right now is, what we are seeing is largely tracking to our expectations. And as we had signaled, where we see abatement in services, it's largely offset by the increase in COVID-related costs. And that's tracked as we had expected. When you back out the impact of some suppressed utilization, the underlying factor is associated with medical cost trends largely look like they did. We aren't seeing significant upticks in services in specific areas out of the norm. So I would say, it looks a lot like utilization prior to the COVID implications. And when I think by line of business, I would say, generally tracking a little below baseline in both our government programs, closer to baseline inside our commercial business. But largely in track with what we had expected. And where it's a little out of line again where perhaps infection rates were higher, we saw that naturally offset with greater utilization. So first quarter, I would say, largely as expected.\nAndrew Witty: John, do you want to add?\nJohn Rex: Yes. Ricky, good morning. It's John Rex here. So as Brian noted, one of the aspects we look for is this rising acuity from patients that have deferred care or missed treatments. And at this point, we don't have evidence of that occurring. And it could be just that it's still too early on to have enough evidence to see it. But we have not yet seen that rising acuity in the populations that we serve. Your point in terms of how we think about as we get later into the year and why that moves like it does and you heard my commentary that a significant majority of the $1.80 we have layered into the second half of the year. That is largely because of the assumptions around those elements that we see that people are increasingly able to get the care they need, the amount of care deferrals declined meaningfully as you get into that latter part of the year. They are accessing the system. And we do get into these elements where we see rising acuity coming in. So those are the elements that are premised in terms of that expectation at this point. But really and the other element that Brian touched on also just in terms of your populations, you have commercial, a little more access to the system versus the public program members. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. And thanks, Ricky, for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nDave Windley: Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask a question about integration and longitudinal care and data versus fragmentation. And the question is this. So Andrew, over many years, Optum has really invested a lot of money in kind of aggregating data about the patient status, care and services delivered, so that touchpoints with United or Optum could have all that information at hand. I guess what I am interested in around kind of your build-out but specifically the comments you have made about telemedicine is, how important is it for telemedicine to enhance and augment the longitudinal and integrated nature of care versus fragmenting that by having it kind of siloed as a separate benefit? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Right. It's a great question. So I think our bias is increasingly and I think rightly toward driving a more and more seamless, simple, easy to access care environment, both for the patient and the provider actually. So what that speaks to is, trying to avoid the fragmentation of the interface and definitely trying to avoid the fragmentation of the information that then sits behind it. So we want to really try and create much more seamless opportunity. So for example, I would give you a real example in Optum Virtual which is, you have heard a little bit on the call already today. So of course, patients are looking for a way to engage with the physician. They actually want to talk to their physician. So one of the things that we are doing is building that platform. But then there might be situations where the physician wants to bring in a specialist into that conversation. Now in a multi-disciplinary clinic, they might be in a position in normal times to go down the hall, get somebody to come down and visit. Now in Optum Virtual, they are able to do that kind of thing. So that's an example of trying to bring that integration, even within the virtual space. So it kind of replicates a little bit more what you might expect in a physical environment. And so, we definitely see the need to try and drive toward that. And we definitely want to try and create the fluidity of the information to ensure that physicians have what they need when they are in front of the patient, when they are talking to the patient so they can make the best possible choices. So we want them to be as highly educated as possible in that context. So we are leaning very much towards the idea of integrated seamless and that's true whether you are in the physical or the virtual space and we want the two to sit together. Thanks for the question.\nDave Windley: Yes. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Next question. Thank you.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. A lot of good topics already covered here. So I just have a few quick follow-ups. First, the detail on OptumCare was very, very helpful. I was hoping I could ask for one more piece of information here which is, so it sounds like you are going to have 18 million people out of 20 million that are still not capitated. Wondering how many of these are sitting in Medicare Advantage plans that aren't capitated, given this is where most of the capitation happens? Just trying to think about the potential kind of pent-up growth there. And then on Medicare Advantage, it sounded like your health assessments are going better in 2021. Should we expect that you should get a significant amount of that risk or headwind that everybody saw for 2021 to reverse next year and get those revenues back? And then lastly, could you give us an update on earning seasonality for the year versus a 50/50 split you talked about on the last update? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hi Justin. Thanks so much for the questions. I am going to ask in a second, John to talk to the earning seasonality and for Wyatt to address the degree to the population we have within the MA plan. Let me just touch on the health assessment. You heard in the prepared comments the very strong performance of the HouseCalls program, actually higher than last year, record quarter actually in terms of performance at HouseCalls. And you are quite right, that makes us feel pretty optimistic that that headwind that we saw is going to dissipate pretty rapidly as we rotate into 2022. And that gives us kind of a rise in optimism that much of that kind of the negative headwind that characterizes the emergence of the pandemic starts to mitigate at least on that dimension. Obviously, we don't know what's going to happen in the next few months with this disease. But as we sit here today, that would be the right kind of expectation to look at. Let me go to Wyatt first. And then John, if you pick up from Wyatt on the seasonality. So, Wyatt?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Justin, thanks for the question. And of the individuals that we serve that are not in fully capitated programs, about a third of them are seniors. And so you can think of that as the Medicare population that we serve through a variety of touchpoints in our care delivery assets. And then as you would expect, a subset of those are already in MA plan, which is to your question. And so, we see, again, a great potential to continue to capture and enroll and care for MA patients through OptumCare's delivery capabilities. And you will also see us going deeper in the markets that we are in and bringing our very mature risk-based platform in established markets to new markets where today we are primarily fee-for-service. So expect both geographic growth and increasing depth and penetration in the markets we serve today. Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Justin, good morning. This is John. In terms of the seasonality, so historically we have been at, what I would call, a kind of 48/52 split in terms of first half, second half. I would put that probably more in the zone of first half being in the 52, 53 zone this year. That is really due to how we are tracking in the $1.80 per share impact on it that the majority of that is occurring in the second half of the year. So that would be really the reason for the seasonality looking different this year than it has looked in other years. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. And thanks, Justin, for the questions. I appreciate it. We just have time for two more questions, operator. So let's go to the next one.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your question, please?\nA.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Maybe drill down a little bit on OptumInsight. Obviously, it had a really good margin trend this quarter. I wondered, because I know there was discussion last year during the pandemic that some of the John Muir type of deals were somewhat on hold as it was tough to sell a health system on that, given social distancing and so forth. Since the fact that you don't have investments for those, is that helping you on the margin right now? And are those now basically reopened that you can go out and bid? And maybe another aspect of the OptumInsight story, as you think ahead now to Change Health coming on board, should we assume that there is a pause in selling activity of some sort while you integrate that and position the company to be even stronger and that business to be even stronger? Or I know there's a lot of synergy assumed to be coming online with that? So how should we think about how Change Health coming online affects the trajectory of that business?\nAndrew Witty: Hi A.J., thanks so much for the question. I am going to ask Robert Musslewhite to make some comments in a second around the progression of the margin in the quarter, which obviously we are very, very pleased to see that. And it was due to a ton of hard work on a number of different dimensions that Robert can describe to you. Just on those large contract agreements, like the one we have with John Muir. Yes, there was a bit of disruption last year. But I would say that is absolutely back on stream now in terms of a line of business for us. And we have a very, very exciting pipeline. And that pipeline exists both in the short, medium and longer term. So that's an area you are going to hear more from us on and is absolutely back in full swing. In terms of Change, obviously we are very keen to continue to work through the regulatory process. We expect this to close in the second half as we have previously indicated. And you should not expect any disruption from us bringing Change onboard to really anything that we are doing and especially not in terms of our selling activity. So we absolutely continue to operate OptumInsight fully as if we were not in a transaction. And even post-transaction, I would fully expect the ongoing sales energy of the company to be not disrupted. So nothing. I really would not lead you to expect anything on that front. With that, Robert, would you go into a bit more detail, please, around the evolution of the margin during the last quarter?\nRobert Musslewhite: Sure. And hi A.J. Listen, we are pleased with the quarter. It was a really good quarter on the topline and that of course profitable growth that contributed to margin. But specifically on margin, we also are really seeing the results of a lot of the modernization work we did across 2020. So last year, we undertook a significant review of the business across the operations and drove to find some multiple ways to drive stronger and more efficient performance and help ensure that the investments we are making were invested appropriately against our key growth opportunities. And so if you look at those initiatives, multiple automation initiatives using advanced techniques in AI, MLP, machine learning, it really drove a lot of short-term productivity. But it also drives a situation where we feel like we have made sustainable margin improvements for the longer term. And that puts us in a position to be more competitive. And that actually rolls over to exactly what you are mentioning, being more competitive on the large engagements. And as Andrew said, we feel really optimistic about that pipeline and where it's headed. The disruption was more in timing and not really an interest during the pandemic. In fact, during the pandemic, I think there was growing recognition among our health system relationships that this was a very productive way to work with Optum and a really important need for them as they face some disruption even coming out of the pandemic to their finances in ways that we can sustainably support them in a really holistic way. So we feel like that's a great path forward. We are excited about the business and feel like we have made some important changes that put us on a really good track going forward.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Robert. And A.J., thanks for asking the question. And Insight, I think, is really on the cusp of a very exciting few years, thanks to the significant work that was done last year, the increasing rate of opportunity that we see to bring in new significant contracts and then obviously the pending Change acquisition creates some really exciting momentum for this business. So this is an area I fully anticipate us looking to for material growth going forward. Operator, last question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche. Your question, please.\nGeorge Hill: Hi. Good morning guys. And thanks for squeezing me in at the end. Andrew, I would just be interested to hear your commentary about the outlook for commercial bundles. I know we are all talking a lot about risk-sharing and what I call risk syndication in the Medicare Advantage space and the bundling of risk in the Medicare Advantage space. But I would be interested in the company's outlook for the commercial business and if you are seeing increased uptake of kind of more risk-sharing tools in that market? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Great. So listen, I think in the commercial space and I am going to ask Bill Golden to come in here real quick. But I think in the commercial space, it's just as possible for us to start to design innovative products and we have already begun to do that between Optum and UHC. Let me ask Bill to dive into that in a little bit more detail. Bill?\nBill Golden: Yes. Thank you. And thanks for the question. Yes, I would say, we are in the early stages of provider-aligned products where we are taking advantage of that risk base. As an example, in our Southern California OptumCare partnership, Harmony really continues to be a cornerstone of those offerings. We are learning a lot with that product, not only regarding how it's priced, but more importantly the actual experience for the members. And so we are using that as a cornerstone and as a program to continue to roll out throughout the country with other areas. So we are very optimistic about the opportunities that that will show in the future. But still in the very early stages of our global cap with the commercial business. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Bill. And George, thanks so much for the question. That's clearly an area we expect to see more in the future. But as Bill says, it's early days and we will see how that progresses. With that, everybody, thank you so much for spending the time with us this morning. As we move through what we all hope are the latter stages of this pandemic, you can expect us to continue to focus on the areas where UnitedHealth Group can do the most to improve healthcare, including adding even greater value at the intersection of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, applying our technology and expertise to create a better functioning, more responsive and cost-efficient healthcare system and making healthcare work better for consumers. We look forward to connecting with you again on these priorities in the weeks and months ahead. And once again, thank you for your attention this morning. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentleman, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Dirk McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks Andrew. As Andrew noted, we continue to drive growth by supporting more affordable, simpler, quality care across Optum and United Healthcare. These are themes you have heard us cover before, and we continue to see the benefits of this approach for the people we serve. Let me turn those themes into some specific examples across Optum and UnitedHealthcare that illustrate how our approach is working. First is how we have been simplifying the consumer experience over the past year. We have driven greater engagement with seniors by increasing adoption of digital tools. Monthly active users of our digital offerings have risen double digit with similar increases in online transactions. This has led to greater adoption of our digital therapeutic offerings. In the first quarter, high-risk chronic disease patients in our home monitoring program logged over 1.5 million biometric measurements such as glucose level, enabling 99% medication compliance and an NPS of 84. (Audit End) We have also made it easier for people to get and maintain behavioral health support by expanding traditional and provider network and combined them with modern digital therapeutic services. Behavioral health needs have increased significantly during the pandemic. And as a result, we have seen substantial adoption in our digital behavioral platform that provides on-demand emotional support, logging a rise of over 100% in utilization. Always accompanying our work to simplify healthcare is Optum and UnitedHealthcare's sharp focus on delivering high-quality care. We have talked to you before about the advances we are making to integrate patient specific health data and plan information directly into the physician's workflow. Clinicians can see gaps in care and act to close them during the patient's visit in addition to other steps that facilitate more efficient care and better outcomes. We now support over eight million of these insight-enabled digital interactions each month with rapidly expanding physician adoption. Delivering high-quality care has been central in our response to the COVID pandemic. Our most recent effort to help members access vaccines is a prime example. We launched a vaccine locator tool, helping people find and sign up for a vaccination. And we have made millions of outbound contacts to engage members and help them get the information they need. Lastly, making care more affordable remains central for the people we serve and the health system overall and is essential for increasing access. For instance, through our medication sourcing program, high cost providers now source drugs at a network specialty pharmacy including OptumRx or charge market rates only for the drug. Early work on this has generated substantial savings for our customers. Our work to make health care simpler, higher quality and more affordable drives strong growth for our business. At the end of January, for example, UnitedHealthcare was awarded an Oklahoma SoonerCare Medicaid contract to serve nearly 200,000 people. Oklahoma previously operated under a fee-for-service program. The award affirms the value we bring to state partners and consumers and reflects our commitment to expand access to care for all Americans. We look forward to working with our new partners in Oklahoma and sharing with you on future calls new examples as our work on simplicity, quality and affordability continues to create improvements and new growth opportunities. With that, now I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. Yes. Thanks Wyatt. I think Andrew and Wyatt pretty will drained it. But let me say a couple of things. First, we know that people want to meet with their doctor and we have been focused on facilitating that with OptumCare. And people, basically, as you look at how things evolve, the brick-and-mortar physician, that's the vast majority of the tele business today. I would also say that I do see a tremendous opportunity for new models and new products strategies with OptumCare and others where we lean towards those providers who have again the best outcomes and provide the most efficient care. So like any other doctors in our network, we at UnitedHealthcare going to be looking at that strongly and we think OptumCare can provide that very well. That's it. Thanks Lisa."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Wyatt Decker",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Robert, for the question. And Andrew, I think you set it up nicely. OptumCare has become the nation's preeminent ambulatory delivery of value-based care. It is physician-led and increasingly you will see us bringing comprehensive services to bear to meet the needs of all of our patients with a particular focus on value base and a particular focus on the fully capitated individual. We will continue to grow over 250,000 lives this year, and you can expect that to accelerate in the years to come as we continue to attract individuals through organic growth as well as through our partnership with UHC, and as Andrew mentioned nearly 90 other providers. Thank you. Yes. Well, thanks for the question. And as you heard us mention before, we are very proud of how quickly we stood up over 17,000 providers during the pandemic on telehealth solutions, but that really just is the beginning and of course across the country, we have seen a massive shift in consumer adoption and willingness to engage in virtual health solutions as well as with our providers more broadly. (Audit End) So our philosophy is that, not all telehealth is created equally and as we continue to develop our new products, you will see us integrating physical care, virtual care, home care and behavioral care in a way that is innovative and differentiated. And in fact, we have already launched a product we call Optum Virtual Care that is live in all 50 states and is doing just that. And what will really differentiate our product to those that we serve is the ability to offer virtual solutions but then, if necessary, immediately connect them to a live bricks-and-mortar solution for more complex or thorough care as well as identifying and triaging both physical and behavioral health care needs and offering comprehensive behavioral health care. We are seeing continued sustainability of virtual care solutions which as you may know peaked during the height of the pandemic have declined some but are still probably 10x where they were pre-pandemic and certain conditions or behavior or areas like behavioral health care are now seeing about 50% utilization through virtual services. So we are very excited about where we are going to take this. I will turn it over to Dirk. Yes. Thank you Andrew. Thanks Josh. Great question. We will continue to evolve. And one of the pieces that will differentiate us as comprehensive care providers is just that, being comprehensive. And so you will see us continuing to weave together products and services that meet people's needs in new and innovative ways. And telehealth and digital solutions are a big piece but not the only piece. The other part that I would call out is, we are increasingly leveraging technology to bring advanced decision support to our physicians and providers. And you may have heard previously about OptumCare. This is a value-based care delivery set of decision tools that are yielding real results, giving people the best, highest quality care that eliminates what we tend to call low value care and is a differentiator. So we will continue to deploy those technologies. As you know, we are on track to grow by over 10,000 physicians. We are now at 56,000 doctors, both affiliated, contracted and employed and we will leverage all of those models as we go forward and we continue to evolve and employ doctors who are really actually quite attracted to our model of value-based primary care. We eliminate much of the clerical burden in our physicians in advanced practitioners' practice and let them focus on the work they love. So this is really gaining traction among our physician workforce. And then to your point around how much of the 20 million lives that we serve today will ultimately be capitated, we anticipate that not only will a significant portion, you heard the number two million today and 0.25 million as we mentioned growing. So as we continue to grow, we also expect that we will always offer a host of modalities including fee-for-service. And that actually is a feeder system, as we think about value-based care being kind of the core of what we offer and fully capitated, the core of the core, if you will. Thank you. Yes. Justin, thanks for the question. And of the individuals that we serve that are not in fully capitated programs, about a third of them are seniors. And so you can think of that as the Medicare population that we serve through a variety of touchpoints in our care delivery assets. And then as you would expect, a subset of those are already in MA plan, which is to your question. And so, we see, again, a great potential to continue to capture and enroll and care for MA patients through OptumCare's delivery capabilities. And you will also see us going deeper in the markets that we are in and bringing our very mature risk-based platform in established markets to new markets where today we are primarily fee-for-service. So expect both geographic growth and increasing depth and penetration in the markets we serve today. Thank you."

            "content": "Yes. Thank you. And thanks for the question. Yes, I would say, we are in the early stages of provider-aligned products where we are taking advantage of that risk base. As an example, in our Southern California OptumCare partnership, Harmony really continues to be a cornerstone of those offerings. We are learning a lot with that product, not only regarding how it's priced, but more importantly the actual experience for the members. And so we are using that as a cornerstone and as a program to continue to roll out throughout the country with other areas. So we are very optimistic about the opportunities that that will show in the future. But still in the very early stages of our global cap with the commercial business. Thank you."

And as we had signaled, where we see abatement in services, it's largely offset by the increase in COVID-related costs. And that's tracked as we had expected. When you back out the impact of some suppressed utilization, the underlying factor is associated with medical cost trends largely look like they did. We aren't seeing significant upticks in services in specific areas out of the norm. So I would say, it looks a lot like utilization prior to the COVID implications. And when I think by line of business, I would say, generally tracking a little below baseline in both our government programs, closer to baseline inside our commercial business. But largely in track with what we had expected. And where it's a little out of line again where perhaps infection rates were higher, we saw that naturally offset with greater utilization. So first quarter, I would say, largely as expected."

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "(Audit Start)Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results and positive outlook as we continue to execute on UnitedHealth Group's long-standing mission and strategies. The exceptional dedication of the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare again defined this period. They have adapted swiftly and creatively to demand and rapidly changing circumstances, implemented new ideas, and importantly remain focused on serving people exceptionally well. As a result, adjusted earnings per share were $5.31, reflecting strong execution at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. In light of our strong start to the year, balanced with continued respect for the potential pandemic-related effects we have previously described, we are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.10 to $18.60 per share. I will touch briefly on two highlights among many in the quarter that illustrate the increased momentum our colleagues at UnitedHealth Group are driving. People served with our employer and individual offerings grew nearly 100,000 in the quarter, even within the context of a challenged U.S. employment environment, and this underscores the growing consumer orientation affordability and breadth of our products. OptumInsight revenues increased 14% and operating income increased 45% compared to the year-ago period as more normal activity levels among healthcare system customers returned leading to expansion in how we help them advance clinical and operational excellence. Significant innovation and automation in the OptumInsight businesses drove strong productivity gains. We have the right capabilities, assets, and strategies in place, and we remain restless to innovate, evolve, and further integrate our offerings to serve more people more effectively, both directly and with our many external partners throughout the healthcare environment. To achieve this, we have been sharpening our focus in three key areas. First, delivering even greater value to those we serve throughout the healthcare system by better harnessing the collaborative capabilities of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We believe we can develop new products and services we support people more effectively by bringing to bear greater application and adoption of the combined offerings of these two distinct and complementary organizations. Optum Care's work supporting Medicare Advantage patients illustrates this well and I will speak more to this shortly. The second area of focus, increase in the application of our technology and related resources to improve care for people and the operational health systems. There are benefits for everyone in helping to make the healthcare system work more like an actual system. Improving the natural flow accessibility and use of information is essential to that goal, all within a secure and protected framework. We can help care providers and payers better serve patients by more effectively simplifying key administrative processes and by providing timely access to relevant information. The third focus is making healthcare work better for consumers. We are ambitious to meet the rising expectations of healthcare consumers, and we will continue to improve our offerings included in such critical zones is greatly simplified, intuitive, and satisfying consumer digital experiences and advanced healthcare banking and payments services that enable people to find, price, and pay for care digitally. You will hear more from us about these approaches in the months ahead. But today, I would like to focus on the first, unlocking greater value for customers at the intersection of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, including through our ability to develop new useful service offerings. One of the most effective ways of doing so is through stronger alignment of the high-quality clinical services of Optum Care to address the needs of patients we serve for our nearly 90 health plan customers. A key foundation is increasing the clinical outcome accountability of our Optum Care practices. Of the four million patients who Optum Care serves in some form of accountable arrangement today, two million are being served under a fully capitated arrangement, and this demonstrates the strong growth and progress. But Optum Care serves 20 million patients in total, which is one reason why we view the potential of Optum Care as only beginning to be harnessed. These accountable arrangements drive measurably better patient outcomes and experiences, all at lower cost. For example, seniors served by Optum Care physicians under such arrangements spend on average one-third fewer days in the hospital and have 40% fewer days in skilled nursing facilities than seniors in traditional Medicare. We expect the growth in the number of Optum Care patients served under accountable arrangements to accelerate. A further example of using our combined expertise to advance more beneficial service offerings is the recent opening of a first of its kind Optum integrated care facility in Riverside County, California. While we have long offered and continue to actively develop our senior focused clinics, this new clinic and community center offers a comprehensive range of primary care led services including a pharmacy, all under a single roof; and importantly, it is especially orientated around supporting Medicaid, Medicare, commercial, and individual members of all ages. This comprehensive health center provides improved care access with modern on-site services, including annual wellness visits, chronic disease management support, coordinated care with trusted specialists, and laboratory, imaging and pharmacy services. The adjacent community center includes a full-service gym and meeting rooms for health education. We see Optum and our payer partners as uniquely positioned to be able to offer these types of impactful venues and look forward to learning from the community and expanding these services. To sum up, we continue to organize and apply the unique capabilities of this organization in ways that enable us to execute on the goals we established for 2021 and beyond and to continue to deliver on our 13% to 16% long-term earnings growth objective. Now, I will turn it over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to give more color on initiatives to drive greater performance across the organization. Thanks John. The story you heard about this quarter is the story you have heard for many years and will continue to do so about UnitedHealth Group, a focus on better serving people and organizations in healthcare using the combined capabilities of Optum and UnitedHealthcare to improve care, cost and experience and an unwavering attention to execute for excellence in all that we do. Operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please. Great. Thanks for the query. I am glad you asked that. I know a lot of people probably have that in mind. John, you should answer that, I think. Thanks John. Thanks Matt. Next question, please. Great. Listen, Robert, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask Wyatt Decker to add, you put your finger on a really key part of the growth strategy going forward. Clearly, you are going to see over this year and next year an accelerating move towards more capitated patients within the OptumCare universe. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, there's a tremendous opportunity as we look at those 20 million and growing number of patients who we look after migrating towards what we believe to a better mechanism to help them manage both their care outcome and also the cost implications. So, you will see that continue to accelerate as we expand our OptumCare networks. We are rapidly transitioning our capabilities clinic-by-clinic to be able to do this, and it's one of the areas I think we feel extremely optimistic about future momentum. But to give you a little bit more detail, Dr. Decker, who leads OptumHealth, please? Thanks Wyatt. And thanks Robert, for the question. Next question, please. Hi Lisa. Go ahead. Lisa, that's a great question, I am going to ask in a second Dr. Decker. And also I think will ask Dirk McMahon to make a couple of comments, but let me just preface that. So, we have obviously seen telehealth develop as a set of capabilities over the last several years. We have been a very extensive user of those capabilities, but I think one of the things we have seen from 2020 and the pandemic is really a kind of shift in terms of people's thinking and willingness to utilize telehealth. We also think that the way in which they are being utilized is evolving. And so, what you are going to see from us and it is one of the examples I might cite in terms of the opportunity for new product development between Optum and UnitedHealthcare is, you are going to see UnitedHealth Group lean forward into much more integrated telehealth capabilities. We have got a number of new initiatives in deployment as we speak operating between the two companies. And with that introduction, let me pass it over to Wyatt to maybe give you a little bit more detail on that. And then, I think it would be good to hear from Dirk the perspective he has on this. So, Wyatt first. Thanks Dirk. Thanks Wyatt. I have got to say, Lisa, I have been keeping an eye on the patient verbatims as we have been deploying the Optum Virtual platform that Wyatt referred to and really the feedback is really extraordinary in terms of how patients are seeing this, the benefit they feel from that and the ease with which they are able to engage with it. So this is exactly the kind of thing you are going to see going forward. I think Optum is in an extremely advantaged position being able to bring together this notion of integrated telehealth with physical and behavioral health. And that's going to be the path we go. And I think we are on the verge of kind of next generation of what this looks like versus what we have seen previously. So Lisa, thanks so much for raising the question. And next question, please. Yes. Listen, Kevin, thanks for the question. I am going to ask John in a second to refer to the $1.80, the math I guess behind that and the underlying trends. As far as sequestrations comes in, obviously we are keeping a close eye on the guidance from the administration. We have clearly seen the extensions. But the guidance raise we have given today is not caveated by that in anyway. So we have our assumptions on that but the guidance stands not withstanding any outcome there. John, on the $1.80? Thanks John. And Kevin, thanks so much for asking the question. I mean I think John really summarized it super well. We have raised our expectations for the year based on our experience so far this year and we have retained that $1.80 assumption, if you will, in terms of what could happen. But we obviously don't have the detailed visibility of that yet. But we feel that's the right balanced stance to take in terms of the rest of this year. So I hope that's clear and thanks so much for the question, Kevin. Next question? Josh, thanks for the question. And before I pass it to Wyatt again to respond to the specifics, let me just give you a sense of how we see this play now. And I think the answer to your question is really both. So we absolutely see tremendous opportunity to continue to develop a variety of different clinic types. And if you look at the, I cited one particular example but we have been open in a wide number of different type of clinics depending on the environment over locality that we are operating in. And you should continue to expect to see that degree of customization according to the need of the geography. It's not a one size fits all model, by any means. So you will continue to see that. But at the same time, we strongly believe there is opportunity over the next few years. And this is why I focused in my kind of second there over going deeper around technology. How we can then help those clinics operate more efficiently? How we can ensure they are better connected, both locally with other clinics that we may own or to a high level of information support. So we see this as being a highly activated network of clinics and centers. The center, the network itself will have a high degree of diversity in it because it needs to be responsive to the needs of the locality, the community that we are operating in. And of course, as sensitive to the previous comments, it will have a very significant telehealth capability deployed alongside it. But Wyatt, maybe you could talk a little bit to how you see the progression within the 20 million? Thanks Wyatt. And maybe I will just ask Dan Schumacher to briefly add to the comments and talk a little bit about Optum At-Home which is a further dimension of this. So go ahead. So Josh, I mean I know that was a little bit of a long answer from the three of us, but you asked a really important question. And this is really one of the core elements of the future of the company. And it's why you have heard us talk so much about OptumHealth, OptumCare and you can see the growth potential. We are at that two million life level now. We clearly see the capitation strategy as a highly effective strategy to deliver both quality and cost management for patients. That movement is really significant and it's really moving strongly. And with the development of the diverse sets of clinics and skills, the development of the technology support that you have just heard refer to, we believe we are in a very strong position to be able to be the leader in ability to manage those patients in the best possible way and ensure that they get the kind of health care they deserve. So Josh, thanks so much for asking the question. Next question, please. So great question, Ricky. I am going to ask Brian Thompson, who has recently been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare, to respond to that. So, BT? John, do you want to add? Thanks John. And thanks, Ricky, for the question. Next question, please. Right. It's a great question. So I think our bias is increasingly and I think rightly toward driving a more and more seamless, simple, easy to access care environment, both for the patient and the provider actually. So what that speaks to is, trying to avoid the fragmentation of the interface and definitely trying to avoid the fragmentation of the information that then sits behind it. So we want to really try and create much more seamless opportunity. So for example, I would give you a real example in Optum Virtual which is, you have heard a little bit on the call already today. So of course, patients are looking for a way to engage with the physician. They actually want to talk to their physician. So one of the things that we are doing is building that platform. But then there might be situations where the physician wants to bring in a specialist into that conversation. Now in a multi-disciplinary clinic, they might be in a position in normal times to go down the hall, get somebody to come down and visit. Now in Optum Virtual, they are able to do that kind of thing. So that's an example of trying to bring that integration, even within the virtual space. So it kind of replicates a little bit more what you might expect in a physical environment. And so, we definitely see the need to try and drive toward that. And we definitely want to try and create the fluidity of the information to ensure that physicians have what they need when they are in front of the patient, when they are talking to the patient so they can make the best possible choices. So we want them to be as highly educated as possible in that context. So we are leaning very much towards the idea of integrated seamless and that's true whether you are in the physical or the virtual space and we want the two to sit together. Thanks for the question. Next question. Thank you. Hi Justin. Thanks so much for the questions. I am going to ask in a second, John to talk to the earning seasonality and for Wyatt to address the degree to the population we have within the MA plan. Let me just touch on the health assessment. You heard in the prepared comments the very strong performance of the HouseCalls program, actually higher than last year, record quarter actually in terms of performance at HouseCalls. And you are quite right, that makes us feel pretty optimistic that that headwind that we saw is going to dissipate pretty rapidly as we rotate into 2022. And that gives us kind of a rise in optimism that much of that kind of the negative headwind that characterizes the emergence of the pandemic starts to mitigate at least on that dimension. Obviously, we don't know what's going to happen in the next few months with this disease. But as we sit here today, that would be the right kind of expectation to look at. Let me go to Wyatt first. And then John, if you pick up from Wyatt on the seasonality. So, Wyatt? Thanks John. And thanks, Justin, for the questions. I appreciate it. We just have time for two more questions, operator. So let's go to the next one. Hi A.J., thanks so much for the question. I am going to ask Robert Musslewhite to make some comments in a second around the progression of the margin in the quarter, which obviously we are very, very pleased to see that. And it was due to a ton of hard work on a number of different dimensions that Robert can describe to you. Just on those large contract agreements, like the one we have with John Muir. Yes, there was a bit of disruption last year. But I would say that is absolutely back on stream now in terms of a line of business for us. And we have a very, very exciting pipeline. And that pipeline exists both in the short, medium and longer term. So that's an area you are going to hear more from us on and is absolutely back in full swing. In terms of Change, obviously we are very keen to continue to work through the regulatory process. We expect this to close in the second half as we have previously indicated. And you should not expect any disruption from us bringing Change onboard to really anything that we are doing and especially not in terms of our selling activity. So we absolutely continue to operate OptumInsight fully as if we were not in a transaction. And even post-transaction, I would fully expect the ongoing sales energy of the company to be not disrupted. So nothing. I really would not lead you to expect anything on that front. With that, Robert, would you go into a bit more detail, please, around the evolution of the margin during the last quarter? Thanks Robert. And A.J., thanks for asking the question. And Insight, I think, is really on the cusp of a very exciting few years, thanks to the significant work that was done last year, the increasing rate of opportunity that we see to bring in new significant contracts and then obviously the pending Change acquisition creates some really exciting momentum for this business. So this is an area I fully anticipate us looking to for material growth going forward. Operator, last question, please? Yes. Great. So listen, I think in the commercial space and I am going to ask Bill Golden to come in here real quick. But I think in the commercial space, it's just as possible for us to start to design innovative products and we have already begun to do that between Optum and UHC. Let me ask Bill to dive into that in a little bit more detail. Bill? Thanks Bill. And George, thanks so much for the question. That's clearly an area we expect to see more in the future. But as Bill says, it's early days and we will see how that progresses. With that, everybody, thank you so much for spending the time with us this morning. As we move through what we all hope are the latter stages of this pandemic, you can expect us to continue to focus on the areas where UnitedHealth Group can do the most to improve healthcare, including adding even greater value at the intersection of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, applying our technology and expertise to create a better functioning, more responsive and cost-efficient healthcare system and making healthcare work better for consumers. We look forward to connecting with you again on these priorities in the weeks and months ahead. And once again, thank you for your attention this morning. Bye, bye."

            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you Dirk. Before I review the performance of our businesses, as in recent quarters I would like to provide an update on the care patterns we are seeing as the pandemic continues to evolve. Over the course of the first quarter, total care activity including COVID-19 related care ran marginally below seasonal baseline. Pacing of elective care activity through the quarter generally track and in opposite directions with the rise and decline of COVID incidence rates which were much higher in the early part of the quarter than in the latter part. To put this in perspective, February and March showed COVID-related care at about half the level experienced in January. Since the quarter's end, we have again began to see a rise in COVID-related care while at this time not approaching the January level. Outpatient care activity was moderately below seasonal baseline for the full quarter, running in counterpoint to the COVID incidence patterns over the three months and reflecting a well below average influenza and respiratory illness season. And total inpatient activity was modestly above seasonal baseline with over 55,000 COVID-19 related admissions during the quarter compared to 65,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Moving to business unit performance. OptumHealth's first quarter revenue and earnings increased 35% year-over-year. Revenue per consumer served grew 31% over the year ago quarter. The growth in this metric continues to reflect the expanding number of people served under value-based care arrangements and the increasing acuity of the care services we offer. OptumInsight's revenue grew 14% in the quarter and earnings 45%, due to growth in our services and technology offerings and improved productivity. The revenue backlog at $20.8 billion grew $1.6 billion over the first quarter 2020, as more normalized business activity started to return among our provider and payer customers. OptumRx revenue and earnings were relatively consistent year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Adjusted scripts declined modestly from the year ago quarter, a period during which we provided advanced medications to the people we serve as the pandemic began. Pharmacy care and specialty services continue to grow strongly, in particular home infusion and our community behavioral health pharmacies. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. First quarter operating result reflected strong execution and continued membership growth. In addition to the growth in commercial and Medicare Advantage offerings noted earlier, people served in managed Medicaid programs grew by nearly 1.1 million over the year ago quarter. Of the 900,000 new seniors we expect to serve within Medicare Advantage this year, about 775,000 are in individual and group and 125,000 in dual special needs offering. Of importance to this, senior customers we serve, our HouseCalls clinicians have been considerably more able compared to this time last year to provide their vital services. We conducted nearly 600,000 home visits in the quarter as more seniors and care givers were vaccinated and comfortable having in-person visits. That's up by a third compared to first quarter 2020 and about four times higher than what was achieved in the second quarter 2020. Our liquidity and capital positions remained strong, with first quarter cash flows from operations at $6 billion or 1.2 times net income. As we look forward towards the combination with Change Healthcare, we intend to maintain our longstanding capital policies. These include our approach to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and an advancing dividend with ample capacity to continue building upon our strategic growth platform. We now expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18.10 to $18.60, an increase of $0.35 from the outlook we offered at our Investor Conference. This outlook continues to include an estimated $1.80 per share of unfavorable COVID-19 related effects, the substantial majority of which we still expect to occur in the latter part of the year, largely as care is more freely able to be delivered to people. Now I will turn it back to Andrew. Sure. Matt, good morning. It's John Rex. Let me give a little color on that. So, yes, prior development, $1 billion favorable versus $850 million in the 4Q. As I am sure you would expect, that emanates heavily from the second half of 2020 and a lot from the fourth quarter. It was favorable really across the businesses. The elements there that would be driving that would be largely along care deferral activity that would have occurred in the quarter. I think when you think about impacts to the company and P&L impact, certainly there are significant mitigating factors that I know you are well aware, MLR rebates, risk order arrangements, reserve reestablishment that occurs. When I look at it and take it all together with those mitigating factors, P&L impact would have been in a similar zone to last year's first quarter with those elements coming in. Thank you. Yes. Kevin, it's John Rex. Good morning. Let me talk a little bit about that and how we think about that progressing throughout the course of the year. So a few impacts here. I think the first, the important impact, I suggested that if a significant majority, I would call it, 70% of our projected COVID impact is really occurs in the second half of the year. And just to be frank, we just don't know enough now about what is going to happen later in the year to kind of have a very meaningfully different projection of what our full year results will be in terms of, will it be better in terms of better than the original projections, except for what we have experienced thus far which we expected some stronger underlying business performance growth across the number of businesses. We have executed well on productivity measures. And maybe just very modestly less impact in the 1Q unfavorable impact than we would have anticipated. But the important component there being that is really much more a back half weighted view in terms of COVID-19 impact. That's really premised upon our expectation that as we get later in the year, people are going to be more able to access previously deferred care and at higher acuity levels as a result of missed or postponed treatments. And that's what we have build into that view in terms of an expectation. But that's really unusual time still, no question. And we have therefore increased our full year estimate by what we know today. Yes. Ricky, good morning. It's John Rex here. So as Brian noted, one of the aspects we look for is this rising acuity from patients that have deferred care or missed treatments. And at this point, we don't have evidence of that occurring. And it could be just that it's still too early on to have enough evidence to see it. But we have not yet seen that rising acuity in the populations that we serve. Your point in terms of how we think about as we get later into the year and why that moves like it does and you heard my commentary that a significant majority of the $1.80 we have layered into the second half of the year. That is largely because of the assumptions around those elements that we see that people are increasingly able to get the care they need, the amount of care deferrals declined meaningfully as you get into that latter part of the year. They are accessing the system. And we do get into these elements where we see rising acuity coming in. So those are the elements that are premised in terms of that expectation at this point. But really and the other element that Brian touched on also just in terms of your populations, you have commercial, a little more access to the system versus the public program members. Thank you. Justin, good morning. This is John. In terms of the seasonality, so historically we have been at, what I would call, a kind of 48/52 split in terms of first half, second half. I would put that probably more in the zone of first half being in the 52, 53 zone this year. That is really due to how we are tracking in the $1.80 per share impact on it that the majority of that is occurring in the second half of the year. So that would be really the reason for the seasonality looking different this year than it has looked in other years. Thanks."

            "content": "Sure. And hi A.J. Listen, we are pleased with the quarter. It was a really good quarter on the topline and that of course profitable growth that contributed to margin. But specifically on margin, we also are really seeing the results of a lot of the modernization work we did across 2020. So last year, we undertook a significant review of the business across the operations and drove to find some multiple ways to drive stronger and more efficient performance and help ensure that the investments we are making were invested appropriately against our key growth opportunities. And so if you look at those initiatives, multiple automation initiatives using advanced techniques in AI, MLP, machine learning, it really drove a lot of short-term productivity. But it also drives a situation where we feel like we have made sustainable margin improvements for the longer term. And that puts us in a position to be more competitive. And that actually rolls over to exactly what you are mentioning, being more competitive on the large engagements. And as Andrew said, we feel really optimistic about that pipeline and where it's headed. The disruption was more in timing and not really an interest during the pandemic. In fact, during the pandemic, I think there was growing recognition among our health system relationships that this was a very productive way to work with Optum and a really important need for them as they face some disruption even coming out of the pandemic to their finances in ways that we can sustainably support them in a really holistic way. So we feel like that's a great path forward. We are excited about the business and feel like we have made some important changes that put us on a really good track going forward."

To the question around sort of center-based, tech-based, data-enabled and different versions of that that Wyatt was talking about, Optum At-Home is a great example of a collaboration between UnitedHealthcare and Optum that's in relatively early stages. But we focused on Medicare Advantage members that are in dual special needs plans initially. And that's a full risk offering and we are doing it in markets where we don't currently have local OptumCare practices. So what we are doing in the program is really both providing care but also arranging and coordinating care. So we are trying to address medical, behavioral and social needs and the results initially have been great. We have improved access for people with more than 80% having in-home visit and more than half of them getting connected back into office-based care, social services referrals and so forth as well as great health quality and outcome. So today we have got a little under 100,000 lives across six markets. We are looking to expand that across the Medicare Advantage Dual SNP but also into the individual MA we are doing with UnitedHealthcare and ultimately look to do that with other health plans. So another growth vector for us as we look at building out our value-based orientation."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial & Earnings Reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.  Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 13, 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Over the course of the past year, the extraordinary and dedicated people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered strong, well-balanced growth, progress in developing our consumer-orientated capabilities and strengthened the many ways in which we deliver value-based care in multiple settings. Each of the five growth pillars we discussed with you at our November investor conference are powerful sources of opportunities on their own within large and expanding addressable markets. Yet what really unlocks the potential value we can provide to those we serve is the connectivity of capabilities across our enterprise. For example, this year, we expect 4 million people will participate in fully accountable value-based care provided by Optum Health, almost 1.8 million more than we served as we entered 2022. We're achieving this by connecting benefits, care and other services to support our patients. Many of these patients will have a Medicare Advantage plan offered by UnitedHealthcare, or one of the many other payers who are accessing Optum's expertise and capabilities in delivering this kind of comprehensive care. We will serve these patients in clinic settings, in their homes, integrating behavioral care, supported by our data-driven clinical incidents and next best actions, and all coordinated to provide the right care when and where they need it. Pharmacy is another area in which we are more deeply connecting consumers with our services. We engage 1 million people every day, finding the lowest cost options, managing their specialty drugs, offering vital in-person clinical advice at our community pharmacies, providing complex medication treatments right in their homes, or simplifying access through digital solutions in order to make the process uneventful for them. We believe this connectivity is a path to better outcomes for people and lower costs. It's also driving growth. By the end of 2023, we expect to have more than 750 community pharmacies, nearly 200 more than we had at the beginning of 2020. We continue to see the impact these services have at a very local and personal level, helping providers deliver more complete care and better outcomes, including medication adherence rates, which are about 90% compared to the 50% U.S. average. Our pharmacists are able to take the time to get to know their patients' treatment plans and support their medication management, collaborating with other care providers. We're guided in pharmacy by the principle of getting to the lowest cost for patients and clients. A good example, as more biosimilars come to market, we're positioned to offer patients their care providers and payers significantly more choices in how to secure the best prices for the therapies they need. In addition to biosimilars, we're driving affordability and prescription benefits by combining formulary and cash market pricing to ensure consumers will always get the best economics. Our life-saving drugs program has made very significant progress since our announcements last year. This program offers zero dollar out-of-pocket cost to consumers for drugs such as insulin and epinephrine. Our goal has been to make this available throughout the U.S. And as of today, we've been approved in 48 states for our fully insured business. Moreover, 1/4 of our self-funded employers have now chosen to add this offering for their employees, and we expect that number to rise. Getting to this point in such a short period of time was only possible through the work not just of our teams, but of state officials and others in the broader healthcare community and we're grateful for their support.  Looking to the year ahead, let me focus you on a couple of themes you can expect to hear from us. One is continued scaling of our commitment to American consumers. You should and will have -- who should and will have an increasing influence over their care experience. Through our core innovations, product design, enhanced digital offerings and partnerships such as RVO Health and Walmart, you will see us driving this more broadly across the enterprise, becoming closer to the consumer, helping simplify their experiences and empowering their decision-making with greater transparency, speed, convenience and support. You will also hear how we are amplifying our technology capabilities.  2023 will see the emergence of an enhanced OptumInsight, bringing to life the opportunities that the legacy organizations from Optum and change creates, an acceleration of how technology can be used to healthcare providers and ultimately patients within the overall health system.  We start this year well prepared to deliver upon the objectives we shared with you in late November, and with a deep sense of responsibility to do so on behalf of the people we are privileged to serve. With that, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. While the calendar shows we are two weeks into the New Year, our team's 2023 started many months ago; and in some cases, years ago. We have been laying the groundwork necessary to execute on our growth strategy and sustain our momentum heading into this year and beyond. To give you a sense of how this develops, I'll step through some of the work that has been longue dur\u00e9e to ready our organization to serve even more patients and customers in this new year and provide greater value for consumers across a broad range of initiatives. Take the many new patients we will serve under value-based care arrangements in 2023, deepening our presence in existing areas and adding new regions. Our team's preparations are extensive. That's because the transition to fully accountable care is not simply a matter of downloading a new app. The preparations include significant investments in clinical training, technology, network coordination and other activities to make certain we are ready to serve. These critical investments help us support both our current year needs and establish foundations for the growth into 2024 and beyond. Our ability to serve people effectively has expanded beyond the four-walls of the clinic with the rapid development of our in-home clinical capabilities. These services complement our clinic-based and digital offerings and bring high-quality care access to some of the most challenged and often underserved patients in this country. For instance, for value-based patients, our in-home services have reduced hospital visits by 15% versus fee-for-service, delivering comparable health outcomes and achieving an NPS of approximately 80.  Within health benefits, you've heard us discuss how our innovation in commercial products is adding new growth opportunities. One of those is Surest, a unique solution to employers and employees who are looking for first dollar coverage and high transparency into quality and cost. The momentum behind Surest is strong and building. Just two years ago, one in 25 national accounts offered Surest as an option to more traditional plans. Thus far in 2023, it is one in nine, and we expect it will continue to rise. Our offerings for seniors are another area in which we plan, invest and build capabilities to provide new and valuable offerings for an extended period. For example, we continue to expand the range of clinical services we provide via our HouseCalls initiative. In 2023, we will increase the types of vaccinations offered, expand testing services and deploy even more real-time resources to address social determinants of health. Seniors place high value on being able to get care in their home. It comes with an NPS of 75 and is helping to drive improving retention levels as we head into 2023. In addition, our advocacy service solutions help members achieve better health. Our solutions led to a 42% increase in closing gaps in care, up to 15% lower ER visits and an over 10% increase in clinical program enrollment compared to customers who utilize standard offerings. Turning to health technology, let me offer a few early observations on our progress and long-term growth opportunities we see in this area. With the completed change healthcare combination, we are accelerating our investments to bring this vision of a more intelligent and simpler health system to market as rapidly as possible. We will continue to innovate in and deliver the software, data analytics, technology-enabled services, revenue cycle management and advisory services our customers expect. And we are executing on the synergies of this combination with most of the financial benefit coming from complementary growth. OptumInsight is uniquely positioned to offer integrated, end-to-end technology analytics and services across the entire healthcare value chain. Along these lines, we recently reached two new comprehensive health system partnerships, with Northern Light Health in Maine and with Owensboro Health in Kentucky. The services we provide typically feature a full breadth of our advanced solutions, including information technology, revenue cycle management, analytics and supply chain tools. The key here is that our comprehensive technology solutions are resonating in the market, and we expect to see increasing momentum across all of OptumInsight as we invest in and finalize our integration activities. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. The investments and innovations Andrew and Dirk described and that we shared with you in November, speak to a company that has tremendous growth potential as we head into '23 and well beyond. The opportunities to serve people more deeply are tangible and accelerating, building upon a foundation of strong growth in recent years, including our 2022 performance. Revenue in '22 of $324 billion grew by more than $36 billion or 13% over the prior year, with well-balanced double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.34 grew 19% and brought full year adjusted earnings per share to $22.19, growth of 17%. Our capital capacities remain strong. Cash flow from operations in '22 was $26.2 billion or 1.3x net income. We returned $13 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, and deployed over $20 billion in growth capital to expand our capabilities for years to come. Turning to the performance of our businesses. OptumHealth's revenues grew by 32% in '22 to $71 billion as we expanded the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements by about 1 million. Revenue per consumer grew by 29%, driven by the increase in value-based care patients and in the levels of care we are able to offer. Consistent with our comments in November, OptumHealth is off to a strong start in '23 and will organically grow to serve an additional 750,000 value-based patients this year. OptumInsights revenues grew 20% to $14.6 billion in '22. We concluded the year with a revenue backlog of $30 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion over last year. As Dirk noted, we are advancing our investments to more rapidly unlock the positive impact OptumInsight can have for care providers and patients. We expect to make a significant portion of these important investments in the first half of the year. Optum Rx revenues grew 9%, approaching $100 billion for the year, driven by continued strong sales and the expansion of our pharmacy services businesses. Both customer retention and new customer wins were among the highest Optum Rx has ever delivered, laying a strong foundation for continued market-leading growth. At UnitedHealthcare, full year revenues of nearly $250 billion grew 12%. Our strong 2023 Medicare Advantage member outlook is consistent with the objectives we shared with you in November. We expect to serve up to 900,000 more people in '23 across our individual, group and dual special needs offerings, our 8th consecutive year of above-market growth. This consistent performance underscores the product innovation, benefit stability and high-value seniors have come to rely on from us. Our Medicaid growth outlook for '23 incorporates an expectation that states will resume eligibility redeterminations early in the second quarter. Our objective is to ensure that people will have continuous access to benefits. And when all redetermination activities are eventually completed, we expect to serve even more people than we do today across our state-based commercial and exchange-based offerings. Within our commercial offerings, we expect to serve about 1 million additional people in 2023.  Our new and innovative products continue to gain momentum with employers and their employees, which will lead to increasing growth in this market over the next several years.  In sum, while this year is just getting started, the early performance we are seeing across our businesses further validates our confidence in the 2023 growth and performance objectives we shared with you just six weeks ago. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. As we head into 2023, we're determined to build upon the momentum we've just described this morning, further advancing our mission and delivering sustainable earnings growth of 13% to 16% over the long term. And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice : The company seems to be taking a lot of momentum across the board into '23. I wonder when you step back and look at the swing factors that say would push the company towards the higher end of the range that you've offered in EPS or towards the lower end, what are some of the biggest swing factors in your mind, potential positives or challenges?\nAndrew Witty : A.J., thanks so much, and Happy New Year to you as well. I appreciate the question. Yes. So first off, we do feel that we're bringing a ton of momentum into 2023. We feel across the board last year, very strong performances. Most of our businesses closed out the year actually a little ahead of where we were anticipating even when we were at the investor conference. So strong from that perspective. As we look into this year, I think real standout for me maybe call out just two or three points. One is just the membership roles and just the scale of growth in our membership. If you look at UHC performance during '22, you heard us talk about that just now, we're anticipating, frankly, another 1 million plus. I wouldn't be at all surprised if we didn't exceed '22 numbers by the time we get to the end of '23. That is a huge plus and signals a tremendous amount of engagement from the marketplace in our product set across all lines of business, whether that's in the government books of business in the MA platform, our determination to make sure that we look after folks in Medicaid as they go through redetermination cycles and, of course, in our commercial books where you've seen tremendously strong growth. So that's really an area which I think is building for us a lot of confidence as we go forward. And then you go across to Optum, and let me just call out record selling seasons coming through from our Optum Rx platform. That's building a tremendous amount of pipeline growth for us within our business over the next several years. OptumHealth, of course, really rapid growth of value-based fully capitated lives. You'll see by the end of '23, we'll be looking after -- well, more than double the number of folks we were looking after at the end of '21. That's an extraordinary expansion, and we expect that to continue to grow hard. OptumInsight, this year will be an emergence of a new OptumInsight. That's a business where we know we can do better. We've known that for a long time. We've been itching to get going on the integration of change and OptumInsight, which we've now been able to do. We really leaned into that in the fourth quarter. You'll see that flow through very rapidly in the first couple of quarters of this year. That's going to give us a whole new cycle of product innovation. We expect that to be a big source of lift as we go forward, backed up by an increasing momentum of being able to sign up these very large health system partnerships. You've seen us do two since the investor conference in November in addition to the ones we already have. I remind you, these are very large scale, very sticky, multiyear relationships, really substantial sources of energy for the organization. So that really drives all of our momentum. I think where we land in the ranges we've given you is all about our ability to execute and making sure that our organization is focused on every single day, making sure we get every transaction right. We look after every patient in the right way. We make sure that we're looking after every consumer approach that we received in the right way. And so execution is going to be what determines where we come out. The raw material in terms of the momentum for the company is just extraordinary as we look into 2023.  A.J., I appreciate the question. And maybe next question, operator, please?\nOperator: Yes. The next question is from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill : Great. I was wondering if maybe you could just comment on the RADV expectations for February 1. We just had our conference this week, and there was a lot of talk about this and just what managed care is generally expecting out of that ruling?\nAndrew Witty : Lisa, thanks very much for the question. Yes. I mean, we're not going to get into a ton of speculation because obviously, it's very, very potentially imminent. And so not sure there's tons of value there. But I would like to ask Tim Noel looks after our M&R business to maybe share some of his perspective on that. Tim?\nTim Noel: Great. Thanks for the question, Lisa. We talked about this a bit at the investor conference and don't have a lot of new information to share this morning, but let me revisit a couple of the key elements that we discussed a couple of weeks ago. So first, risk adjustment is really critical to providing broad and equitable access inside the Medicare Advantage program. Also a really important part of ensuring there's no disincentives for caring for the most vulnerable. We also continue to remain very supportive of additional transparency. And here, that takes the form of more timely and consistent reviews. And a few of the key elements that we're thinking about with respect to these audits is it's very important for CMS to include a fee-for-service adjuster to make sure that we're comparing original Medicare and Medicare Advantage on the same basis. And also, very important that we don't conduct these audits decades in arrears. That comes with some challenges, of course. That said, without the final rule set, as Andrew alluded to, hard to get really narrow and specific, but we feel really good about how our results validated. Some of our sample sets were above, some of our sample sets were below. But likely more specifics to discuss at next quarter's call. Thanks, Lisa.\nAndrew Witty : Tim, thanks so much. And Lisa, thanks for the question. I mean I think as you just, again, just maybe step up a little bit in the broader position, obviously the whole MA program is unbelievably successful and popular program for seniors across the U.S. And of course, the biggest proof of that is the number of folks who every single year volunteer to sign up to be part of this program. And we're seeing another record year of enrollment coming through as we speak. It's super important that any changes, whether it's in this particular circumstance or any other circumstance, it's super important that folks are thoughtful about collateral consequences, making sure that what is really impressive program in terms of quality of care, reassurance provided to seniors, ability to deliver good value for the senior, good value for society, making sure that any changes are made thoughtfully and holistically is what we would be hoping to see. And obviously, we look forward to working with the administration when and if any further updates come forth.  With that, Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And let\u2019s go to next question, operator.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin : I was wondering if you could speak to the progression of earnings when you add physicians or large physician groups in OptumCare and how that changes over time. I'm specifically looking for sort of margin ranges as you first get started in the first year. When you break even, how long that takes? And then how long it takes to get to the ultimate margins? And I'm curious if the scale that you've got now, half of this book is new in the last three years, does scale accelerate some of that opportunity?\nAndrew Witty : Josh, listen, thanks so much for the question. It's a really -- that's a big question. Let me just give a few thoughts toward that. So one of the key capabilities you need to be in value-based care at scale is patients. Patients because it takes three or five years of getting to know medical practices before they become part of our network and as we go through our expansion. Patient then in terms of how you go through the process of building the capabilities and skills within the clinical practices to move from fee-for-service to value-based care. And of course, that patient size is reflected in how long it takes to go through this from an economic and financial perspective. And that's why as we see this rapid development now, it's kind of -- OptumCare, value-based care is kind of an overnight success that took 15 years to build. And that's -- it's really a truth. And we're seeing that scale now come to life and all credit to the teams who are doing that. In terms of what helps here, I think it's really building a muscle within your organization to continuously test, learn, correct, test, learn, correct in terms of how we work. This is a very -- so very -- it's a somewhat delicate system because what you're dealing with, obviously, highly professional clinical decision makers on the front line who are absolutely, ultimately responsible for every decision they make in front of every patient. But you're also trying to make sure they have the right information to be able to learn from the whole system, the information we know about those folks and what's likely to happen, what could happen, what might be the best practice. And how can we get the whole of the system to operate at a higher level. Those sorts of pieces of progress, those areas where we relentlessly invested, give us opportunities to improve the clinical care. If we can improve the clinical care, the economics follow. So within this whole model, getting the clinical care right, getting people in the right facilities, making sure people don't spend too long in care facilities when it's unnecessary, making sure that illness is delayed, deferred because they're treated well that prevention is the priority, that's what drives all of the economics. What we're seeing, Josh, is that over the last three or four years, we are indeed being able to bring our more recent cohorts to a better economic position more quickly. That's allowing us then to continue to invest more aggressively in bringing new patients into the system. And that -- it's really that mechanism, which you're seeing come to life at the moment. Hopefully, that helps a little bit. And next question please.\nOperator: We'll take the next question from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake : Wanted to touch on cost trend. MLR was in line with your expectations for the quarter. But wanted to hear -- there's been questions about the impact of respiratory in the quarter. There's even been some discussion around a pickup in just overall utilization in December. So would love some comments on those to it, maybe just a little on how trend looked between the different businesses, commercial, Medicare and Medicaid?\nAndrew Witty : Yes. Justin, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Brian Thompson to respond to that, please.\nBrian Thompson : Yes. Thanks, Justin, for that question. Throughout the pandemic, we've been making these references to baselines, et cetera. I think, now being three years into this pandemic, I'd like to just ground an anchor more to our expectations as COVID has waned. And what I'm most encouraged by is that the fourth quarter played out as we had expected. And what we had set out inside our pricing trends are lining up really nicely as we look forward to 2023. To your comments around the flu, as I had suggested at our investor conference, we certainly saw that spike. We have now seen that start to wane for, I think, five consecutive weeks here as we're moving forward. So to put it out like we had expected, really not a meaningful impact as I'm looking forward versus what we've planned for. So what I'm most encouraged by is we're sort of out of that zone of the unknowns around comparing to baselines, et cetera, and really managing a book of business with greater predictability back to sort of the expectations that we had well pre-pandemic and encouraged about how all of those elements, including flu, are lining up as we look forward. Thanks, Justin.\nAndrew Witty : Thanks so much, Brian. And Justin, thanks for the question. Next question please?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes : Yes. Could you talk a little bit about the employer segment? And what I'm interested in is what was pricing like in 2023? If you think of the 6% commercial trend that used to be your pre-pandemic sort of levels, what was that like? And for those employer customers, how are they kind of waiting the need to get employees in the war for talent versus focus on maybe higher premium costs and how they're trying to control that?\nAndrew Witty : Lance, thanks so much. Let me ask Brian to kick off on that.\nBrian Thompson : Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll hand it off to Dan Kueter. I'll start with the conversation around trend. As you well know, we used to share trend information back in the day, and stopped doing so simply because it became less instructive as we were pacing through this COVID environment. What I can share, and I think once we get to this zone of consistency, we'll return to those metrics, we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing on the utilization front. I think we are seeing some durable shifts. We've seen it with respect to ER moving into urgent and in-patient to outpatient. But on the flip side, as we all know, in these labor markets, we're seeing stronger unit costs. And as we all know, unit costs still comprise the majority of the overall trend. And as I had suggested earlier in the year, we did have a higher trend planning for 2023 than 2022. But in reality, that was really a function of the first half of 2022. And again, I want to give that thought and belief that we are largely back to normal levels. And I think once we pace through 2023, we'll get to that zone where we can share those pricing trends. So with that, maybe a little bit more on the competitive dynamic, Dan.\nDan Kueter: Yes. Thanks, Brian, and thanks for the question, Lance. The competitive dynamics in the commercial market remain the same as they've been, always competitive. We continue to price to our forward trend, and we have continued to do that. As Brian indicated, there has been some modifications to that, but all within the range of what we've expected and all within the range of how we've priced. So we don't see any material deviations at all from what we've expected in our plan, so.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Dan. Thanks, Lance. Next question?\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley : In OptumHealth as you have added or about to add behavioral and home, more substantial home care opportunities and have talked about those in the context of value-based care. I'm wondering what influence those have on the trajectory of revenue per member served? That's already rising at a pretty rapid clip due to the full cap that you're transitioning lives into. So the home and behavioral adds to that.\nAndrew Witty : Yes. So I'm going to ask Dr. Wyatt Decker to make a couple of comments in a second on that. But maybe just before he does, and I think we don't particularly break out what's driving the elements of that kind of consumer served number. But you can imagine that the move to value-based care is a big driver of that. Now one of the pieces within the home platform, just to pick out one of the two areas you called out, David, is, of course, within there, you have a substantial amount of D-SNP population, right? So that particular part of the business helps us do a much better job of looking -- giving a much better end-to-end wraparound care for complex folks often found in the D-SNP population. And of course, they represent a different type of revenue profile compared to more of a community patient. So I just make that point. So within the home piece, it kind of a derivative phenomenon that home creates a capability, which allows us to serve D-SNP folks better. That, of course, is going to be an accelerator to the metric you were focused on. And maybe ask Wyatt to go a little deeper though, around how you're bringing behavioral along as well as home please?\nWyatt Decker : Yes. Well, thank you, David, for the question. And it's very timely. We view home health as one of the new frontiers of providing value-based healthcare because of the convenience it provides and the ability to access people, like dual special needs patients that often have very difficulty leaving their home to get care. So you will see us both developing if you will, the platform of home care increasingly in a comprehensive fashion, as well as integrating home care with our clinic-based care model. So it really creates two growth vehicles for us, if that makes sense. And similarly, with behavioral, as we've seen during the pandemic, the need for behavioral care is immense in the U.S. market. And our ability to embed behavioral healthcare services within our primary care and value-based care offerings has been differentiated and will continue to grow, as well as our utilization of virtual behavioral care solutions in both the home and clinic environments. And so we're pretty excited about how this is coming together, and we're creating a differentiated offering that helps accelerate value-based care growth and provide that comprehensive care that people made.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Wyatt. Next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor : Just looking for a couple of numbers. One, just going back to respiratory. Our recollection was maybe 4Q for you guys was about 30 basis points of MLR from respiratory. I know Brian said not meaningfully higher. So I'm assuming that means there is another 15 bps or 20 bps or something from respiratory this quarter. And then just secondly, on the investment gain, about $400 million above The Street, about a couple of hundred million above the '23 guidance run rate. So just wondering, was there a realized gain in that quarter that's kind of above recurring or how we should think about that number?\nAndrew Witty : Thanks so much, Gary. Let me ask John Rex to respond.\nJohn Rex : Gary, good morning. I will go back in order here. So just in terms of -- it\u2019d be very similar with Brian Thompson's commentary in terms of what we were seeing in the quarter and I think forward. So those -- that incidence was modestly elevated in the 4Q, but I'd call it modestly elevated, but very much in line with what we would have expected -- and when we were in front of you back at the end of November in terms of flu and respiratory. Let's put those two together in terms of just combining that whole view. So elevated, when you take it into materiality in terms of the $50 billion of medical costs in the quarter, I wouldn't call it immensely material, though, in that element, but very consistent. In terms of investment income, probably wouldn't be very similar to what we reported 4Q a year ago in terms of the absolute level of investment income in there. I wouldn't -- just kind of like last year, probably wouldn't use that as my run rate stepping out into next year though. So we're still comfortable with how we established and guided for 2023 from that perspective also. So very consistent with that 4Q of last year, too.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. And thank you, Gary. Next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel : Just interested if you could summarize your key M&A priorities for 2023, and whether there's any sort of shift at all in sort of the key trends that we've seen over the last few years, which have been a big focus on adding the clinical capabilities and the scale at both OptumHealth and OptumInsight. Should we think about that continuing to be the core area of focus or any other additional elements that are worth considering?\nAndrew Witty : Thanks so much, Scott. Before I ask John Rex to make a couple of comments on this, I'll maybe just make a few introductory notions. I wouldn't go into a ton of detail about where we're looking, but I would continue to say we fully anticipate continuing to deploy our capital effectively into the marketplace. You know that a hallmark of this company has been its ability to effectively and efficiently utilizes capital to supplement its organic growth, and that's been a big part of the success of the organization. We'll continue to do that. We have a substantial number of transactions in process as we speak. As you well know, we're obviously in the process now of bringing to life the Change OptumInsight integration, which is super important for us. As we look forward, it's a very interesting marketplace. I mean I would say that John will probably confirm this, I think what we see the pipeline of opportunities we see is probably bigger, deeper, more diverse than we've ever seen. That's been a trend that kind of picked up probably early last year, certainly continued. We'd expect to see this year to be a pretty interesting year for us. And it's -- you know our five growth pillars. You wouldn't be at all surprised to expect us to obviously align our M&A capital investment around our growth pillars. Beyond that, I'm not sure it would be necessarily wise for us to go too much more detail. But certainly, John, I'd love you to give a bit more perspective on how you're seeing the landscape and the environment.\nJohn Rex : Absolutely. Scott, yes, so I'd start with just echoing what Andrew mentioned there, the way we approach this very much aligned with our five growth pillars and how we evaluate, how we look for opportunities, I should say, and where we think we should be pursuing investments and relationships. I'd point out that these are certainly very long-lived in terms of the investments that we make, in terms of relational investments we make, in terms of understanding markets, particularly as we've heard us talk about before within the care delivery businesses and such as value-based care that these are. Most of the markets that we want to address are aren't established the way that we would like them to be established, so it's very greenfield in terms of our approach to M&A as we look at marketplaces and bringing together the capabilities that we would pursue. The environment itself that echo what Andrew previewed there, certainly a strong environment in terms of opportunity sets that we are seeing in the broad marketplace, in terms of the types of capabilities that are there, how they might fit within this enterprise and the potential. I think you would expect us to see like where we've been focused. Certainly, over the last number of years, you've seen us do a lot of development as it relates to components of value-based care. And you know we define that very broadly now in terms of how we think about capabilities within value-based care to bring in new capabilities also and across all the other elements. But I\u2019d overall characterize the environment as strong and the opportunities as among some of the most interesting, I think, that we have seen as a company.\nAndrew Witty : Yes. I'd agree with that completely, John. And I certainly, over the next several years, see this part of the agenda being a key part of our continued support of our long-term growth goals, and you should expect to see us be -- continue to be active in the space. Thanks so much, Scott. Next question please?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter : I wanted to follow up on the home component of the value-based care opportunity. Wondering if you'd say potentially you're further along in the penetration with the home model inside the UHC book than other payers? Any color there would be great. And then, any sense of how the 4 million fully accountable lives break out by clinic versus home model with the primary care setting, or also how the 750,000 member growth breaks out for 2023 would be great?\nAndrew Witty : Stephen, thanks so much for the question. So first off, let me just reiterate how important we see the development of the home model, the home care platform, and we've seen that grow very substantially over the last couple of years in particular. Super important though, to recognize that it kind of -- so of course, sometimes folks can be essentially managed within just the home environment or the home care platform, and that certainly happens sometimes. But of course, what always happens, what very often happens is the clinic environment, the home environment are connected together, which is really what we're building here. So it's not super instructive, I think, to think about folks who are just kind of clinic nominated or home nominated. That can happen. But not really, I think, necessarily the right way to look at it. I wouldn't look at it that way. I'd see -- I really think about it the way we've built the home capabilities as a substantial extension of what we're able to do in the clinical space. And it speaks to the reality of care. People -- a lot -- not everything happens in the 20 minutes you're in the clinic, right? A ton of things happen when you're at home, and making sure that we've got care capabilities there, especially for folks who find it difficult to get out of the home or for whatever reason, find it difficult to engage with the system. That's a super important part of the environment. What I'd say is that, that is resonating super strongly, not just with UnitedHealthcare, but with other payers as well. And there's no doubt that this side of the agenda has caught the imagination of other payers, and we're delighted to see the continued extension of the multi-payer dynamic of OptumHealth and Optum more generally. And this is one of the drivers of that. In fact, during Q4, our external growth rate -- revenue growth rate was analogous to our internal growth, or i.e. Optum was growing just as quickly with non-UHC payers as it was with UHC. And that's a super important signal for the strength of the company. So important area, you'll continue to hear more about home as we go forward. But I would look at it more as a strengthening as a whole rather than a kind of separate stream in which we would be thinking about it that way.  Hopefully, that helps a little bit, Stephen. And let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich : The advance rate notice for '24 will be out in the coming weeks. It's clearly been well noted that the past few years have kind of been above the historical trend, and know that at some point we could see some moderation. I'd just be curious what your expectations are around that and how you view its relative importance in the context of your overall outlook for the MA market?\nAndrew Witty : Nathan, thanks so much. Yes, as you rightly say, obviously, we're getting close to when we would likely hear the rate notification. And obviously, we don't know what that's going to be. I think where we would sit is -- we think MA is an incredibly important program for seniors. I think it's been demonstrated now repeatedly the value that delivers to the individuals, the value it delivers to society. And of course, the way in which seniors are essentially voting to become part of this program just signals how effective it is. We believe that one of the key elements of that effectiveness that we certainly focused on is our ability to deliver stable benefits year in, year out. So I mean bottom line for us is we hope year in, year out, that the rate notice essentially facilitates that and it allows us to continue to deliver that stability. And we look forward to seeing what that will be, and we'll work with that once it's communicated to us. Not much more we can say on that, to be honest, until we obviously get the right notice. So thanks for the question. Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright : On Optum Rx, your near-term Optum Rx targets do imply passing on the savings from biosimilars, but can you detail some of the other levers you have here to drive the strength you're anticipating? How should we rank those drivers across pharmacy services, versus biosimilar benefits over the next, let's say, 12 to 18 months?\nAndrew Witty : Great question, Erin. Before I ask Heather to give you a few more details, I think we're super pleased with the progress we've made, particularly on the biosimilar innovation that's coming this year in the next few weeks. And the work that's been done within Optum Rx to deliver a contracting strategy, which ensures that everybody who wants to use a HUMIRA molecule, whether that's the brand or whether it's a biosimilar, gets access to lower cost right out of the gate has been a super important innovation in terms of our contracting strategy.  So without folks having to be shifted from drugs or dislocated in the marketplace, we found a way to bring lower cost to everybody in that environment. And I really want to give credit to Heather and her team for the work that she's done to lead on all of that. As you rightly say, we're passing those benefits directly back to the payers and the folks themselves. And with that, Heather, why don't you pick up and describe what else is driving the Rx growth this year?\nHeather Cianfrocco : Sure. So first, let me give you just another sense of maybe next phase when you think biosimilar and then let's hit the strength of the earnings for us in '23. So as Andrew said, we intended to set up the biosimilar strategy to allow the most value to pull through in year one that we can to clients, and we're proud of that. But this is a multiyear strategy, and the markets dynamic will continue to watch it. What's important here is creating a marketplace for competition of the originator with a biosimilar in the specific unique environment with HUMIRA and so many manufacturers coming to market. But over a period of maybe, say, the next 18 months with different attributes, our strategy allows them to compete based on their clinical criteria and product attributes, how the manufacturer support the product and then, obviously, the economics and the pricing. So that's the goal. We'll see that play out over the years. And the goal was to provide choice, not a lot of disruption and be able to extract value without restriction or exclusion. So we'll watch that play out. But when I think about the earnings and the strength of the position we're in or what we hoped to be by the end of '23, think of it as some of the stories you've heard us building and what we've been talking about for the last couple of years, and that's strengthen our pharmacy services. I'll give you an example. Yes, the community pharmacies are growing. They're expanding quickly. But our specialty pharmacies, our Frontier Therapies where we serve some of the more rare disease and orphan drugs are growing as quickly. And in many of those are getting scale. So for instance, the community pharmacies are scaling to the point where we're allowed -- we have central fill supporting because we have the volume of scripts going to those community pharmacies. And we're getting better with negotiations, we're able to negotiate harder on some of our procurement in those businesses. But also look at the PBM. You heard strong selling season again. We hope to have another strong selling season. The pricing is dynamic. We moved quickly with our pricing, with our product attributes. Our product adoption is up 40% year-over-year in our PBM products. And then we've got some return on some of the investments we made in the last year or two, Optum Frontier Therapies, our partnership with RVO. So that, I think, is when you look towards the next year, focus on those areas and look for us to drive earnings growth in those particular areas.\nAndrew Witty : Heather, well said. And again, you've seen a real transformation of the Optum Rx platform. If you look at five years ago, about 1/3 of the revenues in that business came from non-PBM pharmacy services. Now it's at half. As a tremendous shift on the business' scale, really is significant. And I'd say one of the key themes, which is driving a lot of that is a relentless shift was the consumer in the way in which that business is orientated and building its product. Real focus on delivering the best possible deal for consumers, making sure they get the lowest net cost. And then you'll see through, as Heather just mentioned, partnerships like RVO Health, you'll see us to continue to innovate the way in which we engage with consumers to make that much more modern, much more as U.S. consumers should get and should expect. Heather, thank you so much. Next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette : so regarding the acuity level of the elevated flu and respiratory costs in the fourth quarter, is there any sense for just how much of the elevated cost for, hate to call it, tripledemic, let's just call it that, I guess, for the quarter, how much of that was related to the hospital inpatient setting in particular? And then from your data, was there any sense that there may have been any slightly lower elective procedures or traditional non-COVID and non-flu-related care in the fourth quarter in light of the elevated flu and respiratory cost and utilization?\nAndrew Witty : Stephen, thanks so much for asking that. Listen, I think -- listen, of course, it was Q4. There was a bit more flu and respiratory. But really, I'd say immaterial in the scheme -- in the grand -- in the way I'd say in the grand scheme of the healthcare costs of the U.S., almost not noticeable. I mean, almost nothing to see. And I think I wouldn't -- much as I think there was a lot of anticipation around what could be coming in this notion of different viruses all come, somehow creating this, I think you said triple pandemic, really not there. And the little elevation we saw was somewhat within the ranges of what you typically would expect in a normal Q4 early flu season, which, as Brian mentioned earlier, looks like it's -- we've seen the last five weeks coming down. That's pretty much it, yes. So I really wouldn't guide you to characterize this as a big deal within the overall mix of the total healthcare costs that we're dealing with. It really isn't. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck : Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectations for redeterminations that you talked a bit about how you see that as a membership opportunity, but some more focus on the MLR implications. I guess, if you think about the potentially significant change in the membership of the Medicaid program and the implications for the risk pool there, how are you thinking about potential margin compression and how quickly rates might be able to reflect that, if it does play out?\nAndrew Witty : Kevin, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Tim Spilker, who looks after our Medicaid business to talk to that. And maybe Tim, as you do that, you could also maybe just allude a little bit on the degree of visibility you have for your book of business as you roll into 2023. That might also be helpful.\nTim Spilker : Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Kevin, for the question. So certainly, a number of factors in play as we look ahead, certainly, the change in membership that we'll see as redeterminations resume. And then also acuity utilization, all of the factors really as things return to normal.  So at this point, from where we look, we've got visibility at around 75% of our revenue for the year. And states, as they set that revenue, have taken all of those factors into account when setting their rates, and that revenue is in line with our expectations and consistent with the outlook that we shared in November. So we're appreciative of the balanced rational view that our states have taken as they've looked ahead, knowing that we've got many factors coming forward. Maybe one last thing, just as we look ahead, the redetermination process will be extended. We know it will take 10 to 12 months depending on the state. And that will give us opportunities to provide data, feedback and insights to our customers, work with them to adjust as things develop. So really no changes from what we communicated in November and with a little bit more certainty now in terms of our revenue.\nAndrew Witty: Right. Thank you, Tim. I appreciate that, Kevin. Thanks for the question. Operator, we just have time for one last question, if we could go ahead, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill : I wanted to come back to the specialty drug and pharmacy initiatives. And I guess, can you talk about what percent of these drugs are going through the mail channel versus the retail channel now? Kind of how do you expect the share to shift away from retail to mail? And then I'd tack on kind of how should we think about what the earnings power of the shifts can look like as you capture more of the specialty drugs in owned channels versus third-party channels?\nAndrew Witty : George, thanks so much for the question. Let me hand it straight to Heather, please.\nHeather Cianfrocco : Sure, great question. As we continue to see the pipeline in specialty drugs, I hope you can feel the urgency around us driving. And you can see it in our growth, but also in our patient care and our clinical program. So our Optum Frontier Therapy, I think, is actually a good model. I know it serves only sort of rare disease and orphan drug, but we talked about the investor conference. It's got a comprehensive clinical model wrapping around it that supports not just the patients, the caregivers, the prescriber, the family, but also helps pharma to deliver the best service in those drugs. That is the model we're using to inform how we serve clients and how we serve patients in our specialty business as well. So think about that holistic support, patient advocacy, patient support, caregiver support, prescriber support, all while investing in automation. So even in our pharmacy -- in our specialty pharmacy today, our automation is up. We're actually seeing over 30% higher self-service in the specialty pharmacy. That's not just mail and maintenance, that's specialty. So we're investing in the automation. For those that have simple transactions and want to interact with us with these, but those that need more comprehensive care with complex conditions that need the value of our 24/7 pharmacist support, our team is there to help them. So we will always continue to work with our retail partners. We are -- we've got a very strong network of that. But we want to be able to serve our consumers and our clients with best-in-class specialty service.\nAndrew Witty : Thanks, Heather. And George, thank you for the question. Listen, we come to the end of the call, I hope very much you leave the call with a sense of our optimism and focus on continued growth for the year ahead. We remain intent on expanding our ability to help improve healthcare at the system and individual levels and executing with excellence for all those we serve. We look forward to sharing our progress on this journey with you again in April. And in the meantime, thank you so much for your attention this morning. We appreciate it.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. While the calendar shows we are two weeks into the New Year, our team's 2023 started many months ago; and in some cases, years ago. We have been laying the groundwork necessary to execute on our growth strategy and sustain our momentum heading into this year and beyond. To give you a sense of how this develops, I'll step through some of the work that has been longue dure\u0301e to ready our organization to serve even more patients and customers in this new year and provide greater value for consumers across a broad range of initiatives. Take the many new patients we will serve under value-based care arrangements in 2023, deepening our presence in existing areas and adding new regions. Our team's preparations are extensive. That's because the transition to fully accountable care is not simply a matter of downloading a new app. The preparations include significant investments in clinical training, technology, network coordination and other activities to make certain we are ready to serve. These critical investments help us support both our current year needs and establish foundations for the growth into 2024 and beyond. Our ability to serve people effectively has expanded beyond the four-walls of the clinic with the rapid development of our in-home clinical capabilities. These services complement our clinic-based and digital offerings and bring high-quality care access to some of the most challenged and often underserved patients in this country. For instance, for value-based patients, our in-home services have reduced hospital visits by 15% versus fee-for-service, delivering comparable health outcomes and achieving an NPS of approximately 80.  Within health benefits, you've heard us discuss how our innovation in commercial products is adding new growth opportunities. One of those is Surest, a unique solution to employers and employees who are looking for first dollar coverage and high transparency into quality and cost. The momentum behind Surest is strong and building. Just two years ago, one in 25 national accounts offered Surest as an option to more traditional plans. Thus far in 2023, it is one in nine, and we expect it will continue to rise. Our offerings for seniors are another area in which we plan, invest and build capabilities to provide new and valuable offerings for an extended period. For example, we continue to expand the range of clinical services we provide via our HouseCalls initiative. In 2023, we will increase the types of vaccinations offered, expand testing services and deploy even more real-time resources to address social determinants of health. Seniors place high value on being able to get care in their home. It comes with an NPS of 75 and is helping to drive improving retention levels as we head into 2023. In addition, our advocacy service solutions help members achieve better health. Our solutions led to a 42% increase in closing gaps in care, up to 15% lower ER visits and an over 10% increase in clinical program enrollment compared to customers who utilize standard offerings. Turning to health technology, let me offer a few early observations on our progress and long-term growth opportunities we see in this area. With the completed change healthcare combination, we are accelerating our investments to bring this vision of a more intelligent and simpler health system to market as rapidly as possible. We will continue to innovate in and deliver the software, data analytics, technology-enabled services, revenue cycle management and advisory services our customers expect. And we are executing on the synergies of this combination with most of the financial benefit coming from complementary growth. OptumInsight is uniquely positioned to offer integrated, end-to-end technology analytics and services across the entire healthcare value chain. Along these lines, we recently reached two new comprehensive health system partnerships, with Northern Light Health in Maine and with Owensboro Health in Kentucky. The services we provide typically feature a full breadth of our advanced solutions, including information technology, revenue cycle management, analytics and supply chain tools. The key here is that our comprehensive technology solutions are resonating in the market, and we expect to see increasing momentum across all of OptumInsight as we invest in and finalize our integration activities. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."

            "name": "Wyatt Decker",
            "content": "Yes. Well, thank you, David, for the question. And it's very timely. We view home health as one of the new frontiers of providing value-based healthcare because of the convenience it provides and the ability to access people, like dual special needs patients that often have very difficulty leaving their home to get care. So you will see us both developing if you will, the platform of home care increasingly in a comprehensive fashion, as well as integrating home care with our clinic-based care model. So it really creates two growth vehicles for us, if that makes sense. And similarly, with behavioral, as we've seen during the pandemic, the need for behavioral care is immense in the U.S. market. And our ability to embed behavioral healthcare services within our primary care and value-based care offerings has been differentiated and will continue to grow, as well as our utilization of virtual behavioral care solutions in both the home and clinic environments. And so we're pretty excited about how this is coming together, and we're creating a differentiated offering that helps accelerate value-based care growth and provide that comprehensive care that people made."

            "name": "Brian Thompson",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Justin, for that question. Throughout the pandemic, we've been making these references to baselines, et cetera. I think, now being three years into this pandemic, I'd like to just ground an anchor more to our expectations as COVID has waned. And what I'm most encouraged by is that the fourth quarter played out as we had expected. And what we had set out inside our pricing trends are lining up really nicely as we look forward to 2023. To your comments around the flu, as I had suggested at our investor conference, we certainly saw that spike. We have now seen that start to wane for, I think, five consecutive weeks here as we're moving forward. So to put it out like we had expected, really not a meaningful impact as I'm looking forward versus what we've planned for. So what I'm most encouraged by is we're sort of out of that zone of the unknowns around comparing to baselines, et cetera, and really managing a book of business with greater predictability back to sort of the expectations that we had well pre-pandemic and encouraged about how all of those elements, including flu, are lining up as we look forward. Thanks, Justin. Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll hand it off to Dan Kueter. I'll start with the conversation around trend. As you well know, we used to share trend information back in the day, and stopped doing so simply because it became less instructive as we were pacing through this COVID environment. What I can share, and I think once we get to this zone of consistency, we'll return to those metrics, we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing on the utilization front. I think we are seeing some durable shifts. We've seen it with respect to ER moving into urgent and in-patient to outpatient. But on the flip side, as we all know, in these labor markets, we're seeing stronger unit costs. And as we all know, unit costs still comprise the majority of the overall trend. And as I had suggested earlier in the year, we did have a higher trend planning for 2023 than 2022. But in reality, that was really a function of the first half of 2022. And again, I want to give that thought and belief that we are largely back to normal levels. And I think once we pace through 2023, we'll get to that zone where we can share those pricing trends. So with that, maybe a little bit more on the competitive dynamic, Dan."

            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Over the course of the past year, the extraordinary and dedicated people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered strong, well-balanced growth, progress in developing our consumer-orientated capabilities and strengthened the many ways in which we deliver value-based care in multiple settings. Each of the five growth pillars we discussed with you at our November investor conference are powerful sources of opportunities on their own within large and expanding addressable markets. Yet what really unlocks the potential value we can provide to those we serve is the connectivity of capabilities across our enterprise. For example, this year, we expect 4 million people will participate in fully accountable value-based care provided by Optum Health, almost 1.8 million more than we served as we entered 2022. We're achieving this by connecting benefits, care and other services to support our patients. Many of these patients will have a Medicare Advantage plan offered by UnitedHealthcare, or one of the many other payers who are accessing Optum's expertise and capabilities in delivering this kind of comprehensive care. We will serve these patients in clinic settings, in their homes, integrating behavioral care, supported by our data-driven clinical incidents and next best actions, and all coordinated to provide the right care when and where they need it. Pharmacy is another area in which we are more deeply connecting consumers with our services. We engage 1 million people every day, finding the lowest cost options, managing their specialty drugs, offering vital in-person clinical advice at our community pharmacies, providing complex medication treatments right in their homes, or simplifying access through digital solutions in order to make the process uneventful for them. We believe this connectivity is a path to better outcomes for people and lower costs. It's also driving growth. By the end of 2023, we expect to have more than 750 community pharmacies, nearly 200 more than we had at the beginning of 2020. We continue to see the impact these services have at a very local and personal level, helping providers deliver more complete care and better outcomes, including medication adherence rates, which are about 90% compared to the 50% U.S. average. Our pharmacists are able to take the time to get to know their patients' treatment plans and support their medication management, collaborating with other care providers. We're guided in pharmacy by the principle of getting to the lowest cost for patients and clients. A good example, as more biosimilars come to market, we're positioned to offer patients their care providers and payers significantly more choices in how to secure the best prices for the therapies they need. In addition to biosimilars, we're driving affordability and prescription benefits by combining formulary and cash market pricing to ensure consumers will always get the best economics. Our life-saving drugs program has made very significant progress since our announcements last year. This program offers zero dollar out-of-pocket cost to consumers for drugs such as insulin and epinephrine. Our goal has been to make this available throughout the U.S. And as of today, we've been approved in 48 states for our fully insured business. Moreover, 1/4 of our self-funded employers have now chosen to add this offering for their employees, and we expect that number to rise. Getting to this point in such a short period of time was only possible through the work not just of our teams, but of state officials and others in the broader healthcare community and we're grateful for their support.  Looking to the year ahead, let me focus you on a couple of themes you can expect to hear from us. One is continued scaling of our commitment to American consumers. You should and will have -- who should and will have an increasing influence over their care experience. Through our core innovations, product design, enhanced digital offerings and partnerships such as RVO Health and Walmart, you will see us driving this more broadly across the enterprise, becoming closer to the consumer, helping simplify their experiences and empowering their decision-making with greater transparency, speed, convenience and support. You will also hear how we are amplifying our technology capabilities.  2023 will see the emergence of an enhanced OptumInsight, bringing to life the opportunities that the legacy organizations from Optum and change creates, an acceleration of how technology can be used to healthcare providers and ultimately patients within the overall health system.  We start this year well prepared to deliver upon the objectives we shared with you in late November, and with a deep sense of responsibility to do so on behalf of the people we are privileged to serve. With that, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon. Thanks, John. As we head into 2023, we're determined to build upon the momentum we've just described this morning, further advancing our mission and delivering sustainable earnings growth of 13% to 16% over the long term. And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please. A.J., thanks so much, and Happy New Year to you as well. I appreciate the question. Yes. So first off, we do feel that we're bringing a ton of momentum into 2023. We feel across the board last year, very strong performances. Most of our businesses closed out the year actually a little ahead of where we were anticipating even when we were at the investor conference. So strong from that perspective. As we look into this year, I think real standout for me maybe call out just two or three points. One is just the membership roles and just the scale of growth in our membership. If you look at UHC performance during '22, you heard us talk about that just now, we're anticipating, frankly, another 1 million plus. I wouldn't be at all surprised if we didn't exceed '22 numbers by the time we get to the end of '23. That is a huge plus and signals a tremendous amount of engagement from the marketplace in our product set across all lines of business, whether that's in the government books of business in the MA platform, our determination to make sure that we look after folks in Medicaid as they go through redetermination cycles and, of course, in our commercial books where you've seen tremendously strong growth. So that's really an area which I think is building for us a lot of confidence as we go forward. And then you go across to Optum, and let me just call out record selling seasons coming through from our Optum Rx platform. That's building a tremendous amount of pipeline growth for us within our business over the next several years. OptumHealth, of course, really rapid growth of value-based fully capitated lives. You'll see by the end of '23, we'll be looking after -- well, more than double the number of folks we were looking after at the end of '21. That's an extraordinary expansion, and we expect that to continue to grow hard. OptumInsight, this year will be an emergence of a new OptumInsight. That's a business where we know we can do better. We've known that for a long time. We've been itching to get going on the integration of change and OptumInsight, which we've now been able to do. We really leaned into that in the fourth quarter. You'll see that flow through very rapidly in the first couple of quarters of this year. That's going to give us a whole new cycle of product innovation. We expect that to be a big source of lift as we go forward, backed up by an increasing momentum of being able to sign up these very large health system partnerships. You've seen us do two since the investor conference in November in addition to the ones we already have. I remind you, these are very large scale, very sticky, multiyear relationships, really substantial sources of energy for the organization. So that really drives all of our momentum. I think where we land in the ranges we've given you is all about our ability to execute and making sure that our organization is focused on every single day, making sure we get every transaction right. We look after every patient in the right way. We make sure that we're looking after every consumer approach that we received in the right way. And so execution is going to be what determines where we come out. The raw material in terms of the momentum for the company is just extraordinary as we look into 2023.  A.J., I appreciate the question. And maybe next question, operator, please? Lisa, thanks very much for the question. Yes. I mean, we're not going to get into a ton of speculation because obviously, it's very, very potentially imminent. And so not sure there's tons of value there. But I would like to ask Tim Noel looks after our M&R business to maybe share some of his perspective on that. Tim? Tim, thanks so much. And Lisa, thanks for the question. I mean I think as you just, again, just maybe step up a little bit in the broader position, obviously the whole MA program is unbelievably successful and popular program for seniors across the U.S. And of course, the biggest proof of that is the number of folks who every single year volunteer to sign up to be part of this program. And we're seeing another record year of enrollment coming through as we speak. It's super important that any changes, whether it's in this particular circumstance or any other circumstance, it's super important that folks are thoughtful about collateral consequences, making sure that what is really impressive program in terms of quality of care, reassurance provided to seniors, ability to deliver good value for the senior, good value for society, making sure that any changes are made thoughtfully and holistically is what we would be hoping to see. And obviously, we look forward to working with the administration when and if any further updates come forth.  With that, Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And let's go to next question, operator. Josh, listen, thanks so much for the question. It's a really -- that's a big question. Let me just give a few thoughts toward that. So one of the key capabilities you need to be in value-based care at scale is patients. Patients because it takes three or five years of getting to know medical practices before they become part of our network and as we go through our expansion. Patient then in terms of how you go through the process of building the capabilities and skills within the clinical practices to move from fee-for-service to value-based care. And of course, that patient size is reflected in how long it takes to go through this from an economic and financial perspective. And that's why as we see this rapid development now, it's kind of -- OptumCare, value-based care is kind of an overnight success that took 15 years to build. And that's -- it's really a truth. And we're seeing that scale now come to life and all credit to the teams who are doing that. In terms of what helps here, I think it's really building a muscle within your organization to continuously test, learn, correct, test, learn, correct in terms of how we work. This is a very -- so very -- it's a somewhat delicate system because what you're dealing with, obviously, highly professional clinical decision makers on the front line who are absolutely, ultimately responsible for every decision they make in front of every patient. But you're also trying to make sure they have the right information to be able to learn from the whole system, the information we know about those folks and what's likely to happen, what could happen, what might be the best practice. And how can we get the whole of the system to operate at a higher level. Those sorts of pieces of progress, those areas where we relentlessly invested, give us opportunities to improve the clinical care. If we can improve the clinical care, the economics follow. So within this whole model, getting the clinical care right, getting people in the right facilities, making sure people don't spend too long in care facilities when it's unnecessary, making sure that illness is delayed, deferred because they're treated well that prevention is the priority, that's what drives all of the economics. What we're seeing, Josh, is that over the last three or four years, we are indeed being able to bring our more recent cohorts to a better economic position more quickly. That's allowing us then to continue to invest more aggressively in bringing new patients into the system. And that -- it's really that mechanism, which you're seeing come to life at the moment. Hopefully, that helps a little bit. And next question please. Yes. Justin, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Brian Thompson to respond to that, please. Thanks so much, Brian. And Justin, thanks for the question. Next question please? Lance, thanks so much. Let me ask Brian to kick off on that. Thanks so much, Dan. Thanks, Lance. Next question? Yes. So I'm going to ask Dr. Wyatt Decker to make a couple of comments in a second on that. But maybe just before he does, and I think we don't particularly break out what's driving the elements of that kind of consumer served number. But you can imagine that the move to value-based care is a big driver of that. Now one of the pieces within the home platform, just to pick out one of the two areas you called out, David, is, of course, within there, you have a substantial amount of D-SNP population, right? So that particular part of the business helps us do a much better job of looking -- giving a much better end-to-end wraparound care for complex folks often found in the D-SNP population. And of course, they represent a different type of revenue profile compared to more of a community patient. So I just make that point. So within the home piece, it kind of a derivative phenomenon that home creates a capability, which allows us to serve D-SNP folks better. That, of course, is going to be an accelerator to the metric you were focused on. And maybe ask Wyatt to go a little deeper though, around how you're bringing behavioral along as well as home please? Thanks, Wyatt. Next question please? Thanks so much, Gary. Let me ask John Rex to respond. Thanks, John. And thank you, Gary. Next question please? Thanks so much, Scott. Before I ask John Rex to make a couple of comments on this, I'll maybe just make a few introductory notions. I wouldn't go into a ton of detail about where we're looking, but I would continue to say we fully anticipate continuing to deploy our capital effectively into the marketplace. You know that a hallmark of this company has been its ability to effectively and efficiently utilizes capital to supplement its organic growth, and that's been a big part of the success of the organization. We'll continue to do that. We have a substantial number of transactions in process as we speak. As you well know, we're obviously in the process now of bringing to life the Change OptumInsight integration, which is super important for us. As we look forward, it's a very interesting marketplace. I mean I would say that John will probably confirm this, I think what we see the pipeline of opportunities we see is probably bigger, deeper, more diverse than we've ever seen. That's been a trend that kind of picked up probably early last year, certainly continued. We'd expect to see this year to be a pretty interesting year for us. And it's -- you know our five growth pillars. You wouldn't be at all surprised to expect us to obviously align our M&A capital investment around our growth pillars. Beyond that, I'm not sure it would be necessarily wise for us to go too much more detail. But certainly, John, I'd love you to give a bit more perspective on how you're seeing the landscape and the environment. Yes. I'd agree with that completely, John. And I certainly, over the next several years, see this part of the agenda being a key part of our continued support of our long-term growth goals, and you should expect to see us be -- continue to be active in the space. Thanks so much, Scott. Next question please? Stephen, thanks so much for the question. So first off, let me just reiterate how important we see the development of the home model, the home care platform, and we've seen that grow very substantially over the last couple of years in particular. Super important though, to recognize that it kind of -- so of course, sometimes folks can be essentially managed within just the home environment or the home care platform, and that certainly happens sometimes. But of course, what always happens, what very often happens is the clinic environment, the home environment are connected together, which is really what we're building here. So it's not super instructive, I think, to think about folks who are just kind of clinic nominated or home nominated. That can happen. But not really, I think, necessarily the right way to look at it. I wouldn't look at it that way. I'd see -- I really think about it the way we've built the home capabilities as a substantial extension of what we're able to do in the clinical space. And it speaks to the reality of care. People -- a lot -- not everything happens in the 20 minutes you're in the clinic, right? A ton of things happen when you're at home, and making sure that we've got care capabilities there, especially for folks who find it difficult to get out of the home or for whatever reason, find it difficult to engage with the system. That's a super important part of the environment. What I'd say is that, that is resonating super strongly, not just with UnitedHealthcare, but with other payers as well. And there's no doubt that this side of the agenda has caught the imagination of other payers, and we're delighted to see the continued extension of the multi-payer dynamic of OptumHealth and Optum more generally. And this is one of the drivers of that. In fact, during Q4, our external growth rate -- revenue growth rate was analogous to our internal growth, or i.e. Optum was growing just as quickly with non-UHC payers as it was with UHC. And that's a super important signal for the strength of the company. So important area, you'll continue to hear more about home as we go forward. But I would look at it more as a strengthening as a whole rather than a kind of separate stream in which we would be thinking about it that way.  Hopefully, that helps a little bit, Stephen. And let's go to the next question. Nathan, thanks so much. Yes, as you rightly say, obviously, we're getting close to when we would likely hear the rate notification. And obviously, we don't know what that's going to be. I think where we would sit is -- we think MA is an incredibly important program for seniors. I think it's been demonstrated now repeatedly the value that delivers to the individuals, the value it delivers to society. And of course, the way in which seniors are essentially voting to become part of this program just signals how effective it is. We believe that one of the key elements of that effectiveness that we certainly focused on is our ability to deliver stable benefits year in, year out. So I mean bottom line for us is we hope year in, year out, that the rate notice essentially facilitates that and it allows us to continue to deliver that stability. And we look forward to seeing what that will be, and we'll work with that once it's communicated to us. Not much more we can say on that, to be honest, until we obviously get the right notice. So thanks for the question. Next question please? Great question, Erin. Before I ask Heather to give you a few more details, I think we're super pleased with the progress we've made, particularly on the biosimilar innovation that's coming this year in the next few weeks. And the work that's been done within Optum Rx to deliver a contracting strategy, which ensures that everybody who wants to use a HUMIRA molecule, whether that's the brand or whether it's a biosimilar, gets access to lower cost right out of the gate has been a super important innovation in terms of our contracting strategy.  So without folks having to be shifted from drugs or dislocated in the marketplace, we found a way to bring lower cost to everybody in that environment. And I really want to give credit to Heather and her team for the work that she's done to lead on all of that. As you rightly say, we're passing those benefits directly back to the payers and the folks themselves. And with that, Heather, why don't you pick up and describe what else is driving the Rx growth this year? Heather, well said. And again, you've seen a real transformation of the Optum Rx platform. If you look at five years ago, about 1/3 of the revenues in that business came from non-PBM pharmacy services. Now it's at half. As a tremendous shift on the business' scale, really is significant. And I'd say one of the key themes, which is driving a lot of that is a relentless shift was the consumer in the way in which that business is orientated and building its product. Real focus on delivering the best possible deal for consumers, making sure they get the lowest net cost. And then you'll see through, as Heather just mentioned, partnerships like RVO Health, you'll see us to continue to innovate the way in which we engage with consumers to make that much more modern, much more as U.S. consumers should get and should expect. Heather, thank you so much. Next question please? Stephen, thanks so much for asking that. Listen, I think -- listen, of course, it was Q4. There was a bit more flu and respiratory. But really, I'd say immaterial in the scheme -- in the grand -- in the way I'd say in the grand scheme of the healthcare costs of the U.S., almost not noticeable. I mean, almost nothing to see. And I think I wouldn't -- much as I think there was a lot of anticipation around what could be coming in this notion of different viruses all come, somehow creating this, I think you said triple pandemic, really not there. And the little elevation we saw was somewhat within the ranges of what you typically would expect in a normal Q4 early flu season, which, as Brian mentioned earlier, looks like it's -- we've seen the last five weeks coming down. That's pretty much it, yes. So I really wouldn't guide you to characterize this as a big deal within the overall mix of the total healthcare costs that we're dealing with. It really isn't. Next question? Kevin, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Tim Spilker, who looks after our Medicaid business to talk to that. And maybe Tim, as you do that, you could also maybe just allude a little bit on the degree of visibility you have for your book of business as you roll into 2023. That might also be helpful. Right. Thank you, Tim. I appreciate that, Kevin. Thanks for the question. Operator, we just have time for one last question, if we could go ahead, please? George, thanks so much for the question. Let me hand it straight to Heather, please. Thanks, Heather. And George, thank you for the question. Listen, we come to the end of the call, I hope very much you leave the call with a sense of our optimism and focus on continued growth for the year ahead. We remain intent on expanding our ability to help improve healthcare at the system and individual levels and executing with excellence for all those we serve. We look forward to sharing our progress on this journey with you again in April. And in the meantime, thank you so much for your attention this morning. We appreciate it."

            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you, Dirk. The investments and innovations Andrew and Dirk described and that we shared with you in November, speak to a company that has tremendous growth potential as we head into '23 and well beyond. The opportunities to serve people more deeply are tangible and accelerating, building upon a foundation of strong growth in recent years, including our 2022 performance. Revenue in '22 of $324 billion grew by more than $36 billion or 13% over the prior year, with well-balanced double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.34 grew 19% and brought full year adjusted earnings per share to $22.19, growth of 17%. Our capital capacities remain strong. Cash flow from operations in '22 was $26.2 billion or 1.3x net income. We returned $13 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, and deployed over $20 billion in growth capital to expand our capabilities for years to come. Turning to the performance of our businesses. OptumHealth's revenues grew by 32% in '22 to $71 billion as we expanded the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements by about 1 million. Revenue per consumer grew by 29%, driven by the increase in value-based care patients and in the levels of care we are able to offer. Consistent with our comments in November, OptumHealth is off to a strong start in '23 and will organically grow to serve an additional 750,000 value-based patients this year. OptumInsights revenues grew 20% to $14.6 billion in '22. We concluded the year with a revenue backlog of $30 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion over last year. As Dirk noted, we are advancing our investments to more rapidly unlock the positive impact OptumInsight can have for care providers and patients. We expect to make a significant portion of these important investments in the first half of the year. Optum Rx revenues grew 9%, approaching $100 billion for the year, driven by continued strong sales and the expansion of our pharmacy services businesses. Both customer retention and new customer wins were among the highest Optum Rx has ever delivered, laying a strong foundation for continued market-leading growth. At UnitedHealthcare, full year revenues of nearly $250 billion grew 12%. Our strong 2023 Medicare Advantage member outlook is consistent with the objectives we shared with you in November. We expect to serve up to 900,000 more people in '23 across our individual, group and dual special needs offerings, our 8th consecutive year of above-market growth. This consistent performance underscores the product innovation, benefit stability and high-value seniors have come to rely on from us. Our Medicaid growth outlook for '23 incorporates an expectation that states will resume eligibility redeterminations early in the second quarter. Our objective is to ensure that people will have continuous access to benefits. And when all redetermination activities are eventually completed, we expect to serve even more people than we do today across our state-based commercial and exchange-based offerings. Within our commercial offerings, we expect to serve about 1 million additional people in 2023.  Our new and innovative products continue to gain momentum with employers and their employees, which will lead to increasing growth in this market over the next several years.  In sum, while this year is just getting started, the early performance we are seeing across our businesses further validates our confidence in the 2023 growth and performance objectives we shared with you just six weeks ago. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew. Gary, good morning. I will go back in order here. So just in terms of -- it'd be very similar with Brian Thompson's commentary in terms of what we were seeing in the quarter and I think forward. So those -- that incidence was modestly elevated in the 4Q, but I'd call it modestly elevated, but very much in line with what we would have expected -- and when we were in front of you back at the end of November in terms of flu and respiratory. Let's put those two together in terms of just combining that whole view. So elevated, when you take it into materiality in terms of the $50 billion of medical costs in the quarter, I wouldn't call it immensely material, though, in that element, but very consistent. In terms of investment income, probably wouldn't be very similar to what we reported 4Q a year ago in terms of the absolute level of investment income in there. I wouldn't -- just kind of like last year, probably wouldn't use that as my run rate stepping out into next year though. So we're still comfortable with how we established and guided for 2023 from that perspective also. So very consistent with that 4Q of last year, too. Absolutely. Scott, yes, so I'd start with just echoing what Andrew mentioned there, the way we approach this very much aligned with our five growth pillars and how we evaluate, how we look for opportunities, I should say, and where we think we should be pursuing investments and relationships. I'd point out that these are certainly very long-lived in terms of the investments that we make, in terms of relational investments we make, in terms of understanding markets, particularly as we've heard us talk about before within the care delivery businesses and such as value-based care that these are. Most of the markets that we want to address are aren't established the way that we would like them to be established, so it's very greenfield in terms of our approach to M&A as we look at marketplaces and bringing together the capabilities that we would pursue. The environment itself that echo what Andrew previewed there, certainly a strong environment in terms of opportunity sets that we are seeing in the broad marketplace, in terms of the types of capabilities that are there, how they might fit within this enterprise and the potential. I think you would expect us to see like where we've been focused. Certainly, over the last number of years, you've seen us do a lot of development as it relates to components of value-based care. And you know we define that very broadly now in terms of how we think about capabilities within value-based care to bring in new capabilities also and across all the other elements. But I'd overall characterize the environment as strong and the opportunities as among some of the most interesting, I think, that we have seen as a company."

We continue to price to our forward trend, and we have continued to do that. As Brian indicated, there has been some modifications to that, but all within the range of what we've expected and all within the range of how we've priced.

We talked about this a bit at the investor conference and don't have a lot of new information to share this morning, but let me revisit a couple of the key elements that we discussed a couple of weeks ago. So first, risk adjustment is really critical to providing broad and equitable access inside the Medicare Advantage program. Also a really important part of ensuring there's no disincentives for caring for the most vulnerable. We also continue to remain very supportive of additional transparency. And here, that takes the form of more timely and consistent reviews. And a few of the key elements that we're thinking about with respect to these audits is it's very important for CMS to include a fee-for-service adjuster to make sure that we're comparing original Medicare and Medicare Advantage on the same basis. And also, very important that we don't conduct these audits decades in arrears. That comes with some challenges, of course. That said, without the final rule set, as Andrew alluded to, hard to get really narrow and specific, but we feel really good about how our results validated. Some of our sample sets were above, some of our sample sets were below. But likely more specifics to discuss at next quarter's call. Thanks, Lisa."

Their efforts allow us to deliver durable and balanced growth and to increase our 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.85 to $22.05 per share. As an enterprise, we remain focused on our mission and on advancing our growth strategies. Our aim is to serve more people through value-based care and expanded health benefits offerings, a robust foundation on which to consistently drive strong growth into 2023 and beyond. Consumers want value, especially in the current economic environment and that means high-quality care that is more accessible, more affordable and more responsive to their individual needs. In the past quarter, we have accelerated efforts to deliver on this critical consumer proposition, launching several initiatives to reach more people in more communities while deepening relationships with those we already serve. For example, in September, we announced a long-term collaboration with Walmart to provide Optum technology and expertise that will enable America\u2019s largest retailer to provide value-based care to consumers in its clinics. Starting in 2023, we will jointly develop 15 Walmart health clinics in Florida and Georgia and will extend into additional geographies over time. As we expand the collaboration, there will be broad opportunities to address social determinants of health by improving access to benefits such as healthy foods, medications, dental and vision services and more. We also launched a distinctive partnership with Red Ventures, a digital media company connecting tens of millions of consumers each month to its clients\u2019 products and services, through a broad portfolio of proprietary digital content platforms. This partnership called RVO Health combines Red Ventures popular health and wellness platforms, including health line and health grades, with Optum\u2019s consumer marketplace, the Optum Store and the Optum Perks prescription discount card. RVO Health will enable us to engage with more than 100 million active monthly visitors seeking the health advice and insights they need introducing them to relevant products and services through a customized end-to-end digital platform. Affordability is an essential component of value in healthcare, especially when it determines access to the life-saving medicines people need for themselves and their families. In July, we announced zero consumer cost share on drugs for diabetes, severe allergic reactions and other emergency situations starting in January for those we serve with commercial insured benefits. Now, we are working with self-funded employers who are exploring how they can provide these vital medications for zero co-pay. So far, this benefit will be available to more than 1 million additional people and we are actively engaging with many additional employers. We are also improving access to essential medicines for those even without health benefits coverage. For example, Optum Store launched a new partnership with Sanofi to help consumers without insurance obtain insulin for $35 a month and they will be able to have it delivered to their home. Turning to health benefits, today, nearly half of American seniors are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans compared to about 25% a decade ago. And MA plays a vital role in serving those consumers who are significantly more diverse, have lower incomes and more complex care needs than the average senior. There are compelling reasons why seniors increasingly choose MA. Through Medicare Advantage, people are experiencing better health outcomes than in traditional fee-for-service Medicare across a wide spectrum of measures. For example, MA members with diabetes have over 50% lower rates of any category of complication and over 70% lower rates of serious complication. This is due to our ability to provide deeper, more coordinated levels of care, and this is accomplished at lower cost. People served by MA spend as much as 40% less compared to those in Medicare fee-for-service. And this high value for people is delivered at a lower net cost to the government. We are confident our differentiated offerings will once again this year resonate with consumers who are even more focused on affordability, value and simplicity given the rising cost of daily life. Today, in the United States, more people than ever have access to health benefits, an important milestone on the path towards universal coverage, an objective we have long supported. Much of this expanded coverage has occurred in Medicaid. Looking to 2023 and given the potential resumption of eligibility redeterminations next year, a high priority for our team is assuring continuity of access and care for those we serve. The initiatives our team is pursuing to help assure continuous coverage include launching direct outreach and partnering with states and community organizations to identify those at risk and help them retain their benefit coverage, partnering with national retailers and pharmacies to educate consumers about available coverage options and assistance while they are shopping in store and engaging with employers to extend annual enrollment periods and drive education efforts to employees who are eligible for coverage. Underpinning our growing consumer agenda is an ambitious multiyear effort to deepen and expand our enterprise technology capabilities. The recent combination of OptumInsight and Change Healthcare reflects our accelerating efforts to help create more effective and simple experiences for consumers, payers and care providers while lowering costs across the health system. I want to formally welcome our newest colleagues, the talented and compassionate team at Change Healthcare, with whom we have just started working to build upon our shared vision for a more effective and adaptive health system for all participants. With that, I will turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. As Andrew just mentioned, we are very excited about the recent combination of Change Healthcare and OptumInsight. With a grand total of 11 days of integration work behind us, I thought I would provide a bit more commentary on how together we can make the health system simpler and more efficient. Overall, Change brings a robust transaction network built on strong payer and provider connectivity. Together, our focus areas include: first, improving the quality of health care delivery by offering critical point-of-care insights aligned to evidence-based medical standards within the workflow of physicians; second, simplifying administration by fully automating claims transactions, including editing in the EDI stream, improving claim accuracy; lastly, we are reducing friction in the payment process by providing patient benefits and payment obligations at point of service and applying payment integrity at its upfront. Our teams have started out of the gate working intensively together to make these visions a reality and to create the next era of growth for OptumInsight. We are very confident that our combined capabilities will enable us to better serve all healthcare constituents. Beyond OptumInsight, as you might imagine, I spend a lot of time engaging customers of all sizes, operating in almost every sector and representing diverse employee populations. Across these customers, no matter the person or the industry, I hear the same consistent message. The need for deeper levels of support and more resources to comprehensively meet health needs in both the traditional, but also increasingly focused on behavioral health. Companies want to provide a broader range of resources and deeper levels of support for their employees and their families and the groundwork we have been building is resonating in this rapidly evolving area. Here is what we are doing about it. First, we are tackling access. We have expanded our behavioral health network by 25% over the last couple of years, including a growing complement of behavioral clinical practices owned and operated by Optum. And as many of you know, behavioral health is a 24/7 challenge. So we are continuing to expand our portfolio of digital offerings supporting a range of needs, allowing patients to get resources when they need them. We have also made significant improvements to help consumers access vital information more easily through improved navigation tools, guiding consumers to the appropriate condition-specific level of behavioral health is a challenge we are prioritizing. These new experiences have improved customer satisfaction and we are getting people to the right care more quickly. Behavioral health plays an integral role of the overall health and well-being of the people we serve. So you will all continue to \u2013 so you will continue to see us increasing access, quality and affordability in this clinically important and sensitive area. Another tenet of our consumer focus is meeting people where they are, which includes expanding our clinical capabilities to care for people, more holistically, in their homes. We know that at home care settings, especially for people with mobility challenges and highly complex health needs can improve outcomes, elevate patient experience and result in better care. So we bring together teams with medical, behavioral and palliative experience in addition to our home infusion capabilities of OptumRx. By doing so, we help patients and their families keep multiple chronic conditions in check while significantly reducing the need for care in acute and post-acute settings, a real positive for them. The expanding clinical breadth and deepening integration of our value-based care offerings are moving us beyond the confiance of traditional clinical settings, creating an opportunity for us to serve more people more effectively. With that, now I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. As those of you listening know well, numbers can tell a story and the story our numbers tell is one of broad-based growth and substantial near and long-term potential. So, let me walk through some of those numbers with you. In the third quarter, UnitedHealth Group revenues of $81 billion grew 12% or $8.6 billion, highlighted by broad-based double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Care patterns in the quarter remained similar to those of the second quarter and our planning for next year anticipates care patterns continue to normalize. We are encouraged to see people obtaining preventive screenings at levels broadly consistent with longer term norms. And we are maintaining our focus on getting people the care they need. And acuity patterns remain stable, but as always, we are highly respectful of and watchful for evolving medical cost trends. Looking now at the performance of our specific businesses. OptumHealth\u2019s third quarter revenue increased 34% year-over-year as revenue per consumer grew 31%. Growth continues to be led by the increasing number of patients served under value-based care relationships and the expanding types of care settings offered by Optum from meeting behavioral needs to comprehensively serving people in their homes, to higher acuity ambulatory surgery. OptumInsight\u2019s revenue grew 18% in the quarter, led by continued market growth across payer and provider services. And the revenue backlog increased by $1.8 billion year-over-year to $24.1 billion. OptumRx revenue grew 8%, reflecting growth in people served and continued expansion of the pharmacy care businesses, including specialty, home delivery and community pharmacies. Pharmacy care services revenue growth continues to show momentum growing double-digits in the quarter compared to the prior year. And new customer sales and retention have been strong. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, revenue grew by 11% with all businesses contributing. The number of people served domestically by our commercial insured offerings increased by more than 100,000 over the past half year as we continue to experience strong growth in our newer, more affordable consumer-centric offerings. Products such as Surest, which provides consumers with greater certainty and choice over their health benefits and also our virtual first health offerings. People served by our Medicare Advantage offerings continue to grow strongly, increasing 800,000 so far this year. The recently released 2024 plan year star ratings were consistent with our long-term planning expectations, with 81% of our members in 4-star or better plans, a level we expect will rise as planned refinements are finalized. UnitedHealthcare enters 2023 and serving more people in 4 and 5-star plans than any other health plan. The number of people we serve through our Medicaid offerings has grown by 350,000 year-to-date. Most recently, we were awarded the opportunity to continue to serve the people of Nebraska in TANF, CHIP and long-term care programs. UnitedHealthcare achieved the highest score both overall and in each of the individual categories, reflecting our ability to deliver differentiated solutions aligned to our state customers\u2019 needs. And we continue to see strength in our dual special needs offerings with exceptional consumer satisfaction, demonstrated by a net promoter score of 80. Our capital capacities remain strong. Year-to-date, adjusted cash flows from operations were $21 billion or 1.3x net income. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38%, providing ample ability to continue to further build upon vital capabilities, which benefit both the people we serve and the broader health system. And we have returned $10.5 billion to shareholders in the first 9 months of the year through dividends and share repurchases. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance this morning, we updated our 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.85 to $22.05 per share. So we think these numbers are telling the story of an enterprise striving to conclude a strong 2022, a year broadly featuring diversified growth today and making foundational investments for our long-term future. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. As is customary with the close of a third quarter, we will offer early observations about next year. While reserving most of this conversation for our November 29 investor conference. Our businesses are growing and operating well with strong momentum and a keen enterprise focus on executing on our strategic growth priorities. Among a few highlights. The OptumHealth care delivery businesses are rapidly advancing their value-based capacities, expanding the scope and settings of care offered and creating a long runway for growth. And we see our innovative and consistently highly valued Medicare Advantage plans as well positioned to grow strongly again next year. At this distance, we view a majority of the 2023 analyst estimates as reasonably reflecting performance levels we would expect to offer in November with the current consensus at the top end of our likely initial earnings outlook range. And as you have come to expect, we continue to strive toward our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth goal. We look forward to discussing this with you in much greater detail in person at our investor conference in New York. I hope you\u2019re getting a sense of an organization that has long been the case is focused sharply on executing with excellence in all we do, so that we can meet and exceed our commitments to our customers, clinicians, consumers and the communities we serve and, of course, to our employees and to you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions, one per caller please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will first hear from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the comments. As you think about \u201823 and you\u2019re going through the process of pricing discussions with your commercial employer groups and so forth. Is the basic concept \u2013 I know, John, you said continue to return to normal utilization. Is the basic view is that we would project a medical cost trend off of this year that\u2019s more in that traditional 4% or 5% range mid-single digits. And we\u2019ve heard some discussion about maybe there being an unusual bump up in addition to the medical \u2013 traditional medical cost trend to allocate something for providers dealing with their labor issues. Is your discussion with employers, is that something you\u2019re seeing getting put in place?\nAndrew Witty: So A.J., thanks so much for the question. And obviously, a key aspect of planning for next year that you\u2019re focused on. Just let me make a couple of broader comments and I might just ask Brian Thompson to reflect a little bit more detail on that as well from the UnitedHealthcare perspective. Obviously, for the last couple of years, there has been a lot of focus on the effect of COVID as you think about impacts on medical cost trend. I think as we\u2019ve rolled through this year, honestly, I think it\u2019s become much less about COVID. There is now I think there is a blend of possibly a little bit of COVID effect in the system, but cost of living effects, things like inflation, things like capacity constraints in the system as the labor market tightness has affected different parts of the system at different moments. So I think this whole issue has become actually more complicated in some ways because there is more influences on what you need to think through going forward. With that maybe sort of high-level perspective, maybe, Brian, you might just go a little deeper in terms of how you\u2019ve been translating some of that as you\u2019ve been thoughtful about pricing going forward.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, Andrew. Thank you, and thank you for the question, A.J. Brian Thompson here. As we do look forward, I would say that we have planned and price for our cost trend a little higher than historical norms. And I think to some of the points that Andrew made, some of them are pretty obvious and inevitable. The first just being the reality that 2022 is a lower starting point. In addition to that, contributing is labor and inflationary costs. And just being respectful of what we don\u2019t know, again, probably the pacing of care patterns and how they return to normal, certainly included in that. I would certainly suggest though at the same time, we\u2019re working really hard to manage down the impact of these trends on both our consumers and employers alike. And you mentioned how we\u2019re negotiating with our provider partners. I would say we\u2019ve really seen emergence of value-based arrangements at a faster pace than perhaps historically. So we\u2019re not just seeing unit costs accelerate at a higher rate. And in addition, just more product designs that are meaningfully lowering those price points for end consumers, whether it\u2019s virtually enriched products, we mentioned that a little bit. We\u2019ve talked a lot about surest and how that consumer choice model is really driving not only a lower price point. But first dollar coverage is really emerging as a priority for those folks that we support and serve every day. So those are some elements and dynamics not only in the product side, but how we\u2019re looking to our forward view of costs.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Brian, thanks so much. And I think, A.J., one of the key points, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have taken away from what Brian is saying there is, look, there is a degree of \u2013 there is some unavoidable pressures in the macro environment that everybody is well aware of but we\u2019re really doing something about that on behalf of our members and our clients and our customers. Our focus is to bring innovation into the marketplace, whether that\u2019s through the way we design plans like surest in UnitedHealthcare, the way we develop the value-based platform in OptumCare, all of which are designed develop to deliver high-quality care at more affordable levels for folks and then to ensure that, that is something that can rely on year after year after year. So a stability of confidence in the healthcare that they can come to expect. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re really viewing this. It\u2019s obviously a dynamic environment, but we\u2019re extremely focused, as you can tell, on making sure we have strong responses to it. Thanks, A.J. And next question please.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you refresh us on the components of OptumHealth and sort of how much of that revenue is now coming from OptumCare? And then how many of those consumers are within OptumHealth or actually OptumCare consumers and maybe how many are in some form of risk arrangement and then how many are full capitation? I think you\u2019ve given some of those numbers just looking for a refresh.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Josh, good to hear your voice, and thanks so much for the question. So a very good, very strong quarter, continued strong performance from OptumHealth overall. I\u2019ll pass in a second to Dr. Wyatt Decker to give you a little more flavor on that. Just let me pick out one of those aspects, which is a question you asked about the fully capitated lives within there. So if you think about OptumCare, obviously, a subset of OptumHealth has about 20 million or so folks who we look after through that platform. Probably, you\u2019re still a little under 15% of that number in fully capitation arrangements. So that really tells you \u2013 despite the very strong impact that\u2019s having, you can see the way that\u2019s reflected through this sustain 34% growth in average revenue per consumer served in OptumHealth. A lot of that is influenced by the capitation shift, but it\u2019s still a really small fraction of the total number of lives that we look after in that part of our organization. So a lot of runway there, and that\u2019s what really underpins our long-term confidence in sustained growth, particularly in OptumCare, which is a key piece of OptumHealth and maybe now pass to Wyatt to give you a little bit more context of how it all fits together. Wyatt?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thanks, Andrew, and thank you, Josh, for the question. Absolutely correct is the importance of capitated and value-based care to both our strategic business model to continue to offer comprehensive healthcare solutions to our nation citizens as well as to our optimistic outlook on growth. Today, over two-thirds of our revenue are derived from value-based care constructs, and that will continue to grow. As Andrew pointed out, we have ample pathways for growth. You\u2019ll see us going deeper and broader in the markets that we serve today as well as going into new markets like the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast. And what I am excited about is increasingly \u2013 we\u2019re bringing together the platforms that we have talked about historically and that Dirk touched on today. So think of home and community is helping us bring value-based constructs to a broader set of populations and servicing more comprehensively those we serve in OptumCare. So you\u2019ll hear me talking a lot about OptumHealth and our capitated and value-based risk labs because increasingly, we\u2019re bringing all of the services, behavioral, virtual, financial as well as clinics to bear to grow our value-based population. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, Wyatt. Josh thanks so much. Next question please, April.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I think non-COVID utilization has been running a bit below baseline this year, but you mentioned kind of care pattern is continuing to normalize. How are you thinking about that concept of normalization for both the fourth quarter? And can you maybe just talk about the factors that you think could have the biggest impact on the recovery in non-COVID utilization volumes as we get into next year?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Listen, Nathan, thanks for the question. As I said a little earlier, I think a good way to think about this is what has historically been a COVID narrative becomes much more a blended narrative around things like capacity constraints in the system, the cost-of-living folks\u2019 ability to \u2013 or desire to access the system right now, which is an area we are working super hard to try and ensure is sustained. Plus, of course, volatility in things like COVID and flu, particularly as you go through Q4, Q1 over the next few months. So I think all of that is essentially in the mix. We\u2019re taking, I think, a reasonably balanced view of how this is going to play out. We\u2019ve seen now for the bulk of this year, a reasonably stable pattern of care utilization across the portfolio. We are taking a normal year view for flu. So we\u2019re not particularly staking ourselves out to say flu is either going to be very low, as we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years, all very high. We just don\u2019t know. There is really no evidence to support any decision at this point in time. So we\u2019ve taken a very balanced view as we look forward into flu, which, as you well know, can affect Q4 or Q1 differentially year-to-year. And that\u2019s essentially how we\u2019re tackling all of this. We feel very confident about the way we\u2019re planning for the next quarter and particularly as we roll into next year. And obviously, we will course correct as things like flu reveal themselves to us. Thanks for the question. Next question.\nOperator: Justin Lake, Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of membership questions. First, I would love to hear your thoughts on the potential for what happens with Medicaid membership in your mind post redeterminations kind of starting? And then any kind of early view on Medicare Advantage, given the open enrollment kicked in here, what do you think for 2023 in terms of the market? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Justin. So I\u2019ll ask Tim Spilker and then Tim Noel to comment in a second. Just a couple of kind of introductory thoughts really on your questions, as I said in my prepared comments at the beginning of the call, Justin, redeterminations is a really important potential issue for next year and is something that, as an organization, we are going to \u2013 we are really leaning into. We\u2019re very focused on, and that\u2019s because we\u2019re concerned that through a redetermination cycle during \u201823 and \u201824, depending on when the public health emergency comes to an end, could lead to a situation where folks get dislodged from their coverage. And that would be a huge setback in terms of the progress that\u2019s been made over the last many years to extend cover. So we are really focused on how we can ensure that people are retained coverage. Tim will talk in a second around some of the ways in which we feel confident we can help but it is a really important area, and it\u2019s an area where we hope the entire industry and its participants all lean in to make sure that people don\u2019t get lost in the system as things go through a redetermination cycle. So that\u2019s going to be a super important area. Let me ask Tim Spilker to go a little deeper on that and then pass straight to Noel to talk about open enrollment. Go ahead.\nTim Spilker: Yes. Thanks for the question. So first, maybe just some of the numbers, so we\u2019re assuming the PHE will end in January and redeterminations will resume in Q1. And we will share more detail in November around the specifics, but we\u2019re very respectful of a variety of factors that are in play. Certainly, the pacing that will vary by state and then, of course, how consumers respond and behave in terms of the change. So as Andrew mentioned, we\u2019re working hard with our customers. This will be a big lift for states, a really long-term effort over the course of 12 to 14 months. So we\u2019re trying to do our part through data sharing, through outreach to consumers, engaging communities, engaging providers and then really connecting with individuals where they access care, so places like pharmacies. So we\u2019re proud of that work, and we\u2019re proud of our ability to be able to support members as they go through this change. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Tim.\nTim Noel: Yes, good morning. Justin thanks for the question. Tim Noel here. So first, if I may start just with kind of an end cap on 2022, John mentioned in the opening remarks that right now, we\u2019ve grown about 800,000 Medicare lives and that\u2019s consistent with the guidance we gave at our investor conference last year and we are on pace to end this year \u201822 with full year growth of 900,000 lives. So feel good about the way our value proposition has resonated in \u201822 and feel like that momentum will head into 2023. So, great feedback from the broker community around our product positioning, how we are investing, our emphasis on investments in the most utilized benefits like drugs and like dental benefits. So, feel very good heading into AEP tomorrow. With respect to the industry, over the long-term basis, we have kind of guided to 8% to 9% Medicare Advantage industry growth. I don\u2019t have any reason to see it differently from this vantage point for 2023. And once again, I like my chances to outperform the industry in \u201823 and have share gaining growth.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Tim. Next question please.\nOperator: Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Yes. Hi. Thanks. Wanted to ask about OptumInsight, as you work to grow this business and add new anchor partners, I would love to hear what you are hearing from your health system customers given the challenges they are facing. How is the pipeline developing? Can you remind us, I guess how much revenue coverage you have for next year at this point? And then just lastly, any update on expectations for change accretion post the divestiture of claims expense. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Hi Stephen, thanks so much for the question. I am going to ask Dan Schumacher to respond to the first part of that question, and then John Rex will pick up the point on the change accretion piece. So Dan, go ahead.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Thank you, Stephen. Appreciate the question. Obviously, health system partners are under a lot of pressure. And we talked about some of them from the macroeconomic backdrop in terms of shifting side of care and labor shortages, wage inflation, things like that. So, as we engage with the market, we find that health systems are very responsive because we present an opportunity to be able to address some of those short-term needs, but then really importantly, on the mid to long-term, we become a key accelerant in some of their transformation initiatives, things like their preparedness for value-based care as an example, or how they engage digitally with patients. And so those are some of the areas that we have been expanding our reach. We have a robust pipeline, and that pipeline has been growing and conversations have been advancing. And what\u2019s been really encouraging is from our existing relationships, we have been able to drive really strong outcomes, and that gives us confidence around the performance. And so we are excited to see how that develops over time and that will continue to be a contributor. In terms of \u2013 our backlog, it represents about a quarter of our backlog and not surprisingly less in terms of current revenue contribution. And as it relates to coverage into next year, we have well north of half coverage on revenue as we look into next year.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Dan. John?\nJohn Rex: Yes. On accretion for change, so yes, it will be accretive next year. In terms of the magnitude of that, really, the important factors and considerations are when it closes within the year, certain expectations in terms of the integration costs that we will \u2013 and investments we will like to make in the business and when we get that done earlier in the year versus later in the year for a close and then what it has in terms of impact on the out year an important consideration as we bring that in, I think a full out year view. Also, as I am sure you are very aware, the divestiture that occurred in terms of \u2013 with the closing also having an impact on the magnitude of that. So, two important things there. Maybe just actually knowing that you have got models to do here also and as you think about it, 4Q and how that might play in the 4Q. So, we wouldn\u2019t expect a change to be additive to OptumInsight\u2019s operating earnings in the fourth quarter. A few elements on that. One, the second half for changes. I know you understand well, is it\u2019s lower half seasonally in terms of earnings. First half typically considerably stronger than the second half. So, the impact there and how that comes in. Clearly, there will be transaction costs that we will be incurring here. So, really, as you think about your modeling purposes, roughly in the zone of $800 million of revenue coming in to the OptumInsight segment without any impact on operating earnings. And of course, coming back on my comments is how we think about impact going forward. We will look to the point \u2013 to the extent possible, do any acceleration on other important integration activities. So, we can bring the potential benefits of the combination of OptumInsight and change to the health system more quickly, could see that potentially in the over $100 million in terms of incremental cost that we might look to do and pull that ahead. But all of that is incorporated in the 2020 \u2013 in the outlook that we provided this morning, the \u201822 outlook and our \u201823 observations also. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. And I think John tees up a really important point that I just want to reemphasize, which is within the guidance we have given you today for the closeout of \u201822 and \u201823, not only are we anticipating obviously continued very strong growth in revenues and the consequential flow through the business. But you are also seeing us create the space to make sure we can make the right investments. So, whether that\u2019s in making sure we get the integration of change done as promptly as we can, whether it\u2019s how we invest in our consumer capabilities, which really started to get going in Q3 and will continue through Q4 and beyond or whether it\u2019s increasing our investment in our employees to make sure that we are responsive to the cost of living pressures. So, really important that you see that and very much taken into consideration as we thought through our work going forward. The other thing I would just also add is that I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I think you all understand how important the change integration is for OptumInsight. This is \u2013 it\u2019s a great moment to bring together tremendous complementary skills, capabilities, technologies, perspectives on the marketplace. And so as we roll through the next two quarters or three quarters, we really anticipate a kind of new OptumInsight emerging from this integration. And we are very excited to have Neil de Crescenzo as well as Dan Schumacher working together to lead these two organizations as this work goes on. So, a lot of energy potentially being released in this space. And as John said, we have incorporated into our guidance points the space to potentially make the right investments going forward. Next question?\nOperator: Scott Fidel of Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I know that continuity of care has been a big focus here, especially with redeterminations coming back. And just interested in that context how you are thinking about potential footprint expansions in the ACA exchanges for 2023 and beyond. It looks like also there has been some favorable policy developments and then some competitive changes to that could be positive for the market. So, just interested in your thinking on exchange strategy for both next year and longer term. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: I really appreciate that question. As you know, this is an area where we have been building up very substantially over the last couple or 3 years and maybe ask Brian to give you a little bit more detail on that.\nBrian Thompson: Sure Andrew. Thanks for the question, Scott. And we agree totally. We see the exchanges is really emerging as a meaningful place and a broader coverage criteria across this country. And it\u2019s certainly important to us to be more relevant each and every year. In fact, while we are expanding into four new states in 2023, our footprint is expanding meaningfully. I think we are going from around 40% of the addressable market here, leaving 2022 to nearly two-thirds by the end of next year and again \u2013 or by the start of next year, I should suggest. So, again, reasons aligned with yours. It\u2019s important that we are where folks are. And as we manage through this redetermination process working not only with our employer partners or distribution partners in our states, but making sure we have product ourselves to make sure that these folks can get enrolled in. And we are encouraged by our progress. We like how we are positioned here, leaving 2022 both from a footprint and receptivity and growth and a performance perspective and looking forward to expanding again in \u201823.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Brian. Thank you for that question. Next question please.\nOperator: Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I want to go back to trend, again, if I can. Can you give a little more color in the quarter about how trends looked across the three different payers? And when you talk about normalization in 2023, should we expect all three of them to be kind of back to normal, or do you have a view that the government, which has been lagging a little bit, will still kind of take a little bit longer to get back to normal. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Kevin, thanks so much for the question. Maybe I will ask Brian to make a couple of comments on that.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Hi. Thanks for the question, Kevin. Maybe I will start with service type, and it\u2019s really a focus on inpatient, that has been the driver, and it really was the driver last quarter as well. So, when I look at third quarter, it\u2019s largely a repeat of what we saw in the second quarter. Beyond inpatient, some variation, I would say, all other service types to largely near at or even slightly above normal levels. To your question, though, on lines of business, I might just suggest other than inpatient commercial, pretty much at normal care patterns. Medicare is seeing some interesting developments. I would say maybe signs of more durable shifts inside of service, particularly urgent care is a little lower, excuse me, a little higher, but ER is a little lower, and that\u2019s certainly a good trade for the system overall. Outpatient surgeries in Medicare seem to be back to normal. But again, as I had mentioned, inpatient a little bit lower. And again, Medicaid, consistent with the other lines of business, lower in inpatient and physicians starting to trend back. So, again, that\u2019s largely a repeat of what I had suggested last quarter inpatient really being the most notable element inside it.\nAndrew Witty: Brian, thanks so much, and thank you for the question Kevin. Next question please.\nOperator: Next we have from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much for taking my question. When we think about membership in the commercial market, I am just curious how employers are currently talking to you about that trend going into \u201823. And if you can just give us an update on your thoughts around if we move into a recessionary type of environment what that could mean for the health plan business?\nAndrew Witty: Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And I will pass that actually to our new Head of ENI, our commercial insurance business, Dan Keuter. Dan, would you like to answer that?\nDan Keuter: Yes. Thanks Andrew for the introduction. And Lisa thanks for the question. As you know, at this point in the year, our national accounts business for 2023 is largely resolved, but the other segments of our business are not resolved. As we look at that national accounts performance, we are very pleased with what we have seen in terms of a very strong renewal year and also a strong sales year, which leaves us I am confident in a growth year for national accounts for 2023. The other lines of the business are yet to resolve. Specifically related to your question about recessionary impacts, we are certainly well aware of those. However, I would note at this point, based on our Q3 performance, we have seen net hiring among our customers. So, we have not yet seen an emergence of recessionary impact in our commercial book of business. Looking forward to 2023, we will assess the continued evolving economic situation and provide additional guidance as that becomes more clear. Thanks for your question, Lisa.\nAndrew Witty: Dan, thank you very much for that and Lisa, thank you for the question. So, last question, please, operator.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our final question for today will come from Gary Taylor of Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. I just want to come back to \u201823 for a moment. I think the current Street consensus is about 13% earnings growth off your updated \u201822 guidance. And I was hoping maybe this would be a year where you wouldn\u2019t have to say initially that look to be at the high end of the initial range. And obviously, I understand guidance has often come up over the course of the year. But when I think about \u201823, I just want to make sure I am capturing what you are saying. You talked about redeterminations. You talked about some incremental investments in consumer and employees. And you also talked about, I think, just sort of healthy respect, as you might call it, for maybe utilization continuing to normalize. Could you rank those for us in terms of how you are thinking those headwinds weigh on \u201823 a little bit? Is there anything else you would say is material enough to add to that list?\nAndrew Witty: Gary, thanks so much for the questions. I mean if you kind of just think about the blend of headwinds, tailwinds for 2023, in terms of headwinds, I would probably say the external environment, the inflationary pressures, obviously, in among that mix. Question on whether or not we see any kind of economic slowdown as you just heard, we are not really seeing that yet in terms of our marketplace, but we have got to be thoughtful about that, and we want to make sure that we go into the year, not assuming anything overly optimistic. It would be great to have pleasant surprises on that dimension, of course, utilization levels, I spent a lot of time on this call talking about that as we start to see that continue to normalize. And then the investments, I mean those are really the four areas of investments in our business and you recited those very nicely. Now on the other side, you think about the tailwinds for the business. Very strong income and momentum for the organization. OptumHealth\u2019s growth in patients served, the evolution of the at-home platform, which has got over the last 2.5 years, 3 years, has moved to a very significant scale, complementing our clinic platform, strong capabilities that we are demonstrating in Medicare Advantage. You look at those really driving tailwinds for the organization, very substantial. The scale of those organizations and what we are able to do very material. And then I would also say our ability to continue to deploy capital effectively in the marketplace is another one of the things to really think about. And it\u2019s interesting, actually, just to pause for a second today and contrast where we are today versus where we were a year ago. So, year-to-date 2021, we have deployed about $5 billion of capital in M&A, which was about the full year number in the end. As of today, we have spent $20 billion in 2022. So, in terms of our ramp-up of capital deployment, and you heard from John Rex earlier, we have very substantial continued capacity. And obviously, the marketplace is getting interesting around that space. We have talked several times to you in the past about the diverse pipeline of opportunities that we see probably as diverse as we have ever seen. Very much opportunities we see across a number of our key growth platforms. And as we all know, the market is beginning to be very discriminating in terms of value. So, we will see how that plays out for us, but I think you have to expect that to be a tailwind for us as well going into next year. With that, Gary, thanks so much for the question. And thanks, everybody, for your time and questions today. We do hope you are taking away the impression of a company confident in its opportunities and ability to grow. Deeply aware of where and how we need to continue to build and improve and fully committed to our mission of helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. I want to thank you for your attention and we look forward to meeting many of you in person in New York later in the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dirk McMahon",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. As Andrew just mentioned, we are very excited about the recent combination of Change Healthcare and OptumInsight. With a grand total of 11 days of integration work behind us, I thought I would provide a bit more commentary on how together we can make the health system simpler and more efficient. Overall, Change brings a robust transaction network built on strong payer and provider connectivity. Together, our focus areas include: first, improving the quality of health care delivery by offering critical point-of-care insights aligned to evidence-based medical standards within the workflow of physicians; second, simplifying administration by fully automating claims transactions, including editing in the EDI stream, improving claim accuracy; lastly, we are reducing friction in the payment process by providing patient benefits and payment obligations at point of service and applying payment integrity at its upfront. Our teams have started out of the gate working intensively together to make these visions a reality and to create the next era of growth for OptumInsight. We are very confident that our combined capabilities will enable us to better serve all healthcare constituents. Beyond OptumInsight, as you might imagine, I spend a lot of time engaging customers of all sizes, operating in almost every sector and representing diverse employee populations. Across these customers, no matter the person or the industry, I hear the same consistent message. The need for deeper levels of support and more resources to comprehensively meet health needs in both the traditional, but also increasingly focused on behavioral health. Companies want to provide a broader range of resources and deeper levels of support for their employees and their families and the groundwork we have been building is resonating in this rapidly evolving area. Here is what we are doing about it. First, we are tackling access. We have expanded our behavioral health network by 25% over the last couple of years, including a growing complement of behavioral clinical practices owned and operated by Optum. And as many of you know, behavioral health is a 24/7 challenge. So we are continuing to expand our portfolio of digital offerings supporting a range of needs, allowing patients to get resources when they need them. We have also made significant improvements to help consumers access vital information more easily through improved navigation tools, guiding consumers to the appropriate condition-specific level of behavioral health is a challenge we are prioritizing. These new experiences have improved customer satisfaction and we are getting people to the right care more quickly. Behavioral health plays an integral role of the overall health and well-being of the people we serve. So you will all continue to \u2013 so you will continue to see us increasing access, quality and affordability in this clinically important and sensitive area. Another tenet of our consumer focus is meeting people where they are, which includes expanding our clinical capabilities to care for people, more holistically, in their homes. We know that at home care settings, especially for people with mobility challenges and highly complex health needs can improve outcomes, elevate patient experience and result in better care. So we bring together teams with medical, behavioral and palliative experience in addition to our home infusion capabilities of OptumRx. By doing so, we help patients and their families keep multiple chronic conditions in check while significantly reducing the need for care in acute and post-acute settings, a real positive for them. The expanding clinical breadth and deepening integration of our value-based care offerings are moving us beyond the confiance of traditional clinical settings, creating an opportunity for us to serve more people more effectively. With that, now I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."

            "name": "Wyatt Decker",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Andrew, and thank you, Josh, for the question. Absolutely correct is the importance of capitated and value-based care to both our strategic business model to continue to offer comprehensive healthcare solutions to our nation citizens as well as to our optimistic outlook on growth. Today, over two-thirds of our revenue are derived from value-based care constructs, and that will continue to grow. As Andrew pointed out, we have ample pathways for growth. You'll see us going deeper and broader in the markets that we serve today as well as going into new markets like the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast. And what I am excited about is increasingly \u2013 we're bringing together the platforms that we have talked about historically and that Dirk touched on today. So think of home and community is helping us bring value-based constructs to a broader set of populations and servicing more comprehensively those we serve in OptumCare. So you'll hear me talking a lot about OptumHealth and our capitated and value-based risk labs because increasingly, we're bringing all of the services, behavioral, virtual, financial as well as clinics to bear to grow our value-based population. Thank you."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question. So first, maybe just some of the numbers, so we're assuming the PHE will end in January and redeterminations will resume in Q1. And we will share more detail in November around the specifics, but we're very respectful of a variety of factors that are in play. Certainly, the pacing that will vary by state and then, of course, how consumers respond and behave in terms of the change. So as Andrew mentioned, we're working hard with our customers. This will be a big lift for states, a really long-term effort over the course of 12 to 14 months. So we're trying to do our part through data sharing, through outreach to consumers, engaging communities, engaging providers and then really connecting with individuals where they access care, so places like pharmacies. So we're proud of that work, and we're proud of our ability to be able to support members as they go through this change. With that, I'll hand it over to Tim."

            "name": "Brian Thompson",
            "content": "Sure, Andrew. Thank you, and thank you for the question, A.J. Brian Thompson here. As we do look forward, I would say that we have planned and price for our cost trend a little higher than historical norms. And I think to some of the points that Andrew made, some of them are pretty obvious and inevitable. The first just being the reality that 2022 is a lower starting point. In addition to that, contributing is labor and inflationary costs. And just being respectful of what we don't know, again, probably the pacing of care patterns and how they return to normal, certainly included in that. I would certainly suggest though at the same time, we're working really hard to manage down the impact of these trends on both our consumers and employers alike. And you mentioned how we're negotiating with our provider partners. I would say we've really seen emergence of value-based arrangements at a faster pace than perhaps historically. So we're not just seeing unit costs accelerate at a higher rate. And in addition, just more product designs that are meaningfully lowering those price points for end consumers, whether it's virtually enriched products, we mentioned that a little bit. We've talked a lot about surest and how that consumer choice model is really driving not only a lower price point. But first dollar coverage is really emerging as a priority for those folks that we support and serve every day. So those are some elements and dynamics not only in the product side, but how we're looking to our forward view of costs. Sure Andrew. Thanks for the question, Scott. And we agree totally. We see the exchanges is really emerging as a meaningful place and a broader coverage criteria across this country. And it's certainly important to us to be more relevant each and every year. In fact, while we are expanding into four new states in 2023, our footprint is expanding meaningfully.

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As we approach the final stretch of 2022, let me start by recognizing our colleagues, the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare who continue to work diligently day in and day out for those we serve. Their efforts allow us to deliver durable and balanced growth and to increase our 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.85 to $22.05 per share. As an enterprise, we remain focused on our mission and on advancing our growth strategies. Our aim is to serve more people through value-based care and expanded health benefits offerings, a robust foundation on which to consistently drive strong growth into 2023 and beyond. Consumers want value, especially in the current economic environment and that means high-quality care that is more accessible, more affordable and more responsive to their individual needs. In the past quarter, we have accelerated efforts to deliver on this critical consumer proposition, launching several initiatives to reach more people in more communities while deepening relationships with those we already serve. For example, in September, we announced a long-term collaboration with Walmart to provide Optum technology and expertise that will enable America's largest retailer to provide value-based care to consumers in its clinics. Starting in 2023, we will jointly develop 15 Walmart health clinics in Florida and Georgia and will extend into additional geographies over time. As we expand the collaboration, there will be broad opportunities to address social determinants of health by improving access to benefits such as healthy foods, medications, dental and vision services and more. We also launched a distinctive partnership with Red Ventures, a digital media company connecting tens of millions of consumers each month to its clients' products and services, through a broad portfolio of proprietary digital content platforms. This partnership called RVO Health combines Red Ventures popular health and wellness platforms, including health line and health grades, with Optum's consumer marketplace, the Optum Store and the Optum Perks prescription discount card. RVO Health will enable us to engage with more than 100 million active monthly visitors seeking the health advice and insights they need introducing them to relevant products and services through a customized end-to-end digital platform. Affordability is an essential component of value in healthcare, especially when it determines access to the life-saving medicines people need for themselves and their families. In July, we announced zero consumer cost share on drugs for diabetes, severe allergic reactions and other emergency situations starting in January for those we serve with commercial insured benefits. Now, we are working with self-funded employers who are exploring how they can provide these vital medications for zero co-pay. So far, this benefit will be available to more than 1 million additional people and we are actively engaging with many additional employers. We are also improving access to essential medicines for those even without health benefits coverage. For example, Optum Store launched a new partnership with Sanofi to help consumers without insurance obtain insulin for $35 a month and they will be able to have it delivered to their home. Turning to health benefits, today, nearly half of American seniors are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans compared to about 25% a decade ago. And MA plays a vital role in serving those consumers who are significantly more diverse, have lower incomes and more complex care needs than the average senior. There are compelling reasons why seniors increasingly choose MA. Through Medicare Advantage, people are experiencing better health outcomes than in traditional fee-for-service Medicare across a wide spectrum of measures. For example, MA members with diabetes have over 50% lower rates of any category of complication and over 70% lower rates of serious complication. This is due to our ability to provide deeper, more coordinated levels of care, and this is accomplished at lower cost. People served by MA spend as much as 40% less compared to those in Medicare fee-for-service. And this high value for people is delivered at a lower net cost to the government. We are confident our differentiated offerings will once again this year resonate with consumers who are even more focused on affordability, value and simplicity given the rising cost of daily life. Today, in the United States, more people than ever have access to health benefits, an important milestone on the path towards universal coverage, an objective we have long supported. Much of this expanded coverage has occurred in Medicaid. Looking to 2023 and given the potential resumption of eligibility redeterminations next year, a high priority for our team is assuring continuity of access and care for those we serve. The initiatives our team is pursuing to help assure continuous coverage include launching direct outreach and partnering with states and community organizations to identify those at risk and help them retain their benefit coverage, partnering with national retailers and pharmacies to educate consumers about available coverage options and assistance while they are shopping in store and engaging with employers to extend annual enrollment periods and drive education efforts to employees who are eligible for coverage. Underpinning our growing consumer agenda is an ambitious multiyear effort to deepen and expand our enterprise technology capabilities. The recent combination of OptumInsight and Change Healthcare reflects our accelerating efforts to help create more effective and simple experiences for consumers, payers and care providers while lowering costs across the health system. I want to formally welcome our newest colleagues, the talented and compassionate team at Change Healthcare, with whom we have just started working to build upon our shared vision for a more effective and adaptive health system for all participants. With that, I will turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon. Thanks, John. As is customary with the close of a third quarter, we will offer early observations about next year. While reserving most of this conversation for our November 29 investor conference. Our businesses are growing and operating well with strong momentum and a keen enterprise focus on executing on our strategic growth priorities. Among a few highlights. The OptumHealth care delivery businesses are rapidly advancing their value-based capacities, expanding the scope and settings of care offered and creating a long runway for growth. And we see our innovative and consistently highly valued Medicare Advantage plans as well positioned to grow strongly again next year. At this distance, we view a majority of the 2023 analyst estimates as reasonably reflecting performance levels we would expect to offer in November with the current consensus at the top end of our likely initial earnings outlook range. And as you have come to expect, we continue to strive toward our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth goal. We look forward to discussing this with you in much greater detail in person at our investor conference in New York. I hope you're getting a sense of an organization that has long been the case is focused sharply on executing with excellence in all we do, so that we can meet and exceed our commitments to our customers, clinicians, consumers and the communities we serve and, of course, to our employees and to you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions, one per caller please. So A.J., thanks so much for the question. And obviously, a key aspect of planning for next year that you're focused on. Just let me make a couple of broader comments and I might just ask Brian Thompson to reflect a little bit more detail on that as well from the UnitedHealthcare perspective. Obviously, for the last couple of years, there has been a lot of focus on the effect of COVID as you think about impacts on medical cost trend. I think as we've rolled through this year, honestly, I think it's become much less about COVID. There is now I think there is a blend of possibly a little bit of COVID effect in the system, but cost of living effects, things like inflation, things like capacity constraints in the system as the labor market tightness has affected different parts of the system at different moments. So I think this whole issue has become actually more complicated in some ways because there is more influences on what you need to think through going forward. With that maybe sort of high-level perspective, maybe, Brian, you might just go a little deeper in terms of how you've been translating some of that as you've been thoughtful about pricing going forward. Yes. Brian, thanks so much. And I think, A.J., one of the key points, I'm sure you'll have taken away from what Brian is saying there is, look, there is a degree of \u2013 there is some unavoidable pressures in the macro environment that everybody is well aware of but we're really doing something about that on behalf of our members and our clients and our customers. Our focus is to bring innovation into the marketplace, whether that's through the way we design plans like surest in UnitedHealthcare, the way we develop the value-based platform in OptumCare, all of which are designed develop to deliver high-quality care at more affordable levels for folks and then to ensure that, that is something that can rely on year after year after year. So a stability of confidence in the healthcare that they can come to expect. So that's how we're really viewing this. It's obviously a dynamic environment, but we're extremely focused, as you can tell, on making sure we have strong responses to it. Thanks, A.J. And next question please. Yes, Josh, good to hear your voice, and thanks so much for the question. So a very good, very strong quarter, continued strong performance from OptumHealth overall. I'll pass in a second to Dr. Wyatt Decker to give you a little more flavor on that. Just let me pick out one of those aspects, which is a question you asked about the fully capitated lives within there. So if you think about OptumCare, obviously, a subset of OptumHealth has about 20 million or so folks who we look after through that platform. Probably, you're still a little under 15% of that number in fully capitation arrangements. So that really tells you \u2013 despite the very strong impact that's having, you can see the way that's reflected through this sustain 34% growth in average revenue per consumer served in OptumHealth. A lot of that is influenced by the capitation shift, but it's still a really small fraction of the total number of lives that we look after in that part of our organization. So a lot of runway there, and that's what really underpins our long-term confidence in sustained growth, particularly in OptumCare, which is a key piece of OptumHealth and maybe now pass to Wyatt to give you a little bit more context of how it all fits together. Wyatt? Thank you, Wyatt. Josh thanks so much. Next question please, April. Yes. Listen, Nathan, thanks for the question. As I said a little earlier, I think a good way to think about this is what has historically been a COVID narrative becomes much more a blended narrative around things like capacity constraints in the system, the cost-of-living folks' ability to \u2013 or desire to access the system right now, which is an area we are working super hard to try and ensure is sustained. Plus, of course, volatility in things like COVID and flu, particularly as you go through Q4, Q1 over the next few months. So I think all of that is essentially in the mix. We're taking, I think, a reasonably balanced view of how this is going to play out. We've seen now for the bulk of this year, a reasonably stable pattern of care utilization across the portfolio. We are taking a normal year view for flu. So we're not particularly staking ourselves out to say flu is either going to be very low, as we've seen in the last couple of years, all very high. We just don't know. There is really no evidence to support any decision at this point in time. So we've taken a very balanced view as we look forward into flu, which, as you well know, can affect Q4 or Q1 differentially year-to-year. And that's essentially how we're tackling all of this. We feel very confident about the way we're planning for the next quarter and particularly as we roll into next year. And obviously, we will course correct as things like flu reveal themselves to us. Thanks for the question. Next question. Thanks, Justin. So I'll ask Tim Spilker and then Tim Noel to comment in a second. Just a couple of kind of introductory thoughts really on your questions, as I said in my prepared comments at the beginning of the call, Justin, redeterminations is a really important potential issue for next year and is something that, as an organization, we are going to \u2013 we are really leaning into. We're very focused on, and that's because we're concerned that through a redetermination cycle during \u201823 and \u201824, depending on when the public health emergency comes to an end, could lead to a situation where folks get dislodged from their coverage. And that would be a huge setback in terms of the progress that's been made over the last many years to extend cover. So we are really focused on how we can ensure that people are retained coverage. Tim will talk in a second around some of the ways in which we feel confident we can help but it is a really important area, and it's an area where we hope the entire industry and its participants all lean in to make sure that people don't get lost in the system as things go through a redetermination cycle. So that's going to be a super important area. Let me ask Tim Spilker to go a little deeper on that and then pass straight to Noel to talk about open enrollment. Go ahead. Thanks Tim. Next question please. Hi Stephen, thanks so much for the question. I am going to ask Dan Schumacher to respond to the first part of that question, and then John Rex will pick up the point on the change accretion piece. So Dan, go ahead. Thanks Dan. John? Thanks John. And I think John tees up a really important point that I just want to reemphasize, which is within the guidance we have given you today for the closeout of \u201822 and \u201823, not only are we anticipating obviously continued very strong growth in revenues and the consequential flow through the business. But you are also seeing us create the space to make sure we can make the right investments. So, whether that's in making sure we get the integration of change done as promptly as we can, whether it's how we invest in our consumer capabilities, which really started to get going in Q3 and will continue through Q4 and beyond or whether it's increasing our investment in our employees to make sure that we are responsive to the cost of living pressures. So, really important that you see that and very much taken into consideration as we thought through our work going forward. The other thing I would just also add is that I don't want to \u2013 I think you all understand how important the change integration is for OptumInsight. This is \u2013 it's a great moment to bring together tremendous complementary skills, capabilities, technologies, perspectives on the marketplace. And so as we roll through the next two quarters or three quarters, we really anticipate a kind of new OptumInsight emerging from this integration. And we are very excited to have Neil de Crescenzo as well as Dan Schumacher working together to lead these two organizations as this work goes on. So, a lot of energy potentially being released in this space. And as John said, we have incorporated into our guidance points the space to potentially make the right investments going forward. Next question? I really appreciate that question. As you know, this is an area where we have been building up very substantially over the last couple or 3 years and maybe ask Brian to give you a little bit more detail on that. Great. Thanks so much, Brian. Thank you for that question. Next question please. Kevin, thanks so much for the question. Maybe I will ask Brian to make a couple of comments on that. Brian, thanks so much, and thank you for the question Kevin. Next question please. Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And I will pass that actually to our new Head of ENI, our commercial insurance business, Dan Keuter. Dan, would you like to answer that? Dan, thank you very much for that and Lisa, thank you for the question. So, last question, please, operator. Gary, thanks so much for the questions. I mean if you kind of just think about the blend of headwinds, tailwinds for 2023, in terms of headwinds, I would probably say the external environment, the inflationary pressures, obviously, in among that mix. Question on whether or not we see any kind of economic slowdown as you just heard, we are not really seeing that yet in terms of our marketplace, but we have got to be thoughtful about that, and we want to make sure that we go into the year, not assuming anything overly optimistic. It would be great to have pleasant surprises on that dimension, of course, utilization levels, I spent a lot of time on this call talking about that as we start to see that continue to normalize. And then the investments, I mean those are really the four areas of investments in our business and you recited those very nicely. Now on the other side, you think about the tailwinds for the business. Very strong income and momentum for the organization. OptumHealth's growth in patients served, the evolution of the at-home platform, which has got over the last 2.5 years, 3 years, has moved to a very significant scale, complementing our clinic platform, strong capabilities that we are demonstrating in Medicare Advantage. You look at those really driving tailwinds for the organization, very substantial. The scale of those organizations and what we are able to do very material. And then I would also say our ability to continue to deploy capital effectively in the marketplace is another one of the things to really think about. And it's interesting, actually, just to pause for a second today and contrast where we are today versus where we were a year ago. So, year-to-date 2021, we have deployed about $5 billion of capital in M&A, which was about the full year number in the end. As of today, we have spent $20 billion in 2022. So, in terms of our ramp-up of capital deployment, and you heard from John Rex earlier, we have very substantial continued capacity. And obviously, the marketplace is getting interesting around that space. We have talked several times to you in the past about the diverse pipeline of opportunities that we see probably as diverse as we have ever seen. Very much opportunities we see across a number of our key growth platforms. And as we all know, the market is beginning to be very discriminating in terms of value. So, we will see how that plays out for us, but I think you have to expect that to be a tailwind for us as well going into next year. With that, Gary, thanks so much for the question. And thanks, everybody, for your time and questions today. We do hope you are taking away the impression of a company confident in its opportunities and ability to grow. Deeply aware of where and how we need to continue to build and improve and fully committed to our mission of helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. I want to thank you for your attention and we look forward to meeting many of you in person in New York later in the quarter. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Dirk. As those of you listening know well, numbers can tell a story and the story our numbers tell is one of broad-based growth and substantial near and long-term potential. So, let me walk through some of those numbers with you. In the third quarter, UnitedHealth Group revenues of $81 billion grew 12% or $8.6 billion, highlighted by broad-based double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Care patterns in the quarter remained similar to those of the second quarter and our planning for next year anticipates care patterns continue to normalize. We are encouraged to see people obtaining preventive screenings at levels broadly consistent with longer term norms. And we are maintaining our focus on getting people the care they need. And acuity patterns remain stable, but as always, we are highly respectful of and watchful for evolving medical cost trends. Looking now at the performance of our specific businesses. OptumHealth's third quarter revenue increased 34% year-over-year as revenue per consumer grew 31%. Growth continues to be led by the increasing number of patients served under value-based care relationships and the expanding types of care settings offered by Optum from meeting behavioral needs to comprehensively serving people in their homes, to higher acuity ambulatory surgery. OptumInsight's revenue grew 18% in the quarter, led by continued market growth across payer and provider services. And the revenue backlog increased by $1.8 billion year-over-year to $24.1 billion. OptumRx revenue grew 8%, reflecting growth in people served and continued expansion of the pharmacy care businesses, including specialty, home delivery and community pharmacies. Pharmacy care services revenue growth continues to show momentum growing double-digits in the quarter compared to the prior year. And new customer sales and retention have been strong. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, revenue grew by 11% with all businesses contributing. The number of people served domestically by our commercial insured offerings increased by more than 100,000 over the past half year as we continue to experience strong growth in our newer, more affordable consumer-centric offerings. Products such as Surest, which provides consumers with greater certainty and choice over their health benefits and also our virtual first health offerings. People served by our Medicare Advantage offerings continue to grow strongly, increasing 800,000 so far this year. The recently released 2024 plan year star ratings were consistent with our long-term planning expectations, with 81% of our members in 4-star or better plans, a level we expect will rise as planned refinements are finalized. UnitedHealthcare enters 2023 and serving more people in 4 and 5-star plans than any other health plan. The number of people we serve through our Medicaid offerings has grown by 350,000 year-to-date. Most recently, we were awarded the opportunity to continue to serve the people of Nebraska in TANF, CHIP and long-term care programs. UnitedHealthcare achieved the highest score both overall and in each of the individual categories, reflecting our ability to deliver differentiated solutions aligned to our state customers' needs. And we continue to see strength in our dual special needs offerings with exceptional consumer satisfaction, demonstrated by a net promoter score of 80. Our capital capacities remain strong. Year-to-date, adjusted cash flows from operations were $21 billion or 1.3x net income. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38%, providing ample ability to continue to further build upon vital capabilities, which benefit both the people we serve and the broader health system. And we have returned $10.5 billion to shareholders in the first 9 months of the year through dividends and share repurchases. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance this morning, we updated our 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.85 to $22.05 per share. So we think these numbers are telling the story of an enterprise striving to conclude a strong 2022, a year broadly featuring diversified growth today and making foundational investments for our long-term future. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew. Yes. On accretion for change, so yes, it will be accretive next year. In terms of the magnitude of that, really, the important factors and considerations are when it closes within the year, certain expectations in terms of the integration costs that we will \u2013 and investments we will like to make in the business and when we get that done earlier in the year versus later in the year for a close and then what it has in terms of impact on the out year an important consideration as we bring that in, I think a full out year view. Also, as I am sure you are very aware, the divestiture that occurred in terms of \u2013 with the closing also having an impact on the magnitude of that. So, two important things there. Maybe just actually knowing that you have got models to do here also and as you think about it, 4Q and how that might play in the 4Q. So, we wouldn't expect a change to be additive to OptumInsight's operating earnings in the fourth quarter. A few elements on that. One, the second half for changes. I know you understand well, is it's lower half seasonally in terms of earnings. First half typically considerably stronger than the second half. So, the impact there and how that comes in. Clearly, there will be transaction costs that we will be incurring here. So, really, as you think about your modeling purposes, roughly in the zone of $800 million of revenue coming in to the OptumInsight segment without any impact on operating earnings. And of course, coming back on my comments is how we think about impact going forward. We will look to the point \u2013 to the extent possible, do any acceleration on other important integration activities. So, we can bring the potential benefits of the combination of OptumInsight and change to the health system more quickly, could see that potentially in the over $100 million in terms of incremental cost that we might look to do and pull that ahead. But all of that is incorporated in the 2020 \u2013 in the outlook that we provided this morning, the \u201822 outlook and our \u201823 observations also. Thanks."

As you know, at this point in the year, our national accounts business for 2023 is largely resolved, but the other segments of our business are not resolved. As we look at that national accounts performance, we are very pleased with what we have seen in terms of a very strong renewal year and also a strong sales year, which leaves us I am confident in a growth year for national accounts for 2023. The other lines of the business are yet to resolve. Specifically related to your question about recessionary impacts, we are certainly well aware of those. However, I would note at this point, based on our Q3 performance, we have seen net hiring among our customers. So, we have not yet seen an emergence of recessionary impact in our commercial book of business. Looking forward to 2023, we will assess the continued evolving economic situation and provide additional guidance as that becomes more clear. Thanks for your question, Lisa."

So first, if I may start just with kind of an end cap on 2022, John mentioned in the opening remarks that right now, we've grown about 800,000 Medicare lives and that's consistent with the guidance we gave at our investor conference last year and we are on pace to end this year \u201822 with full year growth of 900,000 lives. So feel good about the way our value proposition has resonated in \u201822 and feel like that momentum will head into 2023. So, great feedback from the broker community around our product positioning, how we are investing, our emphasis on investments in the most utilized benefits like drugs and like dental benefits. So, feel very good heading into AEP tomorrow. With respect to the industry, over the long-term basis, we have kind of guided to 8% to 9% Medicare Advantage industry growth. I don't have any reason to see it differently from this vantage point for 2023. And once again, I like my chances to outperform the industry in \u201823 and have share gaining growth."

            "content": "Sure. Thank you, Stephen. Appreciate the question. Obviously, health system partners are under a lot of pressure. And we talked about some of them from the macroeconomic backdrop in terms of shifting side of care and labor shortages, wage inflation, things like that. So, as we engage with the market, we find that health systems are very responsive because we present an opportunity to be able to address some of those short-term needs, but then really importantly, on the mid to long-term, we become a key accelerant in some of their transformation initiatives, things like their preparedness for value-based care as an example, or how they engage digitally with patients. And so those are some of the areas that we have been expanding our reach. We have a robust pipeline, and that pipeline has been growing and conversations have been advancing. And what's been really encouraging is from our existing relationships, we have been able to drive really strong outcomes, and that gives us confidence around the performance. And so we are excited to see how that develops over time and that will continue to be a contributor. In terms of \u2013 our backlog, it represents about a quarter of our backlog and not surprisingly less in terms of current revenue contribution. And as it relates to coverage into next year, we have well north of half coverage on revenue as we look into next year."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial and Earnings Reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 15, 2022, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Katy, thank you, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. UnitedHealth Group ended the second half of the year with sustained momentum as we execute on our objective to serve more people more effectively with connected high-quality care. For that, I want to thank our 360,000 colleagues. It's their unwavering commitment to our mission and their hard work and support of the people we serve that makes all of this possible. As a result of the strong performance at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share. Comprehensive value-based care is a central theme of our growth strategy, helping more patients and care providers transition from traditional fee-for-service to a value-based orientation. We aim to drive better and more consistent care outcomes at lower overall cost, often for people who are among society's most vulnerable with multiple chronic conditions, limited income and unmet social needs. Optum Health and Optum Rx's clinical platforms span a continuum of care settings, from virtual to post-acute, in-clinic and at home, enabling our care teams to meet patients' unique needs by providing personalized connected care. Our approach helps patients stick with their prescribed care programs, allowing them to spend more time in the comfort of their own homes. The high consumer satisfaction with this comprehensive and consumer-focused approach is evidenced, for example, by a Net Promoter Score of 80 for the 1.5 million people served by our Dual Special Needs Plans. We again delivered growth across our health benefits offerings this quarter. As you might expect, right now, our Medicare teams are finalizing offerings for this fall's open enrollment, focused, as always, on delivering more value, stability and predictability for seniors. Throughout the year, we gather extensive consumer broker and market feedback to continually improve our products. Our approach is grounded in providing deep customer engagement, high-touch service and access to the best care. The benefits of this approach are striking. People served by Medicare Advantage spend about 40% less out of pocket than those participating in fee-for-service, which translates into savings of about $2,000 each year for seniors, most of whom are on limited income. And compared to traditional fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage plans devote up to 30% more in resources to primary care and perform up to 50% more preventative screening and testing services for their seniors. The response among seniors in our plans is positive. Plan satisfaction ratings have risen by 450 basis points over the past 5 years, nearly twice that of the industry. Consumer satisfaction is best demonstrated by the almost 3.4 million additional seniors who have chosen our plans over the same period. Meanwhile, in our domestic commercial health business -- benefits business, over the past 12 months, we have grown to serve over 250,000 more people as a result of innovation in and expansion of our products, including our digital-first offerings. To continue driving affordability in areas of greatest need, we are announcing today an important initiative from UnitedHealthcare, supported by Optum Rx. Starting in 2023, there will be no co-pay, $0 out of pocket for several critical medicines on our preferred drug list for UnitedHealthcare Group fully insured members. Included are medicines such as insulin, epinephrine for severe allergic reactions, and albuterol for acute asthma attacks. While this is an important step for vulnerable people's health, the larger and longer-term cost containment of drugs depends upon manufacturers restraining and lowering the list price of their products, which is a fundamental driver of costs. We will continue to use our capabilities to do everything we can to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers, building on past actions, including point-of-sale discounts. Stepping back and looking across each of our 5 growth areas, you'll see a common theme: The deepening of our relationships with the consumers served by Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Throughout 2022, we've been rapidly expanding and accelerating investments in capabilities to reach and serve a broader base of consumers ever more effectively. This includes further enhancing our digital experiences to help consumers find trusted, health-related information and drive greater engagement with our direct-to-consumer platforms. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Dirk McMahon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to share more about these efforts. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. Picking up on Andrew's comments, I want to provide you with a little more color on the progress we have been making on our growth strategies. This progress is evidenced by -- is evidenced in our work to serve more people through value-based arrangements and to deliver better care. We are well along in our goals for the year. This expansion has significant implications for clinical quality and consistency. MA patients in value-based arrangements with Optum Care physicians are more engaged in their care, with adherence to wellness checks running 5 points higher than Medicare fee-for-service patients, helping to deliver a nearly 20% lower hospitalization rate. Further, Optum Care COPD patients served in our value-based arrangements have 80% higher medication adherence rates than Medicare fee-for-service patients, contributing to about 60% fewer respiratory complications, enabling people to avoid emergency room visits. Clinical results like these are a small part of the track record we have built in delivering value-based care at a substantial scale for years now, and what gives real urgency to our work to expand access to such care. We also remain committed as an organization to improving access by driving down the cost of healthcare through applied technology. For example, we are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance the technology backbone of healthcare. Areas such as platform rationalization to reduce unnecessary complexities, greater end-to-end eligibility management for a more seamless customer experience, and a common platform to facilitate a consistent clinical experience for our consumers and providers. These investments will ultimately lead to an enhanced end-to-end service experience, lower overall operating cost and greater value for people we serve. A simpler experience is at the center of our work on the integrated consumer card developed by our Optum financial services team. We have seen great consumer response within our initial pilot groups. The simplicity of combining all benefits, even healthy food purchases onto a single widely-accepted card has been a differentiator with consumers. Based on this initial work, we intend to introduce the card to all our individual Medicare Advantage members in 2023. Another key element of our work to improve experience is the optimization of consumer transactions. We know members need and expect timely information at their fingertips, and I'm pleased to report they are responding well to our digital offerings for everything from understanding their coverage to completing a virtual visit. Digital engagement has jumped 170% among Medicare members during the last couple of years. Lastly, in pharmacy services, we are very focused on improving quality of care and access for consumers by driving pharmacist-led offerings. We are on track to have nearly 700 community pharmacies by the end of the year and continue to increase the integrated community pharmacy footprint in our clinical locations. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. As Andrew noted, we entered the second half of this year with strong growth momentum. First half revenues of over $160 billion grew 13% compared to last year. Performance was well balanced, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. To begin, let me touch briefly on the care patterns we have observed so far this year. Principally, we have seen what had been a balanced relationship between COVID and non-COVID care activity over the past couple of years diverge modestly, with the latter not returning quite as rapidly with lower levels of COVID care. We also continue to see some variation in underlying care patterns, with certain areas remaining below historical levels. For example, pediatrics and emergency department. And others coming back more fully, such as the levels at which seniors are obtaining important preventative care. In recent weeks, we are seeing rising COVID-related hospital admissions but with a lower average length of stay compared with earlier periods. As always, we watch closely for longer-term health impacts on people due to care, which might have been deferred during earlier periods. Thus far, we are still not seeing patterns, which indicate shifting acuity. There are, of course, many reasonable theories about what is driving the current environment, and they are all no doubt interesting. But here is what we are actually doing. Consistent with the long-standing practice at UnitedHealth Group, our primary intent is to ensure people are getting the care they need and to help them in that process as much as we can. We remain, as always, highly respectful of medical cost trends and how they can evolve rapidly, and we will continue to position our offerings accordingly. Moving now to the businesses. Optum Health revenue grew by over $4 billion or 32% in the second quarter. Revenue per consumer increased 30%, led by growth in patients served under value-based arrangements. Earnings from operations rose 24% even as we accelerated investments in our care delivery practices to support value-based expansions. We also saw strong contributions from Optum's ambulatory surgery centers, which continue to advance the scope and complexity of procedures performed in these optimal settings, all while delivering a superior patient and surgeon experience and high-quality clinical outcomes. Our centers have nearly tripled the number of high-acuity joint, spine and cardiovascular procedures performed compared to just 2 years ago. Care providers increasingly recognize the benefits these centers offer, and consumers place high value on the care quality and experience, with an NPS consistently in excess of 90. Optum Insight revenue grew 11% year-over-year. The revenue backlog was $23.6 billion, growth of $2.3 billion compared to last year. We continue to drive technological advancements, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning more deeply in high-value knowledge-based services, including an expanding suite of information technology and data analytics offerings. Optum Rx revenues grew 10% to nearly $25 billion, reflecting continued strong sales results and execution in the core PBM as well as our growth in our pharmacy care services. These vital and expanding care offerings serve and improve the health of people, including in such areas as our high-touch specialty services where we tightly monitor and track the effectiveness of complex treatments. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Revenue grew by a strong $6.6 billion or 12%, with contributions from all our businesses. In our offerings for seniors, we continue to expect to serve up to 800,000 additional people within Medicare Advantage this year. About 3/4 will be an individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in Dual Special Needs Plans. This puts us on track for our seventh consecutive year of share gaining growth in Medicare Advantage. People served by our Medicaid offerings grew by 180,000 in the second quarter. At this point, we anticipate the impact to Medicaid enrollment as a result of state redetermination activities will be experienced next year. We continue to prepare resources to help people find uninterrupted access to appropriate coverage as this transition occurs. We added 80,000 new people in domestic commercial plans during the quarter. Within that, fully-insured commercial offerings grew by 60,000 from the first quarter of this year, with balanced growth across group and individual fully-insured offerings. Of note, some 90% of the growth within our individual and family plans was among people who chose a plan featuring convenient and cost-effective access to virtual visits. Our capital capacities remain strong. Second quarter cash flows from operations were $6.9 billion or 1.3x net income, and we continue to expect full year cash flows of about $24 billion. In the first half of this year, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. In June, our Board increased the dividend by 14%, and we deployed more than $7 billion in capital to enhance our care delivery capacity and consumer strategies to improve outcomes and experiences for the people we serve and for the benefit of the broader health system. As noted earlier, based on this growth outlook, today, we increased our adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. Before the Q&A, let me underscore a few key points. First, the strong momentum throughout our business. The people we serve are continually seeking value, high-quality care at fair cost, and our colleagues across Optum and UnitedHealthcare are raising the bar every day. You see that manifested in our business performance and the strong growth in our core platforms, double-digit growth across the Benefits businesses, a growing revenue backlog in Optum Insight, robust growth in our pharmacy services and expansion across Optum Health. We see tremendous opportunity ahead, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth objective and further advance our mission to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator:  We'll take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice : I wondered if maybe we could ask you to comment a little bit more on your discussions with the employer groups as we go through the selling season on the benefits business. I have 2 open questions. It seems like to me there's this sort of back and forth about need to retain employees, a tight labor market in many industries. But alternatively, concerns about the recession, and how is that coloring conversations? And then also this issue of pressure on some of the provider areas from their tight labor markets, how is that impacting discussions with employers about their benefit outlook for next year?\nAndrew Witty : A.J., thanks so much for the question. So first off, before I hand this to Brian Thompson to give you a few thoughts, we've been super pleased with the progression, particularly across the benefits business, as you've seen in the report this morning. But certainly within our E&I business, the commercial business had a very strong year. And I think the team have worked extremely hard to understand the kind of pressures you're describing as employers are obviously concerned about managing their own cost environment and how we make sure that the benefits availability for their employees are appropriate. Really, I would say, take just this opportunity just to emphasize how important the role of a company like UnitedHealthcare is here. Because as we all know, we're in a more inflationary environment. The role of UnitedHealthcare to help deliver affordability, affordable healthcare coverage to the employees of all of those companies that rely on it is super important. And maybe with that, I'll hand it to Brian to give you a little bit more sense of how things are playing out.\nBrian Thompson : Yes. Thanks for the question, A.J., and I appreciate that lead in, Andrew. Most of these conversations have been around innovation and how do we continue to drive value-based solutions in the form of product design. That has really been the central theme throughout. We have showed up to the market with some new ideas around virtual care. You've heard about that with our partnership with Optum, both in terms of product design, as well as broader access beyond medical integrated with behavioral, et cetera, and how we really enable the consumer. High deductibles have - often have been a part of the equation for a long time, but Bind really puts that consumer in the driver's seat where they're able to choose what coverage they want with pre-service guaranteed costs. And that really resonates in the marketplace. And most importantly, for employers, it not only provides great quality, but lower price points. So I would say the conversations have been less around staffing and employment levels and more around value. And these examples of products have really resonated.\nAndrew Witty : Brian, thanks so much. And A.J., thank you again. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. A question on cost trend. One, it'd be great if you could just run us through what you were seeing by business segment? And then two, in terms of thinking into next year, one, are you starting to price for some level of COVID kind of being normal? So I know you've always guided above for normal plus COVID. Are you starting to price that COVID in pricing above normal for next year? And two, what are hospital unit costs looking like for next year versus the 4% to 5% that we typically take in terms of new contracts? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty : Justin, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask John to maybe comment a little bit on the business cost evolution and then Brian, I think will give you a little bit of perspective of what they're seeing in terms of hospital conversation, just a couple of step back observations maybe I would offer here. First off, as we look across the overall business, we are seeing tremendous growth opportunities and tremendous potential for us to invest behind those. And you see that picked up in some of the increase in investment levels that you see in the quarter this time around. I think that's an incredibly positive sign of the forward potential of the overall organization. John will talk a little bit more to some of those in a second. I think in terms of 2023, we are not going to get into a ton of detail on how we are thinking about pricing. But as always, we are very, very respectful of the kind of underlying phenomena within the cost trends of the environment. Of course, that includes a sense of where COVID may or may not be. And I think we have all learned to be deeply respectful of something like a pandemic and the uncertainties it can present. And even in the last few months we have seen that play out a little bit. And of course, respectful of things like inflationary trends in the environment and all of that plays into how we think about these things. Maybe just to give you a little bit more depth on the first part of your question, I'll pass it to John, and then maybe John, you could pass it to Brian, just to finish off on the second part.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Good morning, Justin. Just a few thoughts, and in particular, maybe we will look at some of the observations really from the quarter from the first half and what we have seen because this influences really what you are getting at and asking how our thinking is developing. So, you heard in my prepared comments talked about that we typically seeing a very balanced relationship between COVID care and non-COVID care over the course of the last two years, and that's what shifted a little bit here in recent months that the lower level of COVID care. And let's put that in the second quarter, probably about 1/3, the number of inpatient admissions as compared to the first quarter. It was not as quickly accompanied by a higher level of non-COVID utilization. So, that was an important kind of underlying factor here that we saw in recent months. I think the other important thing here is, and as you look across care broadly, we've gone longer really between intervals and COVID hospitalizations that any other point since the pandemic now. So that further illuminates the core underlying non-COVID care patterns that we are seeing also. So helping illuminate what's going on underneath all of that. I think the other point that I wanted to speak to that we are seeing, we've been very encouraged that we are seeing some pockets of care moving towards more normal levels. Ones that we would say are kind of bellwethers for future care, an important -- for example, super important for us. Annual wellness visits among our Medicare patients, they're back at pre-pandemic baseline. That's very important for us in getting them the care they need. First fill prescriptions are trending above baseline a little bit, so we're seeing people get some care they need. We're seeing important pickups in some preventative care such as colonoscopies, also those now getting back to baseline. So all that kind of influencing in terms of how we think about the future. We got to make sure people are getting the care that they need. We've seen the greatest response really in our senior populations. I think some of that is our ability to get into their homes to influence that care and to get them into that. And certainly, back to your kind of core fundamental in how we think about the future, yes, enormously respectful of the outlook for future impacts from COVID hospitalizations. Here we are sitting in a period where we're seeing COVID hospitalizations rise again after kind of pausing since January. So super respectful in our outlook towards how that might progress throughout this year and next, and the potential for that to continue to be somewhat variable and to accelerate again. Brian?\nBrian Thompson : Yes, John, I think you summarized that well. I might just add on inflation. Obviously, as you well know, Justin, we priced to our forward view of cost, that includes inflation. We're certainly respectful of what we're seeing in terms of labor cost with our provider partners. And as you might expect, obviously, with long-term agreements, there will be more impact in 2023 than 2022, just as a function of time and how we renew these contracts. So certainly respectful of that dynamic and environment. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Justin. Appreciate it. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser : Yes. I'll focus on Optum Rx. So when we look at Optum Rx, clearly, you've seen very strong top line and growth and membership growth, but we haven't seen necessarily the flow-through on the margins. So what kind of like trends are you seeing just in terms of mix that have impacted results? And how should we think about the progression for the rest of the year for Optum -- for Optum Rx?\nAndrew Witty : Ricky, yes, great. Ricky, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask Heather to make a few comments on that, I think one of the overwhelming census that we see around Optum Rx is the really strong growth and the bringing on board of very significant new clients. And of course, that, as you know, brings with it a kind of front-loading investment phenomenon as you gear up for supporting that, and that's one of the reasons why you see this lag between the revenue growth and the earnings growth. And maybe to give you a little bit more of a sense of all of that and other aspects, Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Yes. Thanks. So as Andrew said, really strong growth this year, and you see that as a result of new client growth and the membership that we've brought in and the direct Optum Rx as well as the UnitedHealthcare book. And you're seeing that in the revenue, you're seeing that in the scripts volume, we see strong utilization, and you also we're seeing that in the earnings growth. With respect to investments, which do impact margins in the quarter, but we will see a return on those through the year and in our long-term plan, I point you to actually 4 things. Number one, those client investments that Andrew talked about. Number two, we talked to you about the new businesses. We've referenced Genoa that we continue to expand into new sites so we can serve more individuals in underserved communities. But I'd maybe point you to 2 additional ones that I think provide some great context where we're investing for the year. That's, number one, with our existing clients and even being responsive to those or prospective clients in our PBM, it's moving very urgently with innovation, like Brian's seeing on the UnitedHealthcare side. To develop products today that address specialty drug costs that are high and rising in addition to consumer affordability. Building on the tools that we've already, I think, delivered significant value. Our specialty tools has delivered over $1 billion of value over the last 2.5 years, and we're not done. We're working urgently to bring more services and products. So that's happening real time in the quarter, and those investments will pay off. And then the last one I'd point you to are those -- are our pharmacies. So our pharmacies are fast growing. We're seeing that impacting our top line growth and in our earnings. But you'll see us not just invest in our operations, and we've talked to you about that before, and in our digital experience. But I'm most excited about the fact that we're also integrating the service. So putting the pharmacist first. We have over 7,000 pharmacists that work hard every day not just to serve and sync meds, but to help our individuals navigate, educate and guide people through our best-in-class capabilities. And so really, integrating those pharmacies with the pharmacist-first and a service-first model is one of our biggest investments in the quarter, and you're going to see a return on that through the rest of the year, but I think it's also going to pay off in the growth of those pharmacies and better service to individuals that need us most.\nAndrew Witty : Great. Thanks, Heather, and Ricky, thank you for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.\nMatt Borsch : Yes. If I could ask a question about the -- I think it was about a month ago that the U.S. Supreme Court elected not to take up the case that had gone through the district and appellate courts regarding the CMS rule on risk coding, if I'm referring to it in the right way. Can you just help us understand anything you can say about implications, or at least maybe next steps in that process?\nAndrew Witty : Matt, thanks very much for the question. I mean, I think not to be too disappointing too, but I don't think you'd be too surprised that we don't generally comment on ongoing legal processes. And I think in this case, that certainly applies. So not really in a position to be able to give you too much information on that, but certainly appreciate the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel : Just had a question just around the LHCG pending acquisition. And clearly, just recently, CMS put out their Home Health Proposal for 2023 and with a pretty disappointing rate cut that they're proposing for next year. Just interested in how that rate cut may influence your thinking on the financial impact of the LHCG acquisition in 2023? And then also whether that influences how you think about deploying that asset potentially in different ways if CMS does end up going through with the rate cut in the final rates when they release those?\nAndrew Witty : Scott, thanks so much for the question. And listen, let me start off by saying we really believe that enhancing and building high-quality care provision in the home is going to be a key feature of the future. And the more that that can be linked to other aspects of care, so for example, physician clinic, virtual and the rest, it's very much a central focus of our Optum Health development. And so the bringing together of LHC within the overall Optum organization is really important to us, and we're very committed to that transaction. We believe it really is going to be a significant enhancement of the quality of care that can be delivered. And we think we can really -- it can really contribute towards improved value-based delivery for patients. I think, as is always the case, making sure that the incentive system is appropriate to drive the right kind of care is really important. So I hope very much over time that CMS and others continue to see the value of home care and that, in fact, the support is given and the signals are given to continue to increase the development of high-quality care in the home environment. And so we'll see how that plays out. Honestly, we are committed to this agenda very much because we see it as a strategically critical way of extending better care to folks in homes. And you have to remember, Scott, some of these folks can't get out of their homes. I mean, this is really -- this isn't kind of elective for them. They need -- we need to find ways to get more help to them. And as you know, we've got a long history in this in areas like house calls, which have delivered amazing health assessment and preventive direction to millions of people, and this is another big step for us to extend. So we're optimistic about this. We hope very much that CMS and others will continue to send signals of support through the way in which they choose to invest in this arena, and we'll see how that plays out during the rest of the year. Thanks so much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill : Andrew, I appreciate your comments on Optum Rx and what you're doing for 2023 around the no co-pay, $0 co-pay. But I'm wondering if you or Heather could maybe comment on 2 things. One, the 2023 selling season? And then secondly, I know you and I have talked in the past about shift towards value-based care within Rx. Are you seeing new programs for 2023 beyond what you talked about as we think about value-based care?\nAndrew Witty : Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And I think UHC supported by Optum Rx are doing the completely right thing here to bring $0 co-pay and $0 out of pocket on some critical meds. And you've got to think about the consequences of folks who are unfortunately affected by the conditions that these meds address. If they don't get the meds when they need them, they're going to end up in the emergency room or worse. And that brings with enormous personal human consequence and, of course, cost. And so we believe this is a really appropriate place for us to lean in and to address that. In terms of -- before I go to Heather to talk about specifically Optum Rx selling season, I just want to step back for a second. I just want to let you know, Optum is in the middle of a record selling season across the board. If you look at the first 6 months of Optum, it, of course, including Optum Rx, but also the other 2 businesses, that we are in a record selling season. So this is a really significant period for us in terms of the fit of the products and services that we're offering across the marketplace. One of the reasons why you've seen a step up our investment profile in the business is because we're seeing such a strong pickup in our services. And maybe with that, Heather, you could address specifically what you're seeing in Optum Rx as you think about selling seasons into '23? And maybe also just touch on the value-based care aspect that Lisa described.\nHeather Cianfrocco : Absolutely. As Andrew said, strong selling season across Optum Rx is enjoying that as well. And the way I think about that, first of all, it came off a really strong '22 season. Sitting where we are today, 2 ways to think about it. The first is client retention. We're going to be in the high 90s again this year with most of the book in right now. With respect to new business activity, based on sales activity, including finalists and win rates right now, we're ahead of where we were at this time last year. And I really think that's the result of the real-time innovation. We're working again with our clients now to bring them services today. We're not waiting. We're not waiting for other market factors or the environment to make us innovate and drive down cost, and that's showing up. I think we have the best client management team and responsive client management team in the industry, and that's paying off for us. So I think we're going to be very busy again in 2023. That's going to require some investment. But we're going to be very busy with another 2023 year serving our clients. With respect to value based, I guess, I think about it in 2 respects. We're seeing better -- we're seeing definitely more interest and pressure from our clients. And we're also seeing more engagement from our clients to engage in the elements of value-based care and to incorporate pharmacy, including specialty pharmacy, into those constructs. The role for us to play is, number one, to ensure that our pharma partners are bringing the most affordable value-based and clinically appropriate drugs to drive those results. But the other thing is that we bring tools real time that integrate products, with treatment protocols. We work very closely with Optum Health, and particularly with most -- with many of our Optum Care prescribers and providers, to experiment with these tools and services that will help prescribers make the right choices. Our plans and plan sponsors to be able to have more predictability in their services and for us, to be an important piece of that value-based shift. So you'll continue to see us invest there, and I think we'll see even more -- the PBMs being a bigger piece of driving value-based care and integrating pharmacy.\nAndrew Witty : Heather, thanks so much. And Lisa, I think you're really right to focus us on this value-based piece. And as Heather just said, rather than it being an Optum Rx kind of standalone agenda, it's very much an Optum agenda, right, in terms of how we build value-based care propositions. And of course, you've seen that very substantially within -- in the primary care, kind of holistic approach that Optum Health is leading on. You'll continue to see us prospect experiment and invest in areas like behavioral health and in areas like oncology, and these are going to be important areas for us to solve. Right now, I'd say those are early day opportunities. But as you think about where the burden of cost and complexity sits in the healthcare environment, those are the kind of places where we need to make progress, and we are. And you should expect to hear much more from us on that over the next 2 or 3 years. Lisa, thanks so much. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin : As you look at the senior market over the next couple of years beyond the obvious primary care services that you're building out, are there other capabilities that you think you need to develop or acquire things that are now emerging in the market that you think are going to be even more important in the future?\nAndrew Witty : Yes, Josh, great question. Really appreciate it. And we continue to see a very strong performance in our senior book of business. You see that continued progression toward 800,000 folks joining us this year for the first time. That's really important, continued market share growth. And all of that is built on the stability of the service offering that we're giving. And I think the experience that the seniors are taking. But you're totally right to ask the question about where next. And maybe Tim Noel, you could speak to that?\nTim Noel : Hey, good morning, Josh.  selling season for Medicare Advantage. Throughout the selling season  number and also seeing, as John talked about, really great engagement. I think about senior market  continuous agenda of innovation is super important  Dirk talked about the UCARD, which is something that makes our benefits easier to use, more simple for members to understand on and experience. But beyond that, we'll continue to bring forth consistent innovations that make the member experience easier for people. Things like the digital experience, more personalized member experiences as well. I think another theme for the senior population will continue to be to -- on expand at-home services. That's really important. I think we've historically thought of the center of care for seniors to be in the physician's office. More and more, though, that's becoming something that needs to occur out of the home given mobility channels, challenges for folks, the vulnerability of this population, bringing care into the home is absolutely essential to the delivery of high-quality care. So those are the big themes. For me, looking forward is continue to advance the at-home capabilities for seniors and continue to innovate, make using benefits easier, more understandable, simple, affordable.\nAndrew Witty : Tim, thanks so much. And I think maybe there was a little glitch with Tim's mic at the beginning of his comments. So I hope very much you were able to hear him, and certainly hear the latter part of his commentary. And I think the sense of urgency and depth of thinking around innovation for our senior members and where that service can go over the next several years is really substantive, and you should continue to see us be super active in that space. Josh, I really appreciate the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck : Great. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the capitated physician growth in the quarter. How you think about the ability to continue to add doctors at this rate, the competitive landscape? And how should we think about where the margin and the capitated physician business compared to Optum Health broadly and where that segment could go over time?\nAndrew Witty : Great questions, Kevin. I'm going to ask John in a second to talk to the margin progression opportunity. But maybe first, Dr. Decker, Head of Optum Health, might speak to the whole dynamic around physician recruitment?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Kevin, thanks for the question. Absolutely, we are seeing continued growth of our physicians in Optum Health and Optum Care. What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found is that physicians are increasingly attracted to the value proposition that we offer them, which is less clerical burden and more focused on doing the work that they love, which is providing clinical care. Moving physicians to value-based care paradigms is especially appealing. So you're seeing us appeal to large groups like Atrius and Kelsey that have recently joined Optum Health, as well as doctors coming straight out of residency. So we're tracking nicely towards our growth agenda of adding 10,000 physicians and advanced practitioners during the year, and look forward to following up with you at the investor conference to share those numbers.\nJohn Rex : Good morning, Kevin, it's John here. So considering the growth in Optum Health and the earnings progression that you should expect out of that, the primary focus continues to be on expanding our capabilities for value-based care, that build out. These investments, as you know well because you've looked at this for a while, are made well in advance of any revenue impact that we get from bringing those physicians on. As we look at our pipeline, so when I talk pipeline, there are 2 ways to think about it. It's both potential future ads. But when I'm talking about it now with you here, I'm talking about even our existing base of clinical care delivery capabilities and where we have to build out that capability in terms of future value-based expansion. We're still quite early stage in that, which is why we hang in this 8% to 10% margin range for Optum Health, view being here that there is a decade ahead of build for us, so. And just when you look at our existing pipeline and what that can drive in terms of strong double-digit top line growth for many years as we bring this on. And the importance, in particular because of the value it brings to the patients we serve, of continuing to invest in these value-based capabilities. So as we build along this, you'll see as we try to do this, we try to -- we look to deliver in this 8% to 10% margin range. And I expect that to continue just because of these deep investments and still considering this very early innings, third inning in terms of the build that we'd like to see looking ahead for care delivery.\nAndrew Witty : John, thank you very much. Kevin, I appreciate the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Whit Mayo with SVB Securities.\nWhit Mayo: I would have thought that investment income would have been a little higher this quarter. Were there any write-downs on Optum Ventures, anything that would negatively impact that? Just wondering how you're marking some of those investments that you've made in recent years.\nAndrew Witty : Yes. Well, thanks so much. Let me hand it straight to John.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Whit. Yes, within the quarter, we actually took -- we realized some losses as we reposition the portfolio a bit here, looking out to the future, try to get that all teed up for the environment we're in right now. And so when you look at that, the quarterly progression, which I believe that's what you're focusing on, I'd call it some of the realized losses we chose to take in this quarter.\nAndrew Witty : Thanks, John, and thanks, Whit. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen and Company.\nGary Taylor : I just wanted to follow up on the Kelsey-Seybold and Atrius commentary just a little bit. You spent just under $6 billion on acquisitions this quarter, which is about what you've spent annually each of the last 5 years. So just wondering, given the size of that, if you could give us any more color on kind of where those organizations are fee-for-service versus capitation? How they might impact Optum Health margins in the second half? And then just broadly on the environment, are the valuations that you're able to garner still far below public company value-based care valuations even after they've corrected? Or is there anything there that becomes more intriguing?\nAndrew Witty : So I'll ask John to make a few comments on this in a second, but I'm glad you saw that substantial continued deployment of our capital to grow the business. As you know, a key part of our long-term growth strategy is, of course, organic and complemented by bringing on board new businesses and teams who can supplement what we have. And there's nothing more powerful to that agenda than building out the value-based care piece. Now we believe in both Atrius and Kelsey-Seybold organizations. We have amazing teams, people, organizations which have got real character, history, personality of themselves that we think is going to really add to the diversity of the company and bringing with it a tremendous amount of skills and perspective. And as you know, a number of them already -- in both cases, they have developed themselves some significant thinking around value-based care, so the fit is really good. Of course, when you bring in new organizations, there's typically a further in process before they fully contribute, and I'm sure that will be the case here as well. But really, we continue to be extremely active in how we sensibly think about deploying capital, and we remain very optimistic about our ability to do that. But maybe go a little further around valuation perspective, John?\nJohn Rex: Yes. As it relates to valuation perspective, I mean, our pipeline and our conversations as we expand in care delivery, these are multiyear conversations that we have. Often by the time we are able to partner with another care delivery organization, we've probably been in conversations with them for 5 years. Super long pipelines, development processes, relationships, understanding the organization. That is us understanding their organization, them understanding us. These go on for quite a long period of time. So with that perspective there, there's probably a little bit less volatility than you might expect in terms of as we pace out and we think about valuations in this business and where we would have stepped into it maybe a number of years ago where we are now. And even if you look towards a public market and such, this just don't manifest quite as quickly. But they also kind of on the other side, they weren't manifesting as quickly. So I would call it a little less impactful at this point and juncture, but the key point that I think we focused on is, these have been multiyear conversations and relationship builds for us as we move into these, and typically not a 6-month process.\nAndrew Witty : Absolutely. Gary, thank you so much for the question. We just have time for one last question. So final question, please, operator.\nOperator: We'll go to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich : I wanted to ask on utilization in the current inflationary environment that consumers are facing. If, given the greater consumerization of healthcare in today's market, how do you think consumers might change how they utilize the system given some of the pressures that they're facing? And have you seen any signs of changes in behavior so far?\nAndrew Witty : Nate, thanks so much for the question. I'm maybe going to go to Brian in a couple of minutes just to give you a little bit of what he's seeing and what is kind of reflected in his membership. But listen, obviously, we all see the inflationary pressures around us, and we all know that that has -- that really focuses people's minds on how they prioritize their spend and investment. What it really means for us is we have to double down on getting a great deal for them. We have to use our capabilities to get the very best quality care available at the most affordable cost. And whether that's through the PBM, whether that's through the UnitedHealthcare negotiations with the rest of the medical environment. That's a really important role we're stepping into play, and we're going to continue to lean into that very much. Now then, it speaks to really being astute around understanding how within the consumer experience, some things are more problematic than others. And I'll call out one of the things we're announcing today to eliminate those co-pays on for people who are in really vulnerable situation. This is the right time to do that, to help those folks who are struggling, and we know that we need those folks to make sure they fill their prescriptions properly. And if there's anything caused by the inflationary environment that might hold that back, there's going to be really bad downside there. And we don't want that to happen. So we will lean into that. I'd call out things like virtual, call out things as you think about much more digital engagement. Call out choice. I mean, giving consumers more choice. The more pressure there is in the environment, you've got to lean into it. And that's why, as an organization, we have over the last 2 years really doubled down on our commitment to consumer strategy across the board. Core capability of this company going forward will be consumer capability. And that's an area where you will see us continue to talk about, invest in, build, innovate and we hope really lead in terms of moving the consumer to the center of thinking in healthcare. And maybe just to finish off, Brian, would love to get your perspective on what you're seeing from your very significant membership.\nBrian Thompson : Sure. Thanks for that, Andrew. Maybe to put it in 2 zones. Macro, I think Andrew hit it right in that macro environment. It's really around virtual care and around emergency department use. We've seen, obviously, virtual care increase and emergency department use go down. As I think in the particular, again, back to that concept of consumer and choice, it's around product design, Bind being our best example when we can put that consumer in the driver's seat where they can choose site of service and optimize both their cost and quality, they do. And when you couple that with a high-performing network, obviously, you get the benefit both of the unit cost as well as that consumer choice. So those are the greatest examples that I can see really emerging in this environment.\nAndrew Witty : Thanks so much. And Nate, thank you very, very much for that question.\nAndrew Witty: We certainly appreciate your time and attention today. And I hope what you heard is the story of growth and focused execution. As our strategy continues to generate momentum across our businesses and advance our mission on behalf of every person and every community, we're privileged to serve. Really grateful for your attention this morning. Thank you so much for your questions. We look forward to following up as usual with any further questions you might have offline. Thanks so much, and have a great day.\nOperator: That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

            "name": "Dirk McMahon",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. Picking up on Andrew's comments, I want to provide you with a little more color on the progress we have been making on our growth strategies. This progress is evidenced by -- is evidenced in our work to serve more people through value-based arrangements and to deliver better care. We are well along in our goals for the year. This expansion has significant implications for clinical quality and consistency. MA patients in value-based arrangements with Optum Care physicians are more engaged in their care, with adherence to wellness checks running 5 points higher than Medicare fee-for-service patients, helping to deliver a nearly 20% lower hospitalization rate. Further, Optum Care COPD patients served in our value-based arrangements have 80% higher medication adherence rates than Medicare fee-for-service patients, contributing to about 60% fewer respiratory complications, enabling people to avoid emergency room visits. Clinical results like these are a small part of the track record we have built in delivering value-based care at a substantial scale for years now, and what gives real urgency to our work to expand access to such care. We also remain committed as an organization to improving access by driving down the cost of healthcare through applied technology. For example, we are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance the technology backbone of healthcare. Areas such as platform rationalization to reduce unnecessary complexities, greater end-to-end eligibility management for a more seamless customer experience, and a common platform to facilitate a consistent clinical experience for our consumers and providers. These investments will ultimately lead to an enhanced end-to-end service experience, lower overall operating cost and greater value for people we serve. A simpler experience is at the center of our work on the integrated consumer card developed by our Optum financial services team. We have seen great consumer response within our initial pilot groups. The simplicity of combining all benefits, even healthy food purchases onto a single widely-accepted card has been a differentiator with consumers. Based on this initial work, we intend to introduce the card to all our individual Medicare Advantage members in 2023. Another key element of our work to improve experience is the optimization of consumer transactions. We know members need and expect timely information at their fingertips, and I'm pleased to report they are responding well to our digital offerings for everything from understanding their coverage to completing a virtual visit. Digital engagement has jumped 170% among Medicare members during the last couple of years. Lastly, in pharmacy services, we are very focused on improving quality of care and access for consumers by driving pharmacist-led offerings. We are on track to have nearly 700 community pharmacies by the end of the year and continue to increase the integrated community pharmacy footprint in our clinical locations. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."

So as Andrew said, really strong growth this year, and you see that as a result of new client growth and the membership that we've brought in and the direct Optum Rx as well as the UnitedHealthcare book. And you're seeing that in the revenue, you're seeing that in the scripts volume, we see strong utilization, and you also we're seeing that in the earnings growth. With respect to investments, which do impact margins in the quarter, but we will see a return on those through the year and in our long-term plan, I point you to actually 4 things. Number one, those client investments that Andrew talked about. Number two, we talked to you about the new businesses. We've referenced Genoa that we continue to expand into new sites so we can serve more individuals in underserved communities.

That's, number one, with our existing clients and even being responsive to those or prospective clients in our PBM, it's moving very urgently with innovation, like Brian's seeing on the UnitedHealthcare side. To develop products today that address specialty drug costs that are high and rising in addition to consumer affordability. Building on the tools that we've already, I think, delivered significant value. Our specialty tools has delivered over $1 billion of value over the last 2.5 years, and we're not done. We're working urgently to bring more services and products. So that's happening real time in the quarter, and those investments will pay off. And then the last one I'd point you to are those -- are our pharmacies. So our pharmacies are fast growing. We're seeing that impacting our top line growth and in our earnings. But you'll see us not just invest in our operations, and we've talked to you about that before, and in our digital experience. But I'm most excited about the fact that we're also integrating the service. So putting the pharmacist first. We have over 7,000 pharmacists that work hard every day not just to serve and sync meds, but to help our individuals navigate, educate and guide people through our best-in-class capabilities. And so really, integrating those pharmacies with the pharmacist-first and a service-first model is one of our biggest investments in the quarter, and you're going to see a return on that through the rest of the year, but I think it's also going to pay off in the growth of those pharmacies and better service to individuals that need us most. Absolutely. As Andrew said, strong selling season across Optum Rx is enjoying that as well. And the way I think about that, first of all, it came off a really strong '22 season. Sitting where we are today, 2 ways to think about it. The first is client retention. We're going to be in the high 90s again this year with most of the book in right now. With respect to new business activity, based on sales activity, including finalists and win rates right now, we're ahead of where we were at this time last year. And I really think that's the result of the real-time innovation. We're working again with our clients now to bring them services today. We're not waiting. We're not waiting for other market factors or the environment to make us innovate and drive down cost, and that's showing up. I think we have the best client management team and responsive client management team in the industry, and that's paying off for us. So I think we're going to be very busy again in 2023. That's going to require some investment. But we're going to be very busy with another 2023 year serving our clients. With respect to value based, I guess, I think about it in 2 respects. We're seeing better -- we're seeing definitely more interest and pressure from our clients. And we're also seeing more engagement from our clients to engage in the elements of value-based care and to incorporate pharmacy, including specialty pharmacy, into those constructs. The role for us to play is, number one, to ensure that our pharma partners are bringing the most affordable value-based and clinically appropriate drugs to drive those results. But the other thing is that we bring tools real time that integrate products, with treatment protocols. We work very closely with Optum Health, and particularly with most -- with many of our Optum Care prescribers and providers, to experiment with these tools and services that will help prescribers make the right choices. Our plans and plan sponsors to be able to have more predictability in their services and for us, to be an important piece of that value-based shift. So you'll continue to see us invest there, and I think we'll see even more -- the PBMs being a bigger piece of driving value-based care and integrating pharmacy."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question, A.J., and I appreciate that lead in, Andrew. Most of these conversations have been around innovation and how do we continue to drive value-based solutions in the form of product design. That has really been the central theme throughout. We have showed up to the market with some new ideas around virtual care. You've heard about that with our partnership with Optum, both in terms of product design, as well as broader access beyond medical integrated with behavioral, et cetera, and how we really enable the consumer. High deductibles have - often have been a part of the equation for a long time, but Bind really puts that consumer in the driver's seat where they're able to choose what coverage they want with pre-service guaranteed costs. And that really resonates in the marketplace. And most importantly, for employers, it not only provides great quality, but lower price points. So I would say the conversations have been less around staffing and employment levels and more around value. And these examples of products have really resonated. Yes, John, I think you summarized that well. I might just add on inflation. Obviously, as you well know, Justin, we priced to our forward view of cost, that includes inflation. We're certainly respectful of what we're seeing in terms of labor cost with our provider partners. And as you might expect, obviously, with long-term agreements, there will be more impact in 2023 than 2022, just as a function of time and how we renew these contracts. So certainly respectful of that dynamic and environment. Thanks. Sure. Thanks for that, Andrew. Maybe to put it in 2 zones. Macro, I think Andrew hit it right in that macro environment. It's really around virtual care and around emergency department use. We've seen, obviously, virtual care increase and emergency department use go down. As I think in the particular, again, back to that concept of consumer and choice, it's around product design, Bind being our best example when we can put that consumer in the driver's seat where they can choose site of service and optimize both their cost and quality, they do. And when you couple that with a high-performing network, obviously, you get the benefit both of the unit cost as well as that consumer choice. So those are the greatest examples that I can see really emerging in this environment."

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Katy, thank you, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. UnitedHealth Group ended the second half of the year with sustained momentum as we execute on our objective to serve more people more effectively with connected high-quality care. For that, I want to thank our 360,000 colleagues. It's their unwavering commitment to our mission and their hard work and support of the people we serve that makes all of this possible. As a result of the strong performance at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share. Comprehensive value-based care is a central theme of our growth strategy, helping more patients and care providers transition from traditional fee-for-service to a value-based orientation. We aim to drive better and more consistent care outcomes at lower overall cost, often for people who are among society's most vulnerable with multiple chronic conditions, limited income and unmet social needs. Optum Health and Optum Rx's clinical platforms span a continuum of care settings, from virtual to post-acute, in-clinic and at home, enabling our care teams to meet patients' unique needs by providing personalized connected care. Our approach helps patients stick with their prescribed care programs, allowing them to spend more time in the comfort of their own homes. The high consumer satisfaction with this comprehensive and consumer-focused approach is evidenced, for example, by a Net Promoter Score of 80 for the 1.5 million people served by our Dual Special Needs Plans. We again delivered growth across our health benefits offerings this quarter. As you might expect, right now, our Medicare teams are finalizing offerings for this fall's open enrollment, focused, as always, on delivering more value, stability and predictability for seniors. Throughout the year, we gather extensive consumer broker and market feedback to continually improve our products. Our approach is grounded in providing deep customer engagement, high-touch service and access to the best care. The benefits of this approach are striking. People served by Medicare Advantage spend about 40% less out of pocket than those participating in fee-for-service, which translates into savings of about $2,000 each year for seniors, most of whom are on limited income. And compared to traditional fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage plans devote up to 30% more in resources to primary care and perform up to 50% more preventative screening and testing services for their seniors. The response among seniors in our plans is positive. Plan satisfaction ratings have risen by 450 basis points over the past 5 years, nearly twice that of the industry. Consumer satisfaction is best demonstrated by the almost 3.4 million additional seniors who have chosen our plans over the same period. Meanwhile, in our domestic commercial health business -- benefits business, over the past 12 months, we have grown to serve over 250,000 more people as a result of innovation in and expansion of our products, including our digital-first offerings. To continue driving affordability in areas of greatest need, we are announcing today an important initiative from UnitedHealthcare, supported by Optum Rx. Starting in 2023, there will be no co-pay, $0 out of pocket for several critical medicines on our preferred drug list for UnitedHealthcare Group fully insured members. Included are medicines such as insulin, epinephrine for severe allergic reactions, and albuterol for acute asthma attacks. While this is an important step for vulnerable people's health, the larger and longer-term cost containment of drugs depends upon manufacturers restraining and lowering the list price of their products, which is a fundamental driver of costs. We will continue to use our capabilities to do everything we can to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers, building on past actions, including point-of-sale discounts. Stepping back and looking across each of our 5 growth areas, you'll see a common theme: The deepening of our relationships with the consumers served by Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Throughout 2022, we've been rapidly expanding and accelerating investments in capabilities to reach and serve a broader base of consumers ever more effectively. This includes further enhancing our digital experiences to help consumers find trusted, health-related information and drive greater engagement with our direct-to-consumer platforms. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Dirk McMahon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to share more about these efforts. Dirk? Thanks, John. Before the Q&A, let me underscore a few key points. First, the strong momentum throughout our business. The people we serve are continually seeking value, high-quality care at fair cost, and our colleagues across Optum and UnitedHealthcare are raising the bar every day. You see that manifested in our business performance and the strong growth in our core platforms, double-digit growth across the Benefits businesses, a growing revenue backlog in Optum Insight, robust growth in our pharmacy services and expansion across Optum Health. We see tremendous opportunity ahead, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth objective and further advance our mission to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please. A.J., thanks so much for the question. So first off, before I hand this to Brian Thompson to give you a few thoughts, we've been super pleased with the progression, particularly across the benefits business, as you've seen in the report this morning. But certainly within our E&I business, the commercial business had a very strong year. And I think the team have worked extremely hard to understand the kind of pressures you're describing as employers are obviously concerned about managing their own cost environment and how we make sure that the benefits availability for their employees are appropriate. Really, I would say, take just this opportunity just to emphasize how important the role of a company like UnitedHealthcare is here. Because as we all know, we're in a more inflationary environment. The role of UnitedHealthcare to help deliver affordability, affordable healthcare coverage to the employees of all of those companies that rely on it is super important. And maybe with that, I'll hand it to Brian to give you a little bit more sense of how things are playing out. Brian, thanks so much. And A.J., thank you again. Next question, please. Justin, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask John to maybe comment a little bit on the business cost evolution and then Brian, I think will give you a little bit of perspective of what they're seeing in terms of hospital conversation, just a couple of step back observations maybe I would offer here. First off, as we look across the overall business, we are seeing tremendous growth opportunities and tremendous potential for us to invest behind those. And you see that picked up in some of the increase in investment levels that you see in the quarter this time around. I think that's an incredibly positive sign of the forward potential of the overall organization. John will talk a little bit more to some of those in a second. I think in terms of 2023, we are not going to get into a ton of detail on how we are thinking about pricing. But as always, we are very, very respectful of the kind of underlying phenomena within the cost trends of the environment. Of course, that includes a sense of where COVID may or may not be. And I think we have all learned to be deeply respectful of something like a pandemic and the uncertainties it can present. And even in the last few months we have seen that play out a little bit. And of course, respectful of things like inflationary trends in the environment and all of that plays into how we think about these things. Maybe just to give you a little bit more depth on the first part of your question, I'll pass it to John, and then maybe John, you could pass it to Brian, just to finish off on the second part. Justin. Appreciate it. Next question, please. Ricky, yes, great. Ricky, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask Heather to make a few comments on that, I think one of the overwhelming census that we see around Optum Rx is the really strong growth and the bringing on board of very significant new clients. And of course, that, as you know, brings with it a kind of front-loading investment phenomenon as you gear up for supporting that, and that's one of the reasons why you see this lag between the revenue growth and the earnings growth. And maybe to give you a little bit more of a sense of all of that and other aspects, Heather? Great. Thanks, Heather, and Ricky, thank you for the question. Next question, please. Matt, thanks very much for the question. I mean, I think not to be too disappointing too, but I don't think you'd be too surprised that we don't generally comment on ongoing legal processes. And I think in this case, that certainly applies. So not really in a position to be able to give you too much information on that, but certainly appreciate the question. Next question, please. Scott, thanks so much for the question. And listen, let me start off by saying we really believe that enhancing and building high-quality care provision in the home is going to be a key feature of the future. And the more that that can be linked to other aspects of care, so for example, physician clinic, virtual and the rest, it's very much a central focus of our Optum Health development. And so the bringing together of LHC within the overall Optum organization is really important to us, and we're very committed to that transaction. We believe it really is going to be a significant enhancement of the quality of care that can be delivered. And we think we can really -- it can really contribute towards improved value-based delivery for patients. I think, as is always the case, making sure that the incentive system is appropriate to drive the right kind of care is really important. So I hope very much over time that CMS and others continue to see the value of home care and that, in fact, the support is given and the signals are given to continue to increase the development of high-quality care in the home environment. And so we'll see how that plays out. Honestly, we are committed to this agenda very much because we see it as a strategically critical way of extending better care to folks in homes. And you have to remember, Scott, some of these folks can't get out of their homes. I mean, this is really -- this isn't kind of elective for them. They need -- we need to find ways to get more help to them. And as you know, we've got a long history in this in areas like house calls, which have delivered amazing health assessment and preventive direction to millions of people, and this is another big step for us to extend. So we're optimistic about this. We hope very much that CMS and others will continue to send signals of support through the way in which they choose to invest in this arena, and we'll see how that plays out during the rest of the year. Thanks so much for the question. Next question, please. Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And I think UHC supported by Optum Rx are doing the completely right thing here to bring $0 co-pay and $0 out of pocket on some critical meds. And you've got to think about the consequences of folks who are unfortunately affected by the conditions that these meds address. If they don't get the meds when they need them, they're going to end up in the emergency room or worse. And that brings with enormous personal human consequence and, of course, cost. And so we believe this is a really appropriate place for us to lean in and to address that. In terms of -- before I go to Heather to talk about specifically Optum Rx selling season, I just want to step back for a second. I just want to let you know, Optum is in the middle of a record selling season across the board. If you look at the first 6 months of Optum, it, of course, including Optum Rx, but also the other 2 businesses, that we are in a record selling season. So this is a really significant period for us in terms of the fit of the products and services that we're offering across the marketplace. One of the reasons why you've seen a step up our investment profile in the business is because we're seeing such a strong pickup in our services. And maybe with that, Heather, you could address specifically what you're seeing in Optum Rx as you think about selling seasons into '23? And maybe also just touch on the value-based care aspect that Lisa described. Heather, thanks so much. And Lisa, I think you're really right to focus us on this value-based piece. And as Heather just said, rather than it being an Optum Rx kind of standalone agenda, it's very much an Optum agenda, right, in terms of how we build value-based care propositions. And of course, you've seen that very substantially within -- in the primary care, kind of holistic approach that Optum Health is leading on. You'll continue to see us prospect experiment and invest in areas like behavioral health and in areas like oncology, and these are going to be important areas for us to solve. Right now, I'd say those are early day opportunities. But as you think about where the burden of cost and complexity sits in the healthcare environment, those are the kind of places where we need to make progress, and we are. And you should expect to hear much more from us on that over the next 2 or 3 years. Lisa, thanks so much. Next question. Yes, Josh, great question. Really appreciate it. And we continue to see a very strong performance in our senior book of business. You see that continued progression toward 800,000 folks joining us this year for the first time. That's really important, continued market share growth. And all of that is built on the stability of the service offering that we're giving. And I think the experience that the seniors are taking. But you're totally right to ask the question about where next. And maybe Tim Noel, you could speak to that? Tim, thanks so much. And I think maybe there was a little glitch with Tim's mic at the beginning of his comments. So I hope very much you were able to hear him, and certainly hear the latter part of his commentary. And I think the sense of urgency and depth of thinking around innovation for our senior members and where that service can go over the next several years is really substantive, and you should continue to see us be super active in that space. Josh, I really appreciate the question. Next question, please. Great questions, Kevin. I'm going to ask John in a second to talk to the margin progression opportunity. But maybe first, Dr. Decker, Head of Optum Health, might speak to the whole dynamic around physician recruitment? John, thank you very much. Kevin, I appreciate the question. Next question, please. Yes. Well, thanks so much. Let me hand it straight to John. Thanks, John, and thanks, Whit. Next question, please. So I'll ask John to make a few comments on this in a second, but I'm glad you saw that substantial continued deployment of our capital to grow the business. As you know, a key part of our long-term growth strategy is, of course, organic and complemented by bringing on board new businesses and teams who can supplement what we have. And there's nothing more powerful to that agenda than building out the value-based care piece. Now we believe in both Atrius and Kelsey-Seybold organizations. We have amazing teams, people, organizations which have got real character, history, personality of themselves that we think is going to really add to the diversity of the company and bringing with it a tremendous amount of skills and perspective. And as you know, a number of them already -- in both cases, they have developed themselves some significant thinking around value-based care, so the fit is really good. Of course, when you bring in new organizations, there's typically a further in process before they fully contribute, and I'm sure that will be the case here as well. But really, we continue to be extremely active in how we sensibly think about deploying capital, and we remain very optimistic about our ability to do that. But maybe go a little further around valuation perspective, John? Absolutely. Gary, thank you so much for the question. We just have time for one last question. So final question, please, operator. Nate, thanks so much for the question. I'm maybe going to go to Brian in a couple of minutes just to give you a little bit of what he's seeing and what is kind of reflected in his membership. But listen, obviously, we all see the inflationary pressures around us, and we all know that that has -- that really focuses people's minds on how they prioritize their spend and investment. What it really means for us is we have to double down on getting a great deal for them. We have to use our capabilities to get the very best quality care available at the most affordable cost. And whether that's through the PBM, whether that's through the UnitedHealthcare negotiations with the rest of the medical environment. That's a really important role we're stepping into play, and we're going to continue to lean into that very much. Now then, it speaks to really being astute around understanding how within the consumer experience, some things are more problematic than others. And I'll call out one of the things we're announcing today to eliminate those co-pays on for people who are in really vulnerable situation. This is the right time to do that, to help those folks who are struggling, and we know that we need those folks to make sure they fill their prescriptions properly. And if there's anything caused by the inflationary environment that might hold that back, there's going to be really bad downside there. And we don't want that to happen. So we will lean into that. I'd call out things like virtual, call out things as you think about much more digital engagement. Call out choice. I mean, giving consumers more choice. The more pressure there is in the environment, you've got to lean into it. And that's why, as an organization, we have over the last 2 years really doubled down on our commitment to consumer strategy across the board. Core capability of this company going forward will be consumer capability. And that's an area where you will see us continue to talk about, invest in, build, innovate and we hope really lead in terms of moving the consumer to the center of thinking in healthcare. And maybe just to finish off, Brian, would love to get your perspective on what you're seeing from your very significant membership. Thanks so much. And Nate, thank you very, very much for that question. We certainly appreciate your time and attention today. And I hope what you heard is the story of growth and focused execution. As our strategy continues to generate momentum across our businesses and advance our mission on behalf of every person and every community, we're privileged to serve. Really grateful for your attention this morning. Thank you so much for your questions. We look forward to following up as usual with any further questions you might have offline. Thanks so much, and have a great day."

            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you, Dirk. As Andrew noted, we entered the second half of this year with strong growth momentum. First half revenues of over $160 billion grew 13% compared to last year. Performance was well balanced, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. To begin, let me touch briefly on the care patterns we have observed so far this year. Principally, we have seen what had been a balanced relationship between COVID and non-COVID care activity over the past couple of years diverge modestly, with the latter not returning quite as rapidly with lower levels of COVID care. We also continue to see some variation in underlying care patterns, with certain areas remaining below historical levels. For example, pediatrics and emergency department. And others coming back more fully, such as the levels at which seniors are obtaining important preventative care. In recent weeks, we are seeing rising COVID-related hospital admissions but with a lower average length of stay compared with earlier periods. As always, we watch closely for longer-term health impacts on people due to care, which might have been deferred during earlier periods. Thus far, we are still not seeing patterns, which indicate shifting acuity. There are, of course, many reasonable theories about what is driving the current environment, and they are all no doubt interesting. But here is what we are actually doing. Consistent with the long-standing practice at UnitedHealth Group, our primary intent is to ensure people are getting the care they need and to help them in that process as much as we can. We remain, as always, highly respectful of medical cost trends and how they can evolve rapidly, and we will continue to position our offerings accordingly. Moving now to the businesses. Optum Health revenue grew by over $4 billion or 32% in the second quarter. Revenue per consumer increased 30%, led by growth in patients served under value-based arrangements. Earnings from operations rose 24% even as we accelerated investments in our care delivery practices to support value-based expansions. We also saw strong contributions from Optum's ambulatory surgery centers, which continue to advance the scope and complexity of procedures performed in these optimal settings, all while delivering a superior patient and surgeon experience and high-quality clinical outcomes. Our centers have nearly tripled the number of high-acuity joint, spine and cardiovascular procedures performed compared to just 2 years ago. Care providers increasingly recognize the benefits these centers offer, and consumers place high value on the care quality and experience, with an NPS consistently in excess of 90. Optum Insight revenue grew 11% year-over-year. The revenue backlog was $23.6 billion, growth of $2.3 billion compared to last year. We continue to drive technological advancements, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning more deeply in high-value knowledge-based services, including an expanding suite of information technology and data analytics offerings. Optum Rx revenues grew 10% to nearly $25 billion, reflecting continued strong sales results and execution in the core PBM as well as our growth in our pharmacy care services. These vital and expanding care offerings serve and improve the health of people, including in such areas as our high-touch specialty services where we tightly monitor and track the effectiveness of complex treatments. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Revenue grew by a strong $6.6 billion or 12%, with contributions from all our businesses. In our offerings for seniors, we continue to expect to serve up to 800,000 additional people within Medicare Advantage this year. About 3/4 will be an individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in Dual Special Needs Plans. This puts us on track for our seventh consecutive year of share gaining growth in Medicare Advantage. People served by our Medicaid offerings grew by 180,000 in the second quarter. At this point, we anticipate the impact to Medicaid enrollment as a result of state redetermination activities will be experienced next year. We continue to prepare resources to help people find uninterrupted access to appropriate coverage as this transition occurs. We added 80,000 new people in domestic commercial plans during the quarter. Within that, fully-insured commercial offerings grew by 60,000 from the first quarter of this year, with balanced growth across group and individual fully-insured offerings. Of note, some 90% of the growth within our individual and family plans was among people who chose a plan featuring convenient and cost-effective access to virtual visits. Our capital capacities remain strong. Second quarter cash flows from operations were $6.9 billion or 1.3x net income, and we continue to expect full year cash flows of about $24 billion. In the first half of this year, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. In June, our Board increased the dividend by 14%, and we deployed more than $7 billion in capital to enhance our care delivery capacity and consumer strategies to improve outcomes and experiences for the people we serve and for the benefit of the broader health system. As noted earlier, based on this growth outlook, today, we increased our adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew. Sure. Good morning, Justin. Just a few thoughts, and in particular, maybe we will look at some of the observations really from the quarter from the first half and what we have seen because this influences really what you are getting at and asking how our thinking is developing. So, you heard in my prepared comments talked about that we typically seeing a very balanced relationship between COVID care and non-COVID care over the course of the last two years, and that's what shifted a little bit here in recent months that the lower level of COVID care. And let's put that in the second quarter, probably about 1/3, the number of inpatient admissions as compared to the first quarter. It was not as quickly accompanied by a higher level of non-COVID utilization. So, that was an important kind of underlying factor here that we saw in recent months. I think the other important thing here is, and as you look across care broadly, we've gone longer really between intervals and COVID hospitalizations that any other point since the pandemic now. So that further illuminates the core underlying non-COVID care patterns that we are seeing also. So helping illuminate what's going on underneath all of that. I think the other point that I wanted to speak to that we are seeing, we've been very encouraged that we are seeing some pockets of care moving towards more normal levels. Ones that we would say are kind of bellwethers for future care, an important -- for example, super important for us. Annual wellness visits among our Medicare patients, they're back at pre-pandemic baseline. That's very important for us in getting them the care they need. First fill prescriptions are trending above baseline a little bit, so we're seeing people get some care they need. We're seeing important pickups in some preventative care such as colonoscopies, also those now getting back to baseline. So all that kind of influencing in terms of how we think about the future. We got to make sure people are getting the care that they need. We've seen the greatest response really in our senior populations. I think some of that is our ability to get into their homes to influence that care and to get them into that. And certainly, back to your kind of core fundamental in how we think about the future, yes, enormously respectful of the outlook for future impacts from COVID hospitalizations. Here we are sitting in a period where we're seeing COVID hospitalizations rise again after kind of pausing since January. So super respectful in our outlook towards how that might progress throughout this year and next, and the potential for that to continue to be somewhat variable and to accelerate again. Brian? Good morning, Kevin, it's John here. So considering the growth in Optum Health and the earnings progression that you should expect out of that, the primary focus continues to be on expanding our capabilities for value-based care, that build out. These investments, as you know well because you've looked at this for a while, are made well in advance of any revenue impact that we get from bringing those physicians on. As we look at our pipeline, so when I talk pipeline, there are 2 ways to think about it. It's both potential future ads. But when I'm talking about it now with you here, I'm talking about even our existing base of clinical care delivery capabilities and where we have to build out that capability in terms of future value-based expansion. We're still quite early stage in that, which is why we hang in this 8% to 10% margin range for Optum Health, view being here that there is a decade ahead of build for us, so. And just when you look at our existing pipeline and what that can drive in terms of strong double-digit top line growth for many years as we bring this on. And the importance, in particular because of the value it brings to the patients we serve, of continuing to invest in these value-based capabilities. So as we build along this, you'll see as we try to do this, we try to -- we look to deliver in this 8% to 10% margin range. And I expect that to continue just because of these deep investments and still considering this very early innings, third inning in terms of the build that we'd like to see looking ahead for care delivery. Good morning, Whit. Yes, within the quarter, we actually took -- we realized some losses as we reposition the portfolio a bit here, looking out to the future, try to get that all teed up for the environment we're in right now. And so when you look at that, the quarterly progression, which I believe that's what you're focusing on, I'd call it some of the realized losses we chose to take in this quarter. Yes. As it relates to valuation perspective, I mean, our pipeline and our conversations as we expand in care delivery, these are multiyear conversations that we have. Often by the time we are able to partner with another care delivery organization, we've probably been in conversations with them for 5 years. Super long pipelines, development processes, relationships, understanding the organization. That is us understanding their organization, them understanding us. These go on for quite a long period of time. So with that perspective there, there's probably a little bit less volatility than you might expect in terms of as we pace out and we think about valuations in this business and where we would have stepped into it maybe a number of years ago where we are now. And even if you look towards a public market and such, this just don't manifest quite as quickly. But they also kind of on the other side, they weren't manifesting as quickly. So I would call it a little less impactful at this point and juncture, but the key point that I think we focused on is, these have been multiyear conversations and relationship builds for us as we move into these, and typically not a 6-month process."

I think about senior market  continuous agenda of innovation is super important  Dirk talked about the UCARD, which is something that makes our benefits easier to use, more simple for members to understand on and experience. But beyond that, we'll continue to bring forth consistent innovations that make the member experience easier for people. Things like the digital experience, more personalized member experiences as well. I think another theme for the senior population will continue to be to -- on expand at-home services. That's really important. I think we've historically thought of the center of care for seniors to be in the physician's office. More and more, though, that's becoming something that needs to occur out of the home given mobility channels, challenges for folks, the vulnerability of this population, bringing care into the home is absolutely essential to the delivery of high-quality care. So those are the big themes. For me, looking forward is continue to advance the at-home capabilities for seniors and continue to innovate, make using benefits easier, more understandable, simple, affordable."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. And as a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under US federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts, a recorrelation of the non-GAAP to the GAAP amounts available on the financial and earnings report section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning in our Form 8-K dated April 14, 2022, which will be assessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to Chief Executive Officer of the UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Coming into this quarter, we set clear objectives for the year to drive strong execution of our long-term strategy and deliver high-quality diversified growth, pursue excellence in every consumer experience and at every touch point and apply technology to help all stakeholders to improve access, affordability, outcomes and experiences. As our results show, we're delivering on these objectives. I would like to start this morning's call by thanking my colleagues, the 350,000 people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Their dedicated work gives us the confidence today to increase our 2022 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $21.20 to $21.70 per share. At our November investor conference, we described five key areas to drive our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth rate. In the first area, value-based care delivery. OptumHealth continued its robust momentum into the first quarter, characterized by its integrated approach and high clinical quality. After a strong start to the year, we now expect to add 600,000 patients under value-based arrangements during 2022 compared to our initial estimate of $500,000. Our approach focuses on providing quality care in the setting that makes most sense for the patients we serve. Our pending combination with LHC Group will reinforce our ability to deliver care and support in the home, as well as in other ambulatory locations. Within the second growth area, health benefits, we're rapidly advancing the quality, innovation and consumer appeal of our plan offerings and bringing value-based care to scale. In Medicare Advantage, our strategic balance of benefit stability and enhancements once again helped to deliver strong growth. We remain well on track to serve an additional 800,000 people in 2022, consistent with the expectations we set last November. In the commercial benefits market, our innovative offerings such as physician-led and virtual first plans have grown to serve 350,000 more people over the past year. This underscores the consumer appeal for these high-quality primary care-based coverage options. Nearly 90% of newly enrolled people in our individual exchange offerings, selected plans with significant virtual components in the most recent open enrollment period and nearly 30% selected a virtual-first offering. You'll see us expand such offerings as we look forward to 2023. In our third growth area, Health Technology, we continue to execute on the major new health system partnerships initiated last year, including a broad relationship with SSM Health and its 11,000 providers caring for people throughout the Midwest. We are helping our health system partners alleviate administrative burdens and create an operational capacity for these organizations to focus on delivering high-quality patient care and experiences. These partnerships move far beyond traditional revenue cycle management with both clinical and technology features becoming important. Fourth, our developing efforts in health financial services, streamlining and simplifying payments for providers, payers, and consumers, while reducing friction and increasing speed and convenience, consider our new integrated consumer card, which we introduced in January. Many people typically have separate cards for clinical care, pharmacy benefits, food assistance programs, fitness, rewards programs and more. We've combined these benefits into a single card vastly simplifying the experience for consumers and providers, and we plan to do even more in the future. And finally, pharmacy services. The high cost of specialty drugs is one of the most pressing issues for our health plan partners. Drawing upon all of Optum's advanced analytical capabilities, we're collaborating with health plans to provide clinicians access to real-time medical and pharmacy analytics, which are coordinated with a patient-specific benefit plan design, enabling clinicians to determine the most effective and appropriate therapies at the point of care. Our initial results are highly positive, helping to lower specialty costs by over 15%. Overall, OptumRx's performance in the quarter, healthy strong sales pipeline provide a great foundation for growth. These efforts from expanding in-home and broad value-based care offerings to enhancements to Medicare Advantage to simplifying how to finance care are designed to create greater value for consumers and more broadly, have a profound impact on the lives of families and individuals and communities with all levels of need across America, which is a powerful motivation for all of us at this company each and every day. Dirk McMahon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will now share more about these efforts. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. There is no more important aspect of the consumer experience in health care than convenient access to quality care, not theoretical access but care when and where people need it. Testing, for instance, is an area where we see significant opportunity to improve the consumer experience. It can be a burden for people to test for conditions such as colorectal cancer. As a result, too often, people just won't deal with the hassle early-stage condition, and as a result, early-stage conditions go undiagnosed and people don't get the care they need until things get really serious, which is bad for their health and results in unnecessarily higher intensity treatments and costs in the future. Like many of you, we have observed more willingness by patients for trial and adoption of in-home testing for many types of chronic conditions. However, it can be challenging for people to first, find test and then make sure the results get back into a doctor's workflow. Patients need to call providers for a prescription, go to disparate locations to pick up the test and then somehow get the piece of paper with a test result into an already busy clinic operation. At UnitedHealthcare, we've introduced an integrated solution that addresses all of the tasks that need to occur sequentially for test results to get into a clinic system. This digitally enabled solution is resulting in nearly 10% increase in people obtaining necessary screening versus a multi-step process. We are expanding this vital capability to more people and making additional types of tests available as well. As many of you know, the first quarter tends to be the most impactful in setting us up for operational success for the remainder of the year. The ease of that initial experience for people has a lasting impact on consumer and customer perceptions and buying decisions, not just for the next three months, but often for years to come. So we thought it would be timely and helpful to provide a bit of a performance report card for the quarter. A short version, this is where we owe a great thank you to the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Perhaps nowhere was this more apparent than in the onboarding of the many new people served under value based arrangements within OptumHealth. Investing in the preparation of systems and training in physicians and staff was critical in laying the groundwork to provide high quality care for these new patients and expanding into new geographies. For example, in Ohio and New York, we are observing early improvements in post-acute trends such as skilled nursing facility admits declining 25% in just the first quarter of operation. It's a testament to the deep integration of our post-acute capabilities for transitioning patients to the most appropriate setting for their needs as well as a patient-centric orientation of our local care delivery organizations and their vigilance on care continuity. At UnitedHealthcare, our digital investments are continuing to serve our care providers and helping advance our efforts to move to a paperless experience. In the first quarter, visits to our digital portal continued to increase, while provider support costs declined about 12% from historical averages. Importantly, we have driven a 38% increase in providers using digital documents instead of paper in just this first quarter compared to last year. We expect the efforts we have taken in this quarter will save 80 tonnes of paper over the next five years. Before handing off to John, let me briefly -- let me turn briefly to our pending combination with Change Healthcare. By now, it should be clear we are deeply committed to helping achieve a simpler, more intelligent an adaptive health system for patients, payers and providers. The combination of Optum and Change Healthcare will connect and simplify core clinical, administrative and payment processes, health care providers and payers depend on to serve patients. Increasing efficiency and reducing friction will benefit the entire health system, resulting in lower costs and a better experience for all stakeholders. Our extended agreement with Change Healthcare reflects our firm belief in the potential benefits of this combination to improve health care and in our ability to successfully overcome the challenge to this merger. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2022 performance positions us well to deliver on our full year financial and growth objectives. Revenues grew by $10 billion or 14% to $80 billion over the year ago first quarter, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. This strong diversified growth was largely organic with balanced contributions from across both our services and benefits operating platforms. Compared to a year ago, we are adding over 1 million more people to OptumHealth, supporting 30% more patients in value-based relationships, providing over 20 million more prescriptions and serving 1.5 million more people across our health benefit offerings. I'll start by providing a little color on care patterns over the course of the quarter and then turn to our individual businesses. As you'd expect, there was considerable variation in care patterns due to the COVID incidence peak early in the quarter. For example, in January, we had about 40,000 COVID related hospitalizations, the highest of any months since the onset of the pandemic. By March, these declined to around 2,000. Overall, care in the quarter was about at baseline levels though we observe pockets that are modestly below historical baseline, such as emergency department and pediatric visits. However, we are not assuming this is a permanent shift in consumer behaviour. As it relates to potential longer term health impacts on people due to care which was deferred during the height of the pandemic, thus far we are not seeing the increasing acuity that many expected. For example, initial oncology related diagnosis levels are consistent with historical averages. Of course, our core focus remains on getting people the care they need and we are encouraged that critical screens are occurring at normalized levels. Moving now to business performance. OptumHealth revenue grew 34% in the first quarter, and earnings from operations rose over 40%. Revenue per consumer grew 33%. This was driven primarily by the increasing number of patients served under value-based arrangements. Continued augmentation of our value-based care offerings, such as expanding digital care and our services into the home, the opportunity to serve more people, much more broadly and deeply. And we expect to grow strongly for years to come. OptumInsight revenue grew 13% year-over-year. The revenue backlog was $22.8 billion, growth of $2 billion or 10% over the prior year. Our expanding health system partnerships are contributing to this growth, and we expect the number and breadth of these partnerships to continue to grow. OptumRx revenues grew 11% to $24 billion, reflecting the strength of new business relationships secured over the course of last year. We typically incur significant investments in the early months of these expansions to assure strong performance and value for our customers. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Revenue growth of 14% was driven across the businesses. Our Medicare Advantage offerings remain on track to add up to 800,000 people. About three quarters will be an individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans. New seniors aging into Medicare are increasingly selecting Medicare Advantage based on the value it offers and the 5-star quality plan performance we achieved this year enables us to enroll people in our plan offerings through the year. People served by our Medicaid offerings grew by over 150,000 in the first quarter and is now approaching $8 million. Our growth outlook for the remainder of the year continues to incorporate an expectation that states will resume eligibility redeterminations when the public health emergency lapses, resulting in modest net attrition. First quarter commercial enrollment was in line with our expectations. The decline in people served under fee-based arrangements was driven by three previously known customer transitions, which were offset by core growth. We see the number of people served overall increasing as we progress through '22, driven by the strong market response to our more recently introduced innovative offerings, as well as the continued recovery in the total number of people covered by employer health benefits, which typically lags reported job growth.  Our capital capacities remain strong. First quarter cash flows from operations of $5.3 billion or 1x net income were consistent with our expectations. And we continue to expect full year cash flows of about $24 billion or 1.2x net income. We returned nearly $4 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases, and ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38%.  And as we look toward completing both the LHC and change combinations this year, we will continue to have ample capacities to expand upon the ways we can serve people and help them to live healthier lives. As noted earlier, based on this growth outlook, today we increased our adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $2.20 to $21.70 per share. And we continue to expect the seasonal pattern to be more consistent with our historical experience with just under 50% of the full year earnings in the first half.  Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, John. I hope that you will recognize the consistent themes that we laid out last year as our guidepost for sustainable growth. Our focus on execution and continuous improvement across our businesses is a characteristic that we're going to sustain as we build upon this strong start to 2022.  And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator:  We will now take our first question from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nLisa Gill: Hi, thanks very much good morning. John, I just want to go back to your comments around utilization trends. You talked about hospitalization now down to 2,000 here in March. But baseline somewhat moderating back, but you talked about ER&Ps. But can you maybe just talk about the difference of what you're seeing in commercial versus government? And then secondly, it sounds like you are not really anticipating that there's still a lot of pent-up demand. Am I hearing that correctly? And how do I think about the trend as we move here towards the back half of the year?\nAndrew Witty: Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Let me ask John to respond to the first part and then Brian Thompson, maybe you could just speak to a little bit the demand piece and maybe Brian pick up within that any sense of acuity shifts. I think that would be helpful for the folks who are listening. John, first.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Lisa, it's John. Yes, so in the first quarter, still seeing similar trends in terms of utilization across the different categories you talked about. A little bit higher in commercial. A little bit lower in government programs. But everything kind of trending back more to those baseline levels, overall. And pointing out, as you appropriately noted here, we were still seeing some pockets here of differentiation, such as impedes and emergency department. That's been a trend we've seen, not to the point yet where we'd expect that to continue, but a consumer differences that we've noted. Also on your comment, and Brian will go into this much more deeply, but as it relates to the potential for acuity, this is something we talked about very early on in the pandemic, as people were missing treatments and how might they come back into the system. It's still something we're extremely watchful for across very -- a lot of categories. I spoke specifically to oncology and what we're seeing in those areas. So good to see people getting their screenings. What we haven't seen, though, is this expectation we had for the incidence rates might actually come up because of missed treatments over their earlier period. And, Brian, could you offer a little more commentary.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Thanks, John, and thanks for the question, Lisa. I think John summed it up nicely. As you expected, the quarter was odd in that, obviously, there was stronger levels of hospitalizations and infections in January, and that clearly deteriorated down to a lower level in March, so kind of a tale of two stories inside the quarter. As John alluded to, commercial, a little more close to baseline, with Medicaid being the lowest and Medicare in between. When you think about service type, inpatient running slightly above baseline, but that was really a function of January in those higher hospitalizations that we saw and really encouraged as we look at physician visits, because those accelerated through the quarter, sort of, offsetting and consistent with the reduction in infection levels. On strain dynamics, maybe another thing I'll point out, clearly, less severe in Omicron than what we saw in Delta. We saw hospitalizations at about half the level that we saw. But again, confirming what John said, really no signs of deferred care, and we've been watching this closely throughout the pandemic, looking at screens, diagnosis, severity, progression. And it usually cycles through pretty quickly after we've seen large infections within two to three months to get back to baseline. And that's where we're at right now, leaving the quarter. So feel good about where we're at as we pace forward into the next quarter.\nAndrew Witty: Great. John and Brian, thanks so much for that. Yes, it was a very -- it was definitely a quarter of two parts in terms of January and then how February and March move forward with the shift in impacts of Omicron during this quarter. And -- but I think what you've heard from both John and Brian really reflects the kind of movement back towards kind of baseline activities with one or two exceptions. Rest assured, we are really watching like a hawk to see any evolving trend around acuity shift. Obviously, that's super important from a patient welfare perspective. But so far, we haven't seen very many signals of that at all. But it's maybe still early days. Lisa, thanks so very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just thought I might ask, where, obviously, a lot of discussion in the broad market about inflationary pressures. And my sense is, you're pretty well matched, particularly on the insurance side, but I wonder if you might take a few minutes and just sort of think. I know there's a lot of different things going on in Optum. How do you feel as we enter a period where there may be a little more inflationary pressure that you're matched revenue versus cost? Is there any pressure points? Is there any places where it's actually helpful to you? Maybe comment on that.\nAndrew Witty: A.J., thanks so much for the question. I'll make a couple of comments and maybe ask Dirk a little bit to reflect on the broader perspective. And then, Brian, again, just to talk a little bit to within the UHC portfolio. I mean, generally speaking, I want to make it super clear. Our focus always is to try and get the very best value proposition for our clients, members and patients. And I think at the time of inflation, that responsibility we carry really seriously. So, making sure that there are advocates really in the system to get the best deal possible for the folks who rely on us to continue to get good access to health care services and the care they need when they need it is something we're very focused on. So, we're fortunate to have some very long-term positions in place with a wide range of inputs that we rely on, which is obviously important. Brian may talk a little bit to that in a second from a UHC perspective. But whether you look at our OptumRx portfolio where we're going to continue to focus on getting really the lowest inflationary pressures. As an overall agenda, this is a time where UnitedHealth Group in all of its parts is going to be first and foremost, do everything it can to protect the people who rely on us from the forces of inflation. With that backdrop, maybe Dirk, you could pick up a little bit more broadly some of the things we're doing in the company and then pass to Brian.\nDirk McMahon: Yes. So thanks, Andrew. Yes, hi A.J. So, first of all, yes, we're always sensitive to the challenges that people face in health care, specifically from a cost perspective. That's a big reason why we have affordability agenda that's really focused on total cost of care, lowering total cost of care for people, and also telling people in these inflationary times how they get more out of their benefits that they purchased from us. We've also done things we've talked before about getting really some good products in the marketplace, like our virtual products, which are 15% lower than other prevailing products in those markets. And as Andrew said, we're working really hard on technology to improve productivity. One of the things we're trying to do from a productivity standpoint is do that to enable us to make targeted investments in our people and to or otherwise pass that through in the form of premiums to folks. So, those are things from a productivity standpoint that on. From a labor strategy standpoint, more broadly, at the last fall as the sort of the great resonation progressed, we made some investments -- targeted investments in our people. In the first quarter, we had our normal merit review cycle with raises. So, we're trying to make from an internal perspective, the right thing to do. But as we look forward in -- for the remainder of the year, we're going to have to make -- continue to make targeted investments in areas like clinicians and in customer service folks where we see higher levels of attrition. So that's a broad brush as to what we're as to what we're doing. Brian, go ahead.\nBrian Thompson: Yes, thanks, Dirk. As you might expect, there are good disciplines in management inside UnitedHealthcare that I'm pleased with where we're at, pricing to our forward view of costs being one, including inflation, Obviously, we have some provider agreements that do offer multiyear predictability, but this is less about being insulated from the overall inflation environment and more about our responsibility to drive down that total cost is Dirk alluded to. And I'm more encouraged than ever on things like value-based care, consumer transparency to navigate the system to get to the appropriate side of service, having the tools digitally to ensure we can enable that virtual engagement and post-acute and home innovation to really avoid those expensive hospital stay. So, those are the elements that we can really drive to try to offset the overall cost.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Brian, very well said, I think. And our response to inflation is innovation. Simple as that. The way in which we're going to get the best outcome for folks who rely on us is to continue to innovate, how we work inside the company to deliver greater productivity, how we deliver efficient access to the system for members and patients, how we take advantage of things like virtual care platforms and how we truly bring to life the value of value-based care and all of the work that's going on between UnitedHealthcare and Optum, that is going to be a tremendous aid to us in ensuring that we can manage through this on behalf of the people who rely on us. So A.J., thanks so much for the question. Next question please operator.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks and good morning. I had a question just on the LHCG acquisition. And I guess, a two-parter. First, just as you've conducted a portfolio review of LHCG's assets. Just interested if you've made a decision yet on whether you plan to retain all of the key assets separate from home health, particularly thinking about hospice and personal care. And then we'll just also be interested just on some of the key synergies that you're seeing as you look out to integrate LHCG into Optum's broader clinical platform, particularly when thinking about some of the more adjacent assets such as Landmark and Navi Health that you already have in the home base care umbrella? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Scott, thanks so much for the question. And I'm going to ask Wyatt Decker in a second to give you a little more response on this. LHC, we're incredibly proud of coming to an agreement with the LHC Board to bring together the two organizations. Obviously, it's a transaction, which hasn't closed yet. So I'm not going to go into too much detail about it. But let me say a few things. And I had a great pleasure, even on Monday, actually to spend some good time with the founders and the leadership team of LHC. Unbelievable positive culture inside the organization that's been built up by Keith and Ginger since they first founded it, really a company with a true heart and really puts patients first and their families first extraordinary impact in all of their lines of operations and how they can have a significant impact on the lives of people who very often are excluded from care. This is really about opening up access to a lot of people who would not otherwise find easy access to the system is really important. And I like very much all of the aspects I've seen of that organization look forward very much to successfully bringing it into the UnitedHealth Group portfolio. I would also say, and this is why I'm going to ask Dr. Decker to take a little bit more deeper dive, we're really moving at speed to bring together our home and community capabilities. And if you look at what's really driving alongside our value-based strategy for the clinics, the rapid growth of our home and community offering, which has brought together, the NaviHealth, Landmark will over time, align with LHC when it joins into the organization built on our original Optima Home product. It's an extraordinary set of capabilities and it's positioning us very well to, for example, serve the D-SNP population in a way, which historically would not have been possible. And that, as you've heard from John earlier, is a big piece of our growth in the first quarter. And maybe with that backdrop, I'll pass to Dr. Decker to give you a little more detail.\nWyatt Decker: Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. And Scott, thank you for the question. We are very excited with the combination of LHC Group. I think Andrew said it well. They have a long-standing culture since they're founding in a small community in Louisiana 1994 of commitment to serve others and help people live their healthiest lives in a home care setting. They've developed multiple capabilities, which actually really nicely complement our growing home and community platform that Andrew touched on. So very excited about that. The quality of care that they provide is remarkable. It's a full 33% higher in the stars quality ratings than the national average for home health care just as an example. And we share this commitment to quality and service. So we feel it's a really good alignment. And then building on your question and Andrew's comments, as we weave home healthcare together with the more kind of complex offerings of post-acute care and complex care in the home that we've already brought into our home community platform, we see remarkable synergies, and this will continue to grow. It also begins to address the question of why has it been so hard to have home care be delivered in a value-based construct. And our vision is with these comprehensive set of offerings stitching it together in a way that is differentiated and helps people get better healthcare outcomes. Initially, we'll help deploy them in the post-acute care setting right out of the gate. Thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: All right. Thanks, Dr. Decker. And A.J., thanks so much for the question. I'll maybe leave you with one thought on LHC actually and just for your awareness, 85% of LHC providers are 4-star or better rating from a quality perspective. I mean that just tells you everything you need to know about that organization and why we wanted to be part of our family. We think it's going to bring great access, great quality to members and families across the country. A. J., thanks so much for the question. Next question, operator, please?\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Justin Lake, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask a question about value-based care. First, kind of with the improvement in the outlook for penetration there. I'm curious if you were to step back and look at the entire kind of value-based care operation you have and think about the penetration in terms of capitation, if you could share that number with us, meaning the total TAM there of your physicians and their patients, how many of them are already in value-based care and what's the potential still to come? And then just given all the competition in the space. I thought it's interesting, there's been some industry chatter that you made a large acquisition or might be making a large acquisition in Houston. Can you talk about the M&A pipeline there? And given the competition, do you still see it as being as robust as it was, let's say, three to five years ago? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Justin, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask in a second, I\u2019ll ask Brian just to reflect a little bit on the kind of direction of travel for value-based care. I think it's super interesting to hear the perspective from a payer perspective because Obviously, what Brian and his team are looking for is how do they deliver the very best outcome and value for the folks who rely on him. But before I go to that, a couple of things. We probably I'm not sure we need to kind of go into a ton of speculation on what the potential would be. Where I would focus on is look at the rate of growth that's going on right now. So that movement in terms of growth of Medicare Advantage that Brian is leading that growth, 600,000 folks coming into the OptumCare value-based capitated environment under Dr. Decker's organization. We're focused on knowing that we are able to sustain that level of transfer and growth over many years to come. So what the ultimate ceiling is on that. I think actually is a product of our ability to continue to deliver a fantastically innovative and high-quality capability in the marketplace. And that's going to continue to attract very large numbers of folks who want to be part of and benefit from it. So I'm a little less thoughtful about what could the ceiling be? I'm much more motivated by and excited by the way in which we're at the 500,000, 600,000 rates moving across our ability to both move and grow and win external business as part of that agenda is going to be the thing that we're focused on. So maybe with that, Brian, I'd ask you to go a little further from your perspective.\nBrian Thompson: Yes. I think similar to what you said, for me, it's less about a number. I will say there's a lot of runway left. It's been about geographic expansion historically. Now it's much more than that. We've moved into duals, it's about complex care, it's about home. So, the breadth and scale is really at the core of it. And UnitedHealthcare is deeply incented to continue this journey with Optum. When you think about our best retention levels, when you think about satisfaction, when you think about where we have the lowest trend that drives the best benefits, the best quality and the best growth, all of those outcomes come when we partner with Optum. So, we're -- we have strong incentives to continue this, and I'm encouraged because there's still a lot of runway left.\nAndrew Witty: Brian, thanks so much. And Justin, just to come back to your second question around pipeline, as you'd expect, we don't comment on transactions speculation. But let me just make a few general points. You saw during Q1, we successfully closed and announced the bringing of Refresh Health into the organization. great business built by Steve Gold and his team, helping us build out our behavioral delivery capabilities within OptumHealth complements super nicely.  Our largest behavioral health network that we already have across the country from the benefit side of the business, so continue to operate there. I'd say, overall, our pipeline of opportunities, I actually think is probably as diverse as it's ever been and probably deeper than it's ever been. So, I think from a potential capital deployment capability, I think we feel pretty optimistic about that.  We continue -- as you see, we continue to be extremely disciplined about ensuring of all the very many opportunities that we see, that we focus on the ones which, first and foremost nestle centrally within our core strategies, those five growth areas I touched on earlier, Refresh Mental Health is a great example of that. So it's right into that value-based proposition in terms of how we believe we need to bring behavioral health management alongside medical management.  So first off, we need to sit centrally within our strategic framework. We need to believe in the culture and the capability of the leadership teams that we're welcoming into UnitedHealth Group. And of course, the economics have to fit with our demanding expectations to support our long-term growth ambitions of 13% to 16% and also the returns that our shareholders rightly expect. So that drives us forward. I feel confident about our ability to continue to deploy capital, which has always been a key element of helping us deliver long-term growth. So hope that gives you a little sense of where we stand, Justin. And maybe with that and the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead. \nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I just had a question. Now that we're thinking about OptumHealth, the type of growth, Andrew, that you were just talking about and really tens of billions of dollars of capitated risk, how do we think about the reserving, if OptumHealth was a stand-alone company, how do we think about reserving against that risk its taking? I presume capitate from UHC is an elimination, has all the other payer medical expense accrual, is that just rolling through your total medical accrual, John, or is there somewhere else on the balance sheet where there's payable numbers we should be paying attention to?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Gary, thanks so much. Let me go straight to John to respond to that.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Gary, it's John. Yes, it'll be rolling through in the by in the same place that you'd be seeing everything else in terms of how those occur. You're right in terms of how you think about eliminations with UnitedHealthcare business versus external business, which would not be eliminated, of course. But all in the same place in terms of how we would be appropriately reserving for those arrangements.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you so much, John. Gary, thank you very much. Emma, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please, go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Great. Thanks. I wanted to go back to the growth in OptumHealth for a minute. Can you talk a little bit about what drove that $100,000 higher number? Is that an organic number? Is that driven by deals? Is it direct contracting? Is it internally United? Is it external? Is there some way to kind of thing about that growth and what drove it? And then, I guess, just generally speaking, when you think about deals in that space, how are you thinking about multiples, either on earnings or on where you think the long term earnings can eventually be when you move that practice to capitation? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Kevin, could you just repeat the second part of the quarter? I just lost you in the middle of that just. Could you just repeat that?\nKevin Fischbeck: Sorry. Yes. Just the second part was just about deal multiples and physicians. So, I mean, I don't know how you think about it, whether it's on the actual earnings or whether it's on kind of a normalized earnings in five years, once you move that practice entirely to capitation, just trying to think about how we should think about the returns on the capital you're spending in this area.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Okay, great. Listen, Kevin, thanks so much. I'll hand to Dr. Decker to respond to you on the first part of where that extra $100,000 taken us up to $600,000 is coming from, and it'd be good for you to hear that from him. I think in terms of how we think about how we invest in this space, I'd say, each one is pretty much a unique situation, right? I mean, every doctor clinic, they're all different. They've all got tremendously different histories, situations, dynamics. And, obviously, we take a view within a broad piece of not just what have they achieved to date, but how alongside the rest of our capabilities can we build opportunities and value for patients and the utilizers of those environments. And that's what really drives our kind of economic assessment. Now, I think, what you can see is the way in which we understand and seek to continue to learn how to work better and better within the value-based envelope and how we can utilize the skills of these organizations, allows us be confident in being able to set very fairly, reward people who choose to join our organization, and that's what's driving our ability to be successful integrators of some phenomenal people and their teams across the country. And I'm so pleased they stay inside the organization. And it\u2019s super nice to be able to see OptumHealth continue to strengthen itself as a physician-led organization. And I think that is really contrasting to many others out there. This is an organization led by physicians at every level of the organization, and it makes a huge difference in terms of the way the heart and soul of this place is starting to be. And, I think, that's what underpins a lot of our contribution and competitiveness. With that, Dr. Decker, as the physician leader of the organization, maybe you could just reflect a little bit on how you're successfully driving up that growth rate.\nWyatt Decker: Sure, Andrew, happy to do it and, Kevin, thanks for the question. What you're really seeing is a result of almost 10 years of building a flywheel that now has significant momentum. We've invested in people, in technology, in data and building out networks and deepening in our established geographies as well as going into new geographies. All of that continues to yield benefits and, frankly, growth. Your question is rate. Is it organic growth that added that additional $100,000? And the answer is, yes. We saw strong results in open enrollment, member retention. And we, of course, have not only four-star plants, but five-star plants that are able to enroll patients year-round. That's also true of duals. And one final point that I'll note is that we are now -- a third of this growth this year is in the dual special needs population. And these are individuals that have difficulty accessing care, and we're able to provide care with home and community, meaning wraparound solutions in their home. So it's another model that helps us grow. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you so much. Kevin, thanks so much for the question. Much appreciated. Next question please.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thank you. Just a follow-up on a previous question. I wanted to ask a little bit more directly about significantly higher interest rate environment we're currently experiencing. Was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you expect this will impact the investment portfolio over the next couple of years as your investments mature and reinvested at higher rates. And I guess also, how should we think about this as impacting EPS growth rate you target? Is this potential upside or tailwind is going to be used to offset inflationary pressures elsewhere or maybe a softer economic backdrop, or is this something you think could actually be a net tailwind to our earnings growth over the next few years? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Stephen, thanks so much for the question. John?\nJohn Rex: Good morning. Yes, certainly, anything more than 0% interest rates is going to be helpful to us overall as we move in that environment. But it does take some time, as I think as you're accurately pointing out here. So, maybe a few perspectives I could offer on that. Roughly 40% of our $70 billion in cash and investments is tied to floating rates. So, that would be the first cut you'd want to take of that. The other 60% would be in the fixed rate environment. So, as you are alluding to, those will mature and be reinvested at higher rates over time. But not much of that piece would have any year one impact call it, in terms of how 1 would think about that. So, maybe just to give you a hypothetical here. Say you had a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. So, that would impact that 40% or call it roughly $28 billion of cash investments that are tied to floating rates. So, that would be the first place you'd see that. So, put that in the zone of it's really about $28 billion in that component. So, $280 million impact on investment income. Important to note on that, we also have about $10 billion of floating rate liabilities. So, think about the swaps floating the rest of commercial paper. So, that would also have about $100 million offset to that $280 million. So, that would be the zone I'd put you in, if you think about getting 12 months out from a first 100 basis point increase, that would be the zone. The rest of that portfolio, the other 60% will roll off over a period of years, call it, think of that probably maybe $5 billion a year rolling off as those things mature, and that would be the pacing that you should expect.\nStephen Baxter: Thank you\nAndrew Witty: John, thank you very much, Stephen thanks so much for the question. And the next question please.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Josh Raskin from Nephron. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could speak to the local market strategy, more on the Optum side in markets like New York or Houston or maybe Houston soon. I'm specifically curious about how much of the delivery system you feel you need to employ, control, own, and how we should be thinking about sort of long-term success and growth. Is that on the delivery side? Does that manifest on the benefit side as well? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Josh, thanks so much. It's a great question, actually. And I would say -- and again, I'm going to ask Wyatt to go much deeper for you on this. I would say that over the decade or so that this has been developing at Optum, I think our views are probably -- it's fair to say evolved quite a bit in terms of what the right way to operate. And not only in terms of what might be the right blend of relationships with ourselves and the physicians Also, the role of physicians versus advanced practice clinicians and others and also the role of what happens in a clinic-based environment versus a home-based environment. And I'd say particularly over the last, I don't know, maybe the last 24 months, I think that has moved on quite a lot in terms of how we're thinking about this. So I would just frame it. I'm going to hand right now to Wyatt, but I would just frame it, maybe, Josh, in those three dimensions, right? Location, kind of, relationship between and then type of clinician are, I think, evolving dynamics around, which we're becoming more and more opinionated. Maybe on that, Wyatt, you could go a little deeper.\nWyatt Decker: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks, Josh, for the question. Andrew framed it up very accurately. And so our thinking and frankly, the practice and value-based medicine is evolving as we're able to go into the home, provide virtual care and behavioral care and comprehensive services even that overcome things like social determinants. So in markets like New York state that have primarily been fee-for-service, we do see an opportunity to move to value-based care. And it's a blend of employed physicians and affiliated and contracted physicians. But increasingly, it is bringing all of the solutions that we offer within Optum, including OptumRx and other places in the enterprise and OptumHealth to bear on helping people get the best health care outcomes possible, lower the total cost of care and actually make care very convenient for health care consumers. And that's a differentiated in the marketplace. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Wyatt, thanks so much. Josh, thanks for the question. Next question please, Emma.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi, good morning. So OptumRx grew EBIT mid-single digits. Should we think about this as a steady state based on growth, and if we think about  coming to market sometime next year, is high single-digit EBIT growth a reasonable place for us to model on top of what we've seen this quarter? And just one follow-up, I think, Dirk, you talked about in-home testing in your prepared remarks. Is this something that you're focusing on the Medicare and dual book, or is this also an offering to the commercial book? And is that -- and are you working with the national labs on that strategy?\nAndrew Witty: Ricky, thanks so much for the questions. Before I go to Heather, let's tackle your first question -- your second question first, and maybe I'll go to Tim Noel to comment a little bit from the perspective of the Medicare book that you're looking at in terms of the home testing opportunity and dynamic.\nTim Noel: Yeah, Ricky, Tim Noel here. Thank you very much for the question. In-home testing is certainly a huge area of focus for us. There\u2019s, obviously, a component of it that relates to some of the work that we do on an annual basis with respect to Star and closing some of those gaps related to the Star measurement methodology. But more recently, we've really been focused on reaching out to people that we know to be under-diagnosed for conditions like Hep C and diabetes. And in doing this, we've reached out over the last year to about one million members who we suspect to be under-diagnosed and offering in-home testing solutions that are then delivered by our health call partners over at Optum. I mean these completion rates have been really promising, 35% last year, and we'll continue to evaluate expanding this program. That will do a really nice job of helping us understand where conditions are under-diagnosed and can be better treated.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks so much. And Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Yeah. So Tim did a great job explaining Ricky, and direct answer to your question, we have started with Medicare and we'll move to commercial as we proceed along. But this is a Medicare start was what I was talking about specifically.\nAndrew Witty: Excellent. Thanks so much. Now just before I hand over to Heather to go deeper on the OptumRx piece. Ricky, as you alluded to, as we roll into next year, in particular, we're coming into a kind of a bit of a new cycle for pharma in a way in terms of the biosimilar opportunities and obviously, you refer to one very significant one, really an important one. So it's clearly going to be a super dynamic environment, which we're Heather's team is absolutely engaged in and getting ready for. I would just say, as I look, very pleased to see that acceleration of growth rate during the first quarter, and that's down to a tremendous amount of hard work in terms of developing the right product and service driving our retention and, of course, win rate. And one of the things I keep an eye on is the number of bid opportunities that we have in front of us, right, in terms of what's coming in. It's been super interesting to see that ratchet up over the last 12 months or so. So the market -- the market is activating. I don't think you'd be super surprised to hear that given the last couple of years, but it is activating. So we're seeing more and more business come to market. Been super reassured by our sustained very, very high retention rates. And Heather, now maybe can reflect a little bit on how she sees that all playing out over the next year or two. Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Thank you. Thank you. Yes, maybe I'll just build on what Andrew said, just first, maybe, Ricky, to your question, you can see our relentless focus under just growth in the pharmacy benefit business, but also the pharmacy services and the direct-to-consumer. So that will continue to support our top line growth. That will support that retention and continued growth -- membership growth in the PBM. But in addition, those pharmacy services become increasingly important as we look at the future in these coming years, you're right, there's -- as we look long anticipated introduction of multiple opportunities in biosimilar and other specialty services for our members. The services that we offer through our pharmacy services programs are really, I think, going to drive not just the growth in our -- the top line of our business, that continued push in our earnings, which as committing to our guidance for this year, which you see it as a mid- to high actually single-digits. And then longer term kind of moderating in the mid-single digits, and that's really that relentless focus on pushing the value and from the pharmacy services into our clients and into our patients and our clients' consumers and making sure that we continue to drive the tools and services that our clients will pay for. Those are our clients, our external book of clients, our UnitedHealthcare client, and that's also our pharmacy services clients like our community pharmacy clients, which really need services and offerings like our behavioral health services that really integrate a fragmented system. So I look at the whole thing. And as we move forward, the tools like our clinical analytics, our PBM, our specialty program management services that were referenced in by Andrew early in our script this morning, as well as our continued push to transform using our pharmacists as the way we're really going to grow our business.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Heather, thanks so much. And Ricky, thank you very much for the question. We just have time for one last question. So Emma, maybe go to the last question.\nOperator: Certainly. We will now take our final question from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks and good morning. So just to tie a lot of things together that have been talked about on the call, with the $0.90 increase in EPS guidance for 2022, just wanted to ask for a little bit more color on how much of this better outlook is driven by the Optum segment in particular versus the UHC segment versus any other factors at the corporate level? I'm guessing it's maybe mostly driven by Optum and maybe OptumHealth within that, but also what else ex Optum is maybe performing better, that's worth calling out as well? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Steven, thanks so much. I think maybe you misspoke. It's a \u2013 we increased our guidance range this year by $0.10, both at the top and the bottom of the guidance range just to reconfirm that. But listen, that raise is essentially based on the strong performance of Q1, good start to the year. We feel good about that. While -- as always, there's a lot of moving parts in our world and you've heard from people like Brian in some detail about some of the dynamic of the first quarter, actually, as it all comes together, the year is kind of shaping up pretty much in-line with the expectations we were laying out to you all in November last year.  Strong performance is supported by execution across all of our businesses. I would say, all of the core businesses of Optum, of UnitedHealthcare have started the year well. We continue to be very focused on the execution of those within those businesses, of course and I think what you're continuing to see, and I hope you've heard some of that in the conversation today and it's certainly reflecting through the results. is the synergy opportunities, which are coming to life between the two organizations, you heard a lot about value-based care, now that whole value-based care model, which we believe is truly capable of transforming experiences, not just for patients, but for physicians and payers. That's a product of the two organizations working together.  The development of in-home care, same thing, very much being led by the two organizations working together. And increasingly, what we're seeing as we strengthen our capabilities in areas like that with our deployment of capital and some of the acquisitions we\u2019ve been making. So for example organizations like naviHealth, Landmark and others, that's then driving strong external growth as well.  So really, really demonstrating how building these kind of fundamental innovations in the way in which care can be thought about, can then not just be attractive to UnitedHealthcare, of course, but also to many other payers and completely reinforces our deep commitment to be a multi-payer organization, building products and services in Optum which work not just for UHC, but for payers across the spectrum. And that's what you're seeing supporting the business. And it supports our confidence in raising the outlook for the rest of this year.  So I hope that gives you a clear sense of that and very much appreciate that final question, Steven. And thank you to everybody else for joining the call this morning. We truly appreciate your interest and your attention. I hope what you heard in the call today is a strong sense of the confidence in our long-term strategy. And as I just said again, an intensely disciplined focus in its execution. We're aiming to create value for consumers, advancing our mission and delivering high-quality diversified growth in this quarter and for many years to come. We look forward to sharing that progress with you again when we next talk in July. Thank you so much, and appreciate your attention today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. You may now all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dirk McMahon",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. There is no more important aspect of the consumer experience in health care than convenient access to quality care, not theoretical access but care when and where people need it. Testing, for instance, is an area where we see significant opportunity to improve the consumer experience. It can be a burden for people to test for conditions such as colorectal cancer. As a result, too often, people just won't deal with the hassle early-stage condition, and as a result, early-stage conditions go undiagnosed and people don't get the care they need until things get really serious, which is bad for their health and results in unnecessarily higher intensity treatments and costs in the future. Like many of you, we have observed more willingness by patients for trial and adoption of in-home testing for many types of chronic conditions. However, it can be challenging for people to first, find test and then make sure the results get back into a doctor's workflow. Patients need to call providers for a prescription, go to disparate locations to pick up the test and then somehow get the piece of paper with a test result into an already busy clinic operation. At UnitedHealthcare, we've introduced an integrated solution that addresses all of the tasks that need to occur sequentially for test results to get into a clinic system. This digitally enabled solution is resulting in nearly 10% increase in people obtaining necessary screening versus a multi-step process. We are expanding this vital capability to more people and making additional types of tests available as well. As many of you know, the first quarter tends to be the most impactful in setting us up for operational success for the remainder of the year. The ease of that initial experience for people has a lasting impact on consumer and customer perceptions and buying decisions, not just for the next three months, but often for years to come. So we thought it would be timely and helpful to provide a bit of a performance report card for the quarter. A short version, this is where we owe a great thank you to the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Perhaps nowhere was this more apparent than in the onboarding of the many new people served under value based arrangements within OptumHealth. Investing in the preparation of systems and training in physicians and staff was critical in laying the groundwork to provide high quality care for these new patients and expanding into new geographies. For example, in Ohio and New York, we are observing early improvements in post-acute trends such as skilled nursing facility admits declining 25% in just the first quarter of operation. It's a testament to the deep integration of our post-acute capabilities for transitioning patients to the most appropriate setting for their needs as well as a patient-centric orientation of our local care delivery organizations and their vigilance on care continuity. At UnitedHealthcare, our digital investments are continuing to serve our care providers and helping advance our efforts to move to a paperless experience. In the first quarter, visits to our digital portal continued to increase, while provider support costs declined about 12% from historical averages. Importantly, we have driven a 38% increase in providers using digital documents instead of paper in just this first quarter compared to last year. We expect the efforts we have taken in this quarter will save 80 tonnes of paper over the next five years. Before handing off to John, let me briefly -- let me turn briefly to our pending combination with Change Healthcare. By now, it should be clear we are deeply committed to helping achieve a simpler, more intelligent an adaptive health system for patients, payers and providers. The combination of Optum and Change Healthcare will connect and simplify core clinical, administrative and payment processes, health care providers and payers depend on to serve patients. Increasing efficiency and reducing friction will benefit the entire health system, resulting in lower costs and a better experience for all stakeholders. Our extended agreement with Change Healthcare reflects our firm belief in the potential benefits of this combination to improve health care and in our ability to successfully overcome the challenge to this merger. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. Yes. So thanks, Andrew. Yes, hi A.J. So, first of all, yes, we're always sensitive to the challenges that people face in health care, specifically from a cost perspective. That's a big reason why we have affordability agenda that's really focused on total cost of care, lowering total cost of care for people, and also telling people in these inflationary times how they get more out of their benefits that they purchased from us. We've also done things we've talked before about getting really some good products in the marketplace, like our virtual products, which are 15% lower than other prevailing products in those markets. And as Andrew said, we're working really hard on technology to improve productivity. One of the things we're trying to do from a productivity standpoint is do that to enable us to make targeted investments in our people and to or otherwise pass that through in the form of premiums to folks. So, those are things from a productivity standpoint that on. From a labor strategy standpoint, more broadly, at the last fall as the sort of the great resonation progressed, we made some investments -- targeted investments in our people. In the first quarter, we had our normal merit review cycle with raises. So, we're trying to make from an internal perspective, the right thing to do. But as we look forward in -- for the remainder of the year, we're going to have to make -- continue to make targeted investments in areas like clinicians and in customer service folks where we see higher levels of attrition. So that's a broad brush as to what we're as to what we're doing. Brian, go ahead. Yeah. So Tim did a great job explaining Ricky, and direct answer to your question, we have started with Medicare and we'll move to commercial as we proceed along. But this is a Medicare start was what I was talking about specifically."

            "content": "Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. And Scott, thank you for the question. We are very excited with the combination of LHC Group. I think Andrew said it well. They have a long-standing culture since they're founding in a small community in Louisiana 1994 of commitment to serve others and help people live their healthiest lives in a home care setting. They've developed multiple capabilities, which actually really nicely complement our growing home and community platform that Andrew touched on. So very excited about that. The quality of care that they provide is remarkable. It's a full 33% higher in the stars quality ratings than the national average for home health care just as an example. And we share this commitment to quality and service. So we feel it's a really good alignment. And then building on your question and Andrew's comments, as we weave home healthcare together with the more kind of complex offerings of post-acute care and complex care in the home that we've already brought into our home community platform, we see remarkable synergies, and this will continue to grow. It also begins to address the question of why has it been so hard to have home care be delivered in a value-based construct. And our vision is with these comprehensive set of offerings stitching it together in a way that is differentiated and helps people get better healthcare outcomes. Initially, we'll help deploy them in the post-acute care setting right out of the gate. Thanks for the question. Sure, Andrew, happy to do it and, Kevin, thanks for the question. What you're really seeing is a result of almost 10 years of building a flywheel that now has significant momentum.

And as we move forward, the tools like our clinical analytics, our PBM, our specialty program management services that were referenced in by Andrew early in our script this morning, as well as our continued push to transform using our pharmacists as the way we're really going to grow our business."

            "name": "Brian Thompson",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, John, and thanks for the question, Lisa. I think John summed it up nicely. As you expected, the quarter was odd in that, obviously, there was stronger levels of hospitalizations and infections in January, and that clearly deteriorated down to a lower level in March, so kind of a tale of two stories inside the quarter. As John alluded to, commercial, a little more close to baseline, with Medicaid being the lowest and Medicare in between. When you think about service type, inpatient running slightly above baseline, but that was really a function of January in those higher hospitalizations that we saw and really encouraged as we look at physician visits, because those accelerated through the quarter, sort of, offsetting and consistent with the reduction in infection levels. On strain dynamics, maybe another thing I'll point out, clearly, less severe in Omicron than what we saw in Delta. We saw hospitalizations at about half the level that we saw. But again, confirming what John said, really no signs of deferred care, and we've been watching this closely throughout the pandemic, looking at screens, diagnosis, severity, progression. And it usually cycles through pretty quickly after we've seen large infections within two to three months to get back to baseline. And that's where we're at right now, leaving the quarter. So feel good about where we're at as we pace forward into the next quarter. Yes, thanks, Dirk. As you might expect, there are good disciplines in management inside UnitedHealthcare that I'm pleased with where we're at, pricing to our forward view of costs being one, including inflation, Obviously, we have some provider agreements that do offer multiyear predictability, but this is less about being insulated from the overall inflation environment and more about our responsibility to drive down that total cost is Dirk alluded to. And I'm more encouraged than ever on things like value-based care, consumer transparency to navigate the system to get to the appropriate side of service, having the tools digitally to ensure we can enable that virtual engagement and post-acute and home innovation to really avoid those expensive hospital stay. So, those are the elements that we can really drive to try to offset the overall cost. Yes. I think similar to what you said, for me, it's less about a number. I will say there's a lot of runway left. It's been about geographic expansion historically. Now it's much more than that. We've moved into duals, it's about complex care, it's about home. So, the breadth and scale is really at the core of it. And UnitedHealthcare is deeply incented to continue this journey with Optum. When you think about our best retention levels, when you think about satisfaction, when you think about where we have the lowest trend that drives the best benefits, the best quality and the best growth, all of those outcomes come when we partner with Optum. So, we're -- we have strong incentives to continue this, and I'm encouraged because there's still a lot of runway left."

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Coming into this quarter, we set clear objectives for the year to drive strong execution of our long-term strategy and deliver high-quality diversified growth, pursue excellence in every consumer experience and at every touch point and apply technology to help all stakeholders to improve access, affordability, outcomes and experiences. As our results show, we're delivering on these objectives. I would like to start this morning's call by thanking my colleagues, the 350,000 people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Their dedicated work gives us the confidence today to increase our 2022 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $21.20 to $21.70 per share. At our November investor conference, we described five key areas to drive our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth rate. In the first area, value-based care delivery. OptumHealth continued its robust momentum into the first quarter, characterized by its integrated approach and high clinical quality. After a strong start to the year, we now expect to add 600,000 patients under value-based arrangements during 2022 compared to our initial estimate of $500,000. Our approach focuses on providing quality care in the setting that makes most sense for the patients we serve. Our pending combination with LHC Group will reinforce our ability to deliver care and support in the home, as well as in other ambulatory locations. Within the second growth area, health benefits, we're rapidly advancing the quality, innovation and consumer appeal of our plan offerings and bringing value-based care to scale. In Medicare Advantage, our strategic balance of benefit stability and enhancements once again helped to deliver strong growth. We remain well on track to serve an additional 800,000 people in 2022, consistent with the expectations we set last November. In the commercial benefits market, our innovative offerings such as physician-led and virtual first plans have grown to serve 350,000 more people over the past year. This underscores the consumer appeal for these high-quality primary care-based coverage options. Nearly 90% of newly enrolled people in our individual exchange offerings, selected plans with significant virtual components in the most recent open enrollment period and nearly 30% selected a virtual-first offering. You'll see us expand such offerings as we look forward to 2023. In our third growth area, Health Technology, we continue to execute on the major new health system partnerships initiated last year, including a broad relationship with SSM Health and its 11,000 providers caring for people throughout the Midwest. We are helping our health system partners alleviate administrative burdens and create an operational capacity for these organizations to focus on delivering high-quality patient care and experiences. These partnerships move far beyond traditional revenue cycle management with both clinical and technology features becoming important. Fourth, our developing efforts in health financial services, streamlining and simplifying payments for providers, payers, and consumers, while reducing friction and increasing speed and convenience, consider our new integrated consumer card, which we introduced in January. Many people typically have separate cards for clinical care, pharmacy benefits, food assistance programs, fitness, rewards programs and more. We've combined these benefits into a single card vastly simplifying the experience for consumers and providers, and we plan to do even more in the future. And finally, pharmacy services. The high cost of specialty drugs is one of the most pressing issues for our health plan partners. Drawing upon all of Optum's advanced analytical capabilities, we're collaborating with health plans to provide clinicians access to real-time medical and pharmacy analytics, which are coordinated with a patient-specific benefit plan design, enabling clinicians to determine the most effective and appropriate therapies at the point of care. Our initial results are highly positive, helping to lower specialty costs by over 15%. Overall, OptumRx's performance in the quarter, healthy strong sales pipeline provide a great foundation for growth. These efforts from expanding in-home and broad value-based care offerings to enhancements to Medicare Advantage to simplifying how to finance care are designed to create greater value for consumers and more broadly, have a profound impact on the lives of families and individuals and communities with all levels of need across America, which is a powerful motivation for all of us at this company each and every day. Dirk McMahon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will now share more about these efforts. Dirk? Thank you, John. I hope that you will recognize the consistent themes that we laid out last year as our guidepost for sustainable growth. Our focus on execution and continuous improvement across our businesses is a characteristic that we're going to sustain as we build upon this strong start to 2022.  And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please. Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Let me ask John to respond to the first part and then Brian Thompson, maybe you could just speak to a little bit the demand piece and maybe Brian pick up within that any sense of acuity shifts. I think that would be helpful for the folks who are listening. John, first. Great. John and Brian, thanks so much for that. Yes, it was a very -- it was definitely a quarter of two parts in terms of January and then how February and March move forward with the shift in impacts of Omicron during this quarter. And -- but I think what you've heard from both John and Brian really reflects the kind of movement back towards kind of baseline activities with one or two exceptions. Rest assured, we are really watching like a hawk to see any evolving trend around acuity shift. Obviously, that's super important from a patient welfare perspective. But so far, we haven't seen very many signals of that at all. But it's maybe still early days. Lisa, thanks so very much for the question. Next question, please. A.J., thanks so much for the question. I'll make a couple of comments and maybe ask Dirk a little bit to reflect on the broader perspective. And then, Brian, again, just to talk a little bit to within the UHC portfolio. I mean, generally speaking, I want to make it super clear. Our focus always is to try and get the very best value proposition for our clients, members and patients. And I think at the time of inflation, that responsibility we carry really seriously. So, making sure that there are advocates really in the system to get the best deal possible for the folks who rely on us to continue to get good access to health care services and the care they need when they need it is something we're very focused on. So, we're fortunate to have some very long-term positions in place with a wide range of inputs that we rely on, which is obviously important. Brian may talk a little bit to that in a second from a UHC perspective. But whether you look at our OptumRx portfolio where we're going to continue to focus on getting really the lowest inflationary pressures. As an overall agenda, this is a time where UnitedHealth Group in all of its parts is going to be first and foremost, do everything it can to protect the people who rely on us from the forces of inflation. With that backdrop, maybe Dirk, you could pick up a little bit more broadly some of the things we're doing in the company and then pass to Brian. Yes. Brian, very well said, I think. And our response to inflation is innovation. Simple as that. The way in which we're going to get the best outcome for folks who rely on us is to continue to innovate, how we work inside the company to deliver greater productivity, how we deliver efficient access to the system for members and patients, how we take advantage of things like virtual care platforms and how we truly bring to life the value of value-based care and all of the work that's going on between UnitedHealthcare and Optum, that is going to be a tremendous aid to us in ensuring that we can manage through this on behalf of the people who rely on us. So A.J., thanks so much for the question. Next question please operator. Scott, thanks so much for the question. And I'm going to ask Wyatt Decker in a second to give you a little more response on this. LHC, we're incredibly proud of coming to an agreement with the LHC Board to bring together the two organizations. Obviously, it's a transaction, which hasn't closed yet. So I'm not going to go into too much detail about it. But let me say a few things. And I had a great pleasure, even on Monday, actually to spend some good time with the founders and the leadership team of LHC. Unbelievable positive culture inside the organization that's been built up by Keith and Ginger since they first founded it, really a company with a true heart and really puts patients first and their families first extraordinary impact in all of their lines of operations and how they can have a significant impact on the lives of people who very often are excluded from care. This is really about opening up access to a lot of people who would not otherwise find easy access to the system is really important. And I like very much all of the aspects I've seen of that organization look forward very much to successfully bringing it into the UnitedHealth Group portfolio. I would also say, and this is why I'm going to ask Dr. Decker to take a little bit more deeper dive, we're really moving at speed to bring together our home and community capabilities. And if you look at what's really driving alongside our value-based strategy for the clinics, the rapid growth of our home and community offering, which has brought together, the NaviHealth, Landmark will over time, align with LHC when it joins into the organization built on our original Optima Home product. It's an extraordinary set of capabilities and it's positioning us very well to, for example, serve the D-SNP population in a way, which historically would not have been possible. And that, as you've heard from John earlier, is a big piece of our growth in the first quarter. And maybe with that backdrop, I'll pass to Dr. Decker to give you a little more detail. All right. Thanks, Dr. Decker. And A.J., thanks so much for the question. I'll maybe leave you with one thought on LHC actually and just for your awareness, 85% of LHC providers are 4-star or better rating from a quality perspective. I mean that just tells you everything you need to know about that organization and why we wanted to be part of our family. We think it's going to bring great access, great quality to members and families across the country. A. J., thanks so much for the question. Next question, operator, please? Justin, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask in a second, I'll ask Brian just to reflect a little bit on the kind of direction of travel for value-based care. I think it's super interesting to hear the perspective from a payer perspective because Obviously, what Brian and his team are looking for is how do they deliver the very best outcome and value for the folks who rely on him. But before I go to that, a couple of things. We probably I'm not sure we need to kind of go into a ton of speculation on what the potential would be. Where I would focus on is look at the rate of growth that's going on right now. So that movement in terms of growth of Medicare Advantage that Brian is leading that growth, 600,000 folks coming into the OptumCare value-based capitated environment under Dr. Decker's organization. We're focused on knowing that we are able to sustain that level of transfer and growth over many years to come. So what the ultimate ceiling is on that. I think actually is a product of our ability to continue to deliver a fantastically innovative and high-quality capability in the marketplace. And that's going to continue to attract very large numbers of folks who want to be part of and benefit from it. So I'm a little less thoughtful about what could the ceiling be? I'm much more motivated by and excited by the way in which we're at the 500,000, 600,000 rates moving across our ability to both move and grow and win external business as part of that agenda is going to be the thing that we're focused on. So maybe with that, Brian, I'd ask you to go a little further from your perspective. Brian, thanks so much. And Justin, just to come back to your second question around pipeline, as you'd expect, we don't comment on transactions speculation. But let me just make a few general points. You saw during Q1, we successfully closed and announced the bringing of Refresh Health into the organization. great business built by Steve Gold and his team, helping us build out our behavioral delivery capabilities within OptumHealth complements super nicely.  Our largest behavioral health network that we already have across the country from the benefit side of the business, so continue to operate there. I'd say, overall, our pipeline of opportunities, I actually think is probably as diverse as it's ever been and probably deeper than it's ever been. So, I think from a potential capital deployment capability, I think we feel pretty optimistic about that.  We continue -- as you see, we continue to be extremely disciplined about ensuring of all the very many opportunities that we see, that we focus on the ones which, first and foremost nestle centrally within our core strategies, those five growth areas I touched on earlier, Refresh Mental Health is a great example of that. So it's right into that value-based proposition in terms of how we believe we need to bring behavioral health management alongside medical management.  So first off, we need to sit centrally within our strategic framework. We need to believe in the culture and the capability of the leadership teams that we're welcoming into UnitedHealth Group. And of course, the economics have to fit with our demanding expectations to support our long-term growth ambitions of 13% to 16% and also the returns that our shareholders rightly expect. So that drives us forward. I feel confident about our ability to continue to deploy capital, which has always been a key element of helping us deliver long-term growth. So hope that gives you a little sense of where we stand, Justin. And maybe with that and the next question. Yes. Gary, thanks so much. Let me go straight to John to respond to that. Thank you so much, John. Gary, thank you very much. Emma, next question, please. Kevin, could you just repeat the second part of the quarter? I just lost you in the middle of that just. Could you just repeat that? Yes. Okay, great. Listen, Kevin, thanks so much. I'll hand to Dr. Decker to respond to you on the first part of where that extra $100,000 taken us up to $600,000 is coming from, and it'd be good for you to hear that from him. I think in terms of how we think about how we invest in this space, I'd say, each one is pretty much a unique situation, right? I mean, every doctor clinic, they're all different. They've all got tremendously different histories, situations, dynamics. And, obviously, we take a view within a broad piece of not just what have they achieved to date, but how alongside the rest of our capabilities can we build opportunities and value for patients and the utilizers of those environments. And that's what really drives our kind of economic assessment. Now, I think, what you can see is the way in which we understand and seek to continue to learn how to work better and better within the value-based envelope and how we can utilize the skills of these organizations, allows us be confident in being able to set very fairly, reward people who choose to join our organization, and that's what's driving our ability to be successful integrators of some phenomenal people and their teams across the country. And I'm so pleased they stay inside the organization. And it's super nice to be able to see OptumHealth continue to strengthen itself as a physician-led organization. And I think that is really contrasting to many others out there. This is an organization led by physicians at every level of the organization, and it makes a huge difference in terms of the way the heart and soul of this place is starting to be. And, I think, that's what underpins a lot of our contribution and competitiveness. With that, Dr. Decker, as the physician leader of the organization, maybe you could just reflect a little bit on how you're successfully driving up that growth rate. Thank you so much. Kevin, thanks so much for the question. Much appreciated. Next question please. Stephen, thanks so much for the question. John? John, thank you very much, Stephen thanks so much for the question. And the next question please. Josh, thanks so much. It's a great question, actually. And I would say -- and again, I'm going to ask Wyatt to go much deeper for you on this. I would say that over the decade or so that this has been developing at Optum, I think our views are probably -- it's fair to say evolved quite a bit in terms of what the right way to operate. And not only in terms of what might be the right blend of relationships with ourselves and the physicians Also, the role of physicians versus advanced practice clinicians and others and also the role of what happens in a clinic-based environment versus a home-based environment. And I'd say particularly over the last, I don't know, maybe the last 24 months, I think that has moved on quite a lot in terms of how we're thinking about this. So I would just frame it. I'm going to hand right now to Wyatt, but I would just frame it, maybe, Josh, in those three dimensions, right? Location, kind of, relationship between and then type of clinician are, I think, evolving dynamics around, which we're becoming more and more opinionated. Maybe on that, Wyatt, you could go a little deeper. Wyatt, thanks so much. Josh, thanks for the question. Next question please, Emma. Ricky, thanks so much for the questions. Before I go to Heather, let's tackle your first question -- your second question first, and maybe I'll go to Tim Noel to comment a little bit from the perspective of the Medicare book that you're looking at in terms of the home testing opportunity and dynamic. Tim, thanks so much. And Dirk? Excellent. Thanks so much. Now just before I hand over to Heather to go deeper on the OptumRx piece. Ricky, as you alluded to, as we roll into next year, in particular, we're coming into a kind of a bit of a new cycle for pharma in a way in terms of the biosimilar opportunities and obviously, you refer to one very significant one, really an important one. So it's clearly going to be a super dynamic environment, which we're Heather's team is absolutely engaged in and getting ready for. I would just say, as I look, very pleased to see that acceleration of growth rate during the first quarter, and that's down to a tremendous amount of hard work in terms of developing the right product and service driving our retention and, of course, win rate. And one of the things I keep an eye on is the number of bid opportunities that we have in front of us, right, in terms of what's coming in. It's been super interesting to see that ratchet up over the last 12 months or so. So the market -- the market is activating. I don't think you'd be super surprised to hear that given the last couple of years, but it is activating. So we're seeing more and more business come to market. Been super reassured by our sustained very, very high retention rates. And Heather, now maybe can reflect a little bit on how she sees that all playing out over the next year or two. Heather? Great. Heather, thanks so much. And Ricky, thank you very much for the question. We just have time for one last question. So Emma, maybe go to the last question. Steven, thanks so much. I think maybe you misspoke. It's a \u2013 we increased our guidance range this year by $0.10, both at the top and the bottom of the guidance range just to reconfirm that. But listen, that raise is essentially based on the strong performance of Q1, good start to the year. We feel good about that. While -- as always, there's a lot of moving parts in our world and you've heard from people like Brian in some detail about some of the dynamic of the first quarter, actually, as it all comes together, the year is kind of shaping up pretty much in-line with the expectations we were laying out to you all in November last year.  Strong performance is supported by execution across all of our businesses. I would say, all of the core businesses of Optum, of UnitedHealthcare have started the year well. We continue to be very focused on the execution of those within those businesses, of course and I think what you're continuing to see, and I hope you've heard some of that in the conversation today and it's certainly reflecting through the results. is the synergy opportunities, which are coming to life between the two organizations, you heard a lot about value-based care, now that whole value-based care model, which we believe is truly capable of transforming experiences, not just for patients, but for physicians and payers. That's a product of the two organizations working together.  The development of in-home care, same thing, very much being led by the two organizations working together. And increasingly, what we're seeing as we strengthen our capabilities in areas like that with our deployment of capital and some of the acquisitions we've been making. So for example organizations like naviHealth, Landmark and others, that's then driving strong external growth as well.  So really, really demonstrating how building these kind of fundamental innovations in the way in which care can be thought about, can then not just be attractive to UnitedHealthcare, of course, but also to many other payers and completely reinforces our deep commitment to be a multi-payer organization, building products and services in Optum which work not just for UHC, but for payers across the spectrum. And that's what you're seeing supporting the business. And it supports our confidence in raising the outlook for the rest of this year.  So I hope that gives you a clear sense of that and very much appreciate that final question, Steven. And thank you to everybody else for joining the call this morning. We truly appreciate your interest and your attention. I hope what you heard in the call today is a strong sense of the confidence in our long-term strategy. And as I just said again, an intensely disciplined focus in its execution. We're aiming to create value for consumers, advancing our mission and delivering high-quality diversified growth in this quarter and for many years to come. We look forward to sharing that progress with you again when we next talk in July. Thank you so much, and appreciate your attention today."

        "speaker6": {
            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you, Dirk, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2022 performance positions us well to deliver on our full year financial and growth objectives. Revenues grew by $10 billion or 14% to $80 billion over the year ago first quarter, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. This strong diversified growth was largely organic with balanced contributions from across both our services and benefits operating platforms. Compared to a year ago, we are adding over 1 million more people to OptumHealth, supporting 30% more patients in value-based relationships, providing over 20 million more prescriptions and serving 1.5 million more people across our health benefit offerings. I'll start by providing a little color on care patterns over the course of the quarter and then turn to our individual businesses. As you'd expect, there was considerable variation in care patterns due to the COVID incidence peak early in the quarter. For example, in January, we had about 40,000 COVID related hospitalizations, the highest of any months since the onset of the pandemic. By March, these declined to around 2,000. Overall, care in the quarter was about at baseline levels though we observe pockets that are modestly below historical baseline, such as emergency department and pediatric visits. However, we are not assuming this is a permanent shift in consumer behaviour. As it relates to potential longer term health impacts on people due to care which was deferred during the height of the pandemic, thus far we are not seeing the increasing acuity that many expected. For example, initial oncology related diagnosis levels are consistent with historical averages. Of course, our core focus remains on getting people the care they need and we are encouraged that critical screens are occurring at normalized levels. Moving now to business performance. OptumHealth revenue grew 34% in the first quarter, and earnings from operations rose over 40%. Revenue per consumer grew 33%. This was driven primarily by the increasing number of patients served under value-based arrangements. Continued augmentation of our value-based care offerings, such as expanding digital care and our services into the home, the opportunity to serve more people, much more broadly and deeply. And we expect to grow strongly for years to come. OptumInsight revenue grew 13% year-over-year. The revenue backlog was $22.8 billion, growth of $2 billion or 10% over the prior year. Our expanding health system partnerships are contributing to this growth, and we expect the number and breadth of these partnerships to continue to grow. OptumRx revenues grew 11% to $24 billion, reflecting the strength of new business relationships secured over the course of last year. We typically incur significant investments in the early months of these expansions to assure strong performance and value for our customers. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Revenue growth of 14% was driven across the businesses. Our Medicare Advantage offerings remain on track to add up to 800,000 people. About three quarters will be an individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans. New seniors aging into Medicare are increasingly selecting Medicare Advantage based on the value it offers and the 5-star quality plan performance we achieved this year enables us to enroll people in our plan offerings through the year. People served by our Medicaid offerings grew by over 150,000 in the first quarter and is now approaching $8 million. Our growth outlook for the remainder of the year continues to incorporate an expectation that states will resume eligibility redeterminations when the public health emergency lapses, resulting in modest net attrition. First quarter commercial enrollment was in line with our expectations. The decline in people served under fee-based arrangements was driven by three previously known customer transitions, which were offset by core growth. We see the number of people served overall increasing as we progress through '22, driven by the strong market response to our more recently introduced innovative offerings, as well as the continued recovery in the total number of people covered by employer health benefits, which typically lags reported job growth.  Our capital capacities remain strong. First quarter cash flows from operations of $5.3 billion or 1x net income were consistent with our expectations. And we continue to expect full year cash flows of about $24 billion or 1.2x net income. We returned nearly $4 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases, and ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38%.  And as we look toward completing both the LHC and change combinations this year, we will continue to have ample capacities to expand upon the ways we can serve people and help them to live healthier lives. As noted earlier, based on this growth outlook, today we increased our adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $2.20 to $21.70 per share. And we continue to expect the seasonal pattern to be more consistent with our historical experience with just under 50% of the full year earnings in the first half.  Now I'll turn it back to Andrew. Good morning, Lisa, it's John. Yes, so in the first quarter, still seeing similar trends in terms of utilization across the different categories you talked about. A little bit higher in commercial. A little bit lower in government programs. But everything kind of trending back more to those baseline levels, overall. And pointing out, as you appropriately noted here, we were still seeing some pockets here of differentiation, such as impedes and emergency department. That's been a trend we've seen, not to the point yet where we'd expect that to continue, but a consumer differences that we've noted. Also on your comment, and Brian will go into this much more deeply, but as it relates to the potential for acuity, this is something we talked about very early on in the pandemic, as people were missing treatments and how might they come back into the system. It's still something we're extremely watchful for across very -- a lot of categories. I spoke specifically to oncology and what we're seeing in those areas. So good to see people getting their screenings. What we haven't seen, though, is this expectation we had for the incidence rates might actually come up because of missed treatments over their earlier period. And, Brian, could you offer a little more commentary. Good morning, Gary, it's John. Yes, it'll be rolling through in the by in the same place that you'd be seeing everything else in terms of how those occur. You're right in terms of how you think about eliminations with UnitedHealthcare business versus external business, which would not be eliminated, of course. But all in the same place in terms of how we would be appropriately reserving for those arrangements. Good morning. Yes, certainly, anything more than 0% interest rates is going to be helpful to us overall as we move in that environment. But it does take some time, as I think as you're accurately pointing out here. So, maybe a few perspectives I could offer on that. Roughly 40% of our $70 billion in cash and investments is tied to floating rates. So, that would be the first cut you'd want to take of that. The other 60% would be in the fixed rate environment. So, as you are alluding to, those will mature and be reinvested at higher rates over time. But not much of that piece would have any year one impact call it, in terms of how 1 would think about that. So, maybe just to give you a hypothetical here. Say you had a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. So, that would impact that 40% or call it roughly $28 billion of cash investments that are tied to floating rates. So, that would be the first place you'd see that. So, put that in the zone of it's really about $28 billion in that component. So, $280 million impact on investment income. Important to note on that, we also have about $10 billion of floating rate liabilities. So, think about the swaps floating the rest of commercial paper. So, that would also have about $100 million offset to that $280 million. So, that would be the zone I'd put you in, if you think about getting 12 months out from a first 100 basis point increase, that would be the zone. The rest of that portfolio, the other 60% will roll off over a period of years, call it, think of that probably maybe $5 billion a year rolling off as those things mature, and that would be the pacing that you should expect."

There's, obviously, a component of it that relates to some of the work that we do on an annual basis with respect to Star and closing some of those gaps related to the Star measurement methodology. But more recently, we've really been focused on reaching out to people that we know to be under-diagnosed for conditions like Hep C and diabetes. And in doing this, we've reached out over the last year to about one million members who we suspect to be under-diagnosed and offering in-home testing solutions that are then delivered by our health call partners over at Optum. I mean these completion rates have been really promising, 35% last year, and we'll continue to evaluate expanding this program. That will do a really nice job of helping us understand where conditions are under-diagnosed and can be better treated."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings report section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call contained in the earnings release will be issued -- we issued this morning in our Form 8-K dated January 12, 2024, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you and good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As we conclude 2023 and embark on a new year, I'd like to express my gratitude to our more than 400,000 talented colleagues who really were UnitedHealth Group. It's directly due to their tireless efforts over the past year that we expanded our opportunities to serve more people, more comprehensively. As I reflect on our 2023 performance, certainly, the shift in care activity among seniors was an important element for us to manage effectively, and the reduced Medicare Advantage funding outlook was a significant influence on how we prepared for 2024 and all the way through to 2026. Despite the shifting care patterns and the commensurate pressure felt during \u201823, we've been able to both deliver on our growth commitments and invest and prepare for reduced MA funding cycle over the next three years. Even considering these factors, 2023 marked the year of balanced, sustainable growth for UnitedHealth Group. Importantly, we also strengthened the foundations, from which we will continue to grow in 2024 and beyond. To illustrate briefly during 2023, Optum Health approached growth of 900,000 more patients under value-based care. UnitedHealthcare added over 1.7 million new consumers in its Medicare and commercial offerings. Optum Rx managed an additional 100 million prescriptions for people. Optum Financial handled more than $500 billion in consumer payer and care provider payments. And Optum Insights facilitated more than 23 billion electronic transactions. The increasingly impactful ways we can engage with patients, consumers, care providers, and customers resulted in revenue growth of over $47 billion and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 13% in 2023. Looking to \u201824, \u201825 and beyond, we will continue to drive quality, simplicity, affordability, and accessibility to help improve healthcare system-wide, and we remain confident in and committed to our long-term 13% to 16% adjusted earnings per share growth rate. Having held our Investor Conference just six weeks ago, I'll take only a few minutes this morning to recap what you should expect from us this year, starting with our work in value-based care. Value-based care for us is a proven way of overcoming many of the widely recognized shortcomings of a fee-for-service-based health system such as fragmented consumer experiences and incentives, that can emphasize volume over quality. Our value-based offerings empower physicians to provide more connected, coordinated and comprehensive care, align incentives among consumers, care providers, and health plans, deliver better health outcomes, and improve costs. At the end of 2023, Optum Health served more than 4 million patients in fully accountable value-based arrangements in partnership with many dozens of health plans. By the end of this year, Optum Health will grow to serve at least another 750,000 patients, under such arrangements, for a total of more than twice the number of people we served just two years ago. Yet, even with the strong growth and significant investments we've made, our market presence is still quite modest and the opportunity expansive. 4 million patients served, just a small fraction of the many more people whose health ultimately will benefit from these models of care. And the total Optum Health revenue base, which today represents only 2% of the $5 trillion U.S. Healthcare System spend. We have a considerable distance to go, to achieve the broad positive system-wide impact for people's health we believe we can help drive. Turning to our consumer focus, we're working hard to help consumers more easily find experience and pay for healthcare, and that includes using their health benefits. One example of our progress can be seen in the results of UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits business. Most recently completed selling season was among our strongest in recent years. The majority of this growth will come from our relationships with large employers among the most sophisticated buyers of health benefits. Our customers tell us where we are focused on what their employees value most. Lower cost, simpler experiences, and adaptable benefits that meet their unique needs and circumstances. And the consumer NPS for these new innovative products is some 20 plus points higher than traditional health plans. We have more to do. Our goal is to become the trusted source for Healthcare information and advice, a go-to-market place for health services payments and benefits, all through a few simple taps on a consumer's phone. One of our larger consumer offerings is Medicare Advantage, which I'd like to touch on briefly. We're proud of our long track record of growth and delivering for the people who choose our offerings. During the recently completed annual enrollment period, we added about 100,000 more consumers and we remain committed to our full-year goal of 450,000 to 550,000. We believe our assumptions of ongoing care activity and approach to supplemental benefit management are entirely appropriate for the environment we are planning for and feel positive about our positioning for growth entering this three-year period. One additional item as we close out the year. To achieve our enterprise-wide long-term goals, we must consistently ensure best use of our resources, both time and capital to enable us to serve people more effectively and deliver value for our shareholders. As you likely saw, we recently agreed to the sale of our Brazil operations, where our dedicated colleagues serve people with care and compassion. We highly value the relationships we have developed over more than a decade in Brazil. After carefully evaluating our best course, we ultimately determined a sale was the right step for the people we serve and for us to best focus our energies on the many compelling growth opportunities that we consistently discuss with you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dirk McMahon, UnitedHealth Group's President and Chief Operating Officer. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Thanks, Andrew. Our growth is rooted in innovation and our intense desire always to do better. We're investing heavily in ways to accomplish that, increasing digital engagement and using AI to be more efficient, and then measuring our performance through net promoter scores to be sure we're hitting the mark. The impact of our digital engagement efforts was evident in our one-one performance metrics. As Andrew noted, we brought on one of our biggest cohorts of new people served by our commercial offerings, and our technology played an important role in making the process work well. Since last month, the UHC mobile app consistently ranked number one or number two in the Apple App Store Medical Category and on Google Play. Through the first week of the year, mobile app installs were up over more than 100% year-over-year, and our chat volume was more than twice our historical average. At Optum Rx, digital investments enabled us to bring on a record number of new clients, who brought with them more than 3 million new consumers, on-boarded with improved customer service scores and at an overall cost, 8% lower than last year, more consumer served, higher satisfaction, and lower costs. Our investments in AI and other advanced technology play an important role in improving customer service and in productivity throughout the enterprise. For example, we are removing repetitive tasks from our workflows by using AI to help with tasks such as responses to consumer inquiries, updating provider directories, and summarizing interactions with customers and patients. This frees up our service staff and clinicians to focus on solving more complicated tasks for the people we serve. And recently we launched a new capability, where we use real-time admissions and discharge data to engage high-risk MA members immediately after an emergency department visit. Connecting them to follow-up care to ensure higher-quality post-admit outcomes and avoid readmissions. This rapid response, driven by timely clinical data has improved member engagement rates by over 300% and has an NPS of 83. NPS remains a vital way to measure how we're performing for our customers and consumers and how our digital initiatives and other efforts are impacting those measures, and leading to improved retention. Couple of examples, through digital optimization, we're providing consumers with on-demand access to care, highly personalized benefits information, real-time support, and integrated pharmacy capabilities. This is translating into significant NPS improvements in many of our businesses. And we removed friction from the system through expanded access to 24/7 virtual visits and UnitedHealthcare's efforts to eliminate nearly 20% of prior authorizations. Throughout \u201824, you should expect to see an even greater investment in our digital capabilities, as we continue to identify opportunities to, leverage technology to reduce administrative costs, improve productivity, and further enhance the consumer experience at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. And now, I'll turn it over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group's, Chief Financial Officer. John?\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. Our colleagues' ongoing focus on further expanding and strengthening the foundations, which underpinned our growth pillars is paving the way for consistent growth in 2024 and beyond. Revenue in \u201823 of $372 billion grew by over 14% with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.16, grew 15% and brought full-year adjusted earnings per share to $25.12, a growth of 13%. As Andrew noted earlier, at the end of December, we entered into an agreement to sell our Brazil operations and expect to close in the first-half of this year. Upon closing, we expect to record a charge of approximately $7 billion, the majority of which is non-cash and largely due to foreign currency translation losses accumulated over several years. The impact of this one-time charge will be excluded from our \u201824 adjusted earnings per share measure. For your modeling purposes, the full-year \u201824 outlook incorporated about $6 billion of revenue for Brazil or about 1.5% of consolidated revenue. Before reviewing our business results, I'll offer some brief comments on care activity. Care patterns remain consistent with those we shared with you in the first-half of \u201823. Activity levels continue to be led by outpatient care for seniors with orthopedic and cardiac procedure categories among the more prominent. As we've noted, our benefit design approach assumed these activity levels persist throughout \u201824. And the care patterns we observed exiting \u201823 reconfirmed that decision. On the margin, we saw some modest late-year seasonal activity, such as strong and welcome response from seniors to scheduled physicians at this to receive RSV vaccinations. In some cases, these were accompanied by additional necessary care being obtained, especially for people that had not seeing a physician in some time. A positive outcome for people's health. In some though, as we reflect on full-year \u201823 results, overall care activity was broadly in-line with the views we've shared earlier. And as we enter \u201924, we're confident in the response of pricing and benefit design actions we undertook. With care patterns, continuing to be supportive of our care ratio outlook of 84% plus or minus 50 basis points. Turning to the performance of our businesses in \u201823. Optum Health revenues grew by 34% to over $95 billion as we increased the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements by about 900,000 to more than 4.1 million, expanded services in the home, and broadened and deepened the levels and types of care we offer. Optum Insight's revenues grew 30% to $18.9 billion. We concluded the year with a revenue backlog of $32.1 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over last year. This growth was driven by our diverse and expanding product portfolio, which connects many of the key stakeholders across healthcare, whether it's launching new decision support solutions for providers, claims editing software for payers, or simplifying the payment process for all, our continued investments are fostering the next phase of Optum Insight growth. Optum Rx revenues grew 16% to over $116 billion, driven by the continued addition of new clients, expansion with an existing relationship, and organic growth of our pharmacy services businesses. In 2023, both customer retention and new wins were among the best Optum Rx has delivered. At UnitedHealthcare full-year revenues of over $281 billion grew nearly 13%. Adding to Andrew's earlier comments, within Medicare Advantage, we expect a majority of our full-year growth outlook to be realized outside the annual enrollment period with the growth patterns consistent with those we have experienced over the more recent years. Our Medicaid enrollment outlook for 2024 balances two key elements. First is that, state redetermination activities will be largely completed by mid-year. And second, that growth within existing states such as North Carolina and other new opportunities will partially offset these impacts. Within our domestic commercial offerings, we expect to serve about 1.5 million additional people in \u201824, a strong result. And we are encouraged by the continued positive customer response we are experiencing as we look ahead. Our ample capital capacities continue to underpin our long-term growth objectives. Cash flow from operations in \u201823 was $29 billion or 1.3 times net income. We returned nearly $15 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends and deployed over $10 billion in growth capital to build for the future. To summarize our \u201823 performance and start to the New Year further solidifies and reinforces our confidence in both the \u201824 and long-term growth objectives we shared with you at the end of November. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John, and thank you, Dirk. Heading into 2024, I hope you all sense our confidence. We have talented people who are committed to our efforts, to help build a simpler and more consumer-friendly health system for the people we serve. And we are well-positioned to continue to deliver on the well-established commitments we've made. Operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to touch on the cost trend commentary, specifically between the Investor Day at the end of the year, looks like the MLR was a little bit higher, can you tell us what you saw there over the last month? Maybe give us some color, John, I know you guys did a great job in the second quarter of getting ahead of cost trend and utilizing some of those facility kind of insights that you have on scheduling et cetera. We're trying to figure out whether this is just seasonality or a further pickup in utilization given the Q3 to Q4 that you saw. So, maybe you could tell us what you saw -- seeing into January and just tell us where you think the Q1 comes in versus the full year? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hey Justin, thanks so much for the question. Let me just make a couple of comments, and I'm going to ask John Rex to give you a little bit more detail on the area you just talked about. So, you know, I think overall, as we look at '23, overall, it came in very much in the sort of zone we expected toward the top end of that zone, but very much within the zone of what we were expecting for the full-year and we signaled back in the middle of the year. And the bulk of that story is driven by the outpatient shift in behavior around seniors that we talked about back in June. You're right, though, post the investor conference, what we certainly saw was a click up in some seasonal activity, each of which individually are kind of pretty small. But added together just made a bit of a difference in that last run out of the quarter, around things like RSV vaccination, which has brought with it -- dragged with it, if you will, some extra utilization of services from seniors who've come in for their vaccine. Listen, to be clear, all of that is good news for healthcare, right? So these are seniors, many of whom had not been to the office for a long time. They've come back in and now got vaccinated. The physicians have picked up other things while they've been there. So a little bit of that going on combined with a little bit of heightened COVID activity just as we rolled out of the year. None of which we really think is durably impacting our outlook for \u201824. So we feel very solid around our \u201824 guidance point of 84, plus or minus 50 bps. Maybe, I ask John just to give you a little bit more click down kind of insight into all about them. Go ahead, John.\nJohn Rex: Yes. Good morning, Justin. You're absolutely right. So the prime factor here when we think about the full-year view and where we ended up being, what we talked about much earlier in the year in terms of the outpatient care activity among senior populations. And that continuing consistent with what we saw back much earlier in the year and very supportive of what we staked out in terms of the benefit design that we stepped into \u201824 with, in particular for senior populations in our Medicare Advantage products. So all those elements very much supportive of that view and the activities we undertook earlier in the year. As it relates to kind of where we landed the full year, so 10 basis points really above kind of what we indicated at the investor conference back in November of differential and Andrew hit on those items. Let me just kind of take it a little bit deep here. So, definitely some typical seasonality involved in there and the incremental elements were -- I point out a couple of items, seniors did really respond strongly to RSV vaccinations and scheduled physician visits. Sometimes those physician visits, what we noted were driving other care activity around that. So in some cases, seniors that hadn't perhaps been to a physician in a little while, and so they visited their PCP, got an RSV vaccine, and then in the meantime, their PCPs were able to close some additional care gaps as they were there, which is a great thing because some of these seniors hadn't been in for a while. So important activity to occur there in the fourth quarter. So that was one of the elements that we saw there. As it relates to kind of what we were seeing with elevated care costs for COVID, what we saw in the fourth quarter in particular in December. Overall, we've been noticing is that COVID admits for inpatient stays are running a higher cost per case than we traditionally saw. That actually kind of makes some sense. There are more intense cases typically that are going into inpatient stay. I will say we did notice in December that the total level of COVID admits were probably 50% to 60% above the October-November average that we had seen. So that was kind of the highest part of the year in terms of COVID inpatient admits. If I take those elements and sum together, that then more than accounts for the 10 basis points differential in our full-year view, Justin. As that pertains to your second question, as we look out into the next year and what we see in terms of patterns, I would call it patterns commensurate, kind of, with what we saw this year in terms of just the movement, with this kind of 84% view that we view for the full-year. As I step back and reflect and just kind of thinking about where -- broadly where the analyst consensus is, you picked particularly the 1Q. It's kind of in the right -- it looks like an appropriate zone in terms of staked out there for what one would expect. So thank you, Justin.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. John, thank you. And Justin, thanks for the question. Appreciate that. Next question, please operator.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Can you describe the competitive environment for Medicare Advantage? And I'm specifically thinking about how you've adjusted benefits in 2024 as part of a three-year process? I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you're trying to adjust for the majority of the risk model changes in one fell swoop. And I'm curious how you think that plays out and positions you not just for \u201824, but then for \u201825 and \u201826 as well?\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Josh, thank you so much. Before I ask Tim Noel to give you more detail on your question, I mean, listen, I think the way we've looked at the shift in the rate notice is, it is a three-year set of adjustments, and that's why we've been very thoughtful about how we've planned, not just, frankly benefit design, but how we continue to accelerate our management of OpEx through the organization, how we continue to focus on eliminating unnecessary care and waste within the system through our various medical management capabilities. So it's really a three-pronged set of agendas, which we're going to be focused on over the next three years. And we've been very thoughtful about making sure that we are setting those tables in a way which we can be sustainable on through this cycle, so that we're not taking sharp left turns or right turns halfway through the period. With that kind of overall perspective, maybe I ask Tim to give you a little bit more deep dive on the competitive environment and how he is very specifically planning for this.\nTim Noel: Yes. Thanks, Josh, for the question. So I agree with Andrew's comments and a couple of things to start with is, there's been a number of changes to the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs, over the last 18-months to two years that are really phasing in over multiple years. And as we plan for 2024, we once again took a very rational view to the environment and also a long-term view with always our overarching goal being benefit stability for our members. As we stepped into -- as we step into benefit planning in future years, we really feel like we have got a very thoughtful way to respond to all of those changes that will be encountered by the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs into 2025 and beyond. And certainly as we look forward, we don't believe that we have any material pricing catch up to do in future periods and feel like we've got a very thoughtful response to the changes that will be encountered by the program into 2025 and 2026. So we think the forward view of our competitive outlook is quite solid and quite strong as we think about growth over the long-term.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you very much. Next question, please operator.\nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just, I apologize, it's sort of granular, but we're getting asked a lot of questions about it. The two metrics, days claims payable down a couple of days year-to-year sequentially, some from third quarter. And then the prior period development being down $100 million, maybe accounts for some of the variance on MLR, I'm guessing. I don't know if that's what you were guiding for when you updated -- last updated your outlook, but any comment on that as well?\nAndrew Witty: Let me ask John to address that A.J., thank you.\nJohn Rex: Yes. Good morning, A.J. So first on the days claims payable, so 2.8 day sequential decline, two days year-over-year. So primarily the single largest factor would be exactly what you pointed to, the change in prior period development. So that has a significant impact, if you look about the year ago where we were in prior period development and where we were even the 3Q. So the significant impact on that part, that'd be the main factor. In terms of other contributing factors that we saw, we did see in the fourth quarter some modest acceleration in provider claim submission timing. So just speed up in terms of those submissions, how quickly we're receiving them from data service in terms of receipt. We also noted that as it related to the fourth quarter some higher claims intensity in the first part of the quarter, particularly October. So that's a factor that impacts the denominator, Medex per day in the day's claims payable metric. And that was a piece that was in that also. As it relates to the $100 million of unfavorable medical development in the quarter, put that mostly, the items that we were talking about in my response to Justin's question. So the respiratory-related activity that we saw in there, the modestly higher cost per case for inpatient, COVID admits, really kind of those were the main factors that we had in there in terms of contributing to the unfavorable development. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: It's a good question, A.J. And as John just said, even back in the sort of second-half of Q3, we saw -- we've seen subsequently that this RSV pickup and this phenomena of more services being delivered around the vaccination was already starting as we were rolling out through Q3, which is really what explains that. So in many ways, this kind of Q3 issue, kind of, Q3 issue of negative development and then this slight pressure at the end of the year, it's kind of the same story, and which is why we don't feel it has any real direct relevance in terms of thinking through 2024. Thanks for the question, though. I appreciate that. Next question, please operator.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. I want to go to Optum Health and just maybe talk about the medical cost trend there. John, just going specifically to the comments that you made, did you see something similar in Optum Health or we see anything different there? And then also, I just want to understand the claim lag there. We've heard from some others that there can be a pretty big claim lag when we think about the providers versus the payers?\nAndrew Witty: So let me ask John to start and then maybe ask Heather to make a couple of comments on the claim dynamic. Go ahead, John.\nJohn Rex: Yes, Lisa. So definitely kind of seeing seniors obtaining RSV vaccinations and some of the respiratory activity that was going on in the quarter. So broadly similar features. For Optum Health, one of the comments that we've made throughout the year, though, also has to do with the progression here of taking on a large block of new membership. So we took on about 900,000 new members as we started the year. And one of the comments we've made throughout the year is engaging with these members, because the most important thing we need to do is have the clinical engagement with these members in terms of start improving their health outcomes, getting them and to see physicians, having our clinicians interacting -- having -- interacting with them. And it's a comment we've made throughout the years, we've seen the Optum Health margin progression, so one of the great things. We probably started the year at kind of roughly at 20% engagement level with that 900,000-member block. We exit the year having engaged with about 80% of these members. Super important factor as we think about Optum Health, as we think about 2024 and how -- and that progression. And that's been a big focus of the team at Optum Health all year long of getting that engagement in. So we can have impact on their health. But far and away, especially given what this population is like, they typically have complex needs, that's important. Another really important market as it relates to the new membership patients that we're bringing into Optum Health for 2024 again. So I talked about that 20% engagement level we started '23 with. For 2024, we're going to start at a 50% engagement level with that new membership. So we're making advances in that and that's exactly what you should expect from the team. Their efforts have been really strong.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks, John. Maybe, Heather, you could comment on Lisa's question around claims, and then I'd like to ask Amar also to follow up on your perspective on engagement and what's driving that. Please go ahead, Heather.\nHeather Cianfrocco: Sure. So the only thing -- the thing I would add to, so I appreciate, on top of John's point, when you think about engaging the patient early, then it's really in the clinician's hands. And I think about the way we think about our clinicians is that importance to your point about visibility than to kind of action. And the way we think about our clinicians is, once we get that engagement, and as John said, early engagement is so important, then our clinicians having the tools, and I think we've been -- what's really essential for us is those 130,000 clinicians having visibility early, what to do next. And the first thing is that they've got the technology, they've got solutions around them, they've got referral management practices that they can engage with high-quality specialists when they need to for outpatient procedures. And then that they've got the supports in behavioral health and the home and community-based -- home and community services that we've been investing heavily in over the last year. And then the last thing I would point to is the contract protections that we've been focused on with our payers, to be sure that the structures are in place so that our clinicians can practice in a responsible way. They have got visibility into the dynamics that are happening with the patients, and then they've got the support in place with the payers.\nAndrew Witty: Amar?\nAmar Desai: Yes, thanks for that question. Look, I think I'd reiterate the point around our highest risk complex members, where we're engaging at a 2 times higher rate than the same time last year. And within engagement and our clinical programs, I'd focus around referral management and high-value evidence-based medicine programs, including our optimal care program, where a majority of our clinicians are engaged with these evidence-based programs are able to get patients the care that they need. And importantly, get the support with the provision of wraparound services, including specifically home-based services, so that the highest risk groups have their care connected from the primary care setting into the home. Thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: Amar, thanks. And John, maybe just to tie up the whole question.\nJohn Rex: Yes, and Lisa, tying up just on the last part of your question here regarding visibility into care activity claims like, no -- we don't -- that's not a factor. Just given the model of Amar's business and how those groups run, we -- frankly, it's one of the areas where we get probably early sensing mechanisms in terms of the care activity that's going on, is one of the early sensing mechanisms from much earlier in the year when we were able to talk about what we were seeing in these senior populations and the care activity within these orthopedic and other procedures. So that's not a factor. In fact, if anything, it's probably a strength of the organization.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Thanks, John. And Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And we obviously just spent a couple of minutes there talking about engagement, and I hope that gave you a strong sense of some of the progress we've made over the last 12 months in this area. I would say we're night and day in a different position today than we were a year ago in terms of our ability to be engaged with these complex patients making sure our physicians are ready to go, that's a really important aspect of what's building our confidence for 2024. And make no apology for just spending a couple more minutes, making sure you hear some of the great work that's gone on over the last year to ensure that we've got these very high levels of engagement and real substance behind that engagement. So that these patients will be supported and managed really positively going through '24. That's what then underpins and unlocks the whole opportunity of value based care for Optum Health. Lisa, thank you for your question. And I'll move on to the next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little about what you're seeing for cost performance in the group commercial or exchange or Medicaid businesses? As you step back, is this still appropriate to attribute all the pressure really, you've seen in 2023 to seniors or should we be mindful of anything else there? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Stephen, thanks so much. Maybe I ask Brian just to give you a kind of overarching summary of what UHC has seen in its different books of business, Brian?\nBrian Thompson: Yes, I appreciate that. Thanks, Stephen, for the question. And I think I'll just lead with, I feel really good not only about how we finished the year in UnitedHealth Care 2023, growth at the top end of our ranges, performance run in positions across the board, but also as we step into the businesses for 2024, feel very good about the key assumptions that underpin our plan and very optimistic. And you mentioned a couple of areas. You're right, as we've discussed some of these elements with respect to cost trend, they are centered in our senior community. And I think the message around those other businesses, nothing to see here and really aligned with our expectations, some good stability and durability in the underlying elements, both utilization and unit cost of our trend outlook and obviously feel very confident in how we're showing up competitively when you look at our growth outlook. So very optimistic about UnitedHealthcare, durability in those other lines that you're suggesting and a lot to look forward to here in the year.\nAndrew Witty: Right. Thanks, Brian. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Great, thanks. Can you talk a little bit about Optum Rx, the drivers of growth in the quarter, in particular topline? And then if you could comment a little on revenue per Rx? And do you have any programs that either in the fourth quarter or in '24 that you've been rolling out that are capturing some of the increased demand on topics like GLP-1s that might be contributors to some of the strong performance? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Lance, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask Patrick to start the response on Optum Rx. First off, I just want to note a super strong selling year for us in Optum Rx, probably our best ever. Extraordinary and across a wide range of categories, plans, public service states, as well as obviously commercial. And really, really pleased with the differentiated product offering, really built on transparency, choice, and of course cost. And so we feel we've built a strong momentum in \u201823, rolling into \u201824. Patrick, you may want to go a little deeper, maybe share a little detail on weight engaged, specifically around the question that Lance raised around GLPs?\nPatrick Conway: Yes, thanks, Lance, for the question. So, as Andrew said, really diverse growth, both new business and high retention rates. So one of our best-selling years ever. I'd also call out the pharmacy services expansion, the organic growth there across the diverse set of pharmacy services, cost management. And then last, as you mentioned, new products and services, just to call out one weight engaged. So comprehensive management, medication, provider support, client support, lifestyle modification, digital, so a comprehensive solution across Optum, not just Optum Rx, partnering with Optum Health and Optum Insights. Already live with clients and robust interest in the marketplace, because patients, members, employers want comprehensive solutions that demonstrate better health outcomes at lower total cost of care.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Patrick. And Lance, thanks for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I guess, I'm still just struggling with the concept of 2023 coming in worse, but this having no impact on the 2024 outlook. I mean, are you saying that the incremental pressure is really just like flu RSV and therefore unlikely to replicate at these levels next year, because the negative development speaks to costs earlier in the year also coming in worse, which implies that the baseline is -- the core baseline is also higher. So can you just help me reconcile, you know, why this isn't raising the base for next year and I guess within that you may feel confident with the guidance range for MLR, but is there reason to be at the higher end of the range to start the year or is the midpoint still where you're orienting? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: So I'll ask John to go a little deeper. Obviously, as you know, Kevin, we've set an MLR target next year, which is in fact higher than the actual closeout for this year in any case, which takes into consideration some of that kind of elevation, which we've seen throughout the year. So I'm going to call it the core elevation associated with the outpatient senior behaviors that we've been talking about now for several quarters. And then as we've talked a little bit already, this end of Q4 type of a small seasonality variation, we don't think is really durable or relevant to the rest of the year. But John, maybe go a little deeper on that.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Good morning, Kevin. So yes, so the elements that contributed to the unfavorable development being around respiratory activity that was going on as the seniors came in to get vaccines, another care was being delivered and such. And that higher inpatient cost per case for the COVID admits that we're seeing. So those would largely be the prime contributors of the elements that we are seeing here in terms of that unfavourability. So you're absolutely correct in your assumption. That doesn't impact our run-in assumption as we think about our outlook for 2024, and which -- so keeps us right squarely in where we thought we'd be as we were at our investor conference, is taking out the 84% plus/minus 50 basis points. Really as we look across the scope of our businesses and we think reflect on how we performed in \u201920 and in \u201823, the scope of it being very much with what we saw back in mid-year of 2023, that this is -- that the running factors are about outpatient care activity among senior populations, which we incorporated into our bids. The elements that you're appropriately referring to in 4Q, again, not factors impacting our view at all in terms of how we staked out \u201824 and how we expect to perform in \u201824. Really good question.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. And I'd also just add, I mean, as you would fully expect, Kevin, we're reviewing the leading indicators of care activity, frankly, daily, weekly, monthly and have been all year. And we've also been investing significantly in increasing numbers of early warning signals, if I can put it that way, to strengthen our radar capability to see this. And I can tell you, we're really not seeing any deviation from what we've been telling you all year in terms of the core activities across the system. The seasonal bumps at the end of the year, obviously, a little different. But in terms of outpatient utilization, all of those lines of activity that we've been discussing at different times with you, the patterns there, very supportive of how we've stepped out for '24. Thanks for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. I was hoping to just hop back over to Optum Health for a second. And just as it relates, one, to the margin targets that you gave us at Investor Day for the 7.7% to 8%, just want to see if those are still the appropriate targets for 2024? And then maybe if we could walk through the sort of pacing exercise with OH margins, given the expected step-up from the exit rate in the fourth quarter, how you're thinking about those OH margins for 1Q, and then sort of pacing over the course of the year? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Scott, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Dr. Desai to make a couple of comments, and then I'm going to talk about where we've staked out for Optum Health next year. A ton of work done during 2023 to strengthen the business. You saw that beginning to show through as we roll through the second-half. We continue to expect that to be a very strong driver of improvement as we go into 2024. A lot of that work we talked about already today around engagement is a key element of our confidence in being able to build our profile of that business. And Amar, maybe you could go a little deeper, and then John can close out with discussing on the progression.\nAmar Desai: Thanks for the question, Scott. We're confident in our 7.7% to 8.0% target for 2024. We've discussed engagement in detail. The second important piece is our medical management programs, which we've scaled effectively. I talked a little bit about OptumCare and evidence-based guidelines. What I would reiterate is the work we're doing across our network with payment integrity. Again, with the idea of being able to provide the right support services across our network. The last piece I would also hit on is our initiatives around OpEx, which have been progressing well and are on track, driving operating efficiencies and G&A discipline across the organization. And it really with focus on more consistency in our systems and unification of our operating platform. So we feel very good about the 7.7% to 8.0% as we go into '24. A - Andrew Witty Great. Thanks so much, Amar. John?\nJohn Rex: Yes, Scott. Good morning. So as Amar said, feel very good about where we established our margin objectives for 2024. The element super important here is, again, how these new patient cohorts progress as they come into our business, and we're able to engage with them clinically and improve their health outcomes, make sure we're able to close care gaps. And the progress that Amar and teams accomplished during 2023 in terms of getting those engagement levels will assist a lot in terms of the health of the people that we're serving here, and then particularly, this cohort from 2023 to 900,000 new patients that we're able to serve and how that business performs over the course of the year. So that's a big step into it. Another big step into it is this group of 750,000 new patients that came on to the business. The fact that we were able to. Yet engagement level is significantly higher than we were at last year, where the new cohort will help also. So it gives us a lot of confidence in where we're stepping out in terms of serving these people throughout the course of the coming year. In terms of your comment, you'd expect them typical than seasonality factors to weigh in how the quarters performed. So much more think about that as seasonality factors, so they're probably having impact here. So typical in terms of seasonal factors that we would have experienced this year, starting with a stronger base that sets us up well to reach our targets.\nAndrew Witty: Right. Thanks, John. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So a question on Optum Rx. Over the past year, there's been some evolving dynamics around -- news flow around the regulatory changes for PBMs unbundling. There were some news flow there as well as pharmacy reimbursement model changes, such as cost plus type of approach? I guess how are you thinking about potential implications of some of these dynamics, if any at all? And do these dynamics have a material impact on Optum Rx? Or how are you thinking about those profit drivers remaining intact kind of going forward for the PBM? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Erin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather to give you some comments there. As you know, Heather's been very, very involved with the various legislative processes, and it'd good to get her perspective on that.\nHeather Cianfrocco: Sure. Thanks. So maybe just quickly, I'll say, completely respectful of the evolving dynamic and just make the headline that our business is incredibly dynamic. I'd be remiss if I don't say, again, at this juncture, that we continue to engage because it's incredibly important to note that in a space where affordable drugs -- affordable prescription drugs to consumers is on everybody's mind, including ours, and that's what the PBM is built to do. We are really pressing to make sure that policymakers understand that it's important to preserve choice for clients. It's important to make sure that we preserve value-based structures, because we know that value base is the way to ensure that we deliver lower price -- lower-cost drugs. And we can't break that alignment of incentives where PBMs work with payers to reduce costs. And that it is incredibly important that discounts remain, because there's no indication that rebates drive list prices up. The PBMs work as a counterweight against high drug cost. That being said, you've seen in our model held diverse the business is. And across Optum Rx, across the PBM, across the pharmacy services, it's a multitude of businesses. And we really listen to our clients. We exist on behalf of our clients, and we compete in a highly competitive market. And we win because our model translates. It translates in transparency, it translates in innovation and it translates in partnership to our clients. So we'll follow the client will be incredibly respectful of the legislation, but I feel really good that we act quickly, we act responsibly, and we work towards value. And you see that in the results. You see that in the growth. But most importantly, you see that in the client validation of the model. So I feel good about where we're positioned. I feel good about the experience in 2023 as a guide to that, but really confident in the growth in \u201824.\nAndrew Witty: Heather, thanks so much. And Erin, thanks very much for the question. I'm sure there'll continue to be debate around this area. High drug cost, of course, is a big issue for everybody. First and foremost, we need to see list prices come down. That's the most important thing that can make a big difference here. I would say that as you look at all the different ideas, which float up from time-to-time around reform in this area, there really isn't anything that we don't offer in some form or fashion to our clients and our customers. And the reality is we think that's the right position. We think we should be offering a portfolio of different tools, different product designs, which allows people to choose what's right for them. Because what a state wants, what a union wants, what a corporation wants differs. And it's super important that their views are taken into account here. We believe we do that well in the diversity of our product offering, and that's what's underpinning our record growth and it underpins our confidence for \u201824. Appreciate that, Erin. Next question?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the Medicare AEP enrollment that you talked about, the 100,000 lives that you added. I guess were there any differences in terms of what consumers responded to this year or differences in the retention rate relative to what you're expecting? And just can you help us think about the drivers of membership growth over the year as you needed to get to the guidance that you gave for the full-year?\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Tim Noel to give you that.\nTim Noel: Yes. Thanks for the question, Nathan. So once again, the Medicare environment, selling environment is highly competitive. And we probably saw one of the more aggressive years of pricing that we've ever seen in the 2024 session. We guided at investor conference to growth of 450,000 to 550,000 lives, which is a little bit more modest than we have grown in past years, but it's reflective of our response to the new risk model changes, what we saw in outpatient utilization patterns early in '23 and reflecting that into 2024 pricing. And as we close out AEP, I would say that we were a little bit light against what we were thinking, kind of, end of November. Most of that actually is in the group business, some of the very aggressive benefits, a little bit more switching, drove some of our term rates a bit higher in AEP than we were initially thinking. But we still feel like we're going to have a much heavier weighting of our growth outside of the annual enrollment period from February to December. And this is really just a continuation of a trend that we have seen play out over the last five years really. And in fact, last year, we drove 430,000 lives of growth or about 60% of our total growth in the period from February to December. This is a portion of the selling season that we really do well in given our large dual footprint and also the fact that some of the selling and AEP tends to be focused on some of those headline benefits that have been really aggressively positioned. And throughout the remainder of the year, there tends to be some switching back as folks think more deeply about things like network, the fulfillment of supplemental benefits, overall service and delivery of product. So I guess the headline is it is a very aggressive marketplace this year. We feel like we're positioned really well for \u201825 and \u201826 on how we priced, and very pleased with what we've done so far and excited about our opportunity, once again, to have a really great growth in the selling period from February to December of \u201824.\nAndrew Witty: Right, Tim. Thanks so much. Last question, please operator.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Most of my questions has been asked. I'll throw this one out, too. We've been seeing more articles about health system just dropping their MA contracts, some of those articles sites, United I know -- historically, most of these types of contracts that, you know, conflicts that make the press historically ultimately come to terms, so I'm just wondering, is this just a media threat? Or do you think there's something more measurable happening here with your health system partners?\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Gary, thanks so much. Let me ask Brian to respond to that.\nBrian Thompson: Hey Gary, thanks for the question. I would say, overall, the disruptions that we see in the market this year are, I would say, at/or even lower than historical comparisons on average, leaving 2023. I will say though that any disruption for our consumers is too much. They come to rely on an in-network provider relationship. They have a coverage expectation from their health plan. So we obviously want to avoid that type of network disruption. And we, however, do need to balance that ambition with affordability. Now as we speak specifically to the Medicare Advantage space, we did have some deals that came down to the wire. And I do think that had some impact on AEP. And again, going to Tim's commentary around our confidence February forward, where we have those deals intact, I think you'll see that response in our growth as well. But again, on average, really not much change overall compared to historical periods on disruption.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. No, it's well said, Brian. And I think, obviously, Gary, we -- what you seen on behalf of patients, on behalf of government to make sure that we're getting the very best cost associated for the care delivered. And it's important that, that negotiation is robust. And the good news is that the overwhelming majority get resolved. We really don't like to see disruption happen. Unfortunately, occasionally, it does. But rest assured, we're making good progress in this area. As Brian said, no real kind of difference in outcome to what we've seen in previous years. With all of that, let me say thank you for all of your questions. Very much appreciated. And as you've heard, we're confident in our mission, focused on our growth pillars, delivering innovation that matters and disciplined in our operations and in our approach to the market. And we look forward to delivering on our commitments in 2024 to our customers, patients and shareholders. Very much appreciate your attention this morning. Thank you, and look forward to talking with you between calls. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. Our growth is rooted in innovation and our intense desire always to do better. We're investing heavily in ways to accomplish that, increasing digital engagement and using AI to be more efficient, and then measuring our performance through net promoter scores to be sure we're hitting the mark. The impact of our digital engagement efforts was evident in our one-one performance metrics. As Andrew noted, we brought on one of our biggest cohorts of new people served by our commercial offerings, and our technology played an important role in making the process work well. Since last month, the UHC mobile app consistently ranked number one or number two in the Apple App Store Medical Category and on Google Play. Through the first week of the year, mobile app installs were up over more than 100% year-over-year, and our chat volume was more than twice our historical average. At Optum Rx, digital investments enabled us to bring on a record number of new clients, who brought with them more than 3 million new consumers, on-boarded with improved customer service scores and at an overall cost, 8% lower than last year, more consumer served, higher satisfaction, and lower costs. Our investments in AI and other advanced technology play an important role in improving customer service and in productivity throughout the enterprise. For example, we are removing repetitive tasks from our workflows by using AI to help with tasks such as responses to consumer inquiries, updating provider directories, and summarizing interactions with customers and patients. This frees up our service staff and clinicians to focus on solving more complicated tasks for the people we serve. And recently we launched a new capability, where we use real-time admissions and discharge data to engage high-risk MA members immediately after an emergency department visit. Connecting them to follow-up care to ensure higher-quality post-admit outcomes and avoid readmissions. This rapid response, driven by timely clinical data has improved member engagement rates by over 300% and has an NPS of 83. NPS remains a vital way to measure how we're performing for our customers and consumers and how our digital initiatives and other efforts are impacting those measures, and leading to improved retention. Couple of examples, through digital optimization, we're providing consumers with on-demand access to care, highly personalized benefits information, real-time support, and integrated pharmacy capabilities. This is translating into significant NPS improvements in many of our businesses. And we removed friction from the system through expanded access to 24/7 virtual visits and UnitedHealthcare's efforts to eliminate nearly 20% of prior authorizations. Throughout \u201824, you should expect to see an even greater investment in our digital capabilities, as we continue to identify opportunities to, leverage technology to reduce administrative costs, improve productivity, and further enhance the consumer experience at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. And now, I'll turn it over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group's, Chief Financial Officer. John?"

So the only thing -- the thing I would add to, so I appreciate, on top of John's point, when you think about engaging the patient early, then it's really in the clinician's hands. And I think about the way we think about our clinicians is that importance to your point about visibility than to kind of action. And the way we think about our clinicians is, once we get that engagement, and as John said, early engagement is so important, then our clinicians having the tools, and I think we've been -- what's really essential for us is those 130,000 clinicians having visibility early, what to do next. And the first thing is that they've got the technology, they've got solutions around them, they've got referral management practices that they can engage with high-quality specialists when they need to for outpatient procedures. And then that they've got the supports in behavioral health and the home and community-based -- home and community services that we've been investing heavily in over the last year. And then the last thing I would point to is the contract protections that we've been focused on with our payers, to be sure that the structures are in place so that our clinicians can practice in a responsible way. They have got visibility into the dynamics that are happening with the patients, and then they've got the support in place with the payers. Sure. Thanks.

And within engagement and our clinical programs, I'd focus around referral management and high-value evidence-based medicine programs, including our optimal care program, where a majority of our clinicians are engaged with these evidence-based programs are able to get patients the care that they need. And importantly, get the support with the provision of wraparound services, including specifically home-based services, so that the highest risk groups have their care connected from the primary care setting into the home. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question, Scott. We're confident in our 7.7% to 8.0% target for 2024. We've discussed engagement in detail. The second important piece is our medical management programs, which we've scaled effectively. I talked a little bit about OptumCare and evidence-based guidelines.

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As we conclude 2023 and embark on a new year, I'd like to express my gratitude to our more than 400,000 talented colleagues who really were UnitedHealth Group. It's directly due to their tireless efforts over the past year that we expanded our opportunities to serve more people, more comprehensively. As I reflect on our 2023 performance, certainly, the shift in care activity among seniors was an important element for us to manage effectively, and the reduced Medicare Advantage funding outlook was a significant influence on how we prepared for 2024 and all the way through to 2026. Despite the shifting care patterns and the commensurate pressure felt during \u201823, we've been able to both deliver on our growth commitments and invest and prepare for reduced MA funding cycle over the next three years. Even considering these factors, 2023 marked the year of balanced, sustainable growth for UnitedHealth Group. Importantly, we also strengthened the foundations, from which we will continue to grow in 2024 and beyond. To illustrate briefly during 2023, Optum Health approached growth of 900,000 more patients under value-based care. UnitedHealthcare added over 1.7 million new consumers in its Medicare and commercial offerings. Optum Rx managed an additional 100 million prescriptions for people. Optum Financial handled more than $500 billion in consumer payer and care provider payments. And Optum Insights facilitated more than 23 billion electronic transactions. The increasingly impactful ways we can engage with patients, consumers, care providers, and customers resulted in revenue growth of over $47 billion and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 13% in 2023. Looking to \u201824, \u201825 and beyond, we will continue to drive quality, simplicity, affordability, and accessibility to help improve healthcare system-wide, and we remain confident in and committed to our long-term 13% to 16% adjusted earnings per share growth rate. Having held our Investor Conference just six weeks ago, I'll take only a few minutes this morning to recap what you should expect from us this year, starting with our work in value-based care. Value-based care for us is a proven way of overcoming many of the widely recognized shortcomings of a fee-for-service-based health system such as fragmented consumer experiences and incentives, that can emphasize volume over quality. Our value-based offerings empower physicians to provide more connected, coordinated and comprehensive care, align incentives among consumers, care providers, and health plans, deliver better health outcomes, and improve costs. At the end of 2023, Optum Health served more than 4 million patients in fully accountable value-based arrangements in partnership with many dozens of health plans. By the end of this year, Optum Health will grow to serve at least another 750,000 patients, under such arrangements, for a total of more than twice the number of people we served just two years ago. Yet, even with the strong growth and significant investments we've made, our market presence is still quite modest and the opportunity expansive. 4 million patients served, just a small fraction of the many more people whose health ultimately will benefit from these models of care. And the total Optum Health revenue base, which today represents only 2% of the $5 trillion U.S. Healthcare System spend. We have a considerable distance to go, to achieve the broad positive system-wide impact for people's health we believe we can help drive. Turning to our consumer focus, we're working hard to help consumers more easily find experience and pay for healthcare, and that includes using their health benefits. One example of our progress can be seen in the results of UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits business. Most recently completed selling season was among our strongest in recent years. The majority of this growth will come from our relationships with large employers among the most sophisticated buyers of health benefits. Our customers tell us where we are focused on what their employees value most. Lower cost, simpler experiences, and adaptable benefits that meet their unique needs and circumstances. And the consumer NPS for these new innovative products is some 20 plus points higher than traditional health plans. We have more to do. Our goal is to become the trusted source for Healthcare information and advice, a go-to-market place for health services payments and benefits, all through a few simple taps on a consumer's phone. One of our larger consumer offerings is Medicare Advantage, which I'd like to touch on briefly. We're proud of our long track record of growth and delivering for the people who choose our offerings. During the recently completed annual enrollment period, we added about 100,000 more consumers and we remain committed to our full-year goal of 450,000 to 550,000. We believe our assumptions of ongoing care activity and approach to supplemental benefit management are entirely appropriate for the environment we are planning for and feel positive about our positioning for growth entering this three-year period. One additional item as we close out the year. To achieve our enterprise-wide long-term goals, we must consistently ensure best use of our resources, both time and capital to enable us to serve people more effectively and deliver value for our shareholders. As you likely saw, we recently agreed to the sale of our Brazil operations, where our dedicated colleagues serve people with care and compassion. We highly value the relationships we have developed over more than a decade in Brazil. After carefully evaluating our best course, we ultimately determined a sale was the right step for the people we serve and for us to best focus our energies on the many compelling growth opportunities that we consistently discuss with you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dirk McMahon, UnitedHealth Group's President and Chief Operating Officer. Dirk? Thanks, John, and thank you, Dirk. Heading into 2024, I hope you all sense our confidence. We have talented people who are committed to our efforts, to help build a simpler and more consumer-friendly health system for the people we serve. And we are well-positioned to continue to deliver on the well-established commitments we've made. Operator, let's open it up for questions. Hey Justin, thanks so much for the question. Let me just make a couple of comments, and I'm going to ask John Rex to give you a little bit more detail on the area you just talked about. So, you know, I think overall, as we look at '23, overall, it came in very much in the sort of zone we expected toward the top end of that zone, but very much within the zone of what we were expecting for the full-year and we signaled back in the middle of the year. And the bulk of that story is driven by the outpatient shift in behavior around seniors that we talked about back in June. You're right, though, post the investor conference, what we certainly saw was a click up in some seasonal activity, each of which individually are kind of pretty small. But added together just made a bit of a difference in that last run out of the quarter, around things like RSV vaccination, which has brought with it -- dragged with it, if you will, some extra utilization of services from seniors who've come in for their vaccine. Listen, to be clear, all of that is good news for healthcare, right? So these are seniors, many of whom had not been to the office for a long time. They've come back in and now got vaccinated. The physicians have picked up other things while they've been there. So a little bit of that going on combined with a little bit of heightened COVID activity just as we rolled out of the year. None of which we really think is durably impacting our outlook for \u201824. So we feel very solid around our \u201824 guidance point of 84, plus or minus 50 bps. Maybe, I ask John just to give you a little bit more click down kind of insight into all about them. Go ahead, John. Yes. John, thank you. And Justin, thanks for the question. Appreciate that. Next question, please operator. Hey, Josh, thank you so much. Before I ask Tim Noel to give you more detail on your question, I mean, listen, I think the way we've looked at the shift in the rate notice is, it is a three-year set of adjustments, and that's why we've been very thoughtful about how we've planned, not just, frankly benefit design, but how we continue to accelerate our management of OpEx through the organization, how we continue to focus on eliminating unnecessary care and waste within the system through our various medical management capabilities. So it's really a three-pronged set of agendas, which we're going to be focused on over the next three years. And we've been very thoughtful about making sure that we are setting those tables in a way which we can be sustainable on through this cycle, so that we're not taking sharp left turns or right turns halfway through the period. With that kind of overall perspective, maybe I ask Tim to give you a little bit more deep dive on the competitive environment and how he is very specifically planning for this. Thank you very much. Next question, please operator. Let me ask John to address that A.J., thank you. It's a good question, A.J. And as John just said, even back in the sort of second-half of Q3, we saw -- we've seen subsequently that this RSV pickup and this phenomena of more services being delivered around the vaccination was already starting as we were rolling out through Q3, which is really what explains that. So in many ways, this kind of Q3 issue, kind of, Q3 issue of negative development and then this slight pressure at the end of the year, it's kind of the same story, and which is why we don't feel it has any real direct relevance in terms of thinking through 2024. Thanks for the question, though. I appreciate that. Next question, please operator. So let me ask John to start and then maybe ask Heather to make a couple of comments on the claim dynamic. Go ahead, John. Great. Thanks, John. Maybe, Heather, you could comment on Lisa's question around claims, and then I'd like to ask Amar also to follow up on your perspective on engagement and what's driving that. Please go ahead, Heather. Amar? Amar, thanks. And John, maybe just to tie up the whole question. Yes. Thanks, John. And Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And we obviously just spent a couple of minutes there talking about engagement, and I hope that gave you a strong sense of some of the progress we've made over the last 12 months in this area. I would say we're night and day in a different position today than we were a year ago in terms of our ability to be engaged with these complex patients making sure our physicians are ready to go, that's a really important aspect of what's building our confidence for 2024. And make no apology for just spending a couple more minutes, making sure you hear some of the great work that's gone on over the last year to ensure that we've got these very high levels of engagement and real substance behind that engagement. So that these patients will be supported and managed really positively going through '24. That's what then underpins and unlocks the whole opportunity of value based care for Optum Health. Lisa, thank you for your question. And I'll move on to the next question. Stephen, thanks so much. Maybe I ask Brian just to give you a kind of overarching summary of what UHC has seen in its different books of business, Brian? Right. Thanks, Brian. Next question, please. Hey, Lance, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask Patrick to start the response on Optum Rx. First off, I just want to note a super strong selling year for us in Optum Rx, probably our best ever. Extraordinary and across a wide range of categories, plans, public service states, as well as obviously commercial. And really, really pleased with the differentiated product offering, really built on transparency, choice, and of course cost. And so we feel we've built a strong momentum in \u201823, rolling into \u201824. Patrick, you may want to go a little deeper, maybe share a little detail on weight engaged, specifically around the question that Lance raised around GLPs? Thanks so much, Patrick. And Lance, thanks for the question. Next question, please. So I'll ask John to go a little deeper. Obviously, as you know, Kevin, we've set an MLR target next year, which is in fact higher than the actual closeout for this year in any case, which takes into consideration some of that kind of elevation, which we've seen throughout the year. So I'm going to call it the core elevation associated with the outpatient senior behaviors that we've been talking about now for several quarters. And then as we've talked a little bit already, this end of Q4 type of a small seasonality variation, we don't think is really durable or relevant to the rest of the year. But John, maybe go a little deeper on that. Yes. And I'd also just add, I mean, as you would fully expect, Kevin, we're reviewing the leading indicators of care activity, frankly, daily, weekly, monthly and have been all year. And we've also been investing significantly in increasing numbers of early warning signals, if I can put it that way, to strengthen our radar capability to see this. And I can tell you, we're really not seeing any deviation from what we've been telling you all year in terms of the core activities across the system. The seasonal bumps at the end of the year, obviously, a little different. But in terms of outpatient utilization, all of those lines of activity that we've been discussing at different times with you, the patterns there, very supportive of how we've stepped out for '24. Thanks for the question. Next question, please. Scott, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Dr. Desai to make a couple of comments, and then I'm going to talk about where we've staked out for Optum Health next year. A ton of work done during 2023 to strengthen the business. You saw that beginning to show through as we roll through the second-half. We continue to expect that to be a very strong driver of improvement as we go into 2024. A lot of that work we talked about already today around engagement is a key element of our confidence in being able to build our profile of that business. And Amar, maybe you could go a little deeper, and then John can close out with discussing on the progression. Right. Thanks, John. Next question? Erin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather to give you some comments there. As you know, Heather's been very, very involved with the various legislative processes, and it'd good to get her perspective on that. Heather, thanks so much. And Erin, thanks very much for the question. I'm sure there'll continue to be debate around this area. High drug cost, of course, is a big issue for everybody. First and foremost, we need to see list prices come down. That's the most important thing that can make a big difference here. I would say that as you look at all the different ideas, which float up from time-to-time around reform in this area, there really isn't anything that we don't offer in some form or fashion to our clients and our customers. And the reality is we think that's the right position. We think we should be offering a portfolio of different tools, different product designs, which allows people to choose what's right for them. Because what a state wants, what a union wants, what a corporation wants differs. And it's super important that their views are taken into account here. We believe we do that well in the diversity of our product offering, and that's what's underpinning our record growth and it underpins our confidence for \u201824. Appreciate that, Erin. Next question? Yes, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Tim Noel to give you that. Right, Tim. Thanks so much. Last question, please operator. Hey, Gary, thanks so much. Let me ask Brian to respond to that. Yes. No, it's well said, Brian. And I think, obviously, Gary, we -- what you seen on behalf of patients, on behalf of government to make sure that we're getting the very best cost associated for the care delivered. And it's important that, that negotiation is robust. And the good news is that the overwhelming majority get resolved. We really don't like to see disruption happen. Unfortunately, occasionally, it does. But rest assured, we're making good progress in this area. As Brian said, no real kind of difference in outcome to what we've seen in previous years. With all of that, let me say thank you for all of your questions. Very much appreciated. And as you've heard, we're confident in our mission, focused on our growth pillars, delivering innovation that matters and disciplined in our operations and in our approach to the market. And we look forward to delivering on our commitments in 2024 to our customers, patients and shareholders. Very much appreciate your attention this morning. Thank you, and look forward to talking with you between calls. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Yes, thanks, Lance, for the question. So, as Andrew said, really diverse growth, both new business and high retention rates. So one of our best-selling years ever. I'd also call out the pharmacy services expansion, the organic growth there across the diverse set of pharmacy services, cost management. And then last, as you mentioned, new products and services, just to call out one weight engaged. So comprehensive management, medication, provider support, client support, lifestyle modification, digital, so a comprehensive solution across Optum, not just Optum Rx, partnering with Optum Health and Optum Insights.

            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you, Dirk. Our colleagues' ongoing focus on further expanding and strengthening the foundations, which underpinned our growth pillars is paving the way for consistent growth in 2024 and beyond. Revenue in \u201823 of $372 billion grew by over 14% with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.16, grew 15% and brought full-year adjusted earnings per share to $25.12, a growth of 13%. As Andrew noted earlier, at the end of December, we entered into an agreement to sell our Brazil operations and expect to close in the first-half of this year. Upon closing, we expect to record a charge of approximately $7 billion, the majority of which is non-cash and largely due to foreign currency translation losses accumulated over several years. The impact of this one-time charge will be excluded from our \u201824 adjusted earnings per share measure. For your modeling purposes, the full-year \u201824 outlook incorporated about $6 billion of revenue for Brazil or about 1.5% of consolidated revenue. Before reviewing our business results, I'll offer some brief comments on care activity. Care patterns remain consistent with those we shared with you in the first-half of \u201823. Activity levels continue to be led by outpatient care for seniors with orthopedic and cardiac procedure categories among the more prominent. As we've noted, our benefit design approach assumed these activity levels persist throughout \u201824. And the care patterns we observed exiting \u201823 reconfirmed that decision. On the margin, we saw some modest late-year seasonal activity, such as strong and welcome response from seniors to scheduled physicians at this to receive RSV vaccinations. In some cases, these were accompanied by additional necessary care being obtained, especially for people that had not seeing a physician in some time. A positive outcome for people's health. In some though, as we reflect on full-year \u201823 results, overall care activity was broadly in-line with the views we've shared earlier. And as we enter '24, we're confident in the response of pricing and benefit design actions we undertook. With care patterns, continuing to be supportive of our care ratio outlook of 84% plus or minus 50 basis points. Turning to the performance of our businesses in \u201823. Optum Health revenues grew by 34% to over $95 billion as we increased the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements by about 900,000 to more than 4.1 million, expanded services in the home, and broadened and deepened the levels and types of care we offer. Optum Insight's revenues grew 30% to $18.9 billion. We concluded the year with a revenue backlog of $32.1 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over last year. This growth was driven by our diverse and expanding product portfolio, which connects many of the key stakeholders across healthcare, whether it's launching new decision support solutions for providers, claims editing software for payers, or simplifying the payment process for all, our continued investments are fostering the next phase of Optum Insight growth. Optum Rx revenues grew 16% to over $116 billion, driven by the continued addition of new clients, expansion with an existing relationship, and organic growth of our pharmacy services businesses. In 2023, both customer retention and new wins were among the best Optum Rx has delivered. At UnitedHealthcare full-year revenues of over $281 billion grew nearly 13%. Adding to Andrew's earlier comments, within Medicare Advantage, we expect a majority of our full-year growth outlook to be realized outside the annual enrollment period with the growth patterns consistent with those we have experienced over the more recent years. Our Medicaid enrollment outlook for 2024 balances two key elements. First is that, state redetermination activities will be largely completed by mid-year. And second, that growth within existing states such as North Carolina and other new opportunities will partially offset these impacts. Within our domestic commercial offerings, we expect to serve about 1.5 million additional people in \u201824, a strong result. And we are encouraged by the continued positive customer response we are experiencing as we look ahead. Our ample capital capacities continue to underpin our long-term growth objectives. Cash flow from operations in \u201823 was $29 billion or 1.3 times net income. We returned nearly $15 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends and deployed over $10 billion in growth capital to build for the future. To summarize our \u201823 performance and start to the New Year further solidifies and reinforces our confidence in both the \u201824 and long-term growth objectives we shared with you at the end of November. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew. Yes. Good morning, Justin. You're absolutely right. So the prime factor here when we think about the full-year view and where we ended up being, what we talked about much earlier in the year in terms of the outpatient care activity among senior populations. And that continuing consistent with what we saw back much earlier in the year and very supportive of what we staked out in terms of the benefit design that we stepped into \u201824 with, in particular for senior populations in our Medicare Advantage products. So all those elements very much supportive of that view and the activities we undertook earlier in the year. As it relates to kind of where we landed the full year, so 10 basis points really above kind of what we indicated at the investor conference back in November of differential and Andrew hit on those items. Let me just kind of take it a little bit deep here. So, definitely some typical seasonality involved in there and the incremental elements were -- I point out a couple of items, seniors did really respond strongly to RSV vaccinations and scheduled physician visits. Sometimes those physician visits, what we noted were driving other care activity around that. So in some cases, seniors that hadn't perhaps been to a physician in a little while, and so they visited their PCP, got an RSV vaccine, and then in the meantime, their PCPs were able to close some additional care gaps as they were there, which is a great thing because some of these seniors hadn't been in for a while. So important activity to occur there in the fourth quarter. So that was one of the elements that we saw there. As it relates to kind of what we were seeing with elevated care costs for COVID, what we saw in the fourth quarter in particular in December. Overall, we've been noticing is that COVID admits for inpatient stays are running a higher cost per case than we traditionally saw. That actually kind of makes some sense. There are more intense cases typically that are going into inpatient stay. I will say we did notice in December that the total level of COVID admits were probably 50% to 60% above the October-November average that we had seen. So that was kind of the highest part of the year in terms of COVID inpatient admits. If I take those elements and sum together, that then more than accounts for the 10 basis points differential in our full-year view, Justin. As that pertains to your second question, as we look out into the next year and what we see in terms of patterns, I would call it patterns commensurate, kind of, with what we saw this year in terms of just the movement, with this kind of 84% view that we view for the full-year. As I step back and reflect and just kind of thinking about where -- broadly where the analyst consensus is, you picked particularly the 1Q. It's kind of in the right -- it looks like an appropriate zone in terms of staked out there for what one would expect. So thank you, Justin. Yes. Good morning, A.J. So first on the days claims payable, so 2.8 day sequential decline, two days year-over-year. So primarily the single largest factor would be exactly what you pointed to, the change in prior period development. So that has a significant impact, if you look about the year ago where we were in prior period development and where we were even the 3Q. So the significant impact on that part, that'd be the main factor. In terms of other contributing factors that we saw, we did see in the fourth quarter some modest acceleration in provider claim submission timing. So just speed up in terms of those submissions, how quickly we're receiving them from data service in terms of receipt. We also noted that as it related to the fourth quarter some higher claims intensity in the first part of the quarter, particularly October. So that's a factor that impacts the denominator, Medex per day in the day's claims payable metric. And that was a piece that was in that also. As it relates to the $100 million of unfavorable medical development in the quarter, put that mostly, the items that we were talking about in my response to Justin's question. So the respiratory-related activity that we saw in there, the modestly higher cost per case for inpatient, COVID admits, really kind of those were the main factors that we had in there in terms of contributing to the unfavorable development. Thank you. Yes, Lisa. So definitely kind of seeing seniors obtaining RSV vaccinations and some of the respiratory activity that was going on in the quarter. So broadly similar features. For Optum Health, one of the comments that we've made throughout the year, though, also has to do with the progression here of taking on a large block of new membership. So we took on about 900,000 new members as we started the year. And one of the comments we've made throughout the year is engaging with these members, because the most important thing we need to do is have the clinical engagement with these members in terms of start improving their health outcomes, getting them and to see physicians, having our clinicians interacting -- having -- interacting with them. And it's a comment we've made throughout the years, we've seen the Optum Health margin progression, so one of the great things. We probably started the year at kind of roughly at 20% engagement level with that 900,000-member block. We exit the year having engaged with about 80% of these members. Super important factor as we think about Optum Health, as we think about 2024 and how -- and that progression. And that's been a big focus of the team at Optum Health all year long of getting that engagement in. So we can have impact on their health. But far and away, especially given what this population is like, they typically have complex needs, that's important. Another really important market as it relates to the new membership patients that we're bringing into Optum Health for 2024 again. So I talked about that 20% engagement level we started '23 with. For 2024, we're going to start at a 50% engagement level with that new membership. So we're making advances in that and that's exactly what you should expect from the team. Their efforts have been really strong. Yes, and Lisa, tying up just on the last part of your question here regarding visibility into care activity claims like, no -- we don't -- that's not a factor. Just given the model of Amar's business and how those groups run, we -- frankly, it's one of the areas where we get probably early sensing mechanisms in terms of the care activity that's going on, is one of the early sensing mechanisms from much earlier in the year when we were able to talk about what we were seeing in these senior populations and the care activity within these orthopedic and other procedures. So that's not a factor. In fact, if anything, it's probably a strength of the organization. Sure. Good morning, Kevin. So yes, so the elements that contributed to the unfavorable development being around respiratory activity that was going on as the seniors came in to get vaccines, another care was being delivered and such. And that higher inpatient cost per case for the COVID admits that we're seeing. So those would largely be the prime contributors of the elements that we are seeing here in terms of that unfavourability. So you're absolutely correct in your assumption. That doesn't impact our run-in assumption as we think about our outlook for 2024, and which -- so keeps us right squarely in where we thought we'd be as we were at our investor conference, is taking out the 84% plus/minus 50 basis points. Really as we look across the scope of our businesses and we think reflect on how we performed in '20 and in \u201823, the scope of it being very much with what we saw back in mid-year of 2023, that this is -- that the running factors are about outpatient care activity among senior populations, which we incorporated into our bids. The elements that you're appropriately referring to in 4Q, again, not factors impacting our view at all in terms of how we staked out \u201824 and how we expect to perform in \u201824. Really good question. Yes, Scott. Good morning. So as Amar said, feel very good about where we established our margin objectives for 2024. The element super important here is, again, how these new patient cohorts progress as they come into our business, and we're able to engage with them clinically and improve their health outcomes, make sure we're able to close care gaps. And the progress that Amar and teams accomplished during 2023 in terms of getting those engagement levels will assist a lot in terms of the health of the people that we're serving here, and then particularly, this cohort from 2023 to 900,000 new patients that we're able to serve and how that business performs over the course of the year. So that's a big step into it. Another big step into it is this group of 750,000 new patients that came on to the business. The fact that we were able to. Yet engagement level is significantly higher than we were at last year, where the new cohort will help also. So it gives us a lot of confidence in where we're stepping out in terms of serving these people throughout the course of the coming year. In terms of your comment, you'd expect them typical than seasonality factors to weigh in how the quarters performed. So much more think about that as seasonality factors, so they're probably having impact here. So typical in terms of seasonal factors that we would have experienced this year, starting with a stronger base that sets us up well to reach our targets."

            "name": "Tim Noel",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Josh, for the question. So I agree with Andrew's comments and a couple of things to start with is, there's been a number of changes to the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs, over the last 18-months to two years that are really phasing in over multiple years. And as we plan for 2024, we once again took a very rational view to the environment and also a long-term view with always our overarching goal being benefit stability for our members. As we stepped into -- as we step into benefit planning in future years, we really feel like we have got a very thoughtful way to respond to all of those changes that will be encountered by the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs into 2025 and beyond. And certainly as we look forward, we don't believe that we have any material pricing catch up to do in future periods and feel like we've got a very thoughtful response to the changes that will be encountered by the program into 2025 and 2026. So we think the forward view of our competitive outlook is quite solid and quite strong as we think about growth over the long-term. Yes. Thanks for the question, Nathan. So once again, the Medicare environment, selling environment is highly competitive. And we probably saw one of the more aggressive years of pricing that we've ever seen in the 2024 session. We guided at investor conference to growth of 450,000 to 550,000 lives, which is a little bit more modest than we have grown in past years, but it's reflective of our response to the new risk model changes, what we saw in outpatient utilization patterns early in '23 and reflecting that into 2024 pricing. And as we close out AEP, I would say that we were a little bit light against what we were thinking, kind of, end of November. Most of that actually is in the group business, some of the very aggressive benefits, a little bit more switching, drove some of our term rates a bit higher in AEP than we were initially thinking. But we still feel like we're going to have a much heavier weighting of our growth outside of the annual enrollment period from February to December. And this is really just a continuation of a trend that we have seen play out over the last five years really. And in fact, last year, we drove 430,000 lives of growth or about 60% of our total growth in the period from February to December. This is a portion of the selling season that we really do well in given our large dual footprint and also the fact that some of the selling and AEP tends to be focused on some of those headline benefits that have been really aggressively positioned. And throughout the remainder of the year, there tends to be some switching back as folks think more deeply about things like network, the fulfillment of supplemental benefits, overall service and delivery of product. So I guess the headline is it is a very aggressive marketplace this year. We feel like we're positioned really well for \u201825 and \u201826 on how we priced, and very pleased with what we've done so far and excited about our opportunity, once again, to have a really great growth in the selling period from February to December of \u201824."

As a direct result of their mission-driven focus, this year we'll serve even more people more comprehensively than anticipated in the outlook we offered at the end of 2022. By the close of this year, we will serve nearly 900,000 additional patients under value-based care arrangements at OptumHealth, almost 1 million new consumers across UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Medicare Advantage offerings, and a total more than 1.5 billion scripts to the people who rely on OptumRx. Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share. The confidence we have in our sustained long-term growth outlook is exemplified by the 14% third quarter revenue increase we reported this morning, more than $11 billion above last year. The sources of this growth will drive many more years of strong performance. Value-based care is the centerpiece of our long-term strategy, precisely because it delivers on the promise of high-quality clinical outcomes and experiences at lower cost than traditional models. This year, we expect OptumHealth will serve more than 4 million people in fully accountable relationships, almost twice as many people as we served just two years ago. Many of these patients have serious health challenges, few economic resources, and until now often had limited access to care or the type of care they truly need. Ramping up to engage these patients requires significant upfront investment and high touch reach. These early efforts ensure we can address patients\u2019 unique needs and design personalized care plans that drive better health outcomes, increase quality of life, and deliver cost savings throughout the health system. Making investments to serve people, who have endured far too many barriers to care is an easy choice for us all. In 2023, you have seen both our commitment and financial capacity to invest to further enable our ability to serve and to grow far into the future. In recent years, we've invested significant resources in building our capabilities to care for people most effectively for the life or health stage they find themselves in, whether they need preventative or palliative care or are best served in a clinic at home or virtually. In particular, we're advancing our ability to care for people in their homes and integrating that physical care with our pharmacy and behavioral offerings. This work means developing an even more versatile clinical workforce to serve consumers in more ways through clinic-based Optum care delivery capabilities and extending our reach to consumers, who may not have ready access to physical clinics. Medicare Advantage continues to be a powerful force in driving superior health outcomes for consumers and in helping to lower costs at the system level. Today, about half of all seniors in the U.S. have chosen Medicare Advantage over traditional Medicare, and that number will continue to expand for very good reasons. The results are well documented. Medicare Advantage outperforms traditional fee-for-service for seniors on many measures, including lower rates of hospitalization. And they spend up to 45% less out of pocket, compared to those in Medicare fee-for-service. Importantly, this high value for consumers is delivered at a lower cost to the health system. UnitedHealthcare serves more people in high quality, four-star and higher Medicare Advantage plans than any other organization. Looking to the 2024 enrollment period, which begins Sunday, we're confident our offerings will again resonate with consumers as they prioritize high-quality care and stable benefits. In the reduced funding environment health plans face, I credit our teams for investing in the areas consumers value most, including zero-dollar premium plans, no copays for primary, virtual, and preventative care, and no copays for 100s of the most commonly prescribed drugs. I want to highlight one more aspect of our growth story, the consistently strong performance of our pharmacy businesses. Pharmacy, as you know, is the most common consumer touch point in healthcare. What consumers and employers want more than anything is access to the most effective treatments in the moment they need them for the lowest possible cost. OptumRx is delivering on those expectations. This most recent selling season is on track to be among our strongest, reflecting a combination of new clients and retention rates in the very high-90s. And as the coming season for 2025 develops, we're expecting another year of robust growth. Our clients tell us they value the enhancements we are making to our pharmacy offerings, providing them transparency and choice, while also integrating new tools and capabilities. Notably, our pharmacy service offerings go far beyond the foundational benefit management capabilities and now account for about half of all OptumRx revenues. We continue to expand the reach of our community pharmacies and our diverse specialty and infusion offerings are growing double-digits. Driving this expanding market demand is the enormous pressure facing employers, health plans, governments and others to manage and respond to manufacturer list pricing. The services offered by OptumRx and others are the only counterbalance to drug company pricing. The foundational business objectives for PBMs is to lower costs and make medicines more affordable and accessible for individuals and families. PBMs are the only entities in the drug supply chain with that exclusive focus and incentive, and we're honored to play this critical role. These pillars of our growth, value-based care, pharmacy, and our innovative benefits businesses, alongside our health technology and financial service capabilities, underpin our ability to develop ever stronger value propositions for the people, who receive and those who pay for care and support our confidence in a future of growth. And with that, I'll pass it to Dirk McMahon, our President and COO.\nDirk McMahon: Thanks, Andrew. I recently hosted UnitedHealthcare's National Accounts Forum, where we bring together client leaders twice a year to share ideas and gather feedback. These are some of the biggest and most sophisticated companies in America that collectively employ and sponsor coverage for millions of people. And to no surprise, healthcare costs top their list of concerns, especially the rising cost of drugs. In addition, they want innovation, new tools to help their employees take full advantage of their benefits, achieve better health outcomes, and save money. And of course, it has to be digital. Let me offer a few examples of innovation that have fueled our growth outlook, starting with our mobile platform, the primary access point for millions of UHC members. Each year, we had new capabilities to provide consumers with increased on-demand care access, highly personalized information about their benefits, real-time support, cost estimation tools, integrated pharmacy capabilities, and enhanced rewards. Another example, our newest and fastest growing commercial offerings, which feature no annual deductibles and incentivize people to make good healthcare choices by offering an unprecedented view into quality and cost. When seeking care options, consumers see potential care providers' latest reviews and quality designations, and they see what they will actually pay for their care, which will help them make the most informed decisions. UnitedHealthcare members in these offerings are receiving more preventative care, while paying about 50% less out of pocket, compared to people enrolled in traditional offerings. And their employers can reduce the total cost of care with an average savings of 11%. These results are why such new offerings are among our fastest growing. Beyond these consumer-facing innovations, we're leveraging the latest technologies to create greater operational capacity and productivity, so we can better serve consumers and focus on the highest value work. Our teams are significantly improving how quickly we respond to the millions of benefit questions we receive each year. We are using AI and natural language processing to expedite call documentation, to rapidly generate accurate summaries of consumer interactions with our contact centers, saving millions of dollars in administrative work and freeing up capacity for our people to prioritize engagement. We're also utilizing these technologies to translate and interpret unstructured data, such as physician notes, which will help, for example, provide deeper insights for life sciences customers, so they can better assess the efficacy of their treatments. Of course, these are just a few of the 100s of AI applications powered by OptumInsight we are actively developing, testing, and deploying today to further elevate the consumer and care provider experience, while driving increased quality and lower costs. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. The growth we reported today is a direct result of investments made over many years to develop and connect the diverse health capabilities needed to serve the people, who rely on us each day, while also creating the foundational capacity to serve millions more in the years ahead. This capability development has long been in the making, and it's still very much underway as the opportunities to serve more people, more deeply continue to expand. Before reviewing our business results, I'll offer a few brief comments on care activity. Care patterns remain consistent with the view we shared during the second quarter, with activity levels still led by outpatient care for seniors, and still most notably in the orthopedic and cardiac procedure categories. These trends remain stable at the levels we previously described. As we've noted, our outlook assumes these activity levels persist throughout next year. We continuously monitor a broad spectrum of patient acuity levels and have yet to see any other notable changes. For example, within oncology, the average stage at which we are first seeing cancer diagnosis remains consistent with historical patterns. As always, we remain diligent in looking for changes to the underlying health of patients. With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. Revenues of $92.4 billion grew by 14% over the prior year, with double-digit growth again at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum Health revenues grew by 29% approaching $24 billion, driven by an increase in the number of care services we offer and patients we serve, especially for those with complex care needs. Operating margins continue to reflect the initial clinical engagement activities that support the strong growth in patients we have realized this year, as well as the higher care activity patterns we have discussed. OptumRx revenues grew by 14%, approaching $29 billion, driven by the strength in our pharmacy care services offerings, as well as new customer wins. Script growth of nearly 7% reflects customer response to our innovative solutions, which focus on choice and lowest net cost. OptumInsight revenues grew by 35% to $5 billion. Revenue backlog of over $31 billion increased by more than $7 billion, in part due to the change healthcare combination. In addition, we recently announced a partnership to provide revenue cycle, analytics, and information technology services to a health system serving more than 400,000 people in the Midwest. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, our commercial business added nearly 700,000 people through the third quarter. Further, selling season indications are tracking favorably, particularly in national accounts. So as \u201824 begins, we expect to grow to serve an additional 1 million people with commercial benefits. Within our public sector programs, we expect growth of nearly 1 million Medicare Advantage members this year. And looking to the year ahead, we're encouraged by the consumer value, stability, and breadth of our offerings. And as always, we start with an expectation that we will outpace overall market growth. Our Medicaid performance remains strong as we support people and families through the redeterminations process. Our teams are really leaning in, speaking with 1,000s of consumers each day. Through a comprehensive Outreach Program, we are helping people navigate the process and connecting them with the resources they need to retain or reinstate their health benefits or to help them find other affordable coverages. A significant majority of the people we engage with are able to retain or reinstate their coverage. Our capital capacities remain strong. For the first nine months of the year, adjusted cash flows from operations were at $22.4 billion or 1.3 times net income. And in that same timeframe, we returned over $11.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As noted, given the strength of our business performance, this morning we have updated our \u201823 outlook for adjusted earnings to $24.85 to $25 per share. And as we finish strongly in \u201823 and look forward to \u201824, we're intensely focused on execution, while further expanding our capacity to serve more people, more deeply, and building the foundations to support our growth objectives for years to come. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. Before opening up for questions, I'll offer some preliminary observations about next year, while reserving most of this conversation for our investor conference on November 29th. Our businesses continue to build momentum, while maintaining flexibility and adaptability for an ever-changing landscape, even as we invest for the future. We're focused on our strategic growth pillars and driving efficiencies throughout the enterprise at an accelerated pace. At this distance, analyst earnings estimates for 2024 reasonably reflect the performance view we expect to offer in November, with consensus near the upper end of our likely initial outlook range. Importantly, the growth we're realizing today and our expanding capacity serve to further reinforce the confidence we have in our long-term 13% to 16% growth objective. And with that, I'll now ask the operator to open up for questions.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Good morning, and thanks for the comments. I wanted to start with GLP-1s and really understand from two sides. One, when we think about rates for 2024, can you talk about what you've incorporated in rates around GLP-1s, especially around weight loss as we have new products coming to the market? And how do I think about that from the PBM side when we think about the services that you can wrap around that and sell from a PBM perspective?\nAndrew Witty: Lisa, thanks so much for the question. In a second, I'll ask Brian Thompson from UHC and Dr. Patrick Conway to respond to your comments in a little more detail. But let me just preface all of that. You know, the thing we're most overall focused on in GLP-1 space is honestly the pricing. You know, we're very positive about the potential for another tool in the toolbox to help folks manage their weight. We recognize that has potential benefits, but we're struggling and frankly our clients are struggling with the list prices, which have been demanded of these products in the U.S., which are running at about 10 times the level of price which have been paid in Western Europe. So, overall, I'd say that is our focus, is to try and find a way to make this a sustainable and affordable space for our clients to support. With that said, let me ask Brian to give you a perspective from UHC and how they've incorporated this in their forward view?\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Thanks for the question there, Lisa. First, to put in context GLP-1 is over 80% on the diabetic side. So as we think about weight loss, up to maybe 20% of our total spend and it's largely performing in line with what we had planned as we went into \u201823. And we feel very confident and comfortable about how we're looking at that going forward into \u201824. As you think about it, keep in mind, the vast majority of the coverage here is in our fee-based business, that's our self-employed customers and that's still at less than a third, around 30% of our book. As we look forward, are our customers considering to cover more or less? I would say it's a mixed bag, some are seeking coverage albeit dissatisfied with the price points. Some are backing off given the cost, but I wouldn't really be directional one way or the other on whether or not we're seeing more or less coverage on the weightless side as we look forward. But again, to Andrew's point, beyond just getting to the obvious lower price points, we're really trying to work with manufacturers to get to some aligned value-based constructs, getting pricing to a point where it's based on outcomes and adherence levels, all the way to outright risk on utilization levels, and pairing those with therapies and programs that can put less reliance on lifelong adherence requirements like these drugs currently have. We're not there yet. We're optimistic, but we can get there, but clearly price point is a key barrier.\nAndrew Witty: Brian, thanks so much. And Patrick, maybe from the -- from OptumRx perspective, you could talk a little bit about the broader approaches we take?\nPatrick Conway: Thank you. As Andrew said, our customers, payers, employers, people we serve are concerned about the prices of GLP-1s as set by manufacturers. OptumRx will continue to negotiate lower prices through discounts over time, be transparent with our customers, and implement clinical evidence-based guidelines so the right people get appropriate medicines. And as you alluded to, Lisa, obesity and cardiometabolic disease is a major public issue -- health issue in the U.S. and across all of [Oxfam] (ph), we are developing and implementing comprehensive solutions of which medicines are only a part of on behalf of our clients and people we serve to drive better health outcomes for all and value to the health system.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Patrick. And Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Next question, please, Jennifer.\nOperator: Yes, we'll go next to A.J. Rice with [UBS] (ph).\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. You know, it's similar to last quarter, the trend in margin and OptumHealth and OptumInsight has been down year-to-year, you know, you've called out change, particularly with OptumInsight, but I wondered if there's any ability to discuss unusual items, non-recurring items. I know you said you had some cost reduction programs you were implementing this quarter in OptumHealth. Did those impact the results? And is there any change as you look ahead to \u201824 in your margin expectations or targets for those two businesses?\nAndrew Witty: A.J., thanks so much for the question, appreciate it. So let me just make a few comments, particularly as it speaks to the OptumHealth part of the question that you raised. So as you look at 2023, essentially what we've seen, and we refer to this in Q2, greater growth in the number of people, patients, that we've been privileged to serve this year, particularly the more complex patients. So very strong, and you heard in our opening commentary, very strong growth in the number of fully accountable lives running at about 900,000, substantial fraction of that coming in the more complex cases. As I said back in the last call, we're very, very pleased to have that growth. We believe that is really foundational or key foundation for future long-term growth of the business. However, within that, the mix of that population is a little different to what we expected. That takes time to then build the engagement capabilities that we need to be able to work with those people and their care providers to ensure the very best care is delivered in the most efficient and effective way. And that's really the bulk of the investment that we're talking about. It's really taking the time, looking after those folks in the way they need to be looked after right now in advance of those being able to engage with them fully and deliver then the various interventions and advices that we can provide that we're really building throughout Optum to ensure that not just in one year, but over multiple years, those folks get increasingly better care delivery and better outcomes. And recall that these patients in many cases have really been somewhat, you know, not necessarily looked after, as well as they could have been by the system, because of their very complexity. In some cases, they're not able to get to clinics, which is why we've been building up our home care capabilities and other wraparound services to the classic clinic approach. That's really the driving force. Now, as that speaks to the future, two things really, A.J., one is we're super confident around our ability to continue to grow the number of patients, who are able to look after. Number two, as those capabilities that have been accelerated during this year begin to affect both the quality positively and the cost of how these patients' care is delivered, you're going to see that shine through an improved economic performance of OptumHealth. And as we look forward, we're very confident about continued strengthening of that business. Make no mistake, OptumHealth is having a very strong growth year and we're taking the opportunity this year to really ready ourselves and build strength for the next many years of that business. AJ, thanks so much for the question. Next question?\nOperator: Yes, we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Understanding that you expect Medicare Advantage to grow at a healthy pace, I think you said above market again in 2024. Could you speak to that progress expected at OptumHealth? I know we'll get details at the Investor Day, but how are you thinking about the transition of patients from sort of fee for service to these fully risk engagements and then maybe general levels of investment for growth in light of the risk model and reimbursement model changes?\nAndrew Witty: So Josh, thanks so much for the question. I mean, obviously we'll leave very much the detail of the elements of the growth model for when we meet with you all in November. Having said that, we would no reason not to expect a continued healthy momentum in our move toward value-based care next year with continued high expectations for our ability to deliver that. To your broader question, maybe just reflect a little bit again on 2023. So this has been a year which essentially has been obviously very heavily influenced by the change in the funding environment that was announced earlier in the year for Medicare Advantage. And we're very appreciative of the three-year phasing of the changes, which CMS ultimately decided to make. But obviously, those changes are essentially the equivalent to a price cut phased in over three years for the Medicare Advantage program. We are appreciative of the fact that we have had essentially seven, eight, nine months warning of that in terms of when that was announced before we go into the \u201824 year. And that\u2019s allowed us and we have taken full advantage of it to really focus on how we ready ourselves, not just for 2024, but for the next 36 months. So 2023 has all for us been about ensuring that we re-engineer our cost base, that we refocused our benefit strategies to those things that matter most to patients, that we strengthen and invest in our ability to manage affordability of care going forward into the system, and that we're taking full advantage of building the capabilities we have already begun to construct around our consumer engagement, our technology, digital first capabilities, and ultimately doubling down on our commitment to value-based care. That has really been the story behind the investments of 2023 in response to the changes that have been signaled by CMS, so that we go into \u201824, \u201825, \u201826, \u201827 feeling strong, feeling that we've taken advantage of these last several months to ensure that we've adjusted and adapted our strategy and business in readiness for the change in the funding environment, which gives us strong confidence for next year and underpins our commitment to the signal I just gave you in terms of our potential for 2024. Next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Justin Lake with Wolf Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask about UHC performance. First, your MLR was better than our expectations, but curious how it compared to your internal estimates? And maybe you could share how that might have come across -- come in across the three main business segments? And then quickly, on the third quarter UHC margins, I found it interesting that while the MLR deteriorated by 50 basis points year-over-year in the quarter, overall UHC margins actually improved by 50 basis points. So, curious what might have grown with that? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Justin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask John Rex to respond to the first part and then Brian Thompson, the second.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Justin. So, overall, I'd call it broadly consistent with our expectations in terms of the third quarter. So a few things I'd like to highlight though. So care patterns were, as we discussed, focused again on outpatients, outpatient activity with seniors, those continue at the levels we described during the second quarter. And that's what really drove a lot of kind of the activity throughout the quarter. It's still in those categories that we have been focused on. The sequential move that you see from second quarter to third quarter is largely a seasonal factor. As you know well, there's always less care activity in a third quarter, that has to do just with vacations, a lot of the elements that go in there in terms of certain types of discretionary care, seasonal illnesses, so typical patterns, and also Part-D patterns that you see on a regular basis. In fact, if you go back to the years prior to 2020, 3Q would typically be the lowest care ratio quarter. So I'd say it's probably more typical than not, just getting back to periods that were more normalized in terms of the activities that we saw going on there. We continue to expect our full-year medical care ratio to be toward the upper end of our initial 82.6 plus minus 50 basis point range. So very consistent with the level that we set out there back again in the two quarter that would be toward the upper end of that outlook. So -- and then the seasonal factors in the 3Q, that some of those things influencing where you'd expect to be in that fourth quarter, the final quarter of the calendar year. Certainly utilization, Part-D impacts, they move the other direction in a fourth quarter. So typical in that. That's amplified, of course, very much by the deductible wear off features that you see in a fourth quarter, influenza, RSV, all those patterns that come in. So we'd expect that to move the other direction here as we go into the 4Q.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks, John. And Brian?\nBrian Thompson: Yes, John, I think you did a good job of explaining, sort of, the sequencing of the medical cost ratio. What I don't want to lose sight of is I think the key point is all of our businesses in UnitedHealthcare right now are really demonstrating innovation and market success at the same time. And you're seeing that come through in these margins, whether that's our complex care and health equity strategy in Medicaid, how we're showing up with broader service offerings and conveniences like UCard and URide, NMA to complement strong, stable core benefits or some of the innovations you heard around the commercial benefits in Dirk\u2019s opening remarks. This is really translating the type of growth and performance that I think you've come to expect from UnitedHealthCare, and I think it sets up a really nice baseline that I remain optimistic about as we look forward to 2024.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Brian and John. Next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the PBM business, obviously interest in alternative or maybe even experimental models has been a big area to-date, you know, the past quarter or so. I guess what are you hearing from your health plan employer clients on their degree of interest in doing something totally transformational in terms of how they manage those benefits? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hi, Stephen, thanks so much. Let me ask Patrick Conway to respond to that.\nPatrick Conway: Yes, so as we interact with our clients, employers, payers, and others, on this, first I'll note, a recent survey came out, approximately 90% of those clients are satisfied with their PBM. They're also satisfied with the level of transparency. Specifically for OptumRx, we will continue to innovate and provide additional solutions to our clients that are comprehensive, integrated and transparent. I'll call out one other area, transparency to the consumer. This has been a journey for us that we continue to drive transparency to the consumer. To call out one example with Price Edge, a product recently launched, that's providing consumers the most affordable medicine at the point of care. We are seeing millions of consumers access, use this tool as we provide it to them. And so you'll continue to see us to drive consumer transparency and innovative solutions to our clients.\nAndrew Witty: Right, Patrick, thanks so much. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Great, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the GLP-1 Class and I guess, you know, as we're starting to see more outcomes data for these drugs, do you see that changing, you know, employers willingness to cover this class given the potential long-term benefits and, you know, how you helping them think about potential ways to design the benefit to be able to manage that cost, which you guys talked about earlier being so much in focus for employers?\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. I mean, there's an old adage, which I quite like in this context, which is the innovation that is not affordable is not innovative. And that's really the key to all of this. Though I have no argument, I don't think anybody at UnitedHealth Group has any argument with the prospects and possibility for the future of this drug class. We recognize the need and nothing would make us happier, honestly, to be able to lean forward and see more and more folks take advantage of these sorts of opportunities. But ultimately it has to be affordable. And what we're hearing from our clients is they just -- they are really struggling to see how they embark on that journey of what they regard as a kind of open-ended financial risk. Now that's exactly why Brian earlier made the comments he did about we're trying to put forward to various manufacturers a variety of different options, but we need the manufacturers to move. It's as simple as that. And we remain extremely open-minded to any model that works. We're working with our clients to ensure that they understand the various options. But they are giving us very, very clear signals. They need our help to make this a more affordable proposition for their employees and their members. And we'll continue to lean into that. Thanks for the question, Nathan. Next question?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. [Indiscernible] if you can give us your updated thoughts on from this vantage point, what you're thinking about the trajectory of just overall wage inflation in healthcare? And how you're sort of planning for that? We have been seeing sort of moderation from the COVID peaks, but there certainly seems to be some pro-inflationary risks out there when thinking about some of the federal policy proposals, state proposals, and then obviously some of these Union actions too. So just curious on how you're thinking about wage inflation and health care moving forward and risks to that inflecting back upwards? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, absolutely. Thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dirk to give you a few comments on that.\nDirk McMahon: Yes, well, to start, what I would say is as we go out and we negotiate with various health systems for prices as we move forward, you know, one of the key things involved in those discussions is, you know, what wage inflation is and how it's impacting their costs. You know, as we sit here today, it's lucky that we sort of have three-year contracts, so it's muted a little bit. But what I would also say is, you know, we see a little bit of upward pressure on unit costs related to wages, but as I sit here today, it's not something that we haven't planning for and priced about. As I think about our own business, we haven't had trouble recruiting people such as nurses, clinicians. We've actually, you know, people really want to work for us and from a capacity perspective, one of the things as we've talked about our growth so far, we have to make sure we have the appropriate labor capacity to manage all the risks that we take. And as a consequence, we do spend a lot of time looking at the market. And as I said, people want to come to work for us. They like the mission. They like the ability to transform healthcare. And we're pretty pleased with our ability to hire and manage our operations going forward.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Dirk. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about OptumHealth, I understand the commentary about membership coming in better, which creates a margin drag, but it feels like a couple of hundred thousand people, maybe low to mid-single-digit, more membership than you expected, causing margins to drop from 8% to 7% or 12%, essentially. Seems like a pretty big delta. So I assume there's other things going on in there beyond just digesting new membership growth. If not, then I guess we would know what the margin is on those new members. But is there anything else you would spike out there and how do we think about building back from where we are today to that 8% to 10% margin target? Is it simply about getting today's membership to target margins or is there a cost side? It seems like you're adjusting the labor force to some degree. Is there an MLR side? Is there a rate side? Any other color to kind of help us give visibility into the 8% to 10% over time? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Kevin, thanks so much for the question. So listen, by far and away the most important phenomena here are the things we've talked about to you already. So just to reiterate a little bit what we said to you back in Q2. So we've seen obviously the elevation in MLR which has stabilized, hasn't really come down, isn't accelerating up, but definitely is a phenomena year-over-year, number one, number two, increased behavioral care costs. Remember that within OptumHealth, our behavioral business is, that's where our behavioral business sits, and that has also seen significant increase year-over-year. We're very positive about that, because it's a signal that people are engaging in seeking help for their behavioral conditions. And we know that, that entwines very importantly with their ongoing medical costs. But nonetheless, it's an element of elevation. And then as you rightly reiterate, a piece of it is the growth in our value-based lives and the mix of those lives. And by mix, that means complexity mix, as well as geographic mix. And it takes, as I said already today, takes a little bit of time to build up the capabilities to allow us to engage properly with those folks at the level we want to. And we have really have -- we have not held back on doing that, Kevin, and that's really the bulk of the investment during this cycle where we've really lent into building those capabilities in readiness for the next, we hope, many years of serving these individuals higher and higher capability. You know, of course, and I made a comment earlier about re-engineering our cost base. Of course there are changes going on in our cost base across the whole organization, including OptumHealth in response to the change in pricing signals from CMS. But I would put those very much, kind of, secondary to the core elements I've just described. We're in a position obviously where we know exactly what these populations are that we're now looking after. That's been very much the basis of our forward views in terms of how we're starting to lay out for \u201824, \u201825, \u201826. And we feel very confident about our ability not only to grow as an organization, but to continue to strengthen margins back into the zone that you've historically been used to. Thanks so much, Kevin, for that and next question?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nSarah James: Thank you. I wanted to circle back to your comments on the strength in commercial growth and national accounts for next year. Can you give us a little bit of color on the pricing environment, given all the comments you've made on the moving pieces and cost trends, and then help us put into context that, and the broader economy with how your clients are thinking about product selection, either in breath or the type of products that they're purchasing from you in \u201924?\nAndrew Witty: Sarah, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dan Kueter, who looks after our commercial insurance business to answer that.\nDan Kueter: Yes, thanks, Andrew. Hi, Sarah. Thanks for the question. The growth that John mentioned in his comments is settled business in our national accounts fee-based segment. So we're very happy with how that's completed. We're pricing and negotiating our fully insured business for January right now, and we're comfortable with how that's materializing as well. Employers continue to focus on both affordability and innovation, and our innovative products continue to resonate significantly in the market, as Dirk highlighted in his comments. Thanks, Sarah.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Don. Next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll, the next two David Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to pivot to OptumInsight, you had commented in previous calls about a fairly heavy level of spending to integrate change and invest in that platform. I wondered if you could update us on any ongoing spend in that regard? What we should expect in terms of implementation on pro-health and kind of trajectory of margin in OptumInsight? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, David, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Roger Connor, who's our new CEO of OptumInsight to respond, Roger?\nRoger Connor: Thank you, and David, thank you for the question. First of all, just to say I'm delighted to be taking over the leadership of Insight. This is a pretty unique and special business. And getting to know the people, the products, and the offerings, I think we're going to make a real difference to healthcare. So excited about that future. Just specifically, David, on your question, the change integration\u2019s gone really well, to be honest. You'll see in the Q3 margin that we had the tail end of some of that spend to integrate, but the Q3 margin is in line with our expectations. I think it is worth understanding the longer term outlook for OptumInsight margin. We still believe that's in the region of 18% to 22%, that's really driven by the mix of the businesses. As you know, we're a business that has software, we have services, so there are different margins in there. But when you take what we've created with change and you look at the overall portfolio that we have, we have this incredible portfolio that is addressing everything from clinical decision support, we've got products for admin efficiency, we've got other products for payment optimization. You have that growth engine plus our innovation, plus that margin profile, we're very confident about the future performance of Insight.\nAndrew Witty: That's great. And I wonder whether Dan Schumacher, who's been very heavily involved in our various health systems partnerships, might just want to reflect a little bit on the question obviously was around pro-health, but rather than talking specifically, maybe just share a few thoughts about the overall evolution of those health system profiles and how they play out over the first couple of years.\nDan Schumacher: Sure, thanks Andrew. David, appreciate the question. Certainly our health system partnerships, you mentioned one that we've announced recently, it's a growing portfolio for us. Obviously, at the health system level, there's a lot of pressures. We've talked in earlier questions about wage inflation and so forth. And we have a unique opportunity to really be able to address some of those near-term challenges, while at the same time provide some capacity for future evolution of the system as they think about more digital capacities, greater outpatient catchment, as well as further engagement. So those are some of the things that we can help unlock for them and their migration to value-based care. So we're encouraged by the portfolio. It continues to grow. Actually, from the initial scope nine out of 10 have expanded from their initial scope. So continuing to grow, we're in the early days, and we see a lot of opportunity ahead of us.\nAndrew Witty: Dan, appreciate it and thanks so much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.\nAnn Hynes: Hi, good morning. I would like to ask a GLP question more on the medical side. It sounds like right now price appears to be the greatest barrier for widespread adoption, assuming the outcome data continues to be positive. If pricing gets to a point that you view and your clients view as affordable. What do you think would be the long-term impact on care on the medical side? Are you seeing any near-term effects right now on MLR? I should say an MLR benefit. And do you think it would be reasonable to assume overall MLRs should decline with greater adoption of these drugs? And maybe what categories of health spend do you think or do you view would be the biggest opportunity going forward? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Ann, thanks so much for the question. I mean, I think honestly it\u2019s just way too early for us to be able to see anything like that, just in terms of, you know, obviously the weight loss indications are only just really coming into play. We haven't really been able to see, I'd say, anything from that perspective yet. And as I said earlier, the real focus for us right now is to try and figure out a way in which we can get to a position where the affordability of this class puts it in a zone where, you know, the people who need it can get it and can afford it. Nothing more to say on that, honestly. Next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James.\nJohn Ransom: Hey, good morning. On your fully accountable lives, what's the expectation where you'll end up in the year with a number of medicare fully advantage lives? And just looking at the eliminations, is it fair to assume that a lot of those fully accountable lives are coming out of the UHC book? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: So thanks very much for the question. I'll ask Dr. Amar Desai, who leads our OptumHealth Organization, just to comment a little bit on the, kind of, shape of the folks we look after there, and the degree to which they come from both UHC and obviously many of our external partners, Amar?\nAmar Desai: John, thanks very much for the question. We've had great growth in fully accountable membership as we mentioned earlier, adding over 900,000 patients for the year. That growth is diverse across a number of payers. We have over 100 payer partners spanning both national and regional payers. And as we think about that growth, of course, UnitedHealthcare is a core partner to us, but we continue to have the strength of our medical groups and physician networks being incredibly attractive to other payers regionally and nationally to be able to grow in their own value-based arrangements to drive outcomes and total cost of care. So we look forward to continued growth in a broad-based, diverse way. Thank you very much.\nAndrew Witty: Amar, thank you. And thank you for the question. Jennifer, I\u2019d say the last question now please.\nOperator: Okay, we'll go last to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Great. Thanks for taking the question. On Medicaid and Medicaid Redetermination, could you comment a little bit on the margin and implications of the members that are getting redetermined off? We've already seen a lot of double coverage or zero MOR on that? And then just in general, are enrollment -- disenrollment trends kind of consistent with your expectations and do you see where those members are going to as far as individual, employer, or uninsured? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Lance. Thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Spilker, who leads our Community and State business to respond to that, Tim?\nTim Spilker: Yes. Thank you, Lance, for the question. And maybe I'll start with just the enrollment trends, because I think that really informs a whole number of factors. So first off, what we're seeing, I think, consistent with what states have reported is significant disenrollment for procedural reasons. And what's more, a lot of variability, frankly, across states in terms of the pacing and re-enrollment and even states now that are suspending terminations or re-enrolling members based on guidance. So those stops and starts certainly have an impact, you know, on our membership, as well as membership mix. But frankly, that's why we continue to develop even more ways to engage members and support our states. You know, our goal really is to help individuals find coverage and so a couple points on that. Our reach rate for the programs that we've implemented exceeds that of our traditional programs, and we're seeing strong re-enrollment rates between 15% and 20% depending on the state. And so as a result, as John mentioned in his comments, we're retaining a significant majority of the members we engage with, certainly more to do. And second, in terms of your question around just kind of outlook, again, I think the factors around the re-enrollment has an impact on just how we think about mix. But I think it's also important that to consider the rate environment. You know, states are taking into account a thoughtful, taking a thoughtful and data-driven approach to rate setting. And with visibility now into around 45% of our revenue for \u201824, really appreciative of the approach that states are taking. So all in all, I would say both membership, as well as our outlook is in line with what we expected at this point with a lot of variability. I think our membership looks good in terms of the outlook that we set at the beginning of the year. And at this point, I feel all of this is manageable.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks so much. And thank all of you for your time this morning. I hope what you heard during today's call only reinforces what you've come to expect from UnitedHealth Group, an organization that's just as nimble and agile as it is focused and disciplined, always growing, always innovating, ceaselessly committed to our mission and deeply devoted to those we share. Thank you for your attention today and we appreciate it.\nOperator: This does concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Dirk McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. I recently hosted UnitedHealthcare's National Accounts Forum, where we bring together client leaders twice a year to share ideas and gather feedback. These are some of the biggest and most sophisticated companies in America that collectively employ and sponsor coverage for millions of people. And to no surprise, healthcare costs top their list of concerns, especially the rising cost of drugs. In addition, they want innovation, new tools to help their employees take full advantage of their benefits, achieve better health outcomes, and save money. And of course, it has to be digital. Let me offer a few examples of innovation that have fueled our growth outlook, starting with our mobile platform, the primary access point for millions of UHC members. Each year, we had new capabilities to provide consumers with increased on-demand care access, highly personalized information about their benefits, real-time support, cost estimation tools, integrated pharmacy capabilities, and enhanced rewards. Another example, our newest and fastest growing commercial offerings, which feature no annual deductibles and incentivize people to make good healthcare choices by offering an unprecedented view into quality and cost. When seeking care options, consumers see potential care providers' latest reviews and quality designations, and they see what they will actually pay for their care, which will help them make the most informed decisions. UnitedHealthcare members in these offerings are receiving more preventative care, while paying about 50% less out of pocket, compared to people enrolled in traditional offerings. And their employers can reduce the total cost of care with an average savings of 11%. These results are why such new offerings are among our fastest growing. Beyond these consumer-facing innovations, we're leveraging the latest technologies to create greater operational capacity and productivity, so we can better serve consumers and focus on the highest value work. Our teams are significantly improving how quickly we respond to the millions of benefit questions we receive each year. We are using AI and natural language processing to expedite call documentation, to rapidly generate accurate summaries of consumer interactions with our contact centers, saving millions of dollars in administrative work and freeing up capacity for our people to prioritize engagement. We're also utilizing these technologies to translate and interpret unstructured data, such as physician notes, which will help, for example, provide deeper insights for life sciences customers, so they can better assess the efficacy of their treatments. Of course, these are just a few of the 100s of AI applications powered by OptumInsight we are actively developing, testing, and deploying today to further elevate the consumer and care provider experience, while driving increased quality and lower costs. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John Rex. Yes, well, to start, what I would say is as we go out and we negotiate with various health systems for prices as we move forward, you know, one of the key things involved in those discussions is, you know, what wage inflation is and how it's impacting their costs. You know, as we sit here today, it's lucky that we sort of have three-year contracts, so it's muted a little bit. But what I would also say is, you know, we see a little bit of upward pressure on unit costs related to wages, but as I sit here today, it's not something that we haven't planning for and priced about. As I think about our own business, we haven't had trouble recruiting people such as nurses, clinicians. We've actually, you know, people really want to work for us and from a capacity perspective, one of the things as we've talked about our growth so far, we have to make sure we have the appropriate labor capacity to manage all the risks that we take. And as a consequence, we do spend a lot of time looking at the market. And as I said, people want to come to work for us. They like the mission. They like the ability to transform healthcare. And we're pretty pleased with our ability to hire and manage our operations going forward."

            "name": "Brian Thompson",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks for the question there, Lisa. First, to put in context GLP-1 is over 80% on the diabetic side. So as we think about weight loss, up to maybe 20% of our total spend and it's largely performing in line with what we had planned as we went into \u201823. And we feel very confident and comfortable about how we're looking at that going forward into \u201824. As you think about it, keep in mind, the vast majority of the coverage here is in our fee-based business, that's our self-employed customers and that's still at less than a third, around 30% of our book. As we look forward, are our customers considering to cover more or less? I would say it's a mixed bag, some are seeking coverage albeit dissatisfied with the price points. Some are backing off given the cost, but I wouldn't really be directional one way or the other on whether or not we're seeing more or less coverage on the weightless side as we look forward. But again, to Andrew's point, beyond just getting to the obvious lower price points, we're really trying to work with manufacturers to get to some aligned value-based constructs, getting pricing to a point where it's based on outcomes and adherence levels, all the way to outright risk on utilization levels, and pairing those with therapies and programs that can put less reliance on lifelong adherence requirements like these drugs currently have. We're not there yet. We're optimistic, but we can get there, but clearly price point is a key barrier. Yes, John, I think you did a good job of explaining, sort of, the sequencing of the medical cost ratio. What I don't want to lose sight of is I think the key point is all of our businesses in UnitedHealthcare right now are really demonstrating innovation and market success at the same time. And you're seeing that come through in these margins, whether that's our complex care and health equity strategy in Medicaid, how we're showing up with broader service offerings and conveniences like UCard and URide, NMA to complement strong, stable core benefits or some of the innovations you heard around the commercial benefits in Dirk's opening remarks. This is really translating the type of growth and performance that I think you've come to expect from UnitedHealthCare, and I think it sets up a really nice baseline that I remain optimistic about as we look forward to 2024."

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter results we reported today reflect well-balanced and durable growth, supported by disciplined execution, and a steadfast commitment to ensure high quality comprehensive care is well within reach for every person we're privileged to serve. Evolution in our marketplace, including regulatory changes, means agility and adaptability must continue to be defining characteristics of our company. The people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare continuously strive to find new ways to innovate, serve, and grow. As a direct result of their mission-driven focus, this year we'll serve even more people more comprehensively than anticipated in the outlook we offered at the end of 2022. By the close of this year, we will serve nearly 900,000 additional patients under value-based care arrangements at OptumHealth, almost 1 million new consumers across UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage offerings, and a total more than 1.5 billion scripts to the people who rely on OptumRx. Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share. The confidence we have in our sustained long-term growth outlook is exemplified by the 14% third quarter revenue increase we reported this morning, more than $11 billion above last year. The sources of this growth will drive many more years of strong performance. Value-based care is the centerpiece of our long-term strategy, precisely because it delivers on the promise of high-quality clinical outcomes and experiences at lower cost than traditional models. This year, we expect OptumHealth will serve more than 4 million people in fully accountable relationships, almost twice as many people as we served just two years ago. Many of these patients have serious health challenges, few economic resources, and until now often had limited access to care or the type of care they truly need. Ramping up to engage these patients requires significant upfront investment and high touch reach. These early efforts ensure we can address patients' unique needs and design personalized care plans that drive better health outcomes, increase quality of life, and deliver cost savings throughout the health system. Making investments to serve people, who have endured far too many barriers to care is an easy choice for us all. In 2023, you have seen both our commitment and financial capacity to invest to further enable our ability to serve and to grow far into the future. In recent years, we've invested significant resources in building our capabilities to care for people most effectively for the life or health stage they find themselves in, whether they need preventative or palliative care or are best served in a clinic at home or virtually. In particular, we're advancing our ability to care for people in their homes and integrating that physical care with our pharmacy and behavioral offerings. This work means developing an even more versatile clinical workforce to serve consumers in more ways through clinic-based Optum care delivery capabilities and extending our reach to consumers, who may not have ready access to physical clinics. Medicare Advantage continues to be a powerful force in driving superior health outcomes for consumers and in helping to lower costs at the system level. Today, about half of all seniors in the U.S. have chosen Medicare Advantage over traditional Medicare, and that number will continue to expand for very good reasons. The results are well documented. Medicare Advantage outperforms traditional fee-for-service for seniors on many measures, including lower rates of hospitalization. And they spend up to 45% less out of pocket, compared to those in Medicare fee-for-service. Importantly, this high value for consumers is delivered at a lower cost to the health system. UnitedHealthcare serves more people in high quality, four-star and higher Medicare Advantage plans than any other organization. Looking to the 2024 enrollment period, which begins Sunday, we're confident our offerings will again resonate with consumers as they prioritize high-quality care and stable benefits. In the reduced funding environment health plans face, I credit our teams for investing in the areas consumers value most, including zero-dollar premium plans, no copays for primary, virtual, and preventative care, and no copays for 100s of the most commonly prescribed drugs. I want to highlight one more aspect of our growth story, the consistently strong performance of our pharmacy businesses. Pharmacy, as you know, is the most common consumer touch point in healthcare. What consumers and employers want more than anything is access to the most effective treatments in the moment they need them for the lowest possible cost. OptumRx is delivering on those expectations. This most recent selling season is on track to be among our strongest, reflecting a combination of new clients and retention rates in the very high-90s. And as the coming season for 2025 develops, we're expecting another year of robust growth. Our clients tell us they value the enhancements we are making to our pharmacy offerings, providing them transparency and choice, while also integrating new tools and capabilities. Notably, our pharmacy service offerings go far beyond the foundational benefit management capabilities and now account for about half of all OptumRx revenues. We continue to expand the reach of our community pharmacies and our diverse specialty and infusion offerings are growing double-digits. Driving this expanding market demand is the enormous pressure facing employers, health plans, governments and others to manage and respond to manufacturer list pricing. The services offered by OptumRx and others are the only counterbalance to drug company pricing. The foundational business objectives for PBMs is to lower costs and make medicines more affordable and accessible for individuals and families. PBMs are the only entities in the drug supply chain with that exclusive focus and incentive, and we're honored to play this critical role. These pillars of our growth, value-based care, pharmacy, and our innovative benefits businesses, alongside our health technology and financial service capabilities, underpin our ability to develop ever stronger value propositions for the people, who receive and those who pay for care and support our confidence in a future of growth. And with that, I'll pass it to Dirk McMahon, our President and COO. Thanks John. Before opening up for questions, I'll offer some preliminary observations about next year, while reserving most of this conversation for our investor conference on November 29th. Our businesses continue to build momentum, while maintaining flexibility and adaptability for an ever-changing landscape, even as we invest for the future. We're focused on our strategic growth pillars and driving efficiencies throughout the enterprise at an accelerated pace. At this distance, analyst earnings estimates for 2024 reasonably reflect the performance view we expect to offer in November, with consensus near the upper end of our likely initial outlook range. Importantly, the growth we're realizing today and our expanding capacity serve to further reinforce the confidence we have in our long-term 13% to 16% growth objective. And with that, I'll now ask the operator to open up for questions. Lisa, thanks so much for the question. In a second, I'll ask Brian Thompson from UHC and Dr. Patrick Conway to respond to your comments in a little more detail. But let me just preface all of that. You know, the thing we're most overall focused on in GLP-1 space is honestly the pricing. You know, we're very positive about the potential for another tool in the toolbox to help folks manage their weight. We recognize that has potential benefits, but we're struggling and frankly our clients are struggling with the list prices, which have been demanded of these products in the U.S., which are running at about 10 times the level of price which have been paid in Western Europe. So, overall, I'd say that is our focus, is to try and find a way to make this a sustainable and affordable space for our clients to support. With that said, let me ask Brian to give you a perspective from UHC and how they've incorporated this in their forward view? Brian, thanks so much. And Patrick, maybe from the -- from OptumRx perspective, you could talk a little bit about the broader approaches we take? Thanks, Patrick. And Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Next question, please, Jennifer. A.J., thanks so much for the question, appreciate it. So let me just make a few comments, particularly as it speaks to the OptumHealth part of the question that you raised. So as you look at 2023, essentially what we've seen, and we refer to this in Q2, greater growth in the number of people, patients, that we've been privileged to serve this year, particularly the more complex patients. So very strong, and you heard in our opening commentary, very strong growth in the number of fully accountable lives running at about 900,000, substantial fraction of that coming in the more complex cases. As I said back in the last call, we're very, very pleased to have that growth. We believe that is really foundational or key foundation for future long-term growth of the business. However, within that, the mix of that population is a little different to what we expected. That takes time to then build the engagement capabilities that we need to be able to work with those people and their care providers to ensure the very best care is delivered in the most efficient and effective way. And that's really the bulk of the investment that we're talking about. It's really taking the time, looking after those folks in the way they need to be looked after right now in advance of those being able to engage with them fully and deliver then the various interventions and advices that we can provide that we're really building throughout Optum to ensure that not just in one year, but over multiple years, those folks get increasingly better care delivery and better outcomes. And recall that these patients in many cases have really been somewhat, you know, not necessarily looked after, as well as they could have been by the system, because of their very complexity. In some cases, they're not able to get to clinics, which is why we've been building up our home care capabilities and other wraparound services to the classic clinic approach. That's really the driving force. Now, as that speaks to the future, two things really, A.J., one is we're super confident around our ability to continue to grow the number of patients, who are able to look after. Number two, as those capabilities that have been accelerated during this year begin to affect both the quality positively and the cost of how these patients' care is delivered, you're going to see that shine through an improved economic performance of OptumHealth. And as we look forward, we're very confident about continued strengthening of that business. Make no mistake, OptumHealth is having a very strong growth year and we're taking the opportunity this year to really ready ourselves and build strength for the next many years of that business. AJ, thanks so much for the question. Next question? So Josh, thanks so much for the question. I mean, obviously we'll leave very much the detail of the elements of the growth model for when we meet with you all in November. Having said that, we would no reason not to expect a continued healthy momentum in our move toward value-based care next year with continued high expectations for our ability to deliver that. To your broader question, maybe just reflect a little bit again on 2023. So this has been a year which essentially has been obviously very heavily influenced by the change in the funding environment that was announced earlier in the year for Medicare Advantage. And we're very appreciative of the three-year phasing of the changes, which CMS ultimately decided to make. But obviously, those changes are essentially the equivalent to a price cut phased in over three years for the Medicare Advantage program. We are appreciative of the fact that we have had essentially seven, eight, nine months warning of that in terms of when that was announced before we go into the \u201824 year. And that's allowed us and we have taken full advantage of it to really focus on how we ready ourselves, not just for 2024, but for the next 36 months. So 2023 has all for us been about ensuring that we re-engineer our cost base, that we refocused our benefit strategies to those things that matter most to patients, that we strengthen and invest in our ability to manage affordability of care going forward into the system, and that we're taking full advantage of building the capabilities we have already begun to construct around our consumer engagement, our technology, digital first capabilities, and ultimately doubling down on our commitment to value-based care. That has really been the story behind the investments of 2023 in response to the changes that have been signaled by CMS, so that we go into \u201824, \u201825, \u201826, \u201827 feeling strong, feeling that we've taken advantage of these last several months to ensure that we've adjusted and adapted our strategy and business in readiness for the change in the funding environment, which gives us strong confidence for next year and underpins our commitment to the signal I just gave you in terms of our potential for 2024. Next question, please? Justin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask John Rex to respond to the first part and then Brian Thompson, the second. Great. Thanks, John. And Brian? Thanks so much, Brian and John. Next question, please? Hi, Stephen, thanks so much. Let me ask Patrick Conway to respond to that. Right, Patrick, thanks so much. Next question? Yes, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. I mean, there's an old adage, which I quite like in this context, which is the innovation that is not affordable is not innovative. And that's really the key to all of this. Though I have no argument, I don't think anybody at UnitedHealth Group has any argument with the prospects and possibility for the future of this drug class. We recognize the need and nothing would make us happier, honestly, to be able to lean forward and see more and more folks take advantage of these sorts of opportunities. But ultimately it has to be affordable. And what we're hearing from our clients is they just -- they are really struggling to see how they embark on that journey of what they regard as a kind of open-ended financial risk. Now that's exactly why Brian earlier made the comments he did about we're trying to put forward to various manufacturers a variety of different options, but we need the manufacturers to move. It's as simple as that. And we remain extremely open-minded to any model that works. We're working with our clients to ensure that they understand the various options. But they are giving us very, very clear signals. They need our help to make this a more affordable proposition for their employees and their members. And we'll continue to lean into that. Thanks for the question, Nathan. Next question? Yes, absolutely. Thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dirk to give you a few comments on that. Thanks, Dirk. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please? Kevin, thanks so much for the question. So listen, by far and away the most important phenomena here are the things we've talked about to you already. So just to reiterate a little bit what we said to you back in Q2. So we've seen obviously the elevation in MLR which has stabilized, hasn't really come down, isn't accelerating up, but definitely is a phenomena year-over-year, number one, number two, increased behavioral care costs. Remember that within OptumHealth, our behavioral business is, that's where our behavioral business sits, and that has also seen significant increase year-over-year. We're very positive about that, because it's a signal that people are engaging in seeking help for their behavioral conditions. And we know that, that entwines very importantly with their ongoing medical costs. But nonetheless, it's an element of elevation. And then as you rightly reiterate, a piece of it is the growth in our value-based lives and the mix of those lives. And by mix, that means complexity mix, as well as geographic mix. And it takes, as I said already today, takes a little bit of time to build up the capabilities to allow us to engage properly with those folks at the level we want to. And we have really have -- we have not held back on doing that, Kevin, and that's really the bulk of the investment during this cycle where we've really lent into building those capabilities in readiness for the next, we hope, many years of serving these individuals higher and higher capability. You know, of course, and I made a comment earlier about re-engineering our cost base. Of course there are changes going on in our cost base across the whole organization, including OptumHealth in response to the change in pricing signals from CMS. But I would put those very much, kind of, secondary to the core elements I've just described. We're in a position obviously where we know exactly what these populations are that we're now looking after. That's been very much the basis of our forward views in terms of how we're starting to lay out for \u201824, \u201825, \u201826. And we feel very confident about our ability not only to grow as an organization, but to continue to strengthen margins back into the zone that you've historically been used to. Thanks so much, Kevin, for that and next question? Sarah, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dan Kueter, who looks after our commercial insurance business to answer that. Thanks so much, Don. Next question, please? Hey, David, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Roger Connor, who's our new CEO of OptumInsight to respond, Roger? That's great. And I wonder whether Dan Schumacher, who's been very heavily involved in our various health systems partnerships, might just want to reflect a little bit on the question obviously was around pro-health, but rather than talking specifically, maybe just share a few thoughts about the overall evolution of those health system profiles and how they play out over the first couple of years. Dan, appreciate it and thanks so much for the question. Next question, please. Ann, thanks so much for the question. I mean, I think honestly it's just way too early for us to be able to see anything like that, just in terms of, you know, obviously the weight loss indications are only just really coming into play. We haven't really been able to see, I'd say, anything from that perspective yet. And as I said earlier, the real focus for us right now is to try and figure out a way in which we can get to a position where the affordability of this class puts it in a zone where, you know, the people who need it can get it and can afford it. Nothing more to say on that, honestly. Next question, please? So thanks very much for the question. I'll ask Dr. Amar Desai, who leads our OptumHealth Organization, just to comment a little bit on the, kind of, shape of the folks we look after there, and the degree to which they come from both UHC and obviously many of our external partners, Amar? Amar, thank you. And thank you for the question. Jennifer, I'd say the last question now please. Hey, Lance. Thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Spilker, who leads our Community and State business to respond to that, Tim? Tim, thanks so much. And thank all of you for your time this morning. I hope what you heard during today's call only reinforces what you've come to expect from UnitedHealth Group, an organization that's just as nimble and agile as it is focused and disciplined, always growing, always innovating, ceaselessly committed to our mission and deeply devoted to those we share. Thank you for your attention today and we appreciate it."

            "content": "Thank you. As Andrew said, our customers, payers, employers, people we serve are concerned about the prices of GLP-1s as set by manufacturers. OptumRx will continue to negotiate lower prices through discounts over time, be transparent with our customers, and implement clinical evidence-based guidelines so the right people get appropriate medicines. And as you alluded to, Lisa, obesity and cardiometabolic disease is a major public issue -- health issue in the U.S. and across all of [Oxfam] (ph), we are developing and implementing comprehensive solutions of which medicines are only a part of on behalf of our clients and people we serve to drive better health outcomes for all and value to the health system. Yes, so as we interact with our clients, employers, payers, and others, on this, first I'll note, a recent survey came out, approximately 90% of those clients are satisfied with their PBM. They're also satisfied with the level of transparency. Specifically for OptumRx, we will continue to innovate and provide additional solutions to our clients that are comprehensive, integrated and transparent. I'll call out one other area, transparency to the consumer. This has been a journey for us that we continue to drive transparency to the consumer. To call out one example with Price Edge, a product recently launched, that's providing consumers the most affordable medicine at the point of care. We are seeing millions of consumers access, use this tool as we provide it to them. And so you'll continue to see us to drive consumer transparency and innovative solutions to our clients."

            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you, Dirk. The growth we reported today is a direct result of investments made over many years to develop and connect the diverse health capabilities needed to serve the people, who rely on us each day, while also creating the foundational capacity to serve millions more in the years ahead. This capability development has long been in the making, and it's still very much underway as the opportunities to serve more people, more deeply continue to expand. Before reviewing our business results, I'll offer a few brief comments on care activity. Care patterns remain consistent with the view we shared during the second quarter, with activity levels still led by outpatient care for seniors, and still most notably in the orthopedic and cardiac procedure categories. These trends remain stable at the levels we previously described. As we've noted, our outlook assumes these activity levels persist throughout next year. We continuously monitor a broad spectrum of patient acuity levels and have yet to see any other notable changes. For example, within oncology, the average stage at which we are first seeing cancer diagnosis remains consistent with historical patterns. As always, we remain diligent in looking for changes to the underlying health of patients. With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. Revenues of $92.4 billion grew by 14% over the prior year, with double-digit growth again at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum Health revenues grew by 29% approaching $24 billion, driven by an increase in the number of care services we offer and patients we serve, especially for those with complex care needs. Operating margins continue to reflect the initial clinical engagement activities that support the strong growth in patients we have realized this year, as well as the higher care activity patterns we have discussed. OptumRx revenues grew by 14%, approaching $29 billion, driven by the strength in our pharmacy care services offerings, as well as new customer wins. Script growth of nearly 7% reflects customer response to our innovative solutions, which focus on choice and lowest net cost. OptumInsight revenues grew by 35% to $5 billion. Revenue backlog of over $31 billion increased by more than $7 billion, in part due to the change healthcare combination. In addition, we recently announced a partnership to provide revenue cycle, analytics, and information technology services to a health system serving more than 400,000 people in the Midwest. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, our commercial business added nearly 700,000 people through the third quarter. Further, selling season indications are tracking favorably, particularly in national accounts. So as \u201824 begins, we expect to grow to serve an additional 1 million people with commercial benefits. Within our public sector programs, we expect growth of nearly 1 million Medicare Advantage members this year. And looking to the year ahead, we're encouraged by the consumer value, stability, and breadth of our offerings. And as always, we start with an expectation that we will outpace overall market growth. Our Medicaid performance remains strong as we support people and families through the redeterminations process. Our teams are really leaning in, speaking with 1,000s of consumers each day. Through a comprehensive Outreach Program, we are helping people navigate the process and connecting them with the resources they need to retain or reinstate their health benefits or to help them find other affordable coverages. A significant majority of the people we engage with are able to retain or reinstate their coverage. Our capital capacities remain strong. For the first nine months of the year, adjusted cash flows from operations were at $22.4 billion or 1.3 times net income. And in that same timeframe, we returned over $11.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As noted, given the strength of our business performance, this morning we have updated our \u201823 outlook for adjusted earnings to $24.85 to $25 per share. And as we finish strongly in \u201823 and look forward to \u201824, we're intensely focused on execution, while further expanding our capacity to serve more people, more deeply, and building the foundations to support our growth objectives for years to come. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew. Good morning, Justin. So, overall, I'd call it broadly consistent with our expectations in terms of the third quarter. So a few things I'd like to highlight though. So care patterns were, as we discussed, focused again on outpatients, outpatient activity with seniors, those continue at the levels we described during the second quarter. And that's what really drove a lot of kind of the activity throughout the quarter. It's still in those categories that we have been focused on. The sequential move that you see from second quarter to third quarter is largely a seasonal factor. As you know well, there's always less care activity in a third quarter, that has to do just with vacations, a lot of the elements that go in there in terms of certain types of discretionary care, seasonal illnesses, so typical patterns, and also Part-D patterns that you see on a regular basis. In fact, if you go back to the years prior to 2020, 3Q would typically be the lowest care ratio quarter. So I'd say it's probably more typical than not, just getting back to periods that were more normalized in terms of the activities that we saw going on there. We continue to expect our full-year medical care ratio to be toward the upper end of our initial 82.6 plus minus 50 basis point range. So very consistent with the level that we set out there back again in the two quarter that would be toward the upper end of that outlook. So -- and then the seasonal factors in the 3Q, that some of those things influencing where you'd expect to be in that fourth quarter, the final quarter of the calendar year. Certainly utilization, Part-D impacts, they move the other direction in a fourth quarter. So typical in that. That's amplified, of course, very much by the deductible wear off features that you see in a fourth quarter, influenza, RSV, all those patterns that come in. So we'd expect that to move the other direction here as we go into the 4Q."

And we have a unique opportunity to really be able to address some of those near-term challenges, while at the same time provide some capacity for future evolution of the system as they think about more digital capacities, greater outpatient catchment, as well as further engagement. So those are some of the things that we can help unlock for them and their migration to value-based care. So we're encouraged by the portfolio. It continues to grow. Actually, from the initial scope nine out of 10 have expanded from their initial scope. So continuing to grow, we're in the early days, and we see a lot of opportunity ahead of us."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earning reports section of the company\u2019s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 14, 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, and good morning. And thank you all for joining us. As we discussed a number of weeks ago during the quarter, we saw a somewhat higher than usual range of movement in certain areas of care activity. As you'd expect, this inevitably impacted some elements of our business, but we overcame these dynamics with strength in other areas. Our second quarter performance reflects the capabilities, agility, and dedication of our people as they responded to the changes. As a team, we're confident in our ability to robustly grow in this fluid healthcare environment. Indeed, as I hope you saw in our release today, revenue growth in the quarter was strong and well balanced across our enterprise increasing by more than $12 billion to nearly $93 billion. Let me provide a few highlights of our growth. First, the number of patients served by OptumHealth under fully accountable value-based care arrangements grew by more than 900,000 over this time last year. Among the new patients we welcomed, a significant number have complex needs. These people have serious health challenges, limited economic resources and often living communities where it can be difficult to access high quality care. Our ability to support their needs is distinctive and a direct result of the investments we have made to provide coordinated and comprehensive medical, pharmacy, and behavioral care, foundational capabilities that will help the patients we serve live healthier lives and drive growth far into the future. OptumRx and OptumInsight revenue grew double-digits on expanded capabilities and products that are generating new sales and opportunities. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s growth was strong and diversified as well. Today, we're serving nearly 1.6 million more people in our commercial and public sector program offerings than we did last year. This durable growth driven by our colleagues relentless focus on quality and execution enabled us to achieve second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.14 and to strengthen our full-year outlook to between $24.70 to $25 per share. We know there is great interest in understanding the recent care activity I just mentioned. So I'll give you an overview of how we're seeing care plans progress and how we're responding. I do want to underscore the most critical point first: making high quality care more affordable and accessible is at the core of our mission. Having more people obtaining the care they need is a positive trend for individuals and our health system and society. As we discussed several weeks ago, during the second quarter, we observed increased care patents, notably in outpatient surgeries for seniors and especially with certain orthopedic procedures, which may have been postponed. John will provide some additional detail on this later. As we look to 2024, we have developed compelling Medicare Advantage offerings. Our teams were, of course, thoughtful, both in our response to the CMS rate notice and in incorporating these care activity trends into our June benefit filings. Even in this challenging funding environment, we continue to prioritize the stability and affordability our members have come to rely on from UnitedHealthcare. We're confident that next year we will once again grow at a pace exceeding that of the broader market. While of a much lesser impact than senior outpatient care, we also are seeing increased care activity in behavioral. Over the past few years, behavioral care patterns have been accelerating as people increasingly feel comfortable seeking services. Just since last year, the percentage of people who are accessing behavioral care has increased by double-digits. From our perspective, it\u2019s an encouraging sign that more people are seeking help. Yet the ongoing shortage of qualified care providers has caused significant access challenges. To address the issue, OptumHealth has expanded its network by 10s of 1,000s of care professionals this year. And we are developing our benefit offerings, assuming demand for behavioral care services will continue to rise. OptumHealth\u2019s value-based care models are continuing to deliver especially strong and measurable results for people. Today serving more than 4 million patients and dozens of payers. OptumHealth and the patients and payers it serves share a common desire to seek improved health outcomes and experiences, while ultimately lowering the cost of care. And we're pleased to see more evidence supporting the efficacy of value-based care. Last month, researchers at Yale Medicine working in collaboration with Optum published a peer reviewed study about in-home visits, an important element in our value-based care approach. The study found patients who received our in-home preventative wellness assessments, compared with those who hadn't made fewer emergency department visits and spent fewer nights in hospitals across four common conditions: depression, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and Type 2 diabetes. They also experienced reduced wait times for follow-up primary Care. Yale Medicine\u2019s research follows another peer reviewed study published in JAMA in December, which found Medicare Advantage patients in Optum's fully accountable care model showed significantly better health outcomes, compared to people in Medicare fee for service. OptumHealth patients fared better on each of eight key metrics: including hospital readmissions and emergency department visits. We see these results as compelling validation of the value-based care approach and signal more strongly its promise and potential, as we expand these care models to many millions more patients in the years ahead. I'll now turn it over to UnitedHealth Group, President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to elaborate on how we're focusing on affordability, transparency, and simplicity for the people we serve. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Thanks Andrew. Making high quality care, more affordable and more accessible is what we do. So it is really great to see people getting the care they need, especially as our teams are working to build more capacity and our benefit networks and care delivery resources to accommodate consumers' evolving needs. Affordability is vital. For far too many people, cost remains the most significant barrier to high quality care. We are leaning in hard on behalf of consumers, employers, and health plans to lower out of pocket costs and drive greater affordability throughout the system. As you heard from Andrew, recently we've seen an uptick in outpatient surgeries. Finding the most appropriate site of service is crucial, because the cost of those procedures can differ dramatically depending upon where they are performed. Overall, evidence shows that comparable procedures performed in ambulatory surgery centers cost about half as much as traditional settings with comparable outcomes. For consumers, that translates into many 100 of dollars in out of pocket cost savings for just a single procedure. And the patient satisfaction levels at our centers are among the highest in healthcare with NPS approaching 90. Also high on our affordability agenda is continuing to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Our customers including employers, unions, health plans and governments count on us to help them access the most effective medicines at the lowest possible cost. In fact, pharmacy benefit managers like ours are the only link in the drug supply chain whose main purpose is to improve affordability for everyone. We go further by recommending benefit designs and providing tools to help consumers navigate their options and find the best value for their prescription. A recently launched feature called Price Edge, which provides the lowest cost option for a patient's medication. Already has delivered millions of dollars in customer out of pocket savings. Especially drug cost continue to be a focus of every customer OptumRx works with. Our differentiated approach to specialty is designed to serve the unique needs of patients, payers, providers, and pharma partners and has allowed us to greatly expand our access to limited distribution drugs. We work to tailor our programs with individualized single point of contact care for rare disease and clinical excellence programs for conditions such as MS, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Clients working with OptumRx, who implement all our specialty medication management programs can save up to 20% on the specialty drug cost. Most related to specialty biosimilars are another area where we are helping drive affordability and consumer choice. Earlier this year, we began offering Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira at parity ensuring patients and their doctors have more options to choose from when deciding on a course of care. Recently OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare announced the addition of two new Humira biosimilars, Cyltezo and Hyrimoz to our standard prescription drug list also at parry. This increased competition for the innovator drug will result in double-digit savings for our customers. You might also recall that a year ago, we announced our initiative to offer lifesaving drugs at no cost to our customers. This benefit is available to everyone in UnitedHealthcare's Group fully insured commercial plans and has been adopted by more than 500 of our self-funded customers, increasing adherence, and saving people millions of dollars. Finally, another important customer innovation that is making the health system simpler is Optum Financial\u2019s integrated card, which enables seamless access to benefits, programs, and rewards for more than 13 million consumers, who have been issued the card since we broadly rolled it out at the start of the year. Adoption and satisfaction levels have been very strong, make it much simpler for seniors to navigate the system and understand their benefits and creating a more satisfying consumer experience. These and many other results are validating our strategic approach to healthcare. I know from my many meetings with customers that these affordability, transparency, and simplicity initiatives are resonating. They are a key reason for our continued growth in a highly competitive environment and for our confidence in maintaining our momentum as we look ahead. With that, let me hand it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. Adaptability and delivering greater value for the people we serve continue as foundational elements for our enterprise. These last few months are a good example, identifying evolving market trends; moving quickly to help people get the care they need; incorporating our broad and multifaceted insights into planning and importantly delivering on our commitments to you, our shareholders. These traits underpin our confidence not only in achieving our goals for \u201823, but also as we look toward \u201824 and beyond. Before reviewing our business results, let me elaborate on the care patterns Andrew described earlier. To illustrate in the second quarter, outpatient care activity among seniors was a few 100 basis points above our expectations. As we've highlighted, specific orthopedic and cardiac procedures had increased its far above that level of variation. And as we developed and filed our 2024 Medicare Advantage offerings, we assume that these levels of heightened care activity will persist throughout next year. Overall care activity among our Medicaid and commercial populations is consistent with our expectations. As always, we continue to intensely analyze trends that may indicate more severe disease progression, which could point to rising acuity. For example, in areas such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, we see no such evidence, while continuing to monitor closely. With that, let's turn to out second quarter results. Revenue of $92.9 billion, grew by nearly $12.6 billion or 16% over the prior year with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. OptumHealth revenues grew by 36% to $23.9 billion, driven by an increase in the number of patients served, a growing mix of patients with more complex needs and the expanding scope of care services we can offer. Operating margins reflect the higher care activity patterns we have discussed with seniors comprising a significant majority of value-based patients served. OptumRx revenues grew by 15%, surpassing $28 billion, driven by continued new customer wins and strong double-digit growth across our specialty, infusion, and community pharmacies. Script growth of nearly 7% reflects continued demand for our affordable solutions that give customers choice and simplify the pharmacy experience, such as biosimilar access and digital pharmacy tools. Part way into the \u201824 selling season, this momentum continues with strong client additions. OptumInsight revenues grew 42% to nearly $4.7 billion. The revenue backlog reached over $31 billion, an increase of $8 billion over last year, in part due to the addition of Change Healthcare. The integration and investment activities discussed on previous calls have gone well and are setting the stage for the next phase of growth for OptumInsight. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Our commercial business added nearly 500,000 people in the first-half and continues its growth with the \u201824 selling season indications tracking favorably. Within our public sector programs, we continue to expect growth of over 900,000 Medicare Advantage members this year. And our Medicaid performance remains strong, as we continue to support states as they initiate redeterminations. Comprehensive outreach efforts to help individuals retain coverage are underway though it is still early as most states began this work only recently. Our capital capacities are strong. Adjusted cash flows from operations were at $10.4 billion or nearly 2 times net income in the second quarter and $15.6 billion or nearly 1.4 times net income in the first-half. In the first six 6 months of this year, we returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and in June, our Board of Directors increased the dividend by 14%. As Andrew mentioned, based upon our growth outlook and the trends discussed, today we were able to strengthen and narrow our full-year \u201823 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.70 to $25 per share. Within this, we expect a relatively balanced pacing in the second-half. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: John, thank you. Overall, for UnitedHealth Group, looking to the second-half of the year and into 2024 and beyond. We're confident that we're capturing the current landscape in our planning decisions, which in turn gives us confidence in our ability to sustain the growth momentum shown in our first-half and continue to demonstrate the adaptability, performance, and mission-driven purpose of this enterprise, especially in evolving environments. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator: The floor is now opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe I appreciate the comments about what you're seeing in the care demand. Maybe on the OptumHealth side, if you guys, obviously top line continues to be very strong there. There's a little bit of margin degradation from first quarter to second quarter? How much of that relates to what you're describing around senior utilization? I know you've got a capitated component and you've got a free for service component. But I think last quarter you also said that the growth in membership would be something that would pressure margin short-term, but obviously be a long-term positive? And then there's a lot of other things in OptumHealth. Are they helping or hurting margin? Give us a little bit of flavor for what's happening underneath the aggregate number.\nAndrew Witty: A.J., thanks so much for the question. So first off, let me start off, I'm super pleased with the performance of OptumHealth overall. And when you look at the growth of that business and particularly the expansion of the number of patients who we're now looking after in value based arrangements now about 4 million folks, but not just from UAC, but of course, from many other payors as well, really strong validation of the model that we've been building and you can continue to see us extend that. In terms of the margin compression during the Q really I'd say there are a couple of dynamics to that. One, is trend and you\u2019d very much echo in the senior trend comments you've heard us make earlier in the quarter and I think is well understood. A second element of that which specifically affects OptumHealth is the behavioral growth. And I mentioned that in my prepared comments A.J., around continued strong growth in behavioral. That certainly has played its part within Q2 for OptumHealth. And then the third area is a kind of, a good news story, but with short-term implication. So that's really the growth of the membership that's coming this year. As you know, we've grown very strongly this year, actually a little ahead of our expectations. We've also brought in a very significant number of complex patients as we invest in helping those folks manage their care better, that puts a little pressure on the margin in the short run. But that's really laying super strong foundation stones, not just 4 million as we move through the year, but into \u201824, \u201825, \u201826. So those three elements, the senior trend piece, the behavioral piece, and then the effect of the strong growth is really what explains what goes on. We're going to continue to lean into that growth very assertively. A.J, thanks so much.\nA.J. Rice: Alright.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to understand when I think about the guide to the upper end for the full-year MLR. How much of that is driven by this MA outpatient trend versus behavioral? And when I think about behavioral utilization, is that being driven by a particular population, or is it more broad-based? And, you know, how do I just think about behavioral as a percentage of your cost?\nAndrew Witty: So Lisa, thanks so very much for that. Let me ask John to just context for you a little bit the balance between the senior and behavioral. And then maybe ask Dr. Decker to just give you a little bit of commentary around the type of consultation that we're dealing with in terms of the growth.\nJohn Rex: Lisa, good morning, it's John. So in terms of your question, the majority of the guide to the upper end of the full-year is driven by what we've described in terms of the activity, the care activity we're seeing amongst the seniors in outpatient, so that's the core there. In terms of behavioral, what we've noticed in behavioral is an increase in the number of people accessing care. Andrew have this in his comments, but a very, very significant increase even just since a year ago in terms of the number of people that are looking to access care, it\u2019s a great thing, we are planning on that continuing. We don't see why that trend slows down, so we're designing our benefits for that to continue. As you recall, I know Lisa, behavioral resides within OptumHealth, and so that's a kind of an impact that we'd see in that component. And Wyatt, maybe some other commentary?\nWyatt Decker: Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Lisa. So you asked about the types of consultations and care being provided within behavioral. And we're seeing across the board increasing utilization, but what's encouraging from a public health perspective is it isn't strictly young people. It's across the board. We're seeing 30, 40, 50-year old accessing behavioral healthcare for needed care for conditions like anxiety, depression, substance use disorder. And our commitment is to make sure that they have access to that care. So as you heard from Andrew earlier, we've expanded our behavioral healthcare network and we also a couple of years ago very thoughtfully launched a behavioral care provider services and we now have ambulatory services available in 37 states, and we have self-paced modules for things like anxiety and depression and we add a therapist as appropriate. So you'll see us continuing to make sure our members have access, as well as providing innovative scalable solutions for behavioral healthcare needs across the age spectrum. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Wyatt, thank you so much. So, Lisa, I think you got it there. Overall, it\u2019s very much around the senior trend phenomena. Within OptumHealth, that the behavioral piece plays its part we see that very much as an area where we will continue to step up and make sure that we're delivering the care in the way that Wyatt just described to you. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. John, you mentioned the balance pacing of EPS in the back half of the year between 3Q and 4Q. Could you talk about your expectations for MCR, specifically between the two quarters? And how are you thinking about the trend of care activity as we head into the back half of the year given what you're seeing with respect to demand, as well as some of the supply bottlenecks that took care being delivered maybe being removed? And do those factors differ significantly between Medicare and the commercial or Medicaid lines of business? Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Nate, good morning. Thanks for the question. Yes, in terms of the balance pacing, the way I describe that is -- and MCR and how that feeds in, we'd expect the MCR to be a little bit lower in the 3Q than we saw in the 2Q, some of that seasonality, as you would fully expect. So within the contexting of balance, expect earnings to be a little bit higher marginally in 3Q than 4Q, because of that typical factor in there, and thinking of an MCR somewhere in the zone of between, kind of, what we saw in the 1Q and 2Q just by seasonality factor. Important in that is we expect the, kind of, general pacing of care activity to remain consistent. That's what we've actually been seeing here. So since we've talked about this and as we've looked at the level of care activity across the company, these elements we talked about in terms of senior outpatient care are really remaining stable at the levels we talk to. And our expectation is it continues in that level. So as you look out to the second-half of this year, our expectation, it continues at those levels that we've been seeing with the -- I mentioned a few 100 basis points above our expectations in the senior business, that continues. The only underlying factor is a little bit of seasonality that you would see occurring there.\nAndrew Witty: Right. Thanks so much John and thanks Nate. Next question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. My question is on commercial trend. That you mentioned it's in line with expectations. I wanted to delve a little bit deeper. I think you might have said previously that you'd priced for commercial trend to be above normal this year, so some conservatism. So does that mean that it's running above normal, but in line with your pricing at this point? If it's above normal, can you tell us how Q2 emerged versus Q4, Q1, meaning that an uptick versus -- in 2Q versus 1Q or 4Q? And then just lastly, any insight on the commercial components, is outpatient at pressure here as well? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Justin, thanks so much for the question. I mean, so really not much to see here in all honesty, first off. Where we came into the year, we -- as you alluded to, we priced for some anticipation of unit cost inflation. We've seen some of that come through. Within that, everything is tracking very much within our expectations. So we set the year anticipating a little bit of price/cost growth, if you will. But beyond that, really nothing to note and we feel good about where we sit here. Thanks so much. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. SO good morning. Do you think any of the increased utilization you're seeing on the MA side was self-inflicted in the sense that you've really augmented benefits dramatically in the last year -- really last two years, and perhaps that's encouraged or even catalyzed, sort of, an overutilization of trends relative to historical patterns and expectations? And then how did you address the utilization trends in your benefit designs for \u201824? I know there's sensitivity about saying something on a public call, but maybe just broad changes that you'd expected?\nAndrew Witty: Josh, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Noel to give you a little bit more commentary. But I think bottom line, I don't really think the benefits are driving this. I think this is -- when you look at the concentration of what we're seeing in terms of the outpatients, the orthopedics, in particular, those sorts of areas, it looks very much more like a kind of deferment of care. Super interesting when you look at maybe what's changed a little bit within that. We've seen a shift in the fraction of people who, once they have been essentially recommended for surgery, actually go through, and complete the procedure. Arguably, what might drive that change is, one, more supply. So actually, it's more possible to go get it done; but two, maybe a little less reticent from an individual to go into a facility in a post-COVID environment versus a COVID environment. That feels like the thing that's shifted. And maybe ask Tim to just add a little bit to that as well, Tim?\nTim Noel: Yes. Thanks, Josh. Consistent with what Andrew said, when we look at potential drivers everything from acuity to benefits added to mix of membership. Everything is really tracking very normally and in line with what we would expect. So nothing to call out there, but certainly something that we look at closely and carefully each and every year, and this year being no different. With respect to your question regarding benefits, so I think one thing to keep in mind is that the more important driver to our benefit decisions this year were the changes to the risk model. Certainly, we've been talking a lot about care patterns, but that has far less of an impact on the benefits filed and is really one of many assumptions that we make inside of our bids. But we feel very confident in our ability to provide stability to the benefits that seniors value most, things like zero co-pays for primary care visits, zero co-pays for Tier 1 drugs. Keeping zero monthly planned premiums where we had them in the past and keeping level out of pocket maximums are very important things for benefits for stability. And we are able to preserve those, so we're really happy about that. So on balance, combined with the great momentum we see in our value proposition, the great partnerships we have and confidence from the broker community, we feel really good about the benefits we filed. And also, as we talked about in our opening remarks, really confident in seeing that momentum pull through into some great growth results next year.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks so much. And Josh, thanks very much for the question. Next questions?\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, a question on the commercial side of the business. Can you talk a little bit about membership and in the fee-based business being down? And also may be related to that and your outlook going forward, in Medicaid redetermination, are you seeing any trends with respect to recapture of those sorts of members? Or anything that's driving the opportunity for either growth in membership or maybe you're seeing in-account attrition due to weakness in the economy? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Lance, thanks so much for the question. Before I hand it to Dan Kueter, who looks after our E&I business, I just want to make a couple of kind of high-level comments. We're seeing overall a very strong performance from our commercial business this year and also setting up, it feels like very well for the \u201824 season. We've seen fantastic overall growth, as I mentioned, in terms of membership. And that's been led very much by a lot of the product innovation that the team have been putting together and into the marketplace. And we see that continuing pretty assertively as we roll into \u201824. Just with that kind of backdrop, maybe, Dan, if you could respond to Lance's specific questions, that would be great.\nDan Kueter: Yes, Lance, thanks for the question. Growth is on track for the full-year. And what you see in Q2 really is represented by the contraction of one large customer in our fee-based business. Your question about attrition and redeterminations, the outcome of those, which will be some puts and takes, will probably determine where within our range we will fall. But the punch line is, we're on track to hit our range for this year. Thanks for the question, Lance.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks, Dan. Thanks so much, Lance, for the questions. And just to be super clear as well that client loss that Dan just referred to, we knew about that about a year ago very much within our expectations and forecast plan. It was something we were anticipating and makes no impact at all to our full-year expectation. But thanks so much for the question. And next questions, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I just want to follow-up on the OptumHealth, because the margin there was obviously pressured in the quarter. And I just want to understand how the margin normalization -- how should we think about that over the next couple of years. I mean, you can -- on the MA side, you can reprice for things. It sounds like you saw it in time for your bids and costs have come in line with the way that you price. Maybe just confirm that piece first. But then since within OptumHealth, you're also relying on other providers and how they price for 2024. How are you thinking about the market? If you're below target this year? Is this something you can get back to next year or just a multi-year thing depending on how others price? Are the leverage within your control or is this kind of a longer-term normalization? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Kevin, thanks so much for the question. So first off, as I mentioned earlier, the pressure is really coming from those three sources, the senior trend phenomenon that we talked a lot about, the very specific Optum piece around behavioral and then the growth in the book. And within that, very much to complex care patient, which, as I'm going to repeat again, is an extremely positive element of our growth going forward. That's going to be an extraordinarily important foundation stone for the future of the company. We're going to continue to lean into that growth, first and foremost. We do expect to see margins continue to strengthen, particularly as you roll through into \u201824. You're absolutely right. We believe we've caught this in our pricing for next year. But more importantly, the longer time we have to look after folks and wrap around care, we can deliver much better outcomes for them, as we talked about earlier and we can also make the economic proposition better. It really builds much more sustainable capability. So all of that will kick in, as well as we roll through subsequent quarters and years. This is going to be a continuing building pressure. I feel very good about that range we've laid out for OptumHealth over the next several years. And actually, I think if I had the choice on a slightly suppressed margin in Q2 or the very significant growth that we've taken in. I'll take the growth all day long. And I'll take that growth, because it's going to underpin years of growth going forward. Appreciate the question, Kevin. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I just want to talk about some of the -- or ask about some of the levers and offset, because it is a little counterintuitive to hear the commentary intra-quarter about higher MLR and then seeing your largest profit segment, OptumHealth, with lower margin. So this quarter, obviously, investment income was far stronger The Street was looking for, at least versus our model G&A, was better. But I know moving into the back half, I think you believe there's more time potentially to pull some of those G&A levers. So could you just talk about investment income, G&A or what other offsets there might be in the back half? And how much of that is carrying forward into your \u201824 thinking at this point?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Very much appreciate the question. Let me ask John to make some comments to that. John?\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Gary, it's John. So yes, you're right. Those investment income has frankly, been growing strongly over the past number of quarters and continues to grow. Some of that is the backdrop of the rising interest rate environment, as you know, very well. Some of that is also a result of very active management by our treasury teams in terms of deploying more and more cash balances into interest-bearing accounts and such as they've been working hard at that over the past few quarters and advancing the productivity of that cash. That's after coming off of a period of many years of a zero interest rate environment. So a lot of elements in that. In any given quarter, we can experience some gains from our -- in our investment portfolio. So that can be gained from -- anything from our regular fixed income investments to anything from our diverse venture holdings. And so those come in -- they come in at different points in time. And perhaps sometimes they're a little bit less predictable, but kind of are typically in a similar zone frankly, not outside. I don't expect those, kind of, things, I don't count on those kind of things, frankly, every quarter. That's not the thing we look at. But there are elements that we've seen over time in kind of the zones that we're experiencing even now, too. So, yes, thanks, Gary.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. And maybe I'll ask Dirk to also comment a little bit. As you think about the G&A side of the equation going forward. Dirk maybe reflect a little bit on the work you're leading around technology and other interventions as we look to drive down our overall costs.\nDirk McMahon: Yes. Gary, what I would say is much of the focus -- we've really been applying a lot of artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing. Long-term, we think there's great hope for those. And some of the short-term things that we're working on in those areas, like using generative AI to help more efficiently write medical appeal letters, things like optimizing our provider search and all of our digital properties with natural language processing and AI, doing a lot of work, improving our payment integrity models, using AI to detect waste, fraud, and abuse. And then a lot in the G&A world to answer basic questions in our call centers, like leveraging our benefit bots to reduce the number of calls and the labor associated with that, for simple questions like is x, y, or z disease covered or have I met my deductible. From a long range perspective, however, I'm really optimistic about our significant data sets. Our ability to take advantage of whatever new technology comes down the pipe to improve health care, I'm really excited about it. So thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Dirk, thanks so much. And I think, Gary, overall, and I think I tried to allude at the very beginning. Obviously, when you see a movement in care activity like we saw in the quarter, it's been great to see the range of levers that we have within the organization to respond. And you've seen what we've been able to do in the very short run. And as you would expect that we have more and more of those levers as you roll through into the medium and longer-term outlooks as both John and Dirk have described both in the financial side of the company, but also critically in the core operating cost structure of the company, which we're going to continue to bear down on very, very assertively. Consequence of all of that is that even with the backdrop of some of the fluidity we've seen. We're able to continue to commit to the investment behind growth and the investment behind looking after patients, as well as we possibly can and giving people a fantastic experience, which is what we think builds super sustainable shareholder value. So that's very much the priority that we're focused on. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess, John, I want to talk a little bit more about your expectations for the senior book in \u201824. You guys kind of talked about that you expect the current elevated trend to continue and price for it when you think about the MA bids. I guess, kind of talk about like what drove, like what drives the visibility there from what you see now in ortho, like looking all the way out to \u201824. And should we think of the pricing is just kind of conservatism on UNH's part? Or like I'm kind of interested in the data that drives the visibility? Thank you\nAndrew Witty: Hey George, thanks for the question. I'm actually going to ask Tim Noel, who leads the Medicare business to respond to that, Tim?\nTim Noel: Thanks, George, for the question. So I'll start by reiterating one thing as an important point. The biggest item though shaping this year has been -- thinking was around the risk model changes. The outpatient care patterns plays a far smaller role there. But that said, having the ability to incorporate the latest data, anything we've learned recently into our Medicare Advantage bids is extremely important in each and every year especially given how we see both key revenue and medical elements firm up inside of Q2, being able to incorporate the latest thinking that we have in our bid filings is really, really important. And because of that, we've designed a bid process that is very nimble and able to accommodate late changes. This year, out of respect for a developing trend, we made the assumption that some of these early indications that we are seeing in the outpatient care patterns we have talked about would remain durable. And as we sit here today, as John has talked about, these assumptions have validated and they've also stabilized. And we feel confident that we've made the appropriate accommodations inside of our 2024 bids for all of this. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks so much. Jenifer, we have time for one last question. So, let\u2019s take the last question. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, all. Thanks. I was hoping maybe you could drill a little bit just into the announcement of the Amedisys acquisition. And maybe in particular, just talk about, sort of, strategy for ramping up the exposure here given the tough near-term reimbursement environment for home health? And then maybe some early thoughts around some of the integrations or synergies that you could generate from integrating Amedisys in LHCG together? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Scott, thanks so much for the question. Well, first of all, we're obviously very pleased to have come to an agreement on the transaction with Amedisys, so we appreciate that. But as you'd expect, it's -- we're now in the very early stages of that process. It wouldn't be appropriate to talk about anything specific in that regard. If I just take it maybe a level higher, it's no secret that we are very strong believers in the value of home health and no secret that we believe that value -- home health capabilities, when combined with other activities in terms of wrapping care around patients, is a really important element of future value-based care, particularly as you speak towards complex patients, many of whom maybe struggle to get out of the home, maybe don't have quite the same kind of relationship with the clinic as you might often expect. So we do think that the general area is an important area. As I said, as far as the specifics are concerned, I think we're now -- we'll go through our -- the regular kind of process, and we'll update you as appropriate, but probably not much more to say today. Thanks so much, Scott, for the question. And thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. We very much appreciate your time. And we hope you take away from this call our confidence in our ability to continue to perform and grow strongly, while we pursue our mission and build the foundations for continued growth in 2024 and beyond. And we are very much looking forward to sharing more on our progress with you again in October. Thanks so much for your time this morning.\nOperator: This does concludes today's conference.

            "name": "Dirk McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks Andrew. Making high quality care, more affordable and more accessible is what we do. So it is really great to see people getting the care they need, especially as our teams are working to build more capacity and our benefit networks and care delivery resources to accommodate consumers' evolving needs. Affordability is vital. For far too many people, cost remains the most significant barrier to high quality care. We are leaning in hard on behalf of consumers, employers, and health plans to lower out of pocket costs and drive greater affordability throughout the system. As you heard from Andrew, recently we've seen an uptick in outpatient surgeries. Finding the most appropriate site of service is crucial, because the cost of those procedures can differ dramatically depending upon where they are performed. Overall, evidence shows that comparable procedures performed in ambulatory surgery centers cost about half as much as traditional settings with comparable outcomes. For consumers, that translates into many 100 of dollars in out of pocket cost savings for just a single procedure. And the patient satisfaction levels at our centers are among the highest in healthcare with NPS approaching 90. Also high on our affordability agenda is continuing to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Our customers including employers, unions, health plans and governments count on us to help them access the most effective medicines at the lowest possible cost. In fact, pharmacy benefit managers like ours are the only link in the drug supply chain whose main purpose is to improve affordability for everyone. We go further by recommending benefit designs and providing tools to help consumers navigate their options and find the best value for their prescription. A recently launched feature called Price Edge, which provides the lowest cost option for a patient's medication. Already has delivered millions of dollars in customer out of pocket savings. Especially drug cost continue to be a focus of every customer OptumRx works with. Our differentiated approach to specialty is designed to serve the unique needs of patients, payers, providers, and pharma partners and has allowed us to greatly expand our access to limited distribution drugs. We work to tailor our programs with individualized single point of contact care for rare disease and clinical excellence programs for conditions such as MS, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Clients working with OptumRx, who implement all our specialty medication management programs can save up to 20% on the specialty drug cost. Most related to specialty biosimilars are another area where we are helping drive affordability and consumer choice. Earlier this year, we began offering Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira at parity ensuring patients and their doctors have more options to choose from when deciding on a course of care. Recently OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare announced the addition of two new Humira biosimilars, Cyltezo and Hyrimoz to our standard prescription drug list also at parry. This increased competition for the innovator drug will result in double-digit savings for our customers. You might also recall that a year ago, we announced our initiative to offer lifesaving drugs at no cost to our customers. This benefit is available to everyone in UnitedHealthcare's Group fully insured commercial plans and has been adopted by more than 500 of our self-funded customers, increasing adherence, and saving people millions of dollars. Finally, another important customer innovation that is making the health system simpler is Optum Financial's integrated card, which enables seamless access to benefits, programs, and rewards for more than 13 million consumers, who have been issued the card since we broadly rolled it out at the start of the year. Adoption and satisfaction levels have been very strong, make it much simpler for seniors to navigate the system and understand their benefits and creating a more satisfying consumer experience. These and many other results are validating our strategic approach to healthcare. I know from my many meetings with customers that these affordability, transparency, and simplicity initiatives are resonating. They are a key reason for our continued growth in a highly competitive environment and for our confidence in maintaining our momentum as we look ahead. With that, let me hand it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. Yes. Gary, what I would say is much of the focus -- we've really been applying a lot of artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing. Long-term, we think there's great hope for those. And some of the short-term things that we're working on in those areas, like using generative AI to help more efficiently write medical appeal letters, things like optimizing our provider search and all of our digital properties with natural language processing and AI, doing a lot of work, improving our payment integrity models, using AI to detect waste, fraud, and abuse.

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. And thank you all for joining us. As we discussed a number of weeks ago during the quarter, we saw a somewhat higher than usual range of movement in certain areas of care activity. As you'd expect, this inevitably impacted some elements of our business, but we overcame these dynamics with strength in other areas. Our second quarter performance reflects the capabilities, agility, and dedication of our people as they responded to the changes. As a team, we're confident in our ability to robustly grow in this fluid healthcare environment. Indeed, as I hope you saw in our release today, revenue growth in the quarter was strong and well balanced across our enterprise increasing by more than $12 billion to nearly $93 billion. Let me provide a few highlights of our growth. First, the number of patients served by OptumHealth under fully accountable value-based care arrangements grew by more than 900,000 over this time last year. Among the new patients we welcomed, a significant number have complex needs. These people have serious health challenges, limited economic resources and often living communities where it can be difficult to access high quality care. Our ability to support their needs is distinctive and a direct result of the investments we have made to provide coordinated and comprehensive medical, pharmacy, and behavioral care, foundational capabilities that will help the patients we serve live healthier lives and drive growth far into the future. OptumRx and OptumInsight revenue grew double-digits on expanded capabilities and products that are generating new sales and opportunities. UnitedHealthcare's growth was strong and diversified as well. Today, we're serving nearly 1.6 million more people in our commercial and public sector program offerings than we did last year. This durable growth driven by our colleagues relentless focus on quality and execution enabled us to achieve second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.14 and to strengthen our full-year outlook to between $24.70 to $25 per share. We know there is great interest in understanding the recent care activity I just mentioned. So I'll give you an overview of how we're seeing care plans progress and how we're responding. I do want to underscore the most critical point first: making high quality care more affordable and accessible is at the core of our mission. Having more people obtaining the care they need is a positive trend for individuals and our health system and society. As we discussed several weeks ago, during the second quarter, we observed increased care patents, notably in outpatient surgeries for seniors and especially with certain orthopedic procedures, which may have been postponed. John will provide some additional detail on this later. As we look to 2024, we have developed compelling Medicare Advantage offerings. Our teams were, of course, thoughtful, both in our response to the CMS rate notice and in incorporating these care activity trends into our June benefit filings. Even in this challenging funding environment, we continue to prioritize the stability and affordability our members have come to rely on from UnitedHealthcare. We're confident that next year we will once again grow at a pace exceeding that of the broader market. While of a much lesser impact than senior outpatient care, we also are seeing increased care activity in behavioral. Over the past few years, behavioral care patterns have been accelerating as people increasingly feel comfortable seeking services. Just since last year, the percentage of people who are accessing behavioral care has increased by double-digits. From our perspective, it's an encouraging sign that more people are seeking help. Yet the ongoing shortage of qualified care providers has caused significant access challenges. To address the issue, OptumHealth has expanded its network by 10s of 1,000s of care professionals this year. And we are developing our benefit offerings, assuming demand for behavioral care services will continue to rise. OptumHealth's value-based care models are continuing to deliver especially strong and measurable results for people. Today serving more than 4 million patients and dozens of payers. OptumHealth and the patients and payers it serves share a common desire to seek improved health outcomes and experiences, while ultimately lowering the cost of care. And we're pleased to see more evidence supporting the efficacy of value-based care. Last month, researchers at Yale Medicine working in collaboration with Optum published a peer reviewed study about in-home visits, an important element in our value-based care approach. The study found patients who received our in-home preventative wellness assessments, compared with those who hadn't made fewer emergency department visits and spent fewer nights in hospitals across four common conditions: depression, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and Type 2 diabetes. They also experienced reduced wait times for follow-up primary Care. Yale Medicine's research follows another peer reviewed study published in JAMA in December, which found Medicare Advantage patients in Optum's fully accountable care model showed significantly better health outcomes, compared to people in Medicare fee for service. OptumHealth patients fared better on each of eight key metrics: including hospital readmissions and emergency department visits. We see these results as compelling validation of the value-based care approach and signal more strongly its promise and potential, as we expand these care models to many millions more patients in the years ahead. I'll now turn it over to UnitedHealth Group, President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to elaborate on how we're focusing on affordability, transparency, and simplicity for the people we serve. Dirk? John, thank you. Overall, for UnitedHealth Group, looking to the second-half of the year and into 2024 and beyond. We're confident that we're capturing the current landscape in our planning decisions, which in turn gives us confidence in our ability to sustain the growth momentum shown in our first-half and continue to demonstrate the adaptability, performance, and mission-driven purpose of this enterprise, especially in evolving environments. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please. A.J., thanks so much for the question. So first off, let me start off, I'm super pleased with the performance of OptumHealth overall. And when you look at the growth of that business and particularly the expansion of the number of patients who we're now looking after in value based arrangements now about 4 million folks, but not just from UAC, but of course, from many other payors as well, really strong validation of the model that we've been building and you can continue to see us extend that. In terms of the margin compression during the Q really I'd say there are a couple of dynamics to that. One, is trend and you'd very much echo in the senior trend comments you've heard us make earlier in the quarter and I think is well understood. A second element of that which specifically affects OptumHealth is the behavioral growth. And I mentioned that in my prepared comments A.J., around continued strong growth in behavioral. That certainly has played its part within Q2 for OptumHealth. And then the third area is a kind of, a good news story, but with short-term implication. So that's really the growth of the membership that's coming this year. As you know, we've grown very strongly this year, actually a little ahead of our expectations. We've also brought in a very significant number of complex patients as we invest in helping those folks manage their care better, that puts a little pressure on the margin in the short run. But that's really laying super strong foundation stones, not just 4 million as we move through the year, but into \u201824, \u201825, \u201826. So those three elements, the senior trend piece, the behavioral piece, and then the effect of the strong growth is really what explains what goes on. We're going to continue to lean into that growth very assertively. A.J, thanks so much. So Lisa, thanks so very much for that. Let me ask John to just context for you a little bit the balance between the senior and behavioral. And then maybe ask Dr. Decker to just give you a little bit of commentary around the type of consultation that we're dealing with in terms of the growth. Yes, Wyatt, thank you so much. So, Lisa, I think you got it there. Overall, it's very much around the senior trend phenomena. Within OptumHealth, that the behavioral piece plays its part we see that very much as an area where we will continue to step up and make sure that we're delivering the care in the way that Wyatt just described to you. Next question please. Right. Thanks so much John and thanks Nate. Next question. Yes. Justin, thanks so much for the question. I mean, so really not much to see here in all honesty, first off. Where we came into the year, we -- as you alluded to, we priced for some anticipation of unit cost inflation. We've seen some of that come through. Within that, everything is tracking very much within our expectations. So we set the year anticipating a little bit of price/cost growth, if you will. But beyond that, really nothing to note and we feel good about where we sit here. Thanks so much. Next question? Josh, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Noel to give you a little bit more commentary. But I think bottom line, I don't really think the benefits are driving this. I think this is -- when you look at the concentration of what we're seeing in terms of the outpatients, the orthopedics, in particular, those sorts of areas, it looks very much more like a kind of deferment of care. Super interesting when you look at maybe what's changed a little bit within that. We've seen a shift in the fraction of people who, once they have been essentially recommended for surgery, actually go through, and complete the procedure. Arguably, what might drive that change is, one, more supply. So actually, it's more possible to go get it done; but two, maybe a little less reticent from an individual to go into a facility in a post-COVID environment versus a COVID environment. That feels like the thing that's shifted. And maybe ask Tim to just add a little bit to that as well, Tim? Tim, thanks so much. And Josh, thanks very much for the question. Next questions? Lance, thanks so much for the question. Before I hand it to Dan Kueter, who looks after our E&I business, I just want to make a couple of kind of high-level comments. We're seeing overall a very strong performance from our commercial business this year and also setting up, it feels like very well for the \u201824 season. We've seen fantastic overall growth, as I mentioned, in terms of membership. And that's been led very much by a lot of the product innovation that the team have been putting together and into the marketplace. And we see that continuing pretty assertively as we roll into \u201824. Just with that kind of backdrop, maybe, Dan, if you could respond to Lance's specific questions, that would be great. Great. Thanks, Dan. Thanks so much, Lance, for the questions. And just to be super clear as well that client loss that Dan just referred to, we knew about that about a year ago very much within our expectations and forecast plan. It was something we were anticipating and makes no impact at all to our full-year expectation. But thanks so much for the question. And next questions, please? Hey, Kevin, thanks so much for the question. So first off, as I mentioned earlier, the pressure is really coming from those three sources, the senior trend phenomenon that we talked a lot about, the very specific Optum piece around behavioral and then the growth in the book. And within that, very much to complex care patient, which, as I'm going to repeat again, is an extremely positive element of our growth going forward. That's going to be an extraordinarily important foundation stone for the future of the company. We're going to continue to lean into that growth, first and foremost. We do expect to see margins continue to strengthen, particularly as you roll through into \u201824. You're absolutely right. We believe we've caught this in our pricing for next year. But more importantly, the longer time we have to look after folks and wrap around care, we can deliver much better outcomes for them, as we talked about earlier and we can also make the economic proposition better. It really builds much more sustainable capability. So all of that will kick in, as well as we roll through subsequent quarters and years. This is going to be a continuing building pressure. I feel very good about that range we've laid out for OptumHealth over the next several years. And actually, I think if I had the choice on a slightly suppressed margin in Q2 or the very significant growth that we've taken in. I'll take the growth all day long. And I'll take that growth, because it's going to underpin years of growth going forward. Appreciate the question, Kevin. Next question? Yes. Very much appreciate the question. Let me ask John to make some comments to that. John? Thanks, John. And maybe I'll ask Dirk to also comment a little bit. As you think about the G&A side of the equation going forward. Dirk maybe reflect a little bit on the work you're leading around technology and other interventions as we look to drive down our overall costs. Yes, Dirk, thanks so much. And I think, Gary, overall, and I think I tried to allude at the very beginning. Obviously, when you see a movement in care activity like we saw in the quarter, it's been great to see the range of levers that we have within the organization to respond. And you've seen what we've been able to do in the very short run. And as you would expect that we have more and more of those levers as you roll through into the medium and longer-term outlooks as both John and Dirk have described both in the financial side of the company, but also critically in the core operating cost structure of the company, which we're going to continue to bear down on very, very assertively. Consequence of all of that is that even with the backdrop of some of the fluidity we've seen. We're able to continue to commit to the investment behind growth and the investment behind looking after patients, as well as we possibly can and giving people a fantastic experience, which is what we think builds super sustainable shareholder value. So that's very much the priority that we're focused on. Next question? Hey George, thanks for the question. I'm actually going to ask Tim Noel, who leads the Medicare business to respond to that, Tim? Tim, thanks so much. Jenifer, we have time for one last question. So, let's take the last question. Thank you. Scott, thanks so much for the question. Well, first of all, we're obviously very pleased to have come to an agreement on the transaction with Amedisys, so we appreciate that. But as you'd expect, it's -- we're now in the very early stages of that process. It wouldn't be appropriate to talk about anything specific in that regard. If I just take it maybe a level higher, it's no secret that we are very strong believers in the value of home health and no secret that we believe that value -- home health capabilities, when combined with other activities in terms of wrapping care around patients, is a really important element of future value-based care, particularly as you speak towards complex patients, many of whom maybe struggle to get out of the home, maybe don't have quite the same kind of relationship with the clinic as you might often expect. So we do think that the general area is an important area. As I said, as far as the specifics are concerned, I think we're now -- we'll go through our -- the regular kind of process, and we'll update you as appropriate, but probably not much more to say today. Thanks so much, Scott, for the question. And thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. We very much appreciate your time. And we hope you take away from this call our confidence in our ability to continue to perform and grow strongly, while we pursue our mission and build the foundations for continued growth in 2024 and beyond. And we are very much looking forward to sharing more on our progress with you again in October. Thanks so much for your time this morning."

            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you, Dirk. Adaptability and delivering greater value for the people we serve continue as foundational elements for our enterprise. These last few months are a good example, identifying evolving market trends; moving quickly to help people get the care they need; incorporating our broad and multifaceted insights into planning and importantly delivering on our commitments to you, our shareholders. These traits underpin our confidence not only in achieving our goals for \u201823, but also as we look toward \u201824 and beyond. Before reviewing our business results, let me elaborate on the care patterns Andrew described earlier. To illustrate in the second quarter, outpatient care activity among seniors was a few 100 basis points above our expectations. As we've highlighted, specific orthopedic and cardiac procedures had increased its far above that level of variation. And as we developed and filed our 2024 Medicare Advantage offerings, we assume that these levels of heightened care activity will persist throughout next year. Overall care activity among our Medicaid and commercial populations is consistent with our expectations. As always, we continue to intensely analyze trends that may indicate more severe disease progression, which could point to rising acuity. For example, in areas such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, we see no such evidence, while continuing to monitor closely. With that, let's turn to out second quarter results. Revenue of $92.9 billion, grew by nearly $12.6 billion or 16% over the prior year with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. OptumHealth revenues grew by 36% to $23.9 billion, driven by an increase in the number of patients served, a growing mix of patients with more complex needs and the expanding scope of care services we can offer. Operating margins reflect the higher care activity patterns we have discussed with seniors comprising a significant majority of value-based patients served. OptumRx revenues grew by 15%, surpassing $28 billion, driven by continued new customer wins and strong double-digit growth across our specialty, infusion, and community pharmacies. Script growth of nearly 7% reflects continued demand for our affordable solutions that give customers choice and simplify the pharmacy experience, such as biosimilar access and digital pharmacy tools. Part way into the \u201824 selling season, this momentum continues with strong client additions. OptumInsight revenues grew 42% to nearly $4.7 billion. The revenue backlog reached over $31 billion, an increase of $8 billion over last year, in part due to the addition of Change Healthcare. The integration and investment activities discussed on previous calls have gone well and are setting the stage for the next phase of growth for OptumInsight. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Our commercial business added nearly 500,000 people in the first-half and continues its growth with the \u201824 selling season indications tracking favorably. Within our public sector programs, we continue to expect growth of over 900,000 Medicare Advantage members this year. And our Medicaid performance remains strong, as we continue to support states as they initiate redeterminations. Comprehensive outreach efforts to help individuals retain coverage are underway though it is still early as most states began this work only recently. Our capital capacities are strong. Adjusted cash flows from operations were at $10.4 billion or nearly 2 times net income in the second quarter and $15.6 billion or nearly 1.4 times net income in the first-half. In the first six 6 months of this year, we returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and in June, our Board of Directors increased the dividend by 14%. As Andrew mentioned, based upon our growth outlook and the trends discussed, today we were able to strengthen and narrow our full-year \u201823 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.70 to $25 per share. Within this, we expect a relatively balanced pacing in the second-half. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew. Lisa, good morning, it's John. So in terms of your question, the majority of the guide to the upper end of the full-year is driven by what we've described in terms of the activity, the care activity we're seeing amongst the seniors in outpatient, so that's the core there. In terms of behavioral, what we've noticed in behavioral is an increase in the number of people accessing care. Andrew have this in his comments, but a very, very significant increase even just since a year ago in terms of the number of people that are looking to access care, it's a great thing, we are planning on that continuing. We don't see why that trend slows down, so we're designing our benefits for that to continue. As you recall, I know Lisa, behavioral resides within OptumHealth, and so that's a kind of an impact that we'd see in that component. And Wyatt, maybe some other commentary? Nate, good morning. Thanks for the question. Yes, in terms of the balance pacing, the way I describe that is -- and MCR and how that feeds in, we'd expect the MCR to be a little bit lower in the 3Q than we saw in the 2Q, some of that seasonality, as you would fully expect. So within the contexting of balance, expect earnings to be a little bit higher marginally in 3Q than 4Q, because of that typical factor in there, and thinking of an MCR somewhere in the zone of between, kind of, what we saw in the 1Q and 2Q just by seasonality factor. Important in that is we expect the, kind of, general pacing of care activity to remain consistent. That's what we've actually been seeing here. So since we've talked about this and as we've looked at the level of care activity across the company, these elements we talked about in terms of senior outpatient care are really remaining stable at the levels we talk to. And our expectation is it continues in that level. So as you look out to the second-half of this year, our expectation, it continues at those levels that we've been seeing with the -- I mentioned a few 100 basis points above our expectations in the senior business, that continues. The only underlying factor is a little bit of seasonality that you would see occurring there. Good morning, Gary, it's John. So yes, you're right. Those investment income has frankly, been growing strongly over the past number of quarters and continues to grow. Some of that is the backdrop of the rising interest rate environment, as you know, very well. Some of that is also a result of very active management by our treasury teams in terms of deploying more and more cash balances into interest-bearing accounts and such as they've been working hard at that over the past few quarters and advancing the productivity of that cash. That's after coming off of a period of many years of a zero interest rate environment. So a lot of elements in that. In any given quarter, we can experience some gains from our -- in our investment portfolio. So that can be gained from -- anything from our regular fixed income investments to anything from our diverse venture holdings. And so those come in -- they come in at different points in time. And perhaps sometimes they're a little bit less predictable, but kind of are typically in a similar zone frankly, not outside. I don't expect those, kind of, things, I don't count on those kind of things, frankly, every quarter. That's not the thing we look at. But there are elements that we've seen over time in kind of the zones that we're experiencing even now, too. So, yes, thanks, Gary."

            "content": "Yes, Lance, thanks for the question. Growth is on track for the full-year. And what you see in Q2 really is represented by the contraction of one large customer in our fee-based business. Your question about attrition and redeterminations, the outcome of those, which will be some puts and takes, will probably determine where within our range we will fall. But the punch line is, we're on track to hit our range for this year. Thanks for the question, Lance."

            "name": "Tim Noel",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Josh. Consistent with what Andrew said, when we look at potential drivers everything from acuity to benefits added to mix of membership. Everything is really tracking very normally and in line with what we would expect. So nothing to call out there, but certainly something that we look at closely and carefully each and every year, and this year being no different. With respect to your question regarding benefits, so I think one thing to keep in mind is that the more important driver to our benefit decisions this year were the changes to the risk model. Certainly, we've been talking a lot about care patterns, but that has far less of an impact on the benefits filed and is really one of many assumptions that we make inside of our bids. But we feel very confident in our ability to provide stability to the benefits that seniors value most, things like zero co-pays for primary care visits, zero co-pays for Tier 1 drugs. Keeping zero monthly planned premiums where we had them in the past and keeping level out of pocket maximums are very important things for benefits for stability. And we are able to preserve those, so we're really happy about that. So on balance, combined with the great momentum we see in our value proposition, the great partnerships we have and confidence from the broker community, we feel really good about the benefits we filed. And also, as we talked about in our opening remarks, really confident in seeing that momentum pull through into some great growth results next year. Thanks, George, for the question. So I'll start by reiterating one thing as an important point. The biggest item though shaping this year has been -- thinking was around the risk model changes. The outpatient care patterns plays a far smaller role there. But that said, having the ability to incorporate the latest data, anything we've learned recently into our Medicare Advantage bids is extremely important in each and every year especially given how we see both key revenue and medical elements firm up inside of Q2, being able to incorporate the latest thinking that we have in our bid filings is really, really important. And because of that, we've designed a bid process that is very nimble and able to accommodate late changes. This year, out of respect for a developing trend, we made the assumption that some of these early indications that we are seeing in the outpatient care patterns we have talked about would remain durable. And as we sit here today, as John has talked about, these assumptions have validated and they've also stabilized. And we feel confident that we've made the appropriate accommodations inside of our 2024 bids for all of this. Thank you."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earning reports section of the company\u2019s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and Form 8-K dated April 14, 2023, which maybe accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Growth in the quarter was strong and well balanced across Optum and UnitedHealthcare with revenue increasing 15% to $92 billion. This broad-based growth, combined with the continued focus of our colleagues on tight execution, helped us deliver first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.26, up 14% over last year. Year-to-date, UnitedHealthcare increased the number of people served in the U.S. by 1.2 million, about half of this total within our commercial offerings. At OptumHealth, we are now serving nearly 700,000 more patients under fully accountable value-based arrangements compared to just December 2022. Given the strength in these results, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the full year to a range of $24.50 to $25 per share. I know one topic is front of mind for you this morning. So I will start with Medicare Advantage. With the 2024 Medicare Advantage notice in hand, we now have greater clarity for the short to mid-term evolution of this important program. Our teams are working through the implications of the changes for 2024 and we will be ready to submit bids in just a few weeks. While we remain concerned about some of the potential unintended consequences of the changes of the risk adjustment model, particularly around adequate diagnosis and support for people with diabetes, complex behavioral needs and more, we do appreciate CMS\u2019 decision to phase-in the changes. This phase-in will allow for more time to minimize impacts on beneficiaries as we lean on the multiple levers available to us, including our ability to manage costs and our relentless focus on member and patient needs. We expect the many years of work and investment our teams have put into product and value differentiation as well as quality measures such as Star scores will enable us to continue to offer leading value to Medicare beneficiaries and to grow strongly for years to come. We are committed to working with CMS as stewards of the MA program, especially with its long-stated goal of promoting value-based care, which remains the best solution to promote equitable access, better healthcare outcomes, exceptional experiences and lower cost for the system. And importantly, it best supports people who have historically been underserved and who face fragmented, less effective care under traditional fee-for-service. Seniors know that with MA versus fee-for-service, they can access a more integrated and comprehensive suite of critical health benefits, including prescription medicines, vision, dental and hearing care. They can seek care in more convenient settings. They experience better health outcomes, such as an over 40% lower rate of avoidable hospitalizations and consistently derive much greater value. In fact, the typical Medicare Advantage senior spent about $2,000 a year less out of pocket compared to seniors in traditional Medicare. And well over 90% of seniors in Medicare Advantage report they are highly satisfied with their coverage and care. That\u2019s why more than 30 million Americans, fully half of all seniors, choose Medicare Advantage today. Over the past year, we focused on improving the consumer experience across our company. This consumer orientation is foundational in support of each of our growth priorities, including our approach to value-based care. For example, this year, we expect to serve more than 4 million patients in fully accountable value-based care arrangements through Optum, about double where we were at the end of 2021. These patients will be members of UnitedHealthcare benefit plans or one of the many other plans served by Optum. Many of them are in Medicare Advantage. And increasingly, we are serving people with Medicaid or commercial benefits, an important growth focus for the coming years. We have spent well more than a decade investing in essential infrastructure and offering extensive practice transition support to enable tens of thousands of care providers to participate in this comprehensive value-based approach. By integrating traditional ambulatory care with specialty behavioral and pharmacy care across in-clinic, virtual and in-home settings, we are delivering measurably better health outcomes for patients, all while improving access and lowering costs for people and the healthcare system overall. Our focus on consumers is helping to drive growth within health benefits, including strong growth in our commercial offerings, and our early indications are for continued robust commercial growth in 2024. From our employee-centered Surest insurance offer to our innovative financial services for both members and care providers, to our improved pharmacy home delivery services and zero co-pays on life-saving drugs, through all of these initiatives and more, we are firmly on track to put the member, patient and consumer at the very heart of what we do. One last note on UnitedHealthcare benefits and the resumption of Medicaid redeterminations, now that the process has started, we are working with our state partners and others to provide as much information and support as possible so people can understand and access their best coverage options. And we expect to be serving more people in our benefit programs when this process is completed. And now I will turn it over to UnitedHealth Group President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Thanks, Andrew. Picking up on redeterminations, for many months, we have been preparing to help people when this activity resumes as it now has in over 20 states. We are working closely with Medicaid members to navigate eligibility guidelines and help find alternative coverage options if they are no longer Medicaid-eligible. This effort includes live outreach calls to educate and assist members with renewal process to ensure they retain their existing coverage or can transition to other plans. We are also engaged with employers to extend annual enrollment periods and drive awareness for employees who are eligible for coverage. With extended eligibility and increased subsidies, many people will qualify for other plans, some with no monthly premium. UnitedHealthcare is executing our detailed plans to ensure as many people as possible have uninterrupted access to coverage and care if they are no longer eligible for Medicaid. Let me now turn to the opportunity we have to more deeply and effectively serve people in their homes. Nearly all of the patients we will add this year in fully accountable value-based relationships will have access to support through our home-based platform. Consumers value and benefit from services delivered in the home and we have expanded our capabilities to serve that need. I will highlight four of our key capabilities in this important area. First, patient assessments, in-home clinical visits designed to identify care needs and help patients with other physical and social needs. This year, we expect to make more than 2.5 million visits to patients\u2019 homes and we continue to expand the scope of the clinical services offered in that setting. Next, care transitions. This entails supporting patients into and through post-acute settings, helping people to avoid hospital readmissions after an inpatient stay. This year, we will manage nearly 12 million care transitions, about twice as many as just 3 years ago. This plays an important role in helping people return safely home and in connecting patients with additional in-home support. Third area, senior community care. This is clinical care for seniors who live in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities and dedicated senior housing. Our clinical teams provide additional layers of care and on-call resources, and they coordinate among patients in their primary care provider, facility staff and caregivers, all contributing to strong quality of care and outcomes. And the fourth area of clinical capability is individual care and coordination for Medicare dual and chronic special needs patients. These patients frequently require a more individualized approach to care. On average, these patients are managing nine different chronic conditions and taking multiple medications. Our high-touch approach leads to better outcomes, including an over 15% reduction in hospitalizations, high patient satisfaction with an NPS of nearly 80 with 99% of our patients in a four-star or higher plan. Our recent combination with LHC Group expands in-home capabilities. LHC provides high-quality, compassionate home health, hospice and post-acute care services with over 12 million patient encounters each year. We will learn from and build upon LHC\u2019s capabilities, expanding the scope and acuity of the care we can provide in a patient\u2019s health. And finally, shifting to pharmacy care services. OptumRx just completed another strong growth season. We are winning new relationships by offering the lowest cost and strong service across a wide variety of customers from health plans to labor and governments and to commercial employers. We help customers obtain the best net cost, and we use our clinical expertise to help treat conditions that call for specialty medications. In addition, consumers are benefiting from efforts such as Price Edge, which gives them the best-price option whether on or off benefit; UnitedHealthcare\u2019s introduction last year of zero-cost life-saving drugs; and our ability to manage the introduction of biosimilars on equal footing with the existing branded product. In short, we have consumers\u2019 backs. With that, let me hand it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. Fundamental execution has long been an essential aspect of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s ability to deliver for all those we serve. We know that if we meet or exceed our commitments and strive to live up to our potential, we will continue to generate high-quality durable growth. Our first quarter performance was highlighted by the strong and accelerating growth achieved across the businesses of UHC and Optum. We accomplished this while continuing to expand upon the foundations, which will drive the future growth you have come to expect from us. Revenue in the first quarter of $92 billion grew by nearly $12 billion or 15% over the prior year with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. This growth was achieved by serving more people across all our businesses, and importantly, by serving them more comprehensively. UnitedHealth Group served \u2013 UnitedHealthcare served about 1.2 million more people in the first 3 months of the year with strong growth across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Optum revenues grew 25% to $54 billion. Care patterns remain largely consistent with recent trends. For example, inpatient trends continue to reflect the growing long-term movement towards ambulatory sites of care. Today, nearly two-thirds of orthopedic procedures are performed in outpatient and other ambulatory settings compared to under one quarter just 5 years ago. Physician office activity continues to trend toward historic levels, while a few categories such as pediatrics remain lower. Emergency room visits remain modestly lower than historical levels with consumers seemingly more comfortable with virtual and walk-in care. Cancer and cardiac screenings are occurring at roughly pre-pandemic levels helped in part by focused efforts to ensure people are obtaining appropriate preventive care. As always, we continue to closely analyze data for indications which could signal increasing acuity, but have yet to see those emerge. Looking now at the performance of the individual businesses in the first quarter. OptumHealth revenues grew by 38% to $23 billion as we expanded a number of patients served under value-based care arrangements. Revenue per consumer served grew by 34% driven by the increase in value-based care patients and in the levels of care we can offer. OptumInsight revenues grew 40% to $4.5 billion. The revenue backlog reached $30.7 billion, an increase of nearly $8 billion over last year, in part due to the addition of Change Healthcare. As we have discussed before, in the first half, we expect to continue to increase our integration and investment activities, which were a component in the first quarter results, and we expect they will accelerate into the second quarter. OptumRx revenues grew 15%, surpassing $27 billion, driven by strong double-digit growth across the businesses, including in our community and home delivery pharmacies. Script growth of $26 million over last year was driven by exceptional customer retention as well as new customer adds. We continue to see strong growth in NPS for our specialty businesses, up nearly 10 points since last year. At UnitedHealthcare, revenues of over $70 billion grew 13% with growth in the number of people served across all of our major benefit categories. For example, in commercial, we set out to serve up to 1 million more people this year and are pacing well to that objective given our first quarter performance. Offerings for large employers led the gains as did our newer and more affordable offerings serving both employers and individuals. Within Medicare Advantage, we shared with you in November our intention to add 800,000 to 900,000 new members in this year, and we now expect to exceed the upper end of that rate. The consistent consumer receptivity to our offerings underscores the product stability and value we provide for seniors. Medicaid membership grew 570,000 over the year ago quarter. We continue to have momentum in Medicaid with recent wins in Indiana and Texas, and we are honored to advance our existing service to the people of North Carolina as the state moves towards expanding managed Medicaid offerings. Our capital capacities remain strong. Cash flows from operations in the quarter at $16.3 billion reflected an additional CMS payment. Adjusting for this effect, first quarter cash flows from operations were consistent with our outlook, and we continue to track well with our full year view to approach $28 billion, about 1.2x net income. In the quarter, we returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and deployed about $8 billion of growth capital to expand our capabilities to serve more people and grow far into the future. As Andrew mentioned, based upon this growth outlook, today, we increased our full year 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.50 to $25 per share. We expect the first half, second half earnings progression to be broadly consistent with our longer-term historical patterns with the second half comprising just slightly more than half of the full year. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. Our comments on this call gives us a flavor of why we\u2019re confident in our outlook for the year and our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth target. Our growth is broad-based and it\u2019s driven within and increasingly across our businesses bolstered, as always, by an enterprise focus on execution on behalf of those we serve. With that, operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions. One per caller please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go ahead and take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks so much. And thanks for all the comments. Maybe just because it\u2019s been in the news as well the whole review of PBMs and some of the approaches the industry has had historically, maybe I\u2019ll just ask you guys to remind us what your approach is relative to rebates, spread pricing and so forth. And then I know OptumRx does a lot more than a traditional PBM. Maybe give people some perspective on the breadth of OptumRx relative to some of the things that are specifically being discussed in Washington today, if possible.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. A.J., thanks so much for the question. Let me make a couple of comments, and then I\u2019m going to hand to Heather Cianfrocco, who looks after our OptumRx business. So first off, I mean, I think the entire space of pharmacy is a critical one within healthcare. It\u2019s the most common touch point for the health system. It\u2019s also an incredibly significant part of the system in terms of where innovation comes into the marketplace. So we\u2019re in important set of activities which need to be delivered effectively on behalf of patients, members, consumers. Having said that, of course, it\u2019s all about affordability and value for money. And there is a real risk, if you see situations where you have essentially monopoly holders, so let\u2019s say, drug companies that have a monopoly over a particular product, there needs to be a counterbalance in terms of the price negotiation to make sure that those prices are effectively procured on behalf of members who otherwise would just not have that kind of ability to negotiate. That\u2019s really the central role that the PBMs play here. There are various mechanisms in which the PBM operates. The rebate mechanism is one that historically has been used in this way. As you well know, A.J., Optum, OptumRx in particular, has led the way in terms of transparency and making sure that, for example, the overwhelming majority of rebates are passed back to the payers of those drugs, typically the plans or the employers who commission us to procure on their behalf. As we look more broadly across the whole landscape of the pharmacy marketplace, there are a few things that I think we strongly believe in and we continue to advocate for very significantly. Number one, there needs to be a counterbalance to the drug company pricing, and the only players in the market right now who are really advocating hard for reducing cost is the PBM. Number two, at Optum, we are committed to lowest net cost. And whether we get there through rebate or we get there through lower list prices, we don\u2019t mind. We\u2019re very happy when people cut list prices because that cuts cost. We\u2019re very happy when we secure increased rebates because that cuts costs. So we continue to focus on that lowest net cost, and we\u2019re super committed to transparency. We\u2019re also committed to finding ways in which we can bring benefits directly to patients, which is why we led last year with zero cost pay for the UnitedHealthcare books of business initially for life-saving drugs. So that\u2019s kind of the big landscape. Now there\u2019s more detail in areas that maybe Heather could take you into, and I\u2019ll pass to her now to give you a little bit more. Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Sure. Thank you. And maybe I would just supplement and just say, A.J., thank you. We are \u2013 certainly, it is in the news. We\u2019re mindful of the interest in this essential service. But I guess I\u2019d also point you to the client need for these essential services. Our PBM services not just negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to drive that lowest net cost for drugs available, as Andrew mentioned, but the clinical supports and services through the pharmacy and therapeutics committees and pipeline reviews, that network administration and all of the benefit administration and consultation that we provide to clients of all sizes and types from government to employer to large sophisticated health plans. And I take validation in the fact that, that business model is needed by our clients, and it\u2019s appreciated. The transparent business model of OptumRx, together with the innovative capabilities, some of our differentiated strategies like the biosimilar strategy that Andrew mentioned that not just brought competition into the market by bringing up to three biosimilars at parity with the originator on the formulary, accepting the high list price and the list price and putting those together and offering them to the clients from our consumer tools like our latest Price Edge that does scan across the market and compares the cash pricing with the members\u2019 real-time out-of-pocket cost to make sure they get the best price. Those are innovative offerings that I\u2019m really proud that our clients find valuable. And we evolve with those needs. So I think I\u2019d point us to the fact that we had a very strong selling season, one of the highest over the last years, in terms of retention and new client shows that the services are needed. We will continue to evolve our business models to our clients\u2019 needs while we continue to engage policymakers and others to make sure that everybody understands the essential value of that PBM service, the distinctive capabilities and transparent business model of OptumRx and in addition, make sure that we ensure client choice and we preserve that function. But I guess that also \u2013 just take the opportunity to say you\u2019re right. OptumRx is so much more than just our PBM, which is incredibly important to our clients. We are so proud of them and I\u2019m so proud of the team. You saw the growth in our pharmacies. But from our community pharmacies that it just celebrated a 700th opening of our behavioral health pharmacy, a very distinctive offering in the market to our specialty with not just high NPS but a 24/7 clinical model and distinctive capabilities for those members that really benefit from specialty drugs but in oftentimes, need our patient support and assistance, including financial. And then, of course, our infusion business, which is very intimate in providing services in the home, and we rely on over 1,100 nurses to do that every day. So incredibly proud of the breadth of service across OptumRx but very mindful that our job in the PBM is to serve our clients and preserve their choice.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Heather. And all of that said, I think what is also really validating here, A.J., just look at the growth rate in the first quarter, 15% growth. It really reflects the competitiveness of the portfolio we have. And as I talk to our clients, what they really appreciate is the degree to which we\u2019re innovating the pharmacy model, more and more transparency, more and more pressure on bringing down those costs. That\u2019s why people are moving to us, and it\u2019s why they\u2019re not leaving us, record levels of retention within this portfolio. And just as a marker, about half of our revenues in the OptumRx portfolio come from non-PBM activities. That\u2019s all the stuff that Heather just referred to at the second part. She runs a super nicely balanced business, great growth profile because we\u2019re delivering for clients and for their members and employees. So A.J., thanks for raising that question. It\u2019s an important topic, and we appreciate having the chance to share it. Next question.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. I\u2019m going to stick to the PBM side for a minute and just really want to hear your comments around GLP-1 drugs. One, how do we think about the cost trend as you think about it from the managed care side of your business? And then secondly, how do we think about really truly managing this new cost of drug that\u2019s coming from a pharmacy perspective?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Lisa, it\u2019s a great question. I think, actually, it would be super interesting to hear from the UnitedHealthcare perspective on that. So I may just ask Brian Thompson, the CEO of UHC, to comment there, please.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, Andrew. Hey, Lisa, good morning. Let me start with the trends that we\u2019re seeing here in 2023 are as planned, overall medical and pharmacy. It\u2019s really a good start to the year with our assumptions being validated as we kick off 2023. With respect to GLP, obviously, a lot of discussion. I would say no real change to either our insights or our position. We have seen an increase in trend in GLP-1s. The overwhelming majority of that is in diabetic care, and it is as we had expected, low single digits in terms of weight loss use. I would say that our on-label usage has been well managed with our authorization requirements. And I think it\u2019s important to put it in the context of our overall medical. Keep in mind, pharmacy is about 20% of our overall spend in any one therapeutic class. This one certainly included less than 1%. So increased year-over-year, overwhelming majority in diabetic care, well managed in terms of off-label use and consistent with what we had planned for.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. No, listen, Brian puts it super well, Lisa. I think I think from where we sit, as we roll forward \u2013 listen, first of all, it\u2019s good news that we\u2019re seeing innovation in areas like weight management. That obviously is going to be an important aspect of consideration for people, particularly with comorbidities. Diabetes is an obvious example of that, number one. Number two, I think as time plays out, what\u2019s going to be super critical here is some of the \u2013 we need to get focused on the facts and reality of this marketplace. We need to really be clear about which patients really do benefit from these medicines and make sure we properly understand how they\u2019re going to use those medicines. So there\u2019s a lot still to learn, I think, as these things progress through their final phases. And then finally, of course, we got to see the prices be affordable, and that\u2019s going to be a key element of how this evolves. And obviously, we keep a close eye on the prices we see in Europe. And just as \u2013 you heard a little bit our focus on the pharmacy side of the business, of course, encouraged by our insurance side of the business. We\u2019re going to be looking for the very best pricing on these medicines, and we\u2019re going to advocate on behalf of members and consumers to get that. So still plenty to come here. I think early days, nothing particularly out of expectations, still very much in the range that Brian just described. Lisa, thanks for the question. Lisa, thanks for the question. Next question?\nOperator: We will take our next question from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes. Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the changes the company is making to prior authorization later this year. It would be great to get some background on why you felt like these changes were necessary and how you\u2019re going to work to manage the cost implications of the changes once they\u2019re made. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Stephen, thanks so much for the question. I\u2019ll ask Brian to address that.\nBrian Thompson: Hey, Steven, thanks for the question. Yes, beginning in the third quarter of this year, we will be eliminating about 20% of our authorization volumes overall. We\u2019re also going to be eliminating most medical authorizations altogether for provider groups and systems that have demonstrated a high-quality care and adherence to the requirements over time. I\u2019d say that might be another 10% of our volumes overall. We will continue to evaluate with some new analytics that we have in partnership with OptumInsight and surveillance capabilities to see if there\u2019s some additional opportunities over time. Really, though, this is a culmination of a lot of things. And first and foremost, I would say it\u2019s our intensifying focus on the consumer experience, really a desire for us to streamline processes, get the latency out of the process and like I said, leverage new technologies to really get to speed of decisioning and really get to point of care. I will say, we are constantly reviewing our prior authorizations, but we need to balance, obviously, what we reduce with that need to guard against clinical quality and patient safety. And I would say in this really robust process that we\u2019ve started here over the last several months that it\u2019s really demonstrated the importance of the authorizations that we do have in place, so really encouraged by our surveillance capabilities. Don\u2019t anticipate any pressure on trend because of it and really see this as a win and satisfier for both our customers and our provider groups alike.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Brian, thanks so much. I might just add, I think as we play out over the next year or 2, this is also an exciting area where UHC and OptumInsight can collaborate. A lot of technology opportunity to be leveraged here, Stephen. And also as you think about the integration of the Change organization into OptumInsight, that gives us a new perspective in terms of how we can create network connectivity to take friction out as well. So how do we \u2013 what you just had a little bit there from Brian is how we kind of streamline this space. It\u2019s still got an important role at its core. Then there\u2019s a ton of opportunity we can bring to really take out a lot of that friction by leveraging technology and the capabilities that we\u2019re building up within the new OptumInsight, so really an interesting space across the whole organization. Thanks so much, Stephen and Brian. Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to sneak in a couple of quick numbers questions. First, on EPS seasonality, it looks like second quarter \u2013 it sounds like you might be looking at closer to kind of flattish EPS year-over-year. Wondering if you can kind of walk through the moving parts there. I know you talked about spending more money on change, for instance. And then just anything on DCP, what range should we be thinking about there in terms of going forward? Is this a kind of \u2013 it went down in the quarter. Is this a more normal range? Kind of where do you see that kind of settling out for the year? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Justin, thanks so much. I\u2019ll ask John Rex to comment there, please.\nJohn Rex: Hi, good morning, Justin, so a few thoughts here in terms of seasonality comments. So yes, this quarter reflected some impacts actually from Change also, so I wouldn\u2019t call that seasonality. But these are investments we\u2019re making as we integrate and we build OptumInsight for the future. And I put that in the zone of $100 million or so of impact in the quarter and expect that to be a little bit higher actually in the second quarter also. In terms of full year seasonality, also, I just want to give a little commentary on that. I expect that to be kind of in the zone of what we have historically done, where you see just a little bit more than half of the earnings generated in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So more similar to if you look to kind of pre-2019 and back, those kind of patterns, that we would typically show. On your commentary \u2013 on your question on DCPs and expectations there, at this level, I would tell you, is probably more in the level that we typically would have run also pre-pandemic in terms of the levels of date clients payable that we would typically run, a few things just in terms of commentary and just seeing some of the impacts just to get really close on it. So, in addition to being at what we would consider to be kind of normalized levels here, some business mix impacts. Some of the areas we are growing in and growing rapidly in have somewhat faster payment cycles. In the first quarter, there is usually a little impact also from Part D seasonality. And kind of on the sequential move there, I would say a little \u2013 just a little bit of day count impact also in terms of \u2013 that was affecting those. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, John. Thanks Justin. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on Medicare Advantage and the phase-in of the risk model changes by CMS. I guess how might the prospects for lower rate growth over the next few years impact relative attractiveness of Medicare Advantage for seniors and the growth of that market? And do you think the risk model changes have any impact on how providers are viewing the attractiveness of full-risk arrangements? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Nathan, thanks so much for the question. So listen, I think as you sort of step back here, a couple of things I would probably just want to make super clear. First off, we really appreciate CMS\u2019 decision to phase-in these changes. That was important and we are very glad to see that. It really allows for the transition to be managed effectively, really we think and a bit \u2013 certainly, our goal is to have a transition here, which really protects the beneficiaries, make sure that it doesn\u2019t in any way kind of damage the program. Of course, it requires us to do things a little differently in some areas. But fundamentally, we think that was really important and we very, very much appreciate that. As we kind of look out to 2024, we are going to be guided by two really important principles here, Nathan. Number one, we are going to be doing what\u2019s absolutely right for the beneficiaries as we always do, so that\u2019s going to guide us in terms of how we are active. And number two, we are going to be driving to sustain our robust membership growth in this space. We believe this is an incredibly important program for seniors. We think value-based care as a piece of this program is a crucial and best way of managing members to give them the best quality outcome, best experience and best cost outcome. Given our established capabilities and our ability to focus on cost management as well as the broad portfolio of value-based services, clinics, in-house activities provided by Optum, we feel super confident in our ability to manage the evolving funding landscape. So, overall yes, it\u2019s changed, but kind of this change every year, this is a little different change to the changes we have had in other years, but it\u2019s all \u2013 these programs are always evolving. We feel, given the portfolio of capabilities we have, super well equipped to be able to pull different levers to be responsive to this to make sure that we can look after beneficiaries. I would also say that the experience we have seen in Optum, the popularity of value-based care for physicians, the way in which they like to be able to concentrate and focus on patients longitudinally, so really think about how to understand, diagnose, prevent, treat, manage that patient through the whole cycle rather than just sporadically through a fee-for-service intervention, that\u2019s a sustaining popular thing. We brought in about 10,000 or more new clinicians last year between physicians and advanced practice clinicians. I think we are going to do about the same this year. Honestly, we are seeing significant numbers of people coming in. And we would continue to expect to see value-based care continue to be a very important part of the future growth of the marketplace and of course, for us. So, as we sit today, of course we have to do things to respond to the changing environment. We feel good about our ability to do it. And I appreciate the question, Nathan. Next question.\nOperator: And we will move on to our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. I want to stay on MA and maybe more specifically, if you could speak to the impact to both, I guess UnitedHealthcare and OptumCare and more specifically, how you plan to balance the need to maintain attractive benefits to grow that membership against your ability to achieve target margins. And maybe do you think the industry will grow at similar rates? It sounds like you don\u2019t see a material impact long-term, but I am just curious if you think 2024 as an industry growth rate looks similar to what we have seen in recent years and maybe within that, how you expect UHC to fare?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Josh, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Brian to give you a few thoughts. Brian?\nBrian Thompson: Hey Josh. Thanks for the question. I will just reiterate, I think what Andrew said. Certainly, this 3-year phase-in gives us an opportunity to minimize this impact on beneficiaries. And I will just reiterate the optimism that Andrew shared. Because of that, that gives us time to really evaluate our cost structure. First and foremost, I think that\u2019s the consideration that we are deeply focused on to make sure that we manage this impact. Look, it\u2019s not the first time that we have had to navigate a rate environment like this. So, I will just say we remain optimistic about MA and the value prop that it has broadly. We certainly feel very good about our market position in it. We intend to grow again in 2024, as Andrew had said. We expect the marketplace to continue to grow in 2024. And we continue to lead with the strong momentum that we have demonstrated for many years now. So, we are obviously in the middle of our benefit planning, but I can just share with you that we are encouraged and optimistic.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Brian. I appreciate it. Thanks Josh. Next question.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about OptumCare and the full-risk patients you have got, specifically the non-UnitedHealthcare patients? And how is the progress going as far as growing that? And how do you see this MA rate environment and high premium environment in commercial employer impacting and potentially accelerating your ability to add non-UHC risk patients?\nAndrew Witty: So, Lance, thanks so much for the question. Let me just make a couple of upfront comments, and then I will ask Dr. Wyatt Decker, who looks after Optum Health, to give you a little more detail. So first off, you are seeing now as we head towards the full year here, 4 million or so fully capitated lives within Optum Health, so under full delegation. That\u2019s an incredible progression over the last 2 years or 3 years. It\u2019s what\u2019s really \u2013 you can see a real differentiation. Super important to remember that, that is being supported not just by clinics, oftentimes people think about just clinics. Within Optum Health, this is really broadly integrated support service. So, this could be Optum at Home. This is in the clinic, it\u2019s behavioral, it\u2019s virtual. It\u2019s a really comprehensive set of capabilities that underpin that and we believe provides fantastic service for the members who are delegated. You see that growth rate continuing to be super strong, 700,000 already transferred this year. It\u2019s extraordinary first quarter for Optum Health. As you step back and look underneath the hood of all of that, of course, UHC is a big piece of it. But there is a very substantial non-UHC delegation quantum in there, which continues to grow well. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, an increase in diversification of that value base as a treatment strategy as it moves into commercial risk and also Medicaid. So, really important diversification. Maybe just talk a little bit why, give a little more detail in terms of how you are thinking about the next year or so.\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Well, thank you, Lance, and thank you, Andrew. I would underscore some of Andrew\u2019s comments. But most particularly, we have developed a comprehensive and differentiated clinical model of care for value-based care. And that is appealing to all of the large national payers who we work with closely, Lance. And so you will see us continuing to grow our book of value-based care lives with all national payers and regional payers who see the value that we are able to provide both to them and to the members and hence, patients that we serve. And you heard a little bit earlier today from Dirk McMahon on our comprehensive home and community offerings, and that\u2019s just one of our many platforms. And we weave these together in a comprehensive fashion, and we think about not just the member, but the person or patient at the other side of this who is on a journey of healthcare. And some have multiple chronic diseases. Some want to focus on staying healthy and well, and some have catastrophic issues that we have to help them navigate effectively. And our ability to do that is unique and differentiated in the healthcare industry. So, I think you will see continued growth with multiple payers. We have enjoyed that this year and will continue to do so as the year progresses. And as Andrew touched on, we really view ourselves not as solely a senior healthcare provider, but as a provider for all walks and ages of lives and particularly commercial. So, we have commercial offerings in Texas, in California and Massachusetts today, and they are a meaningful part of our 4 million fully capitated lives already today. And you will see us continuing to grow in those established markets with commercial and multiple payers as well as going into new markets. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Wyatt. Lance, thanks so much for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I just want to go back to MA for a minute. You guys \u2013 it sounds like you are saying the MA changes that are happening are not significant enough to \u2013 in isolation I think as an individual component to take you off your 13% to 16% EPS growth targets over the next few years. I just want to clarify that. But then I understand that the 3-year phase-in is important to allow you to adjust to it, but at the same time, trying to understand if there is a way to think about this. Are you thinking about the impact as being ratable, or is it a scenario where it\u2019s easier to offset in the beginning, because there is always low-hanging fruit and it\u2019s harder to offset the impact in year three, or is it the opposite, where it\u2019s harder to offset the impact in year one, because you don\u2019t have much time to adjust and it\u2019s easier to impact in year three as you have more and more time to adjust? Just trying to figure out if there is a difference in how this will play out over the next 3 years and how we should think about your growth.\nAndrew Witty: Kevin, thanks so much for the question. So, to your first point, no, you are absolutely right. We remain firmly of the view that the 13% to 16% long-term growth rate of adjusted earnings per share is very much the zone we are in. We \u2013 you see that again in this quarter. We continue to believe that is very much in our horizon as we go forward. Obviously, any given quarter might vary around that, but that very much is the zone we expect and I made that comment a little bit earlier, so for sure on that. Listen, as far as this \u2013 the phase-in come, this will all depend \u2013 different companies will behave differently, I suspect, through all of this. And we see, of course the change here, we will be making changes to some things in our costs and other areas, as Brian talked about earlier on. Other providers may choose to do things differently. How it plays out, I think is actually going to be a little bit of a competitive environment, actually. And I think not something we probably want to get too much into in terms of predicting or sharing exactly how we are going to respond to this. We are getting close to a bid cycle. It\u2019s a super important time. We are deeply fixated on making sure that we continue to grow. To do that, we need to make sure that our bids are super competitive. And we are working on that, and we will work our way through it. And as I said earlier, the phase-in gives us confidence that we can align with where CMS wants to end up in a way which gives the best chance of beneficiaries being looked after appropriately, and that\u2019s what we want to try and do. Thanks so much for the question. Next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks for taking my question. On your commercial risk membership, can you speak to what you are seeing there? And is there anything to glean in terms of how Surest is tracking relative to your expectations? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Erin, thanks so much for the question. I am going to ask Dan Kueter who runs our E&I business to respond. Dan?\nDan Kueter: Yes. Thanks Andrew. Thanks Erin for the question. And yes, our momentum in the first quarter clearly continued the momentum we had in the back half of last year and puts us well on track, as John said in his prepared remarks, to meet our investor conference goal \u2013 investor conference targets rather, of $850 million to $1.5 billion [ph] growth. Surest was a component of that. Surest was the component, about \u2013 accounting for about 25% of our growth in the quarter as that product continues to be adopted. We have shared before that one in nine of our national accounts actually have that product today. We are continuing to see that expand down into the middle market currently as the growth of that product continues. And we also are beginning to experience take-up now on a fully insured basis for that product on a risk basis. We shared at the investor conference that Surest was available in 12 states on an insured basis with a year-end target for this year of upwards of 35 states. We currently offer that product in 25 states. So, it is a meaningful contributor to our growth, and we expect it to be so for the remainder of the year and into the future. Thanks for the question, Erin.\nAndrew Witty: Dan, thank you so much. And I just might add something here, Erin, as well. I mean I think you can see in this Q, you saw it as we rolled into the second half of last year, we are optimistic for the rest of this year. I said earlier that we are expecting continued robust growth on commercial insurance into \u201824. We really feel like this engine has let up again and it\u2019s super important for the organization. Alongside the fantastic growth you are seeing in the government books of business in Medicaid and Medicare. We are now seeing the commercial business really come to the fore again, which is a fantastic thing to see within the company. What you have also just heard a little bit is the way in which Optum is developing its capabilities to be ready to add even more value to the commercial. So, just as that Optum business has built up strength to complement UHC\u2019s leadership in Medicare, for example, you just heard Dr. Decker talking about doing the same thing in commercial. As that growth comes in from Dan\u2019s organization, you can see how that could play out. It\u2019s a super important shift and having all those engines fire in simultaneously is really good for us, and it\u2019s what\u2019s driving this growth we are seeing in Q1. So, thanks for the question, Erin. Next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: Hi. Thank you very much. We have received a number of questions on the EMIS acquisition in the UK, especially now with the CMA\u2019s Phase 2 investigation. And I know you can\u2019t comment on that specifically. But I was wondering if you could recap the key strategic priorities with this acquisition and discuss the specific capabilities within the platform that Optum Insight or other businesses can leverage. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Ben, thanks so much for the question. Yes, obviously, I can\u2019t get into the detail of the regulatory review. But a couple of things to say. So, for a long time, many years, Optum has had a business in the UK. Obviously, the UK is a very different type of marketplace to the U.S., but it has a couple of interesting \u2013 very interesting components. One is you have got very much a primary care-dominated environment, which is obviously very akin to big pieces of Optum Health. And it\u2019s also a marketplace which has looked to develop its abilities around data and connectivity. EMIS, which is the company we are very keen to partner with, we think could be a very important complement to Optum capabilities, particularly as it speaks to helping us connect some of our software capabilities, data analytic capabilities to primary care providers. About 40% of British primary care providers are connected into the EMIS networks. We think that gives a great opportunity to bring fantastic value to the physician practices and then ultimately to the National Health Service. And what we would like to believe if we are able to go through that transaction is that, it can really allow us to start to create another node of innovation alongside all of our other technology platforms to start to develop technology software platforms and the like, which not only could be used in a market like the UK, but in other economies around the world which perhaps have slightly different shaped healthcare systems to the U.S. healthcare system. So, we see this as good for the UK. We think it\u2019s potentially an interesting opportunity to further enhance our investments and progress in technology and software development. And it\u2019s why we are keen to continue the process to get the transaction done. And obviously, we will be working diligently on that. Thanks so much for the question, Ben. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Was actually open just to revisit the full year revenue guidance, just given the first quarter, clearly, you were pacing better than The Street, and you have since closed LHCG. And you are now looking to eclipse the high end of your MA target for the year. So clearly, it seems like there is a lot of upside momentum relative to the initial guidance you gave at Investor Day. I know you don\u2019t typically update the revenue guidance intra-quarter or during the quarters, but certainly interested if maybe you can give us some refined thinking around that. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Thanks so much. Let me ask John to comment.\nJohn Rex: Hey Scott. Good morning. Yes, good strength and growth really across the businesses in the quarter. And we are through some of those areas really across both UHC and Optum in terms of the strength we are seeing in terms of membership growth, in terms of the performance of the other businesses, Optum Rx, a call-out here in terms of the strength they have seen in terms of their new customer wins and retention and Optum Health in its growth in value-based live. So, all strong contributors to that. And yes, we are a little ahead of kind of where the view was in terms of the external view on revenue guidance. So, certainly we are positively biased in terms of the type of growth that we are seeing across the enterprise. Happy to see that. You are also right, probably not doing any updates here in the first quarter in terms of that full year view at this distance, but really strong place to start the year. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. And time for one last question please operator.\nOperator: Our last question will come from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Thank you very much for getting me in. I wanted to ask another question on MA and value-based care. I am wondering if the risk model, Andrew, changes your views about the target member in MA that is, say, most attractive to target between individual MA versus duals. And in value-based care, seeing nice growth, particularly interesting to us that the eliminations grew a lot, which I am inferring is inter-company between Optum Health and UHC. And I am wondering if that is a signal that duals were a big part of the value-based care add in the first quarter. So, kind of a weeds question, but strategically, basically interested to know if duals are still a very important target for MA.\nAndrew Witty: So, David, thanks so much for the question. So, you are quite right, the eliminations are a big piece of that is the Optum Health-UHC dynamic and not surprising because you see such a high risk transfer in Q1. A large fraction of that 700,000 is UHC, not obviously, others as well, but a large fraction. And of course, within that, as we have guided last year, significant proportion of dual special need patients who \u2013 most complex patients, really, I think particularly appropriate patients to benefit from a value-based care approach where you have a really integrated wraparound serve capabilities. So, it\u2019s certainly true on all of that. I am going to slightly disagree with your premise here. We are not in the business of targeting a certain type of member or patient. We want to look after Medicare patients and members, whether they are community MA, whether they are dual special need, whether they are complex or not, whether they are early in their disease in an aging patent or advanced in their disease and an aging part. And then the job for our organization is to mix and match our capabilities to do that as efficiently as possible. And the great thing about Optum Health, David, is that we have such an interesting portfolio of capabilities, which allow us to dial up and down our activities in response to what the patient needs and the way in which they need to be looked after. So, I would say, we are going to be continuing to lean in across the board. It\u2019s just as important to us to grow in dual special needs as well as community MA. And I would say that the progress we make in terms of impacting these folks\u2019 lives and the reason why over 90% of members describe this as a high-satisfaction space is because they \u2013 these people need the support at this stage of their life. And we think that between the programs that UHC offer and then the backup that Optum Health brings in terms of deep clinical engagement really makes a difference, and that\u2019s what drives us. David, appreciate the question. Thank you very much. I am afraid we are at the end of the call. I hope you leave this call with a sense of our optimism and focus on continued growth for the year ahead. We remain intent on expanding our ability to help improve healthcare at the system and individual levels and executing with excellence for all those we serve. And we look forward to sharing our progress on this journey with you again in July. In the meantime, thank you so much for your questions and your attention this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: And with that, that does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. Picking up on redeterminations, for many months, we have been preparing to help people when this activity resumes as it now has in over 20 states. We are working closely with Medicaid members to navigate eligibility guidelines and help find alternative coverage options if they are no longer Medicaid-eligible. This effort includes live outreach calls to educate and assist members with renewal process to ensure they retain their existing coverage or can transition to other plans. We are also engaged with employers to extend annual enrollment periods and drive awareness for employees who are eligible for coverage. With extended eligibility and increased subsidies, many people will qualify for other plans, some with no monthly premium. UnitedHealthcare is executing our detailed plans to ensure as many people as possible have uninterrupted access to coverage and care if they are no longer eligible for Medicaid. Let me now turn to the opportunity we have to more deeply and effectively serve people in their homes. Nearly all of the patients we will add this year in fully accountable value-based relationships will have access to support through our home-based platform. Consumers value and benefit from services delivered in the home and we have expanded our capabilities to serve that need. I will highlight four of our key capabilities in this important area. First, patient assessments, in-home clinical visits designed to identify care needs and help patients with other physical and social needs. This year, we expect to make more than 2.5 million visits to patients' homes and we continue to expand the scope of the clinical services offered in that setting. Next, care transitions. This entails supporting patients into and through post-acute settings, helping people to avoid hospital readmissions after an inpatient stay. This year, we will manage nearly 12 million care transitions, about twice as many as just 3 years ago. This plays an important role in helping people return safely home and in connecting patients with additional in-home support. Third area, senior community care. This is clinical care for seniors who live in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities and dedicated senior housing. Our clinical teams provide additional layers of care and on-call resources, and they coordinate among patients in their primary care provider, facility staff and caregivers, all contributing to strong quality of care and outcomes. And the fourth area of clinical capability is individual care and coordination for Medicare dual and chronic special needs patients. These patients frequently require a more individualized approach to care. On average, these patients are managing nine different chronic conditions and taking multiple medications. Our high-touch approach leads to better outcomes, including an over 15% reduction in hospitalizations, high patient satisfaction with an NPS of nearly 80 with 99% of our patients in a four-star or higher plan. Our recent combination with LHC Group expands in-home capabilities. LHC provides high-quality, compassionate home health, hospice and post-acute care services with over 12 million patient encounters each year. We will learn from and build upon LHC's capabilities, expanding the scope and acuity of the care we can provide in a patient's health. And finally, shifting to pharmacy care services. OptumRx just completed another strong growth season. We are winning new relationships by offering the lowest cost and strong service across a wide variety of customers from health plans to labor and governments and to commercial employers. We help customers obtain the best net cost, and we use our clinical expertise to help treat conditions that call for specialty medications. In addition, consumers are benefiting from efforts such as Price Edge, which gives them the best-price option whether on or off benefit; UnitedHealthcare's introduction last year of zero-cost life-saving drugs; and our ability to manage the introduction of biosimilars on equal footing with the existing branded product. In short, we have consumers' backs. With that, let me hand it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."

            "content": "Yes. Well, thank you, Lance, and thank you, Andrew. I would underscore some of Andrew's comments. But most particularly, we have developed a comprehensive and differentiated clinical model of care for value-based care. And that is appealing to all of the large national payers who we work with closely, Lance. And so you will see us continuing to grow our book of value-based care lives with all national payers and regional payers who see the value that we are able to provide both to them and to the members and hence, patients that we serve. And you heard a little bit earlier today from Dirk McMahon on our comprehensive home and community offerings, and that's just one of our many platforms. And we weave these together in a comprehensive fashion, and we think about not just the member, but the person or patient at the other side of this who is on a journey of healthcare. And some have multiple chronic diseases. Some want to focus on staying healthy and well, and some have catastrophic issues that we have to help them navigate effectively. And our ability to do that is unique and differentiated in the healthcare industry. So, I think you will see continued growth with multiple payers. We have enjoyed that this year and will continue to do so as the year progresses. And as Andrew touched on, we really view ourselves not as solely a senior healthcare provider, but as a provider for all walks and ages of lives and particularly commercial. So, we have commercial offerings in Texas, in California and Massachusetts today, and they are a meaningful part of our 4 million fully capitated lives already today. And you will see us continuing to grow in those established markets with commercial and multiple payers as well as going into new markets. Thank you."

            "content": "Sure. Thank you. And maybe I would just supplement and just say, A.J., thank you. We are \u2013 certainly, it is in the news. We're mindful of the interest in this essential service. But I guess I'd also point you to the client need for these essential services. Our PBM services not just negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to drive that lowest net cost for drugs available, as Andrew mentioned, but the clinical supports and services through the pharmacy and therapeutics committees and pipeline reviews, that network administration and all of the benefit administration and consultation that we provide to clients of all sizes and types from government to employer to large sophisticated health plans. And I take validation in the fact that, that business model is needed by our clients, and it's appreciated. The transparent business model of OptumRx, together with the innovative capabilities, some of our differentiated strategies like the biosimilar strategy that Andrew mentioned that not just brought competition into the market by bringing up to three biosimilars at parity with the originator on the formulary, accepting the high list price and the list price and putting those together and offering them to the clients from our consumer tools like our latest Price Edge that does scan across the market and compares the cash pricing with the members' real-time out-of-pocket cost to make sure they get the best price. Those are innovative offerings that I'm really proud that our clients find valuable. And we evolve with those needs. So I think I'd point us to the fact that we had a very strong selling season, one of the highest over the last years, in terms of retention and new client shows that the services are needed. We will continue to evolve our business models to our clients' needs while we continue to engage policymakers and others to make sure that everybody understands the essential value of that PBM service, the distinctive capabilities and transparent business model of OptumRx and in addition, make sure that we ensure client choice and we preserve that function. But I guess that also \u2013 just take the opportunity to say you're right. OptumRx is so much more than just our PBM, which is incredibly important to our clients. We are so proud of them and I'm so proud of the team. You saw the growth in our pharmacies. But from our community pharmacies that it just celebrated a 700th opening of our behavioral health pharmacy, a very distinctive offering in the market to our specialty with not just high NPS but a 24/7 clinical model and distinctive capabilities for those members that really benefit from specialty drugs but in oftentimes, need our patient support and assistance, including financial. And then, of course, our infusion business, which is very intimate in providing services in the home, and we rely on over 1,100 nurses to do that every day. So incredibly proud of the breadth of service across OptumRx but very mindful that our job in the PBM is to serve our clients and preserve their choice."

            "name": "Brian Thompson",
            "content": "Sure, Andrew. Hey, Lisa, good morning. Let me start with the trends that we're seeing here in 2023 are as planned, overall medical and pharmacy. It's really a good start to the year with our assumptions being validated as we kick off 2023. With respect to GLP, obviously, a lot of discussion. I would say no real change to either our insights or our position. We have seen an increase in trend in GLP-1s. The overwhelming majority of that is in diabetic care, and it is as we had expected, low single digits in terms of weight loss use. I would say that our on-label usage has been well managed with our authorization requirements. And I think it's important to put it in the context of our overall medical. Keep in mind, pharmacy is about 20% of our overall spend in any one therapeutic class. This one certainly included less than 1%. So increased year-over-year, overwhelming majority in diabetic care, well managed in terms of off-label use and consistent with what we had planned for. Hey, Steven, thanks for the question. Yes, beginning in the third quarter of this year, we will be eliminating about 20% of our authorization volumes overall. We're also going to be eliminating most medical authorizations altogether for provider groups and systems that have demonstrated a high-quality care and adherence to the requirements over time. I'd say that might be another 10% of our volumes overall. We will continue to evaluate with some new analytics that we have in partnership with OptumInsight and surveillance capabilities to see if there's some additional opportunities over time. Really, though, this is a culmination of a lot of things. And first and foremost, I would say it's our intensifying focus on the consumer experience, really a desire for us to streamline processes, get the latency out of the process and like I said, leverage new technologies to really get to speed of decisioning and really get to point of care. I will say, we are constantly reviewing our prior authorizations, but we need to balance, obviously, what we reduce with that need to guard against clinical quality and patient safety. And I would say in this really robust process that we've started here over the last several months that it's really demonstrated the importance of the authorizations that we do have in place, so really encouraged by our surveillance capabilities. Don't anticipate any pressure on trend because of it and really see this as a win and satisfier for both our customers and our provider groups alike. Hey Josh. Thanks for the question. I will just reiterate, I think what Andrew said. Certainly, this 3-year phase-in gives us an opportunity to minimize this impact on beneficiaries. And I will just reiterate the optimism that Andrew shared. Because of that, that gives us time to really evaluate our cost structure. First and foremost, I think that's the consideration that we are deeply focused on to make sure that we manage this impact. Look, it's not the first time that we have had to navigate a rate environment like this. So, I will just say we remain optimistic about MA and the value prop that it has broadly. We certainly feel very good about our market position in it. We intend to grow again in 2024, as Andrew had said. We expect the marketplace to continue to grow in 2024. And we continue to lead with the strong momentum that we have demonstrated for many years now. So, we are obviously in the middle of our benefit planning, but I can just share with you that we are encouraged and optimistic."

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Growth in the quarter was strong and well balanced across Optum and UnitedHealthcare with revenue increasing 15% to $92 billion. This broad-based growth, combined with the continued focus of our colleagues on tight execution, helped us deliver first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.26, up 14% over last year. Year-to-date, UnitedHealthcare increased the number of people served in the U.S. by 1.2 million, about half of this total within our commercial offerings. At OptumHealth, we are now serving nearly 700,000 more patients under fully accountable value-based arrangements compared to just December 2022. Given the strength in these results, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the full year to a range of $24.50 to $25 per share. I know one topic is front of mind for you this morning. So I will start with Medicare Advantage. With the 2024 Medicare Advantage notice in hand, we now have greater clarity for the short to mid-term evolution of this important program. Our teams are working through the implications of the changes for 2024 and we will be ready to submit bids in just a few weeks. While we remain concerned about some of the potential unintended consequences of the changes of the risk adjustment model, particularly around adequate diagnosis and support for people with diabetes, complex behavioral needs and more, we do appreciate CMS' decision to phase-in the changes. This phase-in will allow for more time to minimize impacts on beneficiaries as we lean on the multiple levers available to us, including our ability to manage costs and our relentless focus on member and patient needs. We expect the many years of work and investment our teams have put into product and value differentiation as well as quality measures such as Star scores will enable us to continue to offer leading value to Medicare beneficiaries and to grow strongly for years to come. We are committed to working with CMS as stewards of the MA program, especially with its long-stated goal of promoting value-based care, which remains the best solution to promote equitable access, better healthcare outcomes, exceptional experiences and lower cost for the system. And importantly, it best supports people who have historically been underserved and who face fragmented, less effective care under traditional fee-for-service. Seniors know that with MA versus fee-for-service, they can access a more integrated and comprehensive suite of critical health benefits, including prescription medicines, vision, dental and hearing care. They can seek care in more convenient settings. They experience better health outcomes, such as an over 40% lower rate of avoidable hospitalizations and consistently derive much greater value. In fact, the typical Medicare Advantage senior spent about $2,000 a year less out of pocket compared to seniors in traditional Medicare. And well over 90% of seniors in Medicare Advantage report they are highly satisfied with their coverage and care. That's why more than 30 million Americans, fully half of all seniors, choose Medicare Advantage today. Over the past year, we focused on improving the consumer experience across our company. This consumer orientation is foundational in support of each of our growth priorities, including our approach to value-based care. For example, this year, we expect to serve more than 4 million patients in fully accountable value-based care arrangements through Optum, about double where we were at the end of 2021. These patients will be members of UnitedHealthcare benefit plans or one of the many other plans served by Optum. Many of them are in Medicare Advantage. And increasingly, we are serving people with Medicaid or commercial benefits, an important growth focus for the coming years. We have spent well more than a decade investing in essential infrastructure and offering extensive practice transition support to enable tens of thousands of care providers to participate in this comprehensive value-based approach. By integrating traditional ambulatory care with specialty behavioral and pharmacy care across in-clinic, virtual and in-home settings, we are delivering measurably better health outcomes for patients, all while improving access and lowering costs for people and the healthcare system overall. Our focus on consumers is helping to drive growth within health benefits, including strong growth in our commercial offerings, and our early indications are for continued robust commercial growth in 2024. From our employee-centered Surest insurance offer to our innovative financial services for both members and care providers, to our improved pharmacy home delivery services and zero co-pays on life-saving drugs, through all of these initiatives and more, we are firmly on track to put the member, patient and consumer at the very heart of what we do. One last note on UnitedHealthcare benefits and the resumption of Medicaid redeterminations, now that the process has started, we are working with our state partners and others to provide as much information and support as possible so people can understand and access their best coverage options. And we expect to be serving more people in our benefit programs when this process is completed. And now I will turn it over to UnitedHealth Group President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon. Dirk? Thanks, John. Our comments on this call gives us a flavor of why we're confident in our outlook for the year and our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth target. Our growth is broad-based and it's driven within and increasingly across our businesses bolstered, as always, by an enterprise focus on execution on behalf of those we serve. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller please. Yes. A.J., thanks so much for the question. Let me make a couple of comments, and then I'm going to hand to Heather Cianfrocco, who looks after our OptumRx business. So first off, I mean, I think the entire space of pharmacy is a critical one within healthcare. It's the most common touch point for the health system. It's also an incredibly significant part of the system in terms of where innovation comes into the marketplace. So we're in important set of activities which need to be delivered effectively on behalf of patients, members, consumers. Having said that, of course, it's all about affordability and value for money. And there is a real risk, if you see situations where you have essentially monopoly holders, so let's say, drug companies that have a monopoly over a particular product, there needs to be a counterbalance in terms of the price negotiation to make sure that those prices are effectively procured on behalf of members who otherwise would just not have that kind of ability to negotiate. That's really the central role that the PBMs play here. There are various mechanisms in which the PBM operates. The rebate mechanism is one that historically has been used in this way. As you well know, A.J., Optum, OptumRx in particular, has led the way in terms of transparency and making sure that, for example, the overwhelming majority of rebates are passed back to the payers of those drugs, typically the plans or the employers who commission us to procure on their behalf. As we look more broadly across the whole landscape of the pharmacy marketplace, there are a few things that I think we strongly believe in and we continue to advocate for very significantly. Number one, there needs to be a counterbalance to the drug company pricing, and the only players in the market right now who are really advocating hard for reducing cost is the PBM. Number two, at Optum, we are committed to lowest net cost. And whether we get there through rebate or we get there through lower list prices, we don't mind. We're very happy when people cut list prices because that cuts cost. We're very happy when we secure increased rebates because that cuts costs. So we continue to focus on that lowest net cost, and we're super committed to transparency. We're also committed to finding ways in which we can bring benefits directly to patients, which is why we led last year with zero cost pay for the UnitedHealthcare books of business initially for life-saving drugs. So that's kind of the big landscape. Now there's more detail in areas that maybe Heather could take you into, and I'll pass to her now to give you a little bit more. Heather? Thanks, Heather. And all of that said, I think what is also really validating here, A.J., just look at the growth rate in the first quarter, 15% growth. It really reflects the competitiveness of the portfolio we have. And as I talk to our clients, what they really appreciate is the degree to which we're innovating the pharmacy model, more and more transparency, more and more pressure on bringing down those costs. That's why people are moving to us, and it's why they're not leaving us, record levels of retention within this portfolio. And just as a marker, about half of our revenues in the OptumRx portfolio come from non-PBM activities. That's all the stuff that Heather just referred to at the second part. She runs a super nicely balanced business, great growth profile because we're delivering for clients and for their members and employees. So A.J., thanks for raising that question. It's an important topic, and we appreciate having the chance to share it. Next question. Yes. Lisa, it's a great question. I think, actually, it would be super interesting to hear from the UnitedHealthcare perspective on that. So I may just ask Brian Thompson, the CEO of UHC, to comment there, please. Yes. No, listen, Brian puts it super well, Lisa. I think I think from where we sit, as we roll forward \u2013 listen, first of all, it's good news that we're seeing innovation in areas like weight management. That obviously is going to be an important aspect of consideration for people, particularly with comorbidities. Diabetes is an obvious example of that, number one. Number two, I think as time plays out, what's going to be super critical here is some of the \u2013 we need to get focused on the facts and reality of this marketplace. We need to really be clear about which patients really do benefit from these medicines and make sure we properly understand how they're going to use those medicines. So there's a lot still to learn, I think, as these things progress through their final phases. And then finally, of course, we got to see the prices be affordable, and that's going to be a key element of how this evolves. And obviously, we keep a close eye on the prices we see in Europe. And just as \u2013 you heard a little bit our focus on the pharmacy side of the business, of course, encouraged by our insurance side of the business. We're going to be looking for the very best pricing on these medicines, and we're going to advocate on behalf of members and consumers to get that. So still plenty to come here. I think early days, nothing particularly out of expectations, still very much in the range that Brian just described. Lisa, thanks for the question. Lisa, thanks for the question. Next question? Yes. Stephen, thanks so much for the question. I'll ask Brian to address that. Yes. Brian, thanks so much. I might just add, I think as we play out over the next year or 2, this is also an exciting area where UHC and OptumInsight can collaborate. A lot of technology opportunity to be leveraged here, Stephen. And also as you think about the integration of the Change organization into OptumInsight, that gives us a new perspective in terms of how we can create network connectivity to take friction out as well. So how do we \u2013 what you just had a little bit there from Brian is how we kind of streamline this space. It's still got an important role at its core. Then there's a ton of opportunity we can bring to really take out a lot of that friction by leveraging technology and the capabilities that we're building up within the new OptumInsight, so really an interesting space across the whole organization. Thanks so much, Stephen and Brian. Next question? Yes. Justin, thanks so much. I'll ask John Rex to comment there, please. Thanks so much, John. Thanks Justin. Next question please. Nathan, thanks so much for the question. So listen, I think as you sort of step back here, a couple of things I would probably just want to make super clear. First off, we really appreciate CMS' decision to phase-in these changes. That was important and we are very glad to see that. It really allows for the transition to be managed effectively, really we think and a bit \u2013 certainly, our goal is to have a transition here, which really protects the beneficiaries, make sure that it doesn't in any way kind of damage the program. Of course, it requires us to do things a little differently in some areas. But fundamentally, we think that was really important and we very, very much appreciate that. As we kind of look out to 2024, we are going to be guided by two really important principles here, Nathan. Number one, we are going to be doing what's absolutely right for the beneficiaries as we always do, so that's going to guide us in terms of how we are active. And number two, we are going to be driving to sustain our robust membership growth in this space. We believe this is an incredibly important program for seniors. We think value-based care as a piece of this program is a crucial and best way of managing members to give them the best quality outcome, best experience and best cost outcome. Given our established capabilities and our ability to focus on cost management as well as the broad portfolio of value-based services, clinics, in-house activities provided by Optum, we feel super confident in our ability to manage the evolving funding landscape. So, overall yes, it's changed, but kind of this change every year, this is a little different change to the changes we have had in other years, but it's all \u2013 these programs are always evolving. We feel, given the portfolio of capabilities we have, super well equipped to be able to pull different levers to be responsive to this to make sure that we can look after beneficiaries. I would also say that the experience we have seen in Optum, the popularity of value-based care for physicians, the way in which they like to be able to concentrate and focus on patients longitudinally, so really think about how to understand, diagnose, prevent, treat, manage that patient through the whole cycle rather than just sporadically through a fee-for-service intervention, that's a sustaining popular thing. We brought in about 10,000 or more new clinicians last year between physicians and advanced practice clinicians. I think we are going to do about the same this year. Honestly, we are seeing significant numbers of people coming in. And we would continue to expect to see value-based care continue to be a very important part of the future growth of the marketplace and of course, for us. So, as we sit today, of course we have to do things to respond to the changing environment. We feel good about our ability to do it. And I appreciate the question, Nathan. Next question. Yes. Josh, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Brian to give you a few thoughts. Brian? Great. Thanks so much, Brian. I appreciate it. Thanks Josh. Next question. So, Lance, thanks so much for the question. Let me just make a couple of upfront comments, and then I will ask Dr. Wyatt Decker, who looks after Optum Health, to give you a little more detail. So first off, you are seeing now as we head towards the full year here, 4 million or so fully capitated lives within Optum Health, so under full delegation. That's an incredible progression over the last 2 years or 3 years. It's what's really \u2013 you can see a real differentiation. Super important to remember that, that is being supported not just by clinics, oftentimes people think about just clinics. Within Optum Health, this is really broadly integrated support service. So, this could be Optum at Home. This is in the clinic, it's behavioral, it's virtual. It's a really comprehensive set of capabilities that underpin that and we believe provides fantastic service for the members who are delegated. You see that growth rate continuing to be super strong, 700,000 already transferred this year. It's extraordinary first quarter for Optum Health. As you step back and look underneath the hood of all of that, of course, UHC is a big piece of it. But there is a very substantial non-UHC delegation quantum in there, which continues to grow well. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, an increase in diversification of that value base as a treatment strategy as it moves into commercial risk and also Medicaid. So, really important diversification. Maybe just talk a little bit why, give a little more detail in terms of how you are thinking about the next year or so. Thanks Wyatt. Lance, thanks so much for the question. Next question please. Kevin, thanks so much for the question. So, to your first point, no, you are absolutely right. We remain firmly of the view that the 13% to 16% long-term growth rate of adjusted earnings per share is very much the zone we are in. We \u2013 you see that again in this quarter. We continue to believe that is very much in our horizon as we go forward. Obviously, any given quarter might vary around that, but that very much is the zone we expect and I made that comment a little bit earlier, so for sure on that. Listen, as far as this \u2013 the phase-in come, this will all depend \u2013 different companies will behave differently, I suspect, through all of this. And we see, of course the change here, we will be making changes to some things in our costs and other areas, as Brian talked about earlier on. Other providers may choose to do things differently. How it plays out, I think is actually going to be a little bit of a competitive environment, actually. And I think not something we probably want to get too much into in terms of predicting or sharing exactly how we are going to respond to this. We are getting close to a bid cycle. It's a super important time. We are deeply fixated on making sure that we continue to grow. To do that, we need to make sure that our bids are super competitive. And we are working on that, and we will work our way through it. And as I said earlier, the phase-in gives us confidence that we can align with where CMS wants to end up in a way which gives the best chance of beneficiaries being looked after appropriately, and that's what we want to try and do. Thanks so much for the question. Next question. Erin, thanks so much for the question. I am going to ask Dan Kueter who runs our E&I business to respond. Dan? Dan, thank you so much. And I just might add something here, Erin, as well. I mean I think you can see in this Q, you saw it as we rolled into the second half of last year, we are optimistic for the rest of this year. I said earlier that we are expecting continued robust growth on commercial insurance into \u201824. We really feel like this engine has let up again and it's super important for the organization. Alongside the fantastic growth you are seeing in the government books of business in Medicaid and Medicare. We are now seeing the commercial business really come to the fore again, which is a fantastic thing to see within the company. What you have also just heard a little bit is the way in which Optum is developing its capabilities to be ready to add even more value to the commercial. So, just as that Optum business has built up strength to complement UHC's leadership in Medicare, for example, you just heard Dr. Decker talking about doing the same thing in commercial. As that growth comes in from Dan's organization, you can see how that could play out. It's a super important shift and having all those engines fire in simultaneously is really good for us, and it's what's driving this growth we are seeing in Q1. So, thanks for the question, Erin. Next question. Yes. Ben, thanks so much for the question. Yes, obviously, I can't get into the detail of the regulatory review. But a couple of things to say. So, for a long time, many years, Optum has had a business in the UK. Obviously, the UK is a very different type of marketplace to the U.S., but it has a couple of interesting \u2013 very interesting components. One is you have got very much a primary care-dominated environment, which is obviously very akin to big pieces of Optum Health. And it's also a marketplace which has looked to develop its abilities around data and connectivity. EMIS, which is the company we are very keen to partner with, we think could be a very important complement to Optum capabilities, particularly as it speaks to helping us connect some of our software capabilities, data analytic capabilities to primary care providers. About 40% of British primary care providers are connected into the EMIS networks. We think that gives a great opportunity to bring fantastic value to the physician practices and then ultimately to the National Health Service. And what we would like to believe if we are able to go through that transaction is that, it can really allow us to start to create another node of innovation alongside all of our other technology platforms to start to develop technology software platforms and the like, which not only could be used in a market like the UK, but in other economies around the world which perhaps have slightly different shaped healthcare systems to the U.S. healthcare system. So, we see this as good for the UK. We think it's potentially an interesting opportunity to further enhance our investments and progress in technology and software development. And it's why we are keen to continue the process to get the transaction done. And obviously, we will be working diligently on that. Thanks so much for the question, Ben. Next question please. Yes. Thanks so much. Let me ask John to comment. Thanks John. And time for one last question please operator. So, David, thanks so much for the question. So, you are quite right, the eliminations are a big piece of that is the Optum Health-UHC dynamic and not surprising because you see such a high risk transfer in Q1. A large fraction of that 700,000 is UHC, not obviously, others as well, but a large fraction. And of course, within that, as we have guided last year, significant proportion of dual special need patients who \u2013 most complex patients, really, I think particularly appropriate patients to benefit from a value-based care approach where you have a really integrated wraparound serve capabilities. So, it's certainly true on all of that. I am going to slightly disagree with your premise here. We are not in the business of targeting a certain type of member or patient. We want to look after Medicare patients and members, whether they are community MA, whether they are dual special need, whether they are complex or not, whether they are early in their disease in an aging patent or advanced in their disease and an aging part. And then the job for our organization is to mix and match our capabilities to do that as efficiently as possible. And the great thing about Optum Health, David, is that we have such an interesting portfolio of capabilities, which allow us to dial up and down our activities in response to what the patient needs and the way in which they need to be looked after. So, I would say, we are going to be continuing to lean in across the board. It's just as important to us to grow in dual special needs as well as community MA. And I would say that the progress we make in terms of impacting these folks' lives and the reason why over 90% of members describe this as a high-satisfaction space is because they \u2013 these people need the support at this stage of their life. And we think that between the programs that UHC offer and then the backup that Optum Health brings in terms of deep clinical engagement really makes a difference, and that's what drives us. David, appreciate the question. Thank you very much. I am afraid we are at the end of the call. I hope you leave this call with a sense of our optimism and focus on continued growth for the year ahead. We remain intent on expanding our ability to help improve healthcare at the system and individual levels and executing with excellence for all those we serve. And we look forward to sharing our progress on this journey with you again in July. In the meantime, thank you so much for your questions and your attention this morning. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Dirk. Fundamental execution has long been an essential aspect of UnitedHealth Group's ability to deliver for all those we serve. We know that if we meet or exceed our commitments and strive to live up to our potential, we will continue to generate high-quality durable growth. Our first quarter performance was highlighted by the strong and accelerating growth achieved across the businesses of UHC and Optum. We accomplished this while continuing to expand upon the foundations, which will drive the future growth you have come to expect from us. Revenue in the first quarter of $92 billion grew by nearly $12 billion or 15% over the prior year with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. This growth was achieved by serving more people across all our businesses, and importantly, by serving them more comprehensively. UnitedHealth Group served \u2013 UnitedHealthcare served about 1.2 million more people in the first 3 months of the year with strong growth across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Optum revenues grew 25% to $54 billion. Care patterns remain largely consistent with recent trends. For example, inpatient trends continue to reflect the growing long-term movement towards ambulatory sites of care. Today, nearly two-thirds of orthopedic procedures are performed in outpatient and other ambulatory settings compared to under one quarter just 5 years ago. Physician office activity continues to trend toward historic levels, while a few categories such as pediatrics remain lower. Emergency room visits remain modestly lower than historical levels with consumers seemingly more comfortable with virtual and walk-in care. Cancer and cardiac screenings are occurring at roughly pre-pandemic levels helped in part by focused efforts to ensure people are obtaining appropriate preventive care. As always, we continue to closely analyze data for indications which could signal increasing acuity, but have yet to see those emerge. Looking now at the performance of the individual businesses in the first quarter. OptumHealth revenues grew by 38% to $23 billion as we expanded a number of patients served under value-based care arrangements. Revenue per consumer served grew by 34% driven by the increase in value-based care patients and in the levels of care we can offer. OptumInsight revenues grew 40% to $4.5 billion. The revenue backlog reached $30.7 billion, an increase of nearly $8 billion over last year, in part due to the addition of Change Healthcare. As we have discussed before, in the first half, we expect to continue to increase our integration and investment activities, which were a component in the first quarter results, and we expect they will accelerate into the second quarter. OptumRx revenues grew 15%, surpassing $27 billion, driven by strong double-digit growth across the businesses, including in our community and home delivery pharmacies. Script growth of $26 million over last year was driven by exceptional customer retention as well as new customer adds. We continue to see strong growth in NPS for our specialty businesses, up nearly 10 points since last year. At UnitedHealthcare, revenues of over $70 billion grew 13% with growth in the number of people served across all of our major benefit categories. For example, in commercial, we set out to serve up to 1 million more people this year and are pacing well to that objective given our first quarter performance. Offerings for large employers led the gains as did our newer and more affordable offerings serving both employers and individuals. Within Medicare Advantage, we shared with you in November our intention to add 800,000 to 900,000 new members in this year, and we now expect to exceed the upper end of that rate. The consistent consumer receptivity to our offerings underscores the product stability and value we provide for seniors. Medicaid membership grew 570,000 over the year ago quarter. We continue to have momentum in Medicaid with recent wins in Indiana and Texas, and we are honored to advance our existing service to the people of North Carolina as the state moves towards expanding managed Medicaid offerings. Our capital capacities remain strong. Cash flows from operations in the quarter at $16.3 billion reflected an additional CMS payment. Adjusting for this effect, first quarter cash flows from operations were consistent with our outlook, and we continue to track well with our full year view to approach $28 billion, about 1.2x net income. In the quarter, we returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and deployed about $8 billion of growth capital to expand our capabilities to serve more people and grow far into the future. As Andrew mentioned, based upon this growth outlook, today, we increased our full year 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.50 to $25 per share. We expect the first half, second half earnings progression to be broadly consistent with our longer-term historical patterns with the second half comprising just slightly more than half of the full year. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew. Hi, good morning, Justin, so a few thoughts here in terms of seasonality comments. So yes, this quarter reflected some impacts actually from Change also, so I wouldn't call that seasonality. But these are investments we're making as we integrate and we build OptumInsight for the future. And I put that in the zone of $100 million or so of impact in the quarter and expect that to be a little bit higher actually in the second quarter also. In terms of full year seasonality, also, I just want to give a little commentary on that. I expect that to be kind of in the zone of what we have historically done, where you see just a little bit more than half of the earnings generated in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So more similar to if you look to kind of pre-2019 and back, those kind of patterns, that we would typically show. On your commentary \u2013 on your question on DCPs and expectations there, at this level, I would tell you, is probably more in the level that we typically would have run also pre-pandemic in terms of the levels of date clients payable that we would typically run, a few things just in terms of commentary and just seeing some of the impacts just to get really close on it. So, in addition to being at what we would consider to be kind of normalized levels here, some business mix impacts. Some of the areas we are growing in and growing rapidly in have somewhat faster payment cycles. In the first quarter, there is usually a little impact also from Part D seasonality. And kind of on the sequential move there, I would say a little \u2013 just a little bit of day count impact also in terms of \u2013 that was affecting those. Thank you. Hey Scott. Good morning. Yes, good strength and growth really across the businesses in the quarter. And we are through some of those areas really across both UHC and Optum in terms of the strength we are seeing in terms of membership growth, in terms of the performance of the other businesses, Optum Rx, a call-out here in terms of the strength they have seen in terms of their new customer wins and retention and Optum Health in its growth in value-based live. So, all strong contributors to that. And yes, we are a little ahead of kind of where the view was in terms of the external view on revenue guidance. So, certainly we are positively biased in terms of the type of growth that we are seeing across the enterprise. Happy to see that. You are also right, probably not doing any updates here in the first quarter in terms of that full year view at this distance, but really strong place to start the year. Thank you."

And yes, our momentum in the first quarter clearly continued the momentum we had in the back half of last year and puts us well on track, as John said in his prepared remarks, to meet our investor conference goal \u2013 investor conference targets rather, of $850 million to $1.5 billion [ph] growth. Surest was a component of that. Surest was the component, about \u2013 accounting for about 25% of our growth in the quarter as that product continues to be adopted. We have shared before that one in nine of our national accounts actually have that product today. We are continuing to see that expand down into the middle market currently as the growth of that product continues. And we also are beginning to experience take-up now on a fully insured basis for that product on a risk basis. We shared at the investor conference that Surest was available in 12 states on an insured basis with a year-end target for this year of upwards of 35 states. We currently offer that product in 25 states. So, it is a meaningful contributor to our growth, and we expect it to be so for the remainder of the year and into the future.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amount is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company's investor relations page at www.unitedhealthgroupcom. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release, we issued this morning and in our form 8-K dated October 15, 2024, which may be accessed from the investor relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Good morning and thank you for joining us. As you saw in our release, the people of UnitedHealth Group continue to deliver on our growth pillars. Our teams are providing more people with more high-quality health care services and benefits and restlessly looking for ways to simplify the health system and deliver more value for patients, employers and providers alike. By the end of this year, we will have grown to serve more than 2 million new consumers with commercial offerings, fulfill more than 1.6 billion prescriptions through Optum Rx and care for 4.7 million people in value based arrangements. Our people have done all this and more in a challenging period, navigating the first year of the CMS Medicare rate cuts and its impact on member mix. The effects of the state driven Medicaid member redeterminations, certain novel care patterns and the changed health care cyber-attack. While many of those factors could not have been anticipated, thanks to our people's efforts, we can affirm a full year 2024 earnings outlook still within the range, we first offered back in November 2023. It's a distinctive part of the culture of UnitedHealth Group that we continue to strive to deliver on our financial commitments to you through changing environments and unforeseen challenges. As we look to 2025, and I will address this shortly, we remain in a dynamic period for the healthcare sector. Amid this, it's important that we continue to invest in the durable value creating capabilities of this company that support our 13% to 16% long-term growth objective. We will balance our commitments to investing in the promising future before us with managing the known and potential challenges. We remain highly optimistic for the future, even as we are respectful of the pressures the sector faces again next year. Even within this environment, we're well positioned to continue our growth in the years ahead. I want to highlight two important reasons for this optimism. First is our relentless focus on execution, quality and innovation. In particular, we continue to work tirelessly to improve people's experiences with the health system. To that end, this month, we launched a first of its kind national gold card program, which will reduce the number of prior authorizations by 500,000 every year for qualified in network providers. This can help improve both the quality and the affordability of care while reducing friction in the system. Artificial intelligence is starting to be an important tool in improving our work. Our advanced practice clinicians use AI to summarize lengthy patient histories, freeing up hundreds of hours that can be better spent caring for people. Our nurses use Generative AI to review documentation more efficiently, saving time and improving patient service. AI is helping our consumer advocates, powering tens of millions of consumer interactions and provider searches. This allows our advocates to spend more time with people on more complex inquiries, driving better efficiency while also improving the consumer experience as reflected in higher NPS scores. And finally, using AI to help build software is enabling technology engineering teams to enhance the speed and quality necessary to help drive our technology modernization. Our focus on execution and quality is also evident in the Medicare Advantage plans we are offering for 2025. Once again, we focused on consumer value and as much as possible on benefit stability, even as we navigated the adverse Medicare funding environment. With annual enrollment beginning today, we believe we will continue to be a top choice for consumers. A second element underpinning our growth is delivery on our commitment to the transition of the health system to value based care. For over 20 years, there has been a bipartisan consensus among healthcare experts and policymakers that value based care that is integrated, patient centered and outcome focused care is superior to the often fragmented and unnecessarily expensive fee for service system. Across four presidential administrations, CMS has called for private public innovation in the development of value based care models in Medicare and Medicaid. It provides better outcomes for patients. It saves money for the customers and taxpayers who fund care. And it empowers clinicians to focus on providing the most beneficial care. The rationale for these decades long effort to develop value based care is both simple and sound. It moves from incentives based solely on volume to incentives based on a patient's health outcomes and experience. And it helps ensure patient care is delivered not at the highest cost sites of service, but rather those that combine the highest quality and value. The effectiveness of value based care for patients is proven and powerful and it's good for the system. At UnitedHealth Group, we're purposefully organized to support the transition to value based care. It requires deep engagement with patients, setting the foundation to move setting the foundation to move to more coordinated care, connecting patients to primary care earlier driving clinically accurate diagnoses, more effectively recognizing and managing chronic conditions, and slowing disease progression. We're seeing the benefits of this work come to fruition. People served by OptumHealth's value-based care models are more likely to receive cancer screenings and be in better control of their diabetes and hypertension than people in fee for service in Medicare and 10% less likely to visit the emergency room or be re-admitted to hospital program. One example of the impact of better care coordination is our emergency room space discharge program, which helps patients who may be at risk for unnecessary and expensive ER use and readmissions. We have learned that the specific ways in which a discharge is managed can have a substantial impact on readmissions, which are a problem for both patients and facilities. Our nurse care managers proactively engage the emergency teams to provide them relevant information from the outpatient medical record and to facilitate a safe discharge. This approach, currently in eight markets, is already helping to avoid hundreds of inpatient stays each month. It preserves emergency resources for those, who truly need them, saves money and is a better experience for patients. Our many care offerings now serve people in value-based care arrangements in dozens of service areas, integrating primary, surgical behavioral and home care. These patients come from many diverse payers and employers, a clear sign of confidence from the market that we're on the right track. This is the value proposition of UnitedHealth Group, committed to serving patients, providers, payers and customers with quality, integrity and innovation and joining with federal and state governments in the effort to help to build a better health system that meets the needs of all stakeholders now and into the future. Fundamentally, we continue to grow, because more people and organizations are purchasing more of the products and services we offer. It's a simple statement to make, yet a hard thing to do year in and year out. But it's the enduring reason for our optimism about the long-term growth and future of this enterprise. Now I'll turn it over to John Rex, our President and Chief Financial Officer.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Andrew. Strong growth across the company sets us up well to deliver upon our commitments to you. Amid all the puts and takes of this unusual year, we are seeing what we always look for. New products and innovations taking root among customers, more people being served through our services and continued improvement in the experience people have. These are key to our long-term success. I'll start today by offering some observations on care activity patterns, as we know that is most likely top of mind for many of you. Certain care patterns persisted at higher levels than we expected in the period for three specific and we believe primarily transitory reasons, two of which we noted last quarter. First, the still pronounced upshift in coding intensity by hospitals, which we flagged last quarter. In some cases, the coding actions are extreme. Certain entities have been notably and persistently aggressive, having up shifted their coding intensity factors by more than 20%. We are actively addressing this unnecessary additional cost burden to the health system. The second item, also noted last quarter, is the continued timing mismatch between the current health status of Medicaid members and state rate updates. States often use care activity data that is well over a year old in setting their rates. That typically has minimal impact when member mix levels are relatively stable. But with eligibility redetermination significantly shifting, both the number and average acuity of people covered has changed. As a result of the lagging care activity data as well as the annual rate cycle timing, updates remain well short of current care activity, a factor that for us was more pronounced through the period than anticipated. A third item that emerged more substantially in the period was a rather rapid acceleration in the prescribing of certain high cost specialty medications, primarily those used to treat cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders and cancer. We believe a contributing factor to the acceleration was the Inflation Reduction Act, which eliminated the individual coinsurance requirement during the catastrophic coverage phase. As many of you know, more people enter this phase in the second half of the year. While we anticipated this will become a more meaningful factor in 2025, drug manufacturer campaigns pulled some of this activity into this year more sharply than anticipated. With that, let's turn to our Q3 results. Revenues of $101 billion grew more than 9% over the prior year, with strong growth again at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. OptumHealth revenues grew by over $2 billion and are approaching $26 billion. This was driven by an increase in both the number and type of care services we offer and the patients we serve, especially in the home and among those with complex needs. OptumRx revenues grew by over $5 billion to more than $34 billion driven by strength in our pharmacy care offerings, as well as growth in pharmacy benefits management from new customers and expanding specialty services. OptumInsight revenues in the quarter were stable, approaching $5 billion and the nearly $33 billion revenue backlog increased by more than $1 billion from last year. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Our domestic commercial business has added more than 2.4 million people through the third quarter. Selling season indications are tracking favorably as we head into \u201825, reflecting continued strong uptake of UnitedHealthcare's innovative offerings. Our Medicare Advantage plans on offer this fall balance providing as much benefit stability as possible for seniors, while contending with the CMS funding cuts, IRA changes and expected care patterns. The initial stars ratings for plan year \u201826 for consumers in four-star or better rated plans is largely consistent with what we saw in our initial results last year. As has been the case in recent years, we expect these percentages to increase. In Medicaid, our new state customer expansion and retention performance remains strong, including recent awards in Massachusetts, Colorado, Rhode Island, Florida and Michigan. We hope to continue to support people and families in the post-redeterminations period and are advocating with states to ensure adequate funding and resources for these often underserved people. Our capital capacities remain strong and continue to underpin our long-term growth objectives. In the quarter, cash flows from operations were $14 billion or 2.2x net income and year-to-date we\u2019re nearly $22 billion. So far this year, we have returned $9.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase. Additionally, we have invested more than $11 billion in a wide range of strategic opportunities; including updating and extending our long standing and productive relationship with AARP to better serve older Americans. As highlighted last quarter, after the cyber-attack, we prioritized devoting resources to support care providers, over some activities such as share repurchase. Payments and claim flows for most care providers have normalized, and repayment of these capital advances is underway. Regarding Change Healthcare, for full year '24, we now estimate the business disruption costs will be about $0.75 per share, an increase of $0.10 from the former midpoint. As you may recall, business disruption largely encompasses the loss of revenues combined with the cost of keeping these capabilities fully ready to serve. These effects are not excluded from adjusted earnings. We continue to work with customers to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and to win new business with our now more modern, secure and capable offerings. We expect to continue to build back the business to pre-attack levels over the course of '25 and estimate next year's full year impact will be roughly half of the '24 level. As we enter the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing our '24 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $27.50 to $27.75 to reflect business disruption impacts and the care patterns we discussed. Our company's ability to deliver within the range of the commitments established nearly a year ago, even in challenging circumstances is another example of the discipline and innovation of the enterprise and the confidence we have in delivering diverse growth for the long-term. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. Before we turn to your questions, I want to provide some preliminary observations about next year, which we'll review in more depth at our upcoming investor conference. Perhaps the most important element is that our businesses are operating well and our growth potential remains strong. We see continued momentum in the selling season performance for UnitedHealthcare's commercial business and Optum Rx, which both offer best-in-class innovation and performance for customers. The consumer value proposition of Medicare Advantage continues to be highly compelling and we see strong growth potentially in this market for many years to come. The Optum Health value-based care businesses that we've been building for well over a decade are beginning to approach the very early stages of their potential and will be a key differentiating growth factor in the years ahead. At the same time, and as we build for the future and contemplate our 2025 outlook, we're taking into account several unique dynamics. First, the concurrent timing of the second year of the CMS Medicare rate cuts and the most significant Inflation Reduction Act impacts into a single year and the negative effects of that on the people we serve. Second, within Medicaid, the timing mismatch of state customer rate actions, which do not yet reflect the higher acuity of remaining consumers. And third, a respectful view of the care activity that John noted. We're actively addressing and managing for these and continuing to believe our 2025 planning assumptions appropriately capture these components, though we will be prudent in an initial early view. The majority of those 2025 factors are expected to be most impactful to the UnitedHealthcare businesses. As a result, we anticipate stepping out for 2025 more conservatively than is typical. At this distance, we expect the upper end of the likely range will offer in December has been around $30 per share. As always, we will seek to advance beyond this initial view as the year progresses and we remain committed to and focused on our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth objective. We see 2025 as a year of opportunity in building to that commitment, so you will see us investing in our growth pillars aggressively, modernizing our company with AI and other technologies and always exercising discipline in our operating performance. We look forward to discussing this with you in much greater detail at our Investor Conference on December 4 in New York. Now operator, we'll take some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thank you for the comments. John, I want to go back to where you talked about your observations here in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about some of those that you expect to impact \u201825? And I really want to focus on the third one, which you talked about the rapid acceleration in Rx, but you also talked about the positive impact that you're seeing within your OptumRx business on the specialty side. How do we think about that playing into 2025?\nAndrew Witty: Let me ask John to start, then I'm going to ask Brian, UHC to make a couple of comments, and then we'll come back to Patrick at OptumRx. It's a wide range and set of impacts that you're alluding to. So let me start with John.\nJohn Rex: So just a few comments here and maybe kind of shape some of these messages here. So first of all, in terms of what we would expect to persist, what we expect to subside here. So I'd start with our planning assumptions, as Andrew noted, we're looking for some of these elements here. What was different for us in the quarter than the thoughts we would have had at the end of last quarter is, most notably, what we saw in terms of the rapid increase in the specialty drugs. And we'll get a little bit more to that. There really was a midyear issue. We think really tied into the IRA and the components that shifted for that. And as you look at some of the prescribing patterns that are out, those shifted sharply in the second half of the year. And we would have been planned on some of that happening really more next year. The pull forward in this year was one of those elements that was a bit unexpected. I think the other elements are probably more understood out there. The timing mismatch in Medicaid has been in the conversation, what we've been seeing in the provider in the providing coding intensity also more understood. So maybe we'll go around a little bit to Brian Thompson, let him address some of those elements.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, John. As John mentioned, specialty Rx, again, largely contained to our Medicare Advantage book. And let me start with, I feel very adequately priced for how this will play out in 2025, despite the surprise here in the second half. And you might ask how that's possible. What we had done is planned for the IRA to drive a greater induced utilization as it continued to roll out with the biggest elements being in 2025. Obviously, there's a lower out of pocket maximum for consumers in 2024. We expected that to play out more in 2025. We're seeing that accelerate into 2024, but not at levels that would suggest we're not at levels that would suggest we're not covered for it in 2025. Again, we thought it would be a little more gradual. We've certainly seen some manufacturers doing some promotion. I believe that's also contributing. But, certainly feel good about how we priced for it in 2025 because we did anticipate these step-ups, particularly with the large scale changes and more richness and benefit for consumers that will come to play out in 2025.\nAndrew Witty: Patrick, maybe just reflect on it from an OptumRx position.\nPatrick Conway: In terms of OptumRx, first, I would call out volume where we had a record PBM selling season last year that plays into this year and renewal rates in the high 90s. The growth in mix, including in specialty, drives significant revenue growth for us. I call it pharmacy services, which as you know, Lisa, in our specialty arena, significant growth but also infusion, hospital health system and our community pharmacy platforms, and then new products and services, including around specialty, whether it's Savings IQ, which has saved consumers over $1 billion this year or Price Edge, where we have over 9 million members and saved consumers $125 million or our [wait engage], we've got a number of new products and services around the specialty arena that continue to deliver value to our customers. We're really purpose built to help our customers manage specialty spend.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.\nA.J. Rice: I appreciate the early comments on 2025. I wonder if -- relative to sort of a normal year of 13% to 16% growth, is there any way to sort of size some of the different headwinds and tailwinds you're looking at to formulate what looks like at $30 is about 8% growth?\nAndrew Witty: A.J. thanks so much for the question. Let me just context this a little bit. First off, as you would see in a typical year, we'd always start the year with the plan to obviously deliver but ideally beat and that will continue to be the culture of the organization. We are clearly in an unusual situation right now in terms of the various pressures that we've seen coming externally from particularly government funded reductions and to some extent the continued strength of MedEx cost. Probably net-net, all still somewhat hangover effects of the COVID pandemic still playing through the system, both in terms of volume and also some pressure on unit costs that we've seen, all of which you see in the kind of pressure that we see this year. Now, as we think about 2025, what we're trying to set out here, A.J. is something really important for the long-term future of the company. Those external pressures which we've described, I think, clearly both in the press release and in the commentary this morning, we're being clear about what they are. At the same time, what we mustn't do is pull away from investing in what's going to drive the future of this organization over the next decade. What does that mean? That means, really making sure we're investing in filling out and continuing to build out our value based care platforms. It means really leaning into taking advantage of the technology opportunities, which now exist in reality. So the chance to really modernize our full stack across our organization, transform the way in which we develop new products, give us opportunity to bring forth a new look, OptumInsight based on much newer technologies, give us the opportunity to transform consumer experience, something which is sadly lacking across U.S. healthcare. All of those things are opportunities we sit right now. They sit in the same year, as we have these various headwinds that we've been talking about. And so, what we're doing for 2025 is we're putting in place what we believe is a really responsible plan, really focused on making sure, we don't pull back from investment in the long-term, not shortchanging the next decade. And that's what we're leaning into in terms of making sure our \u201825 plan is responsible for longer term value creation of the organization. Now as I said at the beginning of the response to your good question, A.J., we're always going to go into every cycle aiming to do better than we lay out at the beginning. But I think it's appropriate for us to make sure that we build a plan for 2025, which acknowledges the external pressures and make sure that we retain the capabilities to continue to build what we think is a really distinctive set of capabilities, which will play out very powerfully for the next 10 years. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Thanks for the color on the MLR factors that you called out. When you think about the Q3 MLR unfavorably developing in the quarter, is it fair to think that all three of those factors were about the same? Or would you call out one of them as maybe being larger? And when we think about the coding and utilization management, I guess, operationally, what needs to happen if you're to make progress on this front? I don't think you've attributed much of this to midnight rule to date. Can you update us on whether that changed at all in the quarter? And maybe if not, where the pressure is manifesting on the coating side?\nAndrew Witty: I'm going to ask John to start and then ask Brian to give you a little bit more perspective on that also.\nJohn Rex: And yes, I would say in the quarter versus our initial expectations that we shared with you a quarter ago, it was really they were all roughly in the same zone in terms of impact in the quarter, those elements that we called out kind of give or take, but they're roughly in the same zone as we look at them. Brian?\nBrian Thompson: As it relates to upcoding new inpatient stays versus what we feel is more appropriately build as outpatient, we did expect that behavior to somewhat subside here in the third quarter. Last quarter, we had talked about the timing of that spike being largely related to our own utilization management waivers during the cyber-attack, but it certainly has persisted. As John mentioned at the outset, this is a few large systems driving it. We certainly do remain focused on evaluation of this practice. It's a key part of our utilization management. The difference between an inpatient and outpatient stay is largely borne by our consumers on an already too expensive cost of care in a hospital setting. So we remain vigilant on focusing on this, hoping to see it abate to levels that we're more used to seeing in the past. And we'll continue to review this as we look forward. Right, Brian. Thanks so much. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: There seem to be more moving pieces to the Medicare Advantage landscape than usual entering 2025. So maybe can you just take a step back and speak to your strategy over the next few years? And specifically, how important is growth in Medicare Advantage to UnitedHealth's overall enterprise strategy? And then maybe a potential weakness from competitors changes how you think about coming to market?\nAndrew Witty: Josh thanks very much for the question. Let me just make a couple of comments and then ask Tim Noll, who leads our MLR business to go a little deeper for you. And obviously, very timely given that today is the first day of the selling season for the new MA year going into 2025. So as you look across the whole of UnitedHealth Group, Medicare Advantage, of course, is a very important part of the business, but it is one of several different pieces of what is really a very diversified group of health care businesses. There are obviously linkages from Medicare Advantage to Optum, in particular obviously through Optum Health and elsewhere. But I would say over time, what you're seeing is as important as MA is, you'll see many other elements of the business continue to grow, and that's critical for the long term the long-term sustainability of the company, of course. That's why we've laid out the five growth pillars of the business over the last two or three years, Josh, as really signpost of where you should expect us to deploy capital. It's where we put our mindshare. It's where we look for opportunities to improve the health care system. So, whether that be in benefit design, whether that be in building our value-based care, bringing new technologies to the marketplace, transforming and modernizing pharmacy or bringing forward what ought to be a state-of-the-art financial services capability into a part of the economy, which represents 20% of GDP. Those are the five growth areas of the company. MA is an important element within all of that, but it is one of several key opportunities for us to drive forward. Having said all of that, as we come into this cycle, I think, what we're seeing is the benefits of some very thoughtful, calm, not over reactive planning last year. I think the way in which the team led us through 2024 in terms of benefit design has proven out to be on balance, right, given the very, very many moving parts that you correctly alluded to. I think that sets us up in a good place in terms of how we enter this year. We'll see how this cycle goes. I'll ask Tim to give more comment. But most importantly, it really gives us confidence as we look out over the next four or five years that we're not we don't feel like we're having to fix significant problems that were avoided, if you will, that we didn't make those step mistakes a year ago, which is always a thing to worry about in this situation. We have a lot of moving parts. It's critical not to be over reactive. It's critical to be very much consumer patient centric, and that's really been the guidepost that we followed. And I think it served us well. Tim, I think, is going to serve us well this year.\nTim Noel: Thanks, Josh, for the question. Yes, and I would underscore some of the pieces that Andrew mentioned. And also, yes, it is a very dynamic period right now in the Medicare marketplace. But our strategy and our vision here for the business really doesn't change a lot. I'll just underscore a couple of those that are key to this environment today. One is that, we've always had a long-term planning view and that's never more important than it is today. Right now, that includes a very rational response in any particular year to the revenue pressures that the program is facing. You saw that play out for us in \u201824; you'll see that continue to play out. As Andrew alluded to, that ensures that we don't have any deferred maintenance and pricing carryover into a subsequent year, given the environment that we're in. Along with that, we always strive to provide as much stability as possible to consumers in any one year. In this year, in 2025, that has meant preserving PCP co-pays of $0 for our consumers, and trying to do what we can to make sure that co-pays are near zero for the most commonly prescribed medications as well. And then also to preserve as much choice as possible that we have for consumers that's really important for Medicare beneficiary that we design products and plans that meet their needs and listening to what consumers want will always be a core element as well. Lastly, and this is really important is, this environment is continuing to create more value. And the headline there is around our partnership with our value-based care providers. That's the best opportunity for us to continue to create value in light of some of the pressures that the program is facing and we continue to see great opportunities there. And that's what we're leaning into right now. Finally, the newest technologies that are emerging around AI and ML are giving us some really nice opportunities to provide more efficiencies in our operation and be able to pass those efficiencies along to beneficiaries and then be another and there'd be another considerable way that we offset some of the headwinds of the program. So yes, very dynamic environment, but really our strategy and some of the core principles and foundations of our Medicare Advantage programs don't change.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Tim. And I just want to thank Tim and his team for if you just step back, Josh, and you're super well aware of this. And you just look at the amount of regulatory change, change in funding dynamics, IRA coming into the marketplace, insufficient growth coefficient in terms of future MA funding on top of V28 cuts. What Tim's team has done is basically try to neutralize a lot of that volatility and noise in terms of how it flows through to touch patients and members. It's really important that stability, never more important to have that -- than in this cycle we're in right now. Because otherwise you would see tremendous amount of, I think, disturbing volatility flow through into the market. And we're not going to do that. We are going to put our patients and our members first. We're going to strive to do everything we possibly can to give them a fantastic experience. By working with Optum, we believe that for many of those patients, we can introduce them to an unparalleled set of quality outcomes, both in terms of care and cost and experience. And that work has never been more valuable than when you see the kind of volatility that we've seen last year. And we're going to see again next year because of the things that have already been announced. And what you're seeing us plan for is how to work through that. We're not going to sacrifice long-term potential of all of what we've built in this short period of volatility. What we're going to do is work to insulate members, make sure that members have great experience. And today is the first sell in day and hopefully, lots of folks are going to be picking up the line to UHC today. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Given all the volatility you've been -- we've seen in the sector, I was hoping you could share with us some incremental color on how your Medicaid business ex Duals and your Medicare Advantage business including Duals are performing in the third quarter and for the full year of 2024 relative to target margins. And maybe also give us some color on the expected pace of potential improvement that's implied within 2025 guidance, if there is any improvement expected?\nAndrew Witty: Let me ask Brian to respond.\nBrian Thompson: Let me start with Duals, and I would say we remain very encouraged about the outlook for our duals business. Certainly, about the position of those products as we approach 2025, I think that will be a growth element for us. Inside 2024, obviously, we talked about it in our prepared remarks last quarter as well as this quarter. One of the three items contributing is the pressure we see from redeterminations. And that's obviously impacting our Medicaid book. I'd like to say that we probably weathered the storm on the volume impact of redeterminations, and that's now behind us. What we're really looking at now is how do these rates catch up to where our current cost trends are. And I think we've seen some strong momentum with our state partners, but it's not yet responsive to the trends that we're seeing real time. And we're hopeful that through our partnership and our advocacy that we'll close this gap on funding at a faster rate than maybe normal rating cycles would suggest. But the key items in the quarter, again, were just higher volumes of disenrollment. And if I was to point to one element beyond just the traditional acuity of those that left and those that stayed that we had planned for, I'd point to behavioral care. Many of our states have looked to us to expand access to behavioral care. And I think many of us that partner with our states have done so. That does have some cost implications. So we're really hopeful that these states will be more responsive than traditional rating cycles would suggest and that we'll see these tailwinds soon as we pace through this big year again of largely the volume being the driver of the implications in year and now hopeful that we'll see these rating cycles catch up to our cost trends that we're seeing emerge.\nAndrew Witty : Great. Brian thanks so much. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel : I was hoping just to toggle over to the commercial business and how some of those -- I guess, those three elements, obviously, excluding the Medicaid one, but the other two elements that you talked about that were -- costs were coming in higher than expected. Just if you could maybe sort of bifurcate that between commercial group and then commercial individual and I guess how you're seeing those flow through into both of those markets. And then just on the individual side, just how that informs your view on how you've priced your exchange products for 2025, and sort of comfort with the margin trajectory there?\nAndrew Witty : Let me ask Brian to give you kind of an overarching view and then maybe pass to Dan Kueter to give you a little deeper on the commercial business.\nBrian Thompson : Yes, Scott, thanks for the question, it provides me an opportunity to clarify. The three items that we mentioned at the outset and throughout really aren't a part of our commercial business. What we've talked about, obviously, redeterminations in the Medicaid space and the other pressure points around inpatient stays and specialty -- largely around Medicare Advantage. I feel really good about not only our performance, but our cost management inside our commercial business, and I'll hand it to Dan Keuter, our CEO of that business.\nDaniel Kueter : I can offer that in the exchange business, as you asked about, our pricing is respectful of the brand and the other market dynamics in that space, which include our product offering, our geographic footprint and the competitive environment. For 2025, we have priced with a forward view of our cost in full respect for trend. As Brian and John have noted, those impacts that are driving some trend in the government programs are not applicable to the commercial business, whether that be on the individual side or the group side. So our outlook on trend for 2025 is consistent with our view for 2024, and the drivers in the commercial business remain the things that we have discussed for some time now: provider unit cost, pharmacy cost and enabling expanded access to behavioral health services. So those have been the driver in '24. We expect those to continue into '25. And we have priced both the individual business and the group business with full respect and awareness of those trend items.\nAndrew Witty : Dan, thank you so much. And really, the two elements that Dan just raised there, the pharmacy unit cost and utilization, and of course, the hospital unit cost, are two kind of strategic areas that we really want to lean into. And we've been very outspoken for years about the need to bring down a list price of drugs. We continue to advocate very strongly for that. Until that happens, we continue to utilize all of the tools at our disposal through OptumRx to try and bring down those costs on behalf of our members and on behalf of the companies who we serve within the commercial books of business. We're also exploiting as much as we possibly can, opportunities to be leaders in how we think about biosimilar adoption and how we create wraparound programs on important areas like weight loss. All of which are designed to try and bring down essentially the ever kind of increase in inflationary pressure that we see from the drug bill, and that's an important one. The second one Dan referred to is hospital unit costs. And we've seen really some unusually aggressive and high unit cost asks, we are very much -- we fully recognize the critical role of the hospital systems and hospitals, obviously, within the care delivery environment. But we need to -- we want to continue to work to try and find new compact, a new way of working with hospitals. We want to see less abrasion in the marketplace. We believe that ought to come with more competitive rates in the marketplace. We see a critical role for hospitals as acuity needs rise and rise. But at the same time, we see great opportunity for us to partner with the right health systems to create much better value for money for the overall system. So the two areas we really want to be a willing partner to innovate. And whether that be with drug companies who are interested in new ways of working to bring down cost or whether that's with hospital systems who want to work with us to reimagine what the patient experience, the doctor experiences, and all part of bringing down the unit cost, those are areas that are super important for the long run and it's going to be a space where you're going to see us continue to be very active in terms of putting forward ideas, trying -- piloting new approaches. The national gold card program I mentioned 30 minutes ago, is just one example, and we're going to continue to look for those sorts of opportunities.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes : Could you talk a little bit about OptumHealth? And I had three points there. If you could talk a little bit about some of the drivers of margin improvement in the quarter. If you talk about the outlook for \u201825 for risk contracting. In particular, what things might be driving that as far as adoption in MA and if you're seeing adoption in other segments like employer. And then maybe a sort of related question, are you seeing any other responses in the employer segment to the high premium inflation environment that's out there, like PBC adoption, but also things like binder or whatever?\nAndrew Witty : Let me ask John just to comment on margin. And I'd like to go to Dr. Desai, who looks after OptumHealth, on your second two points, if that's okay.\nJohn Rex : A few things benefiting Optum here is as it continues to progress. Let's start with -- now this is roughly a $100 billion a year business that we've been building over the past decade or so, advancing strongly along the way and we're able to make refinements in the business as we look ahead and such. So that is -- you should expect us to see us continue to refine the portfolio that we are in the types of businesses that we're in. What is OptumHealth is mostly a care delivery business at this point versus kind of what it was maybe even five years ago. And so you should continue to see us focus the portfolio strongly on that. So we'll focus the portfolio on those businesses that make a lot of sense for us, and we will not be in businesses that don't hang as tightly with the theme we have in value-based care and where we're heading for this business for the next decade. In addition to legacy elements in there, such as maybe contracts and such that needed refinements that have been in there for a while and so moving those along, also getting them into a better zone. So really, the company performing very strongly, fundamentally in here and the type of engagement they're having with the people that they serve at OptumHealth. And Dr. Desai and his team and how they've advanced that with the engagement of the most complex patients. Those are the fundamental drivers of how that business has performed. And then our job is to make sure that we refine the portfolio, refine the elements here as we look ahead for the next decade and build.\nAndrew Witty : Great. Thanks, John. And Amar?\nAmar Desai : So first of all, we feel very good about the overall performance of OptumHealth. We are continuing to execute against our three year plan that we put in place in 2023, focused on medical cost management and affordability initiatives, clinical engagement, our operating cost management activities and then accelerated diversified growth in some of our services businesses. On that point, in particular, with services, we're pleased with the growth in our OptumServe business, where we've had new product launches in the areas of medical disability exams that have resonated very well in the marketplace and have contributed to a leading position as a clinical provider for the largest government and federal agencies in the country. As it relates to your broader question around growth across payers, we have strong relationships with over 100 planned partners and are poised to execute on a broad, diverse growth agenda. In fact, in this dynamic rate environment and benefit environment we've discussed here, we're actually seeing increased outreach from payers who are looking for really an enduring partner who can operate in capitated arrangements. In particular, a number of productive discussions ongoing around funding and market level planning as we plan for AEP, but also in other lines of business. And foundational to all of these conversations is really first and foremost, the quality of our providers anchored in the community, particularly our ability to achieve clinical outcomes, including closing gaps in care for Stars programs and HEDIS measures, the strength of that network in the geographies that plan partners are looking to grow in, and then continued focus around our clinical engagement. In fact, year-to-date, we've engaged over 80% of our members. 90% year-to-date for our highest risk members. So when I take that together, great momentum and strength to not only grow but grow in a broad and diverse way across multiple lines of business.\nAndrew Witty : Amar, thank you very much. And I'm going to ask Heather in a second just to give a little bit of perspective from Hersey the Head of Optum in terms of the value-based care ambition and where we're looking to take that particularly as it differentiates. But both Heather and I have recently been out with some of our key commercial clients, and it's been striking to me the rise in interest and -- it's a beginning, I think but the rise in interest for some commercial employers to start to explore moving to value based as an alternative. And I do think that we're going to see that start to move forward now. It's one of the reasons we've been investing heavily in some new groups, I'll call out particularly Kelsey-Seybold who joined Optum just a couple of years ago. They're really good at the leading edge of that kind of model. And I do think that we're going to see -- Lance, to your good question, I think we're going to see that start to evolve over the next few years. And we're certainly starting to see the beginnings of important employers begin to ask those questions. And there are obviously some who already do it, and I'd expect to see that trend accelerate as we go forward. But Heather, it'd be good just to share a little bit how you're viewing the overall value-based care kind of point of differentiation, maybe from a member perspective and the like.\nHeather Cianfrocco : And just maybe, Lance, thanks for the opportunity. I think you're right, you're seeing -- in this dynamic environment and a complex funding environment, you're seeing the value proposition of the value-based care in the sense that Amar described it, not just for those plan sponsors that predominantly take risk for Medicare Advantage, but we're seeing it from employers as well direct to employer. And I think the principles of it, as Andrew said, is one, they're looking for alternatives that give clear predictability. They're looking for a better member holistic experience and that means integrating their wellness programs, it means better answers and closer proximity to the wraparound services they need, including behavioral health and at times home based services. And it means, again, more predictability and the ability to invest dollars in other areas of well-being and health for our employers. The other thing I'd point out is not only to Amar's point are we continuing to invest in value-based care. And with every month, we see more aligned physicians with better tools, with better platforms with increased signals and incentives to ensure that they're focused on the outcomes and the affordability of our members. And you're seeing that show through in OptumHealth's performance. But don't forget the other services, they -- across Optum, also help our payers and our employers, including our risk and quality services that we offer through OptumInsight. Those are the administrative and clinical services, they're more high-powered, they're more universal. We're using AI to bring down the cost of those and increase the universes. And in OptumRx, OptumRx PBM services, if the employer or the plan wants it, is a value-based accountable construct. They can do a pass-through where they manage the cost or they can do an accountable construct, when we talk about our clear guarantee programs. We take the risk for all of those services, including the specialty services. Now it's really important to note, I think this is incredibly important that with guarantee or accountability, our clients don't lose transparency. OptumRx stands for transparency, but we're trying to make it simpler and we're trying to take accountability. So I would point to the value-based services across Optum and say, yes, they're resonating with payers. We're seeing that, and that's why we're so optimistic about our long-term value proposition. But every other service that Optum offers through Insight, through the Bank and throughout OptumRx contributes to that value-based mission and helps all of our clients, payers, state customers, federal customers, employers and should benefit our consumers with better outcomes and with a better experience.\nAndrew Witty : Heather, thanks so much. And Lance, thanks again for the question.\nOperator: We'll go next to [Joanna Gaik] with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: So I just have a follow-up question on the OptumHealth discussion sites question was about margins. But I want to ask about revenues. In the quarter, the revenues actually did decline sequentially quarter-over-quarter from second quarter about 4%. So -- and I know there was a commentary around streamlining the portfolio and some contracts. So, is that sequential decline and a fraction that you -- there was something that actually did already take place in the third quarter in terms of exiting maybe some underperforming contracts or business lines? So can you comment on that? And I guess, were margins also benefiting from investment income and to what degree? And then I guess for the quarter, real question is about trying to ask again what you assume for margins in OptumHealth next year?\nAndrew Witty : Let me -- I think actually the sequential is a pretty straightforward explanation, let me just ask John to give you a little detail on that.\nJohn Rex : On, yes, so the refinements that I was discussing would be the primary impact in terms of the sequential and what you're seeing sequentially in terms of revenues. And as we continue to refine the portfolio, refine contracts, legacy contracts that might be out there and work ahead on that. That would be the really prime component that we'd see in there.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nSarah James : I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on OptumInsight. So excluding change, how are -- how is the sales pipeline and margins going versus your expectations on the non-change business? And then on change specifically, as we think about its transition into 2025, is that business an earnings drag? And how should we think about the revenue being a headwind or a tailwind compared to '24?\nAndrew Witty : Sarah, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Roger Connor, who leads OptumInsight, to give you a little deeper on this. But I just want to thank and acknowledge that the tech team and the OptumInsight team more broadly for the extraordinary response to the change attack, and Joe shared you in a second, the great progress we've made in recovery in that business. Continues to be -- work to do, obviously, bringing back all the clients who we asked to go work with other folks during the attack. We did the right thing in terms of protecting the system and encouraging people to find alternatives. We're now bringing them back. We've made a huge step forward in that. That work will continue as we roll into New Year, as you heard in the introductory comments, but great progress on that. And the speed at which we will to rebuild a modern platform has been just extraordinary. And I think actually bodes very well for us in the future in terms of how we think about our speed of technical modernization as an organization. More broadly, I think it's also given us the stimulus to really, really reimagine what the future of OptumInsight is going to be, and I'll pass it now to Roger to give you a little more detail on just where we are on the recovery and, more importantly, on the non-change modernization aspects.\nRoger Connor : Thanks, Andrew, and thanks very much for the question. I think hopefully, you're going to get a sense of the confidence we feel in OptumInsight going into 2025 as we move through the change event. Maybe if I just start there, first of all, with the cyber recovery and in terms of the progress that's been going well. From a Q3 perspective, you'll see that the business disruption reduced quarter-on-quarter. I suppose where we're focused through the first half of the year has really been on the restoration of the systems, and we've made very good progress. Not really, it's all about reconnecting our customers. And as John shared, we are seeing slightly higher business disruption trend going into the end of the year, and some of that will carry over. Maybe just a couple of reasons to a little bit deeper as to why that's happening. From a reconnection perspective, customers are coming back. We're actually making good progress there. What we're seeing is the volume that's coming back isn't coming back to the pre-attack levels. And customers are really looking for vendor redundancy, what they're out there looking for is in another one or two sources of their software systems, for example. Now we understand that. We think that's a good thing for the health system, but that is having an impact on us this year. But that also creates an opportunity for us. We've got an opportunity to go out and get new customers or sales and become an additional supplier for them. So again, that's a focus. That's going to take a little bit longer, a slightly more complex implementation time. So when you add those to factors together, that's why you see that carryover impact into 2025. I think it's important just to understand just the scope of OptumInsight overall. Because if you look at our core business outside of change, which is the vast majority of OptumInsight, that's where we're feeling very confident around the opportunities that we've got through the end of this year and going into next year. And you can see that we're performing well. We've got momentum. You can see that in our operating earnings in terms of outperformance in terms of our growth year-to-year when you adjust for change. That confidence comes really in a couple of areas. One, the market needs us. The payer and provider markets are where we see real opportunity. There's significant cost pressure in that client base, and they really see our services and software as a bit of a sweet spot. That's where we can help and provide their solutions. And then where I'm actually most excited is what we're going to do in innovation and what we're doing in innovation to accelerate currently, because we're building off that new modernized tech environment that we've built this year at Insight. And we're using AI to not only transform the functionality of our current products, like payment integrity revenue cycle, but to create these differentiated products and creating this exciting portfolio of AI-driven innovations. Now the good news about Insight is that we can go and test those with our partners with UnitedHealthcare, we test them with OptumHealth. We conclude our big health system partnerships. That allows us to test these things quickly and bring them to market fast. And you're going to see us doing that more as we go into next year. So when I add that underlying market opportunity, I add that this AI-fueled acceleration of innovation, that's why I think that we've got -- we're really set up well going into 2025 and for our performance next year.\nAndrew Witty : Great. Thanks, Roger.\nOperator: We'll go next to Andrew Mok with Barclays.\nAndrew Mok : SG&A has been a strong contributor to earnings this year. Just curious how we should think about the permanency of some of those cost changes as we look forward to 2025. Is there anything that you would call out as being more temporary in nature?\nAndrew Witty : Listen, I think you should expect us to be very, very disciplined around cost management. And again, I want to go back to first principles. I'll take you back to the investor conference last year in New York. I stood on the stage and I said, look, essentially, what you're seeing from the CMSP28 rate change is a price cut. I mean that's what it is. And the price cut requires us to respond accordingly. And a key piece of that response, if you want to protect members, which we do is we have to take cost down inside the organization, and we have to try and eliminate waste in the MedEx environment outside of the company. So, we have been relentless around how can we find sustainable cost reductions for the organization, particularly in both businesses. You see this year, I'd say, Optum, in particular, has been doing a remarkable job of taking cost out. I think there's more to go, and we will be very relentless about that. And as an organization, we recognize the payer has the right to change the price they want we have to respond. Cost reduction is a key piece of it. And MedEx management is the other key piece, and those are going to be two really important features of the future for the organization in terms of how we robustly respond to all of this. So yes, you should expect more of that and it will be a key piece of the plan going forward. We just have time for one last question, if we could take the last one, please.\nOperator: Yes. We'll take our last question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright : So you mentioned some of the internal investments just around AI and other initiatives into 2025. But what about broader capital deployment? I guess, how should we be thinking about the priorities heading into 2025 in the context of everything that's going on in and otherwise, but also just what's embedded in your expectation share buybacks or otherwise?\nAndrew Witty : And I'll ask John just to comment in a second. But broadly speaking, our capital deployment is going to be very much led by our five growth pillars of focus for the organization. So as you think about that benefits business, obviously, UnitedHealthcare, value-based care, our technology-led opportunities, our pharmacy businesses and of course, financial services. Those are going to be the areas in which we think about capital deployment. Value-based care is really the organizing principle, which binds all of that together. So that's going to be a key kind of element to that also. And then I would add to that, something we talked about over the last two years extensively is consumerization. You should expect us to continue to challenge and push on how we can constantly modernize the consumer experience that we're able to offer. Technology as a facilitator of that, but also philosophy as a facilitator of that, right? The organization is changing. It's biased to being much more consumers in the way it thinks and operates. We want to continue to bring that to life. So those five growth pillars, the opportunities, the technology of the 2020s gives us, and then a shift in emphasis from the company towards a more consumerist experience, those are really the guide points. And then, John, maybe just more broadly summarize beyond that element, if you could for capital.\nJohn Rex : So you should see -- expect our capital deployment agenda remain very much like it has the past many years, focused on expanding the capabilities of the company, orienting how we look at that orienting around our five growth pillars and where we need to be adding capabilities, clearly generating strong returns for shareholders as we deploy that capital. So first and foremost, that's always been the first priority, how can we build new capabilities for the company that will deliver strong returns for shareholders for the next decade and where should we be putting that capital. That will continue very much the same. You shouldn't see any shift on that. That's always first priority. And then we look at other elements there in terms of in share repurchase and dividend and those other elements where we can return capital to shareholders. So you should see that be very, very steady as you look to the decade ahead in terms of how we've always approached this business.\nAndrew Witty: And thank you for the question, and thank you all for your questions this morning. As we look to conclude in this year and further preparing for 2025, we're excited about the future of UnitedHealth Group. We believe we have the focus, the discipline and the adaptability to continue to grow our 13% to 16% long-term target. And we remain, as always, committed to the people we serve. Despite the challenges that we see in the environment externally, we believe at UnitedHealth Group, we have the right mix of people, capabilities, passion and compassion to allow us to not just navigate 2025, but actually in doing so, set the foundations for continued differentiated performance for many years to come. We appreciate very much your attention this morning. Look forward to having the chance to see you in person in New York at our investor conference. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

For 2025, we have priced with a forward view of our cost in full respect for trend. As Brian and John have noted, those impacts that are driving some trend in the government programs are not applicable to the commercial business, whether that be on the individual side or the group side. So our outlook on trend for 2025 is consistent with our view for 2024, and the drivers in the commercial business remain the things that we have discussed for some time now: provider unit cost, pharmacy cost and enabling expanded access to behavioral health services. So those have been the driver in '24. We expect those to continue into '25. And we have priced both the individual business and the group business with full respect and awareness of those trend items."

            "content": "And just maybe, Lance, thanks for the opportunity. I think you're right, you're seeing -- in this dynamic environment and a complex funding environment, you're seeing the value proposition of the value-based care in the sense that Amar described it, not just for those plan sponsors that predominantly take risk for Medicare Advantage, but we're seeing it from employers as well direct to employer. And I think the principles of it, as Andrew said, is one, they're looking for alternatives that give clear predictability. They're looking for a better member holistic experience and that means integrating their wellness programs, it means better answers and closer proximity to the wraparound services they need, including behavioral health and at times home based services. And it means, again, more predictability and the ability to invest dollars in other areas of well-being and health for our employers. The other thing I'd point out is not only to Amar's point are we continuing to invest in value-based care. And with every month, we see more aligned physicians with better tools, with better platforms with increased signals and incentives to ensure that they're focused on the outcomes and the affordability of our members. And you're seeing that show through in OptumHealth's performance. But don't forget the other services, they -- across Optum, also help our payers and our employers, including our risk and quality services that we offer through OptumInsight. Those are the administrative and clinical services, they're more high-powered, they're more universal. We're using AI to bring down the cost of those and increase the universes. And in OptumRx, OptumRx PBM services, if the employer or the plan wants it, is a value-based accountable construct. They can do a pass-through where they manage the cost or they can do an accountable construct, when we talk about our clear guarantee programs. We take the risk for all of those services, including the specialty services. Now it's really important to note, I think this is incredibly important that with guarantee or accountability, our clients don't lose transparency. OptumRx stands for transparency, but we're trying to make it simpler and we're trying to take accountability. So I would point to the value-based services across Optum and say, yes, they're resonating with payers. We're seeing that, and that's why we're so optimistic about our long-term value proposition. But every other service that Optum offers through Insight, through the Bank and throughout OptumRx contributes to that value-based mission and helps all of our clients, payers, state customers, federal customers, employers and should benefit our consumers with better outcomes and with a better experience."

            "name": "Brian Thompson",
            "content": "Sure, John. As John mentioned, specialty Rx, again, largely contained to our Medicare Advantage book. And let me start with, I feel very adequately priced for how this will play out in 2025, despite the surprise here in the second half. And you might ask how that's possible. What we had done is planned for the IRA to drive a greater induced utilization as it continued to roll out with the biggest elements being in 2025. Obviously, there's a lower out of pocket maximum for consumers in 2024. We expected that to play out more in 2025. We're seeing that accelerate into 2024, but not at levels that would suggest we're not at levels that would suggest we're not covered for it in 2025. Again, we thought it would be a little more gradual. We've certainly seen some manufacturers doing some promotion. I believe that's also contributing. But, certainly feel good about how we priced for it in 2025 because we did anticipate these step-ups, particularly with the large scale changes and more richness and benefit for consumers that will come to play out in 2025. As it relates to upcoding new inpatient stays versus what we feel is more appropriately build as outpatient, we did expect that behavior to somewhat subside here in the third quarter. Last quarter, we had talked about the timing of that spike being largely related to our own utilization management waivers during the cyber-attack, but it certainly has persisted. As John mentioned at the outset, this is a few large systems driving it. We certainly do remain focused on evaluation of this practice. It's a key part of our utilization management. The difference between an inpatient and outpatient stay is largely borne by our consumers on an already too expensive cost of care in a hospital setting. So we remain vigilant on focusing on this, hoping to see it abate to levels that we're more used to seeing in the past. And we'll continue to review this as we look forward. Right, Brian. Thanks so much. Next question please. Let me start with Duals, and I would say we remain very encouraged about the outlook for our duals business. Certainly, about the position of those products as we approach 2025, I think that will be a growth element for us. Inside 2024, obviously, we talked about it in our prepared remarks last quarter as well as this quarter. One of the three items contributing is the pressure we see from redeterminations. And that's obviously impacting our Medicaid book. I'd like to say that we probably weathered the storm on the volume impact of redeterminations, and that's now behind us. What we're really looking at now is how do these rates catch up to where our current cost trends are. And I think we've seen some strong momentum with our state partners, but it's not yet responsive to the trends that we're seeing real time. And we're hopeful that through our partnership and our advocacy that we'll close this gap on funding at a faster rate than maybe normal rating cycles would suggest. But the key items in the quarter, again, were just higher volumes of disenrollment. And if I was to point to one element beyond just the traditional acuity of those that left and those that stayed that we had planned for, I'd point to behavioral care. Many of our states have looked to us to expand access to behavioral care. And I think many of us that partner with our states have done so. That does have some cost implications. So we're really hopeful that these states will be more responsive than traditional rating cycles would suggest and that we'll see these tailwinds soon as we pace through this big year again of largely the volume being the driver of the implications in year and now hopeful that we'll see these rating cycles catch up to our cost trends that we're seeing emerge. Yes, Scott, thanks for the question, it provides me an opportunity to clarify. The three items that we mentioned at the outset and throughout really aren't a part of our commercial business. What we've talked about, obviously, redeterminations in the Medicaid space and the other pressure points around inpatient stays and specialty -- largely around Medicare Advantage. I feel really good about not only our performance, but our cost management inside our commercial business, and I'll hand it to Dan Keuter, our CEO of that business."

            "content": "So first of all, we feel very good about the overall performance of OptumHealth. We are continuing to execute against our three year plan that we put in place in 2023, focused on medical cost management and affordability initiatives, clinical engagement, our operating cost management activities and then accelerated diversified growth in some of our services businesses. On that point, in particular, with services, we're pleased with the growth in our OptumServe business, where we've had new product launches in the areas of medical disability exams that have resonated very well in the marketplace and have contributed to a leading position as a clinical provider for the largest government and federal agencies in the country. As it relates to your broader question around growth across payers, we have strong relationships with over 100 planned partners and are poised to execute on a broad, diverse growth agenda. In fact, in this dynamic rate environment and benefit environment we've discussed here, we're actually seeing increased outreach from payers who are looking for really an enduring partner who can operate in capitated arrangements. In particular, a number of productive discussions ongoing around funding and market level planning as we plan for AEP, but also in other lines of business. And foundational to all of these conversations is really first and foremost, the quality of our providers anchored in the community, particularly our ability to achieve clinical outcomes, including closing gaps in care for Stars programs and HEDIS measures, the strength of that network in the geographies that plan partners are looking to grow in, and then continued focus around our clinical engagement. In fact, year-to-date, we've engaged over 80% of our members. 90% year-to-date for our highest risk members. So when I take that together, great momentum and strength to not only grow but grow in a broad and diverse way across multiple lines of business."

        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. As you saw in our release, the people of UnitedHealth Group continue to deliver on our growth pillars. Our teams are providing more people with more high-quality health care services and benefits and restlessly looking for ways to simplify the health system and deliver more value for patients, employers and providers alike. By the end of this year, we will have grown to serve more than 2 million new consumers with commercial offerings, fulfill more than 1.6 billion prescriptions through Optum Rx and care for 4.7 million people in value based arrangements. Our people have done all this and more in a challenging period, navigating the first year of the CMS Medicare rate cuts and its impact on member mix. The effects of the state driven Medicaid member redeterminations, certain novel care patterns and the changed health care cyber-attack. While many of those factors could not have been anticipated, thanks to our people's efforts, we can affirm a full year 2024 earnings outlook still within the range, we first offered back in November 2023. It's a distinctive part of the culture of UnitedHealth Group that we continue to strive to deliver on our financial commitments to you through changing environments and unforeseen challenges. As we look to 2025, and I will address this shortly, we remain in a dynamic period for the healthcare sector. Amid this, it's important that we continue to invest in the durable value creating capabilities of this company that support our 13% to 16% long-term growth objective. We will balance our commitments to investing in the promising future before us with managing the known and potential challenges. We remain highly optimistic for the future, even as we are respectful of the pressures the sector faces again next year. Even within this environment, we're well positioned to continue our growth in the years ahead. I want to highlight two important reasons for this optimism. First is our relentless focus on execution, quality and innovation. In particular, we continue to work tirelessly to improve people's experiences with the health system. To that end, this month, we launched a first of its kind national gold card program, which will reduce the number of prior authorizations by 500,000 every year for qualified in network providers. This can help improve both the quality and the affordability of care while reducing friction in the system. Artificial intelligence is starting to be an important tool in improving our work. Our advanced practice clinicians use AI to summarize lengthy patient histories, freeing up hundreds of hours that can be better spent caring for people. Our nurses use Generative AI to review documentation more efficiently, saving time and improving patient service. AI is helping our consumer advocates, powering tens of millions of consumer interactions and provider searches. This allows our advocates to spend more time with people on more complex inquiries, driving better efficiency while also improving the consumer experience as reflected in higher NPS scores. And finally, using AI to help build software is enabling technology engineering teams to enhance the speed and quality necessary to help drive our technology modernization. Our focus on execution and quality is also evident in the Medicare Advantage plans we are offering for 2025. Once again, we focused on consumer value and as much as possible on benefit stability, even as we navigated the adverse Medicare funding environment. With annual enrollment beginning today, we believe we will continue to be a top choice for consumers. A second element underpinning our growth is delivery on our commitment to the transition of the health system to value based care. For over 20 years, there has been a bipartisan consensus among healthcare experts and policymakers that value based care that is integrated, patient centered and outcome focused care is superior to the often fragmented and unnecessarily expensive fee for service system. Across four presidential administrations, CMS has called for private public innovation in the development of value based care models in Medicare and Medicaid. It provides better outcomes for patients. It saves money for the customers and taxpayers who fund care. And it empowers clinicians to focus on providing the most beneficial care. The rationale for these decades long effort to develop value based care is both simple and sound. It moves from incentives based solely on volume to incentives based on a patient's health outcomes and experience. And it helps ensure patient care is delivered not at the highest cost sites of service, but rather those that combine the highest quality and value. The effectiveness of value based care for patients is proven and powerful and it's good for the system. At UnitedHealth Group, we're purposefully organized to support the transition to value based care. It requires deep engagement with patients, setting the foundation to move setting the foundation to move to more coordinated care, connecting patients to primary care earlier driving clinically accurate diagnoses, more effectively recognizing and managing chronic conditions, and slowing disease progression. We're seeing the benefits of this work come to fruition. People served by OptumHealth's value-based care models are more likely to receive cancer screenings and be in better control of their diabetes and hypertension than people in fee for service in Medicare and 10% less likely to visit the emergency room or be re-admitted to hospital program. One example of the impact of better care coordination is our emergency room space discharge program, which helps patients who may be at risk for unnecessary and expensive ER use and readmissions. We have learned that the specific ways in which a discharge is managed can have a substantial impact on readmissions, which are a problem for both patients and facilities. Our nurse care managers proactively engage the emergency teams to provide them relevant information from the outpatient medical record and to facilitate a safe discharge. This approach, currently in eight markets, is already helping to avoid hundreds of inpatient stays each month. It preserves emergency resources for those, who truly need them, saves money and is a better experience for patients. Our many care offerings now serve people in value-based care arrangements in dozens of service areas, integrating primary, surgical behavioral and home care. These patients come from many diverse payers and employers, a clear sign of confidence from the market that we're on the right track. This is the value proposition of UnitedHealth Group, committed to serving patients, providers, payers and customers with quality, integrity and innovation and joining with federal and state governments in the effort to help to build a better health system that meets the needs of all stakeholders now and into the future. Fundamentally, we continue to grow, because more people and organizations are purchasing more of the products and services we offer. It's a simple statement to make, yet a hard thing to do year in and year out. But it's the enduring reason for our optimism about the long-term growth and future of this enterprise. Now I'll turn it over to John Rex, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Thanks, John. Before we turn to your questions, I want to provide some preliminary observations about next year, which we'll review in more depth at our upcoming investor conference. Perhaps the most important element is that our businesses are operating well and our growth potential remains strong. We see continued momentum in the selling season performance for UnitedHealthcare's commercial business and Optum Rx, which both offer best-in-class innovation and performance for customers. The consumer value proposition of Medicare Advantage continues to be highly compelling and we see strong growth potentially in this market for many years to come. The Optum Health value-based care businesses that we've been building for well over a decade are beginning to approach the very early stages of their potential and will be a key differentiating growth factor in the years ahead. At the same time, and as we build for the future and contemplate our 2025 outlook, we're taking into account several unique dynamics. First, the concurrent timing of the second year of the CMS Medicare rate cuts and the most significant Inflation Reduction Act impacts into a single year and the negative effects of that on the people we serve. Second, within Medicaid, the timing mismatch of state customer rate actions, which do not yet reflect the higher acuity of remaining consumers. And third, a respectful view of the care activity that John noted. We're actively addressing and managing for these and continuing to believe our 2025 planning assumptions appropriately capture these components, though we will be prudent in an initial early view. The majority of those 2025 factors are expected to be most impactful to the UnitedHealthcare businesses. As a result, we anticipate stepping out for 2025 more conservatively than is typical. At this distance, we expect the upper end of the likely range will offer in December has been around $30 per share. As always, we will seek to advance beyond this initial view as the year progresses and we remain committed to and focused on our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth objective. We see 2025 as a year of opportunity in building to that commitment, so you will see us investing in our growth pillars aggressively, modernizing our company with AI and other technologies and always exercising discipline in our operating performance. We look forward to discussing this with you in much greater detail at our Investor Conference on December 4 in New York. Now operator, we'll take some questions. Let me ask John to start, then I'm going to ask Brian, UHC to make a couple of comments, and then we'll come back to Patrick at OptumRx. It's a wide range and set of impacts that you're alluding to. So let me start with John. Patrick, maybe just reflect on it from an OptumRx position. Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. Next question. A.J. thanks so much for the question. Let me just context this a little bit. First off, as you would see in a typical year, we'd always start the year with the plan to obviously deliver but ideally beat and that will continue to be the culture of the organization. We are clearly in an unusual situation right now in terms of the various pressures that we've seen coming externally from particularly government funded reductions and to some extent the continued strength of MedEx cost. Probably net-net, all still somewhat hangover effects of the COVID pandemic still playing through the system, both in terms of volume and also some pressure on unit costs that we've seen, all of which you see in the kind of pressure that we see this year. Now, as we think about 2025, what we're trying to set out here, A.J. is something really important for the long-term future of the company. Those external pressures which we've described, I think, clearly both in the press release and in the commentary this morning, we're being clear about what they are. At the same time, what we mustn't do is pull away from investing in what's going to drive the future of this organization over the next decade. What does that mean? That means, really making sure we're investing in filling out and continuing to build out our value based care platforms. It means really leaning into taking advantage of the technology opportunities, which now exist in reality. So the chance to really modernize our full stack across our organization, transform the way in which we develop new products, give us opportunity to bring forth a new look, OptumInsight based on much newer technologies, give us the opportunity to transform consumer experience, something which is sadly lacking across U.S. healthcare. All of those things are opportunities we sit right now. They sit in the same year, as we have these various headwinds that we've been talking about. And so, what we're doing for 2025 is we're putting in place what we believe is a really responsible plan, really focused on making sure, we don't pull back from investment in the long-term, not shortchanging the next decade. And that's what we're leaning into in terms of making sure our \u201825 plan is responsible for longer term value creation of the organization. Now as I said at the beginning of the response to your good question, A.J., we're always going to go into every cycle aiming to do better than we lay out at the beginning. But I think it's appropriate for us to make sure that we build a plan for 2025, which acknowledges the external pressures and make sure that we retain the capabilities to continue to build what we think is a really distinctive set of capabilities, which will play out very powerfully for the next 10 years. Next question, please. I'm going to ask John to start and then ask Brian to give you a little bit more perspective on that also. Josh thanks very much for the question. Let me just make a couple of comments and then ask Tim Noll, who leads our MLR business to go a little deeper for you. And obviously, very timely given that today is the first day of the selling season for the new MA year going into 2025. So as you look across the whole of UnitedHealth Group, Medicare Advantage, of course, is a very important part of the business, but it is one of several different pieces of what is really a very diversified group of health care businesses. There are obviously linkages from Medicare Advantage to Optum, in particular obviously through Optum Health and elsewhere. But I would say over time, what you're seeing is as important as MA is, you'll see many other elements of the business continue to grow, and that's critical for the long term the long-term sustainability of the company, of course. That's why we've laid out the five growth pillars of the business over the last two or three years, Josh, as really signpost of where you should expect us to deploy capital. It's where we put our mindshare. It's where we look for opportunities to improve the health care system. So, whether that be in benefit design, whether that be in building our value-based care, bringing new technologies to the marketplace, transforming and modernizing pharmacy or bringing forward what ought to be a state-of-the-art financial services capability into a part of the economy, which represents 20% of GDP. Those are the five growth areas of the company. MA is an important element within all of that, but it is one of several key opportunities for us to drive forward. Having said all of that, as we come into this cycle, I think, what we're seeing is the benefits of some very thoughtful, calm, not over reactive planning last year. I think the way in which the team led us through 2024 in terms of benefit design has proven out to be on balance, right, given the very, very many moving parts that you correctly alluded to. I think that sets us up in a good place in terms of how we enter this year. We'll see how this cycle goes. I'll ask Tim to give more comment. But most importantly, it really gives us confidence as we look out over the next four or five years that we're not we don't feel like we're having to fix significant problems that were avoided, if you will, that we didn't make those step mistakes a year ago, which is always a thing to worry about in this situation. We have a lot of moving parts. It's critical not to be over reactive. It's critical to be very much consumer patient centric, and that's really been the guidepost that we followed. And I think it served us well. Tim, I think, is going to serve us well this year. Thanks Tim. And I just want to thank Tim and his team for if you just step back, Josh, and you're super well aware of this. And you just look at the amount of regulatory change, change in funding dynamics, IRA coming into the marketplace, insufficient growth coefficient in terms of future MA funding on top of V28 cuts. What Tim's team has done is basically try to neutralize a lot of that volatility and noise in terms of how it flows through to touch patients and members. It's really important that stability, never more important to have that -- than in this cycle we're in right now. Because otherwise you would see tremendous amount of, I think, disturbing volatility flow through into the market. And we're not going to do that. We are going to put our patients and our members first. We're going to strive to do everything we possibly can to give them a fantastic experience. By working with Optum, we believe that for many of those patients, we can introduce them to an unparalleled set of quality outcomes, both in terms of care and cost and experience. And that work has never been more valuable than when you see the kind of volatility that we've seen last year. And we're going to see again next year because of the things that have already been announced. And what you're seeing us plan for is how to work through that. We're not going to sacrifice long-term potential of all of what we've built in this short period of volatility. What we're going to do is work to insulate members, make sure that members have great experience. And today is the first sell in day and hopefully, lots of folks are going to be picking up the line to UHC today. Next question, please. Let me ask Brian to respond. Great. Brian thanks so much. Next question please. Let me ask Brian to give you kind of an overarching view and then maybe pass to Dan Kueter to give you a little deeper on the commercial business. Dan, thank you so much. And really, the two elements that Dan just raised there, the pharmacy unit cost and utilization, and of course, the hospital unit cost, are two kind of strategic areas that we really want to lean into. And we've been very outspoken for years about the need to bring down a list price of drugs. We continue to advocate very strongly for that. Until that happens, we continue to utilize all of the tools at our disposal through OptumRx to try and bring down those costs on behalf of our members and on behalf of the companies who we serve within the commercial books of business. We're also exploiting as much as we possibly can, opportunities to be leaders in how we think about biosimilar adoption and how we create wraparound programs on important areas like weight loss. All of which are designed to try and bring down essentially the ever kind of increase in inflationary pressure that we see from the drug bill, and that's an important one. The second one Dan referred to is hospital unit costs. And we've seen really some unusually aggressive and high unit cost asks, we are very much -- we fully recognize the critical role of the hospital systems and hospitals, obviously, within the care delivery environment. But we need to -- we want to continue to work to try and find new compact, a new way of working with hospitals. We want to see less abrasion in the marketplace. We believe that ought to come with more competitive rates in the marketplace. We see a critical role for hospitals as acuity needs rise and rise. But at the same time, we see great opportunity for us to partner with the right health systems to create much better value for money for the overall system. So the two areas we really want to be a willing partner to innovate. And whether that be with drug companies who are interested in new ways of working to bring down cost or whether that's with hospital systems who want to work with us to reimagine what the patient experience, the doctor experiences, and all part of bringing down the unit cost, those are areas that are super important for the long run and it's going to be a space where you're going to see us continue to be very active in terms of putting forward ideas, trying -- piloting new approaches. The national gold card program I mentioned 30 minutes ago, is just one example, and we're going to continue to look for those sorts of opportunities. Let me ask John just to comment on margin. And I'd like to go to Dr. Desai, who looks after OptumHealth, on your second two points, if that's okay. Great. Thanks, John. And Amar? Amar, thank you very much. And I'm going to ask Heather in a second just to give a little bit of perspective from Hersey the Head of Optum in terms of the value-based care ambition and where we're looking to take that particularly as it differentiates. But both Heather and I have recently been out with some of our key commercial clients, and it's been striking to me the rise in interest and -- it's a beginning, I think but the rise in interest for some commercial employers to start to explore moving to value based as an alternative. And I do think that we're going to see that start to move forward now. It's one of the reasons we've been investing heavily in some new groups, I'll call out particularly Kelsey-Seybold who joined Optum just a couple of years ago. They're really good at the leading edge of that kind of model. And I do think that we're going to see -- Lance, to your good question, I think we're going to see that start to evolve over the next few years. And we're certainly starting to see the beginnings of important employers begin to ask those questions. And there are obviously some who already do it, and I'd expect to see that trend accelerate as we go forward. But Heather, it'd be good just to share a little bit how you're viewing the overall value-based care kind of point of differentiation, maybe from a member perspective and the like. Heather, thanks so much. And Lance, thanks again for the question. Let me -- I think actually the sequential is a pretty straightforward explanation, let me just ask John to give you a little detail on that. Sarah, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Roger Connor, who leads OptumInsight, to give you a little deeper on this. But I just want to thank and acknowledge that the tech team and the OptumInsight team more broadly for the extraordinary response to the change attack, and Joe shared you in a second, the great progress we've made in recovery in that business. Continues to be -- work to do, obviously, bringing back all the clients who we asked to go work with other folks during the attack. We did the right thing in terms of protecting the system and encouraging people to find alternatives. We're now bringing them back. We've made a huge step forward in that. That work will continue as we roll into New Year, as you heard in the introductory comments, but great progress on that. And the speed at which we will to rebuild a modern platform has been just extraordinary. And I think actually bodes very well for us in the future in terms of how we think about our speed of technical modernization as an organization. More broadly, I think it's also given us the stimulus to really, really reimagine what the future of OptumInsight is going to be, and I'll pass it now to Roger to give you a little more detail on just where we are on the recovery and, more importantly, on the non-change modernization aspects. Great. Thanks, Roger. Listen, I think you should expect us to be very, very disciplined around cost management. And again, I want to go back to first principles. I'll take you back to the investor conference last year in New York. I stood on the stage and I said, look, essentially, what you're seeing from the CMSP28 rate change is a price cut. I mean that's what it is. And the price cut requires us to respond accordingly. And a key piece of that response, if you want to protect members, which we do is we have to take cost down inside the organization, and we have to try and eliminate waste in the MedEx environment outside of the company. So, we have been relentless around how can we find sustainable cost reductions for the organization, particularly in both businesses. You see this year, I'd say, Optum, in particular, has been doing a remarkable job of taking cost out. I think there's more to go, and we will be very relentless about that. And as an organization, we recognize the payer has the right to change the price they want we have to respond. Cost reduction is a key piece of it. And MedEx management is the other key piece, and those are going to be two really important features of the future for the organization in terms of how we robustly respond to all of this. So yes, you should expect more of that and it will be a key piece of the plan going forward. We just have time for one last question, if we could take the last one, please. And I'll ask John just to comment in a second. But broadly speaking, our capital deployment is going to be very much led by our five growth pillars of focus for the organization. So as you think about that benefits business, obviously, UnitedHealthcare, value-based care, our technology-led opportunities, our pharmacy businesses and of course, financial services. Those are going to be the areas in which we think about capital deployment. Value-based care is really the organizing principle, which binds all of that together. So that's going to be a key kind of element to that also. And then I would add to that, something we talked about over the last two years extensively is consumerization. You should expect us to continue to challenge and push on how we can constantly modernize the consumer experience that we're able to offer. Technology as a facilitator of that, but also philosophy as a facilitator of that, right? The organization is changing. It's biased to being much more consumers in the way it thinks and operates. We want to continue to bring that to life. So those five growth pillars, the opportunities, the technology of the 2020s gives us, and then a shift in emphasis from the company towards a more consumerist experience, those are really the guide points. And then, John, maybe just more broadly summarize beyond that element, if you could for capital. And thank you for the question, and thank you all for your questions this morning. As we look to conclude in this year and further preparing for 2025, we're excited about the future of UnitedHealth Group. We believe we have the focus, the discipline and the adaptability to continue to grow our 13% to 16% long-term target. And we remain, as always, committed to the people we serve. Despite the challenges that we see in the environment externally, we believe at UnitedHealth Group, we have the right mix of people, capabilities, passion and compassion to allow us to not just navigate 2025, but actually in doing so, set the foundations for continued differentiated performance for many years to come. We appreciate very much your attention this morning. Look forward to having the chance to see you in person in New York at our investor conference. Thank you."

            "content": "In terms of OptumRx, first, I would call out volume where we had a record PBM selling season last year that plays into this year and renewal rates in the high 90s. The growth in mix, including in specialty, drives significant revenue growth for us. I call it pharmacy services, which as you know, Lisa, in our specialty arena, significant growth but also infusion, hospital health system and our community pharmacy platforms, and then new products and services, including around specialty, whether it's Savings IQ, which has saved consumers over $1 billion this year or Price Edge, where we have over 9 million members and saved consumers $125 million or our [wait engage], we've got a number of new products and services around the specialty arena that continue to deliver value to our customers. We're really purpose built to help our customers manage specialty spend."
        },
        "speaker8": {
            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. Strong growth across the company sets us up well to deliver upon our commitments to you. Amid all the puts and takes of this unusual year, we are seeing what we always look for. New products and innovations taking root among customers, more people being served through our services and continued improvement in the experience people have. These are key to our long-term success. I'll start today by offering some observations on care activity patterns, as we know that is most likely top of mind for many of you. Certain care patterns persisted at higher levels than we expected in the period for three specific and we believe primarily transitory reasons, two of which we noted last quarter. First, the still pronounced upshift in coding intensity by hospitals, which we flagged last quarter. In some cases, the coding actions are extreme. Certain entities have been notably and persistently aggressive, having up shifted their coding intensity factors by more than 20%. We are actively addressing this unnecessary additional cost burden to the health system. The second item, also noted last quarter, is the continued timing mismatch between the current health status of Medicaid members and state rate updates. States often use care activity data that is well over a year old in setting their rates. That typically has minimal impact when member mix levels are relatively stable. But with eligibility redetermination significantly shifting, both the number and average acuity of people covered has changed. As a result of the lagging care activity data as well as the annual rate cycle timing, updates remain well short of current care activity, a factor that for us was more pronounced through the period than anticipated. A third item that emerged more substantially in the period was a rather rapid acceleration in the prescribing of certain high cost specialty medications, primarily those used to treat cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders and cancer. We believe a contributing factor to the acceleration was the Inflation Reduction Act, which eliminated the individual coinsurance requirement during the catastrophic coverage phase. As many of you know, more people enter this phase in the second half of the year. While we anticipated this will become a more meaningful factor in 2025, drug manufacturer campaigns pulled some of this activity into this year more sharply than anticipated. With that, let's turn to our Q3 results. Revenues of $101 billion grew more than 9% over the prior year, with strong growth again at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. OptumHealth revenues grew by over $2 billion and are approaching $26 billion. This was driven by an increase in both the number and type of care services we offer and the patients we serve, especially in the home and among those with complex needs. OptumRx revenues grew by over $5 billion to more than $34 billion driven by strength in our pharmacy care offerings, as well as growth in pharmacy benefits management from new customers and expanding specialty services. OptumInsight revenues in the quarter were stable, approaching $5 billion and the nearly $33 billion revenue backlog increased by more than $1 billion from last year. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Our domestic commercial business has added more than 2.4 million people through the third quarter. Selling season indications are tracking favorably as we head into \u201825, reflecting continued strong uptake of UnitedHealthcare's innovative offerings. Our Medicare Advantage plans on offer this fall balance providing as much benefit stability as possible for seniors, while contending with the CMS funding cuts, IRA changes and expected care patterns. The initial stars ratings for plan year \u201826 for consumers in four-star or better rated plans is largely consistent with what we saw in our initial results last year. As has been the case in recent years, we expect these percentages to increase. In Medicaid, our new state customer expansion and retention performance remains strong, including recent awards in Massachusetts, Colorado, Rhode Island, Florida and Michigan. We hope to continue to support people and families in the post-redeterminations period and are advocating with states to ensure adequate funding and resources for these often underserved people. Our capital capacities remain strong and continue to underpin our long-term growth objectives. In the quarter, cash flows from operations were $14 billion or 2.2x net income and year-to-date we're nearly $22 billion. So far this year, we have returned $9.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase. Additionally, we have invested more than $11 billion in a wide range of strategic opportunities; including updating and extending our long standing and productive relationship with AARP to better serve older Americans. As highlighted last quarter, after the cyber-attack, we prioritized devoting resources to support care providers, over some activities such as share repurchase. Payments and claim flows for most care providers have normalized, and repayment of these capital advances is underway. Regarding Change Healthcare, for full year '24, we now estimate the business disruption costs will be about $0.75 per share, an increase of $0.10 from the former midpoint. As you may recall, business disruption largely encompasses the loss of revenues combined with the cost of keeping these capabilities fully ready to serve. These effects are not excluded from adjusted earnings. We continue to work with customers to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and to win new business with our now more modern, secure and capable offerings. We expect to continue to build back the business to pre-attack levels over the course of '25 and estimate next year's full year impact will be roughly half of the '24 level. As we enter the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing our '24 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $27.50 to $27.75 to reflect business disruption impacts and the care patterns we discussed. Our company's ability to deliver within the range of the commitments established nearly a year ago, even in challenging circumstances is another example of the discipline and innovation of the enterprise and the confidence we have in delivering diverse growth for the long-term. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew. So just a few comments here and maybe kind of shape some of these messages here. So first of all, in terms of what we would expect to persist, what we expect to subside here. So I'd start with our planning assumptions, as Andrew noted, we're looking for some of these elements here. What was different for us in the quarter than the thoughts we would have had at the end of last quarter is, most notably, what we saw in terms of the rapid increase in the specialty drugs. And we'll get a little bit more to that. There really was a midyear issue. We think really tied into the IRA and the components that shifted for that. And as you look at some of the prescribing patterns that are out, those shifted sharply in the second half of the year. And we would have been planned on some of that happening really more next year. The pull forward in this year was one of those elements that was a bit unexpected. I think the other elements are probably more understood out there. The timing mismatch in Medicaid has been in the conversation, what we've been seeing in the provider in the providing coding intensity also more understood. So maybe we'll go around a little bit to Brian Thompson, let him address some of those elements. And yes, I would say in the quarter versus our initial expectations that we shared with you a quarter ago, it was really they were all roughly in the same zone in terms of impact in the quarter, those elements that we called out kind of give or take, but they're roughly in the same zone as we look at them. Brian? A few things benefiting Optum here is as it continues to progress. Let's start with -- now this is roughly a $100 billion a year business that we've been building over the past decade or so, advancing strongly along the way and we're able to make refinements in the business as we look ahead and such. So that is -- you should expect us to see us continue to refine the portfolio that we are in the types of businesses that we're in. What is OptumHealth is mostly a care delivery business at this point versus kind of what it was maybe even five years ago. And so you should continue to see us focus the portfolio strongly on that. So we'll focus the portfolio on those businesses that make a lot of sense for us, and we will not be in businesses that don't hang as tightly with the theme we have in value-based care and where we're heading for this business for the next decade. In addition to legacy elements in there, such as maybe contracts and such that needed refinements that have been in there for a while and so moving those along, also getting them into a better zone. So really, the company performing very strongly, fundamentally in here and the type of engagement they're having with the people that they serve at OptumHealth. And Dr. Desai and his team and how they've advanced that with the engagement of the most complex patients. Those are the fundamental drivers of how that business has performed. And then our job is to make sure that we refine the portfolio, refine the elements here as we look ahead for the next decade and build. On, yes, so the refinements that I was discussing would be the primary impact in terms of the sequential and what you're seeing sequentially in terms of revenues. And as we continue to refine the portfolio, refine contracts, legacy contracts that might be out there and work ahead on that. That would be the really prime component that we'd see in there. So you should see -- expect our capital deployment agenda remain very much like it has the past many years, focused on expanding the capabilities of the company, orienting how we look at that orienting around our five growth pillars and where we need to be adding capabilities, clearly generating strong returns for shareholders as we deploy that capital. So first and foremost, that's always been the first priority, how can we build new capabilities for the company that will deliver strong returns for shareholders for the next decade and where should we be putting that capital. That will continue very much the same. You shouldn't see any shift on that. That's always first priority. And then we look at other elements there in terms of in share repurchase and dividend and those other elements where we can return capital to shareholders. So you should see that be very, very steady as you look to the decade ahead in terms of how we've always approached this business."

            "content": "Thanks, Josh, for the question. Yes, and I would underscore some of the pieces that Andrew mentioned. And also, yes, it is a very dynamic period right now in the Medicare marketplace. But our strategy and our vision here for the business really doesn't change a lot. I'll just underscore a couple of those that are key to this environment today. One is that, we've always had a long-term planning view and that's never more important than it is today. Right now, that includes a very rational response in any particular year to the revenue pressures that the program is facing. You saw that play out for us in \u201824; you'll see that continue to play out. As Andrew alluded to, that ensures that we don't have any deferred maintenance and pricing carryover into a subsequent year, given the environment that we're in. Along with that, we always strive to provide as much stability as possible to consumers in any one year. In this year, in 2025, that has meant preserving PCP co-pays of $0 for our consumers, and trying to do what we can to make sure that co-pays are near zero for the most commonly prescribed medications as well. And then also to preserve as much choice as possible that we have for consumers that's really important for Medicare beneficiary that we design products and plans that meet their needs and listening to what consumers want will always be a core element as well. Lastly, and this is really important is, this environment is continuing to create more value. And the headline there is around our partnership with our value-based care providers. That's the best opportunity for us to continue to create value in light of some of the pressures that the program is facing and we continue to see great opportunities there. And that's what we're leaning into right now. Finally, the newest technologies that are emerging around AI and ML are giving us some really nice opportunities to provide more efficiencies in our operation and be able to pass those efficiencies along to beneficiaries and then be another and there'd be another considerable way that we offset some of the headwinds of the program. So yes, very dynamic environment, but really our strategy and some of the core principles and foundations of our Medicare Advantage programs don't change."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are. Some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under US federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amount is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company's investor relations page at www.unitedhealthgroupcom. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our form 8-K dated July 16, 2024, which may be accessed from the investor relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The second quarter results we reported today reflect diversified and durable growth and a commitment to ensuring high quality care is available to every person we're privileged to serve. In the first half of the year, revenues grew by nearly $14 billion, with strong contributions from across the enterprise, led by double-digit growth at Optum. UnitedHealth Group entered the second half of the year with continuing and broad-based growth momentum. As a result, we are affirming our full year adjusted earnings outlook even as we absorb $0.60 to $0.70 per share in business disruption impacts related to the cyberattack. These results come from the sustained focus of the 400,000 people of UnitedHealth Group on adding value for patients, consumers and customers through the fundamental execution of our key priorities. We're also well positioned for growth in 2025. In the selling season to date, the most sophisticated thoughtful buyers of health benefits and services in the US, such as large employers, unions, states, seniors, all continue to choose the offerings of UnitedHealth Group, when they're looking for managed care, pharmacy services or a Medicare Advantage plan that provides the best value. This consistent growth reflects customers' recognition of the need for a company like ours. As you know, UnitedHealth Group strives to help reduce the fragmentation and lack of coordination that drives up costs and erodes care outcomes in the $5 trillion US healthcare marketplace. We aim to better coordinate and align incentives among caregivers, payers, and pharmacy, enabling us to focus on the whole patient throughout their health journey. We believe this increases value for customers and consumers, improves people's experience and health, reduces redundancies and waste, and ultimately leads to a more sustainable health system. For example, the proven health and economic value to consumers and taxpayers of Medicare Advantage. A recent study by Milliman found that the cost of taxpayers of Medicare Advantage is 4% less than traditional fee-for-service Medicare. At the same time, Medicare Advantage provides seniors well over $2,000 per year in additional value through lower out-of-pocket cost and important services like dental, vision and hearing, none of which fee-for-service Medicare covers. That means a lot to the majority of the people Medicare Advantage serves, who have limited economic resources and otherwise would lack access to such services. The home visits we offer seniors further illustrate the value of MA. Last year, our medical professionals made more than 2.5 million home visits. As a direct result, our clinicians identified 300,000 seniors with emergent health needs that may otherwise have gone undiagnosed. They connected more than 500,000 seniors to essential resources to help them with unaddressed needs such as food insecurity, medication affordability, transportation, and financial support. They also identified and helped close more than 3 million gaps in care that made a real difference in people's lives. Within 90 days of one of our home visits, 75% of patients received follow-up in a clinical setting. Additionally, Medicare Advantage patients with chronic conditions who receive these home visits end up with better managed and more stable health outcomes, as evidenced by spending measurably less time than fee-for-service patients in emergency room and other hospital settings. The bottom line, our home visit programs help patients live healthier lives and save taxpayers money. It is only Medicare Advantage that makes programs and results like this possible. Similarly, Optum Rx clients continue to appreciate the efforts we make to ensure delivery of the lowest cost drugs in the face of drug companies' sole ability to set prices. They also recognize the importance of the comprehensive pharmacy services we provide to people that's driving our momentum this year and bodes well for 2025. We also continue to bring practical innovation to people through new products and services, and by using new and emerging technologies to improve our own operating efficiency. For example, Surest continues to differentiate itself in the marketplace, which is why more and more customers are offering it to their employees, and why the offering continues to grow substantially. Additionally, investments in modernization of legacy technology and new emerging technologies are enabling our consumer-centric advancement of healthcare. For example, our growing AI portfolio made up of hundreds of practical use cases will generate billions of dollars of efficiencies over the next several years. These investments enable us to improve consumer experience, enhance provider find and price care capabilities to meet people's needs and improve clinical back-office execution. We expect technology innovation to become an increasingly core driver of our growth over the next two to five years. And now, I'll turn it over to our President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Andrew. I'll start this morning by providing context on some of the unique items in the quarter. Then, I'll follow with perspectives on care activity and general business updates. The overarching theme I hope you leave with today is that UnitedHealth Group continues to deliver broadly diversified growth with expanding opportunities, work that positions us for continued strong performance in '25 and beyond. Now to update on Change Healthcare. Our focus has centered on the patients, care providers and customers who rely on us to keep the health system running. Payment and claims [slows] (ph) for most care providers are back to normal, but we know that is not the case for some, so we continue to work with those who are not there yet. UnitedHealth Group has provided more than $9 billion in loans and advance payments to help providers mitigate the impact of the attack, all at no cost to them. Cyber impacts in the quarter totaled $0.92 per share, and we now estimate the full year impact will be $1.90 to $2.05 per share. But let me break that down a couple of steps further for you. Of the total in the quarter, $0.64 per share were direct costs incurred in restoring the clearinghouse platform and other response efforts. These included higher medical expenses directly stemming from the temporary pause of some care management activities. For the full year, we now estimate these direct costs at $1.30 to $1.35 per share. The $0.40 to $0.45 per share increase in this estimate is primarily related to care provider financial support and costs for producing and mailing the consumer notifications that will begin later this month. As a reminder, these direct costs are included in net earnings but are excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The other component affecting our results relates to disruption of the ongoing Change Healthcare business. This largely encompasses the loss of revenues combined with the costs of keeping these capabilities fully ready to serve. Notably, these effects are not excluded from adjusted earnings. In the second quarter, this impact was $0.28 per share. For the full year, we now estimate the business disruption impacts at $0.60 to $0.70 per share compared to the $0.30 to $0.40 we estimated last quarter. Most of the service functionality is now restored and revenues are rebuilding even as the pacing of this process varies. These important services are now more modern, secure and capable, and continuing to advance rapidly. Our ambition continues to be to return to baseline performance in '25 and to grow strongly from there. Turning to international. Following the sale last quarter of our much larger Brazil operations, we classified the remaining South American businesses as held for sale. This is a natural step following the Brazil sale. We highly value the relationships we have built with our dedicated colleagues over the last several years and wish them continued success. In a diverse enterprise with a strong growth record and capabilities such as ours, such portfolio evolutions enable us to keep our focus on the many compelling growth opportunities before us. The second quarter includes a total of $1.3 billion in South American impacts, the majority of which is non-cash and largely due to foreign currency translation losses accumulated over the years. About $220 million of this stems from a regulatory action in Chile, affecting all health plans. You'll see that as a component in the supplemental financial tables we provided this morning. The action relates to industry premium increases dating back to 2020, but as configured, will be reflected in consumer premium credits to be issued in future years. As a result, the entire $220 million was recorded as a reduction to premium revenue in the second quarter, increasing our reported medical care ratio by about 25 basis points. Turning to the second quarter medical care ratio, it was also impacted by about 40 basis points, or $290 million due to the suspension of some care management activities after the cyberattack. That makes for a total of about 65 basis points of non-repeating impacts, including South America. Beyond these effects, the care ratio in the quarter was also modestly affected by three other factors. One being member mix within Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans, which this year has been shaped by the unusual competitive benefit configurations in the marketplace. A second being the timing mismatch between the current health status of remaining Medicaid members and the state rate updates, a timing mismatch we expect to realign in the months ahead. And third, the lingering upshift in provider coding intensity, which we believe was spurred by the temporary suspension of our care review activities and carried past. This impact is not reflected in our cyberattack direct response costs, and we have been addressing it. Nonetheless, we continue to expect our full year medical care ratio, excluding 30 basis points of cyber and South American effects to be within the range we offered in November, albeit at the upper end. For our 2025 Medicare Advantage planning process, we assumed care patterns and mix at the levels we are seeing today, in addition to fully incorporating the second of the three-year phased funding cuts, and we have been fully attuned to how the Inflation Reduction Act will affect Medicare Part D offerings in '25. Also, as noted, we expect the Medicaid timing mismatch to subside as rates are updated throughout the remainder of this year and into next, appropriately reflecting current member health status. Turning to the performance of our businesses. At UnitedHealthcare, revenues of $74 billion grew by $3.6 billion. UHC domestic commercial membership grew 2.3 million in the first half of this year as employers and consumers responded to our distinctive offerings. And while the '25 selling season is ongoing, we are encouraged by the continued momentum we see. Our recently filed Medicare Advantage bid for '25, again took a balanced approach to provide as much stability for seniors as possible, while factoring in the realities of the funding cuts and current care patterns. You can expect us to continue to prioritize balanced and durable performance over transitory market share gains. In Medicaid, we expect membership levels to stabilize as we head into the second half of the year and our teams are executing well with both renewals and expansions. Optum Health revenues grew by 13% to $27 billion, and the operating margin expanded over last year. We are on track to approach 5 million patients in value-based care by the end of this year and are progressing strongly on our earlier and deeper engagement with patients, with a purposeful focus on our newer regions to more rapidly improve health outcomes and experiences. Optum Rx revenues grew 13% to over $32 billion, driven by strong customer response to the differentiated value, consumer experience and clinical expertise we offer. At Optum Insight, for the services beyond Change Healthcare, we see strong performance in line with our expectations. The revenue backlog increased to nearly $33 billion, growth of over $1 billion from a year ago, driven by business process and information technology services for health systems. A few additional items of note. As we highlighted in April, we established an additional $800 million in medical reserves in the first quarter to reflect the potential for the cyberattack to have affected claims receipt timing. With claims now flowing at more normalized levels, we continue to prudently analyze these trends. Similar to last quarter, the second quarter results do not reflect any favorable earnings impacting medical reserve development. Days [and] (ph) claims payable at 45.2 compared to 47.1 in the first quarter. The change was due primarily to the return to more normal claims submission patterns from providers and to a lesser extent, some impact from reclassifying the remaining South American operations to held for sale. Cash flows from operations in the quarter were $6.7 billion, or 1.5 times net income, even with the accelerated funding for care providers. In June, our Board of Directors increased the dividend by 12%, marking the 15th consecutive year of double-digit dividend increases to shareholders. During the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we prioritized devoting resources to support care providers in the wake of the cyberattack over some activities such as share repurchase. It was the right thing to do, devoting all our efforts to provide stability for the health system. Still, with our ongoing strong capital capacities and with support needs abating, we expect to achieve the full year repurchase objective we shared with you last November. In summary, it is the confidence we have in the performance of our diversified businesses that allows us to affirm full year adjusted EPS in the range of $27.50 to $28.00, the objective we established last year. Even as we have absorbed the unanticipated $0.60 to $0.70 in business disruption impacts. Within this, we expect a balanced pacing in the second half. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: John, thank you. As I said in November at our investor conference, we operate in an environment where change is constant. What you've come to see is that when changes happen, foreseen or unforeseen, we just deal with it. UnitedHealth Group is a nimble and adaptable enterprise, well suited to meet the challenges that come our way and the opportunities we pursue with the many and diverse capabilities available to us. In this first half, as we've done before, we navigated a complex external environment while managing through a significant business disruption. We continue to deliver on our growth objectives and are committed to delivering on our 13% to 16% long-term growth target. We'll now answer any questions you might have. Operator, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to A.J. Rice with UBS.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, thanks for the question. Just to make sure, expanding on John's comments, if we're thinking about the -- your thinking on MLR overall for the rest of the year, it sounds like beyond Change, beyond Latin America, there's two items you're calling out. One is Medicaid timing mismatch, which sounds like you think it\u2019s short term and then this upcoding, coding intensity comment. And I assume that's mainly in the insurance business, but maybe it's in Optum as well. Can you just give us a sense of how much those are impacting your thinking? And how much is second quarter versus the impact in the back half on those?\nAndrew Witty: Yeah, A.J., thanks for the question. Let me ask John to get right to it.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, A.J. Yeah, and really kind of three items that we're talking to in addition to those two here, also the member mix component here when you bring it all together, those additional items that we're looking at in terms of -- versus where we were and how we're thinking about it. I would say they\u2019re in kind of roughly equivalent -- in roughly equivalent zone in terms of their impact here. And then how they flow throughout the year -- the rest of year, really, you'll see some of those elements. So, as it relates to Medicaid impacts, pricing goes on over a period of, say, kind of 12 months or so. So there's pricing that occurs over the rest of this year into next year. So those elements in terms of catching up -- that mismatch catching up with the acuity that we have in the remaining population occurs over a period. Certainly, we are addressing the elements we talked about in terms of what we're seeing in the coding up shift, and we're well underway in addressing those elements, but we'll continue to address them throughout the course of the year. The member mix is kind of the member mix we have now at this point. And that really pertains to just the elements that I mentioned in my prepared comments about some of the benefit design impacts and how that impacted both our growth and also the type of membership that we were left with as we saw our full configuration. That really lasts with us throughout the year. So -- but that was an element we also incorporated into our view for 2025 as we approached our bids for '25. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Well said, John. And maybe just to reiterate one thing John said and then maybe add a further point, A.J. Super important just to hear what you said in terms of that member mix, obviously, we deal with it during this year, but we obviously had the opportunity to incorporate into our '25 planning and bids. So, feel very good about that. And then the secondly, maybe just to reflect, step back just a little bit on as we think of MLR. Really, the biggest incoming dynamic on MLR at the beginning of this year was the funding reduction in MA, the V-28 significant reduction in funding. And you can see that we are fundamentally navigating that, I think, extremely well. And yes, there are a couple of areas of pressure at the margin. I think as you just heard from John, they're primarily boxed off in terms of they're going to work their way through the pricing cycle with Medicaid or in the case of concerns around coding activity, we're very focused on that, confident we'll be able to -- we are addressing that. So those things feel transitory. Most importantly, we feel good about the way our response to the V-28 funding cut is playing out for us in the overall business. And really that -- as we started the year, that was the much bigger thing to make sure we got right, and I'm feeling like we're well on our way through the first year of this three-year cycle, and we've talked to you repeatedly about how critical it is to make sure we navigate that over the long run, and we feel good about that. So, thanks, A.J. Next question?\nOperator: Yes. We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much and good morning. I want to focus for a minute on SG&A, which came in much better than expected. Can you maybe talk about the key components of where you're seeing cost savings, the durability? And, Andrew, you touched a little bit about AI efficiencies there. Are you starting to see that in this quarter? And how much opportunity is there from an SG&A perspective when we think about AI?\nAndrew Witty: Lisa, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask John to comment a little bit. Let me make a couple of kind of upfront comments and then maybe a couple of examples more specifically to help you a little bit on this. So, to get your last point, we are running now hundreds of AI use case deployments. I'd say the first wave of those are essentially allowing us to do things much more quickly, much more reliably, much more efficiently than humans can do them. So an ability to navigate complexity to find answers within complex datasets. And super important, and I'll give you a couple of examples of how that begins to help us as we go on. I think we are now -- you will also start to see as we roll through the end of this year and next year, those same kind of tools begin to be deployed in fundamental reimagination of business process. So one is essentially allowing an existing process to run more efficiently. The second is, can we actually take steps out of a process and really start to change things. I'd call out payment integrity as a front-runner in that particular regard. And you'll start to see a lot of movement there over the next year or so, Lisa. And it's going to be, I think, OptumInsight '25, '26, '27 in terms of deployment of technology to change many of the processes that we've been used to for decades is coming, and that's going to be a very exciting phase. If you look in the short run, I'll give you a couple of examples. And this plays a little bit around technology. I certainly wouldn't say these are all Generative AI examples, but they're certainly digitization examples. They are certainly technology-enabled examples. So for example, we brought on this year at OptumRx a record number of clients. You've seen the growth. You can imagine the number of folks who've been signed up into Rx platforms. We actually spent 9% less this year in the onboarding of that record volume than we did the prior year, 9%, that\u2019s entirely due to digitization, technology efficiency deployed through the organization. Let me take you into another part of the organization, OptumHealth. We've more or less increased our number of risk -- fully risk delegated lives within OptumHealth by about 40% over the last two years. That's -- by the way, that's in excess of 1 million -- almost 1.5 million more lives over that period with zero increase in personnel headcount in the risk-based businesses. So, zero increase in headcount in a business which has increased its served members by close to 40%. So those are just a couple of examples. You're seeing that show up in those two examples, Optum. That's why you're starting to see that leverage flow through the Optum business line and it\u2019s something we obviously expect to continue to sustain over many, many quarters and years. And, John, I'd love you to go a little deeper.\nJohn Rex: Yeah. Good morning, Lisa. As you can -- I guess I'd start by -- it is early in that journey in terms of the potential and opportunity for what we can do. And yes, it was a very strong quarter in terms of cost management. But let me just step back a moment here. As you can imagine, given how some of these businesses were built and the fragmentation of the system, there are duplicative functions and uneven consumer experiences throughout that we're addressing. And as our businesses begin to scale, our ability to produce efficiency accelerates while, at same time, we can improve those customer experiences and expand the best practice across the broader base. The comments that Andrew was offering in his answer to your question, it's just really a natural outgrowth as these businesses begin to move beyond what we have viewed the earliest phases to a more adolescent phase. That's what we're seeing. Very strong this quarter. Over the longer term, we can expect advancement. I wouldn't expect it to remain at this level consistently as we look ahead over the next few quarters, though. It was a super strong quarter. But we are going to look to invest in many of these items that Andrew just articulated here, getting to a more modern streamlined experiences as these businesses evolve further. So I wouldn't expect it to persist right at this level as we make those investments, and we're anxious and ambitious to make those investments.\nAndrew Witty: Great. So, Lisa, thanks for raising it. You can tell it's a big focus for us. We laid out when V-28 first was announced, that one of the three ways that we would respond to this is we would double down on our own cost management efficiency and productivity, you're absolutely seeing that. And that coincides with an extraordinarily and exciting moment around technological innovation, whether that's Generative AI, digitization, all wrapped together in our march toward a greater consumer focus within the organization. All of that really hangs together is very much the core focus of how we think about things going forward. Thanks, Lisa. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Looking at your bids that you submitted for MA for 2025, I'd be curious if you could tell us if you were bidding to improve MA margins in 2025, or if you're still within that target range in light of the G&A savings? And then more importantly, maybe just some early thoughts on what sort of growth assumptions you have included in those bids, both your assumption for the market as well as any potential market share gains?\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Josh, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Tim Noel to address the first part of your question. On the second part, you're not going to be surprised. I'm going to defer from making any predictions about next year. It's still a little early. We'd like to see where everybody else plays out in this cycle. I think we [also are] (ph) in the 2024 cycle. Ultimately, the way growth plays out in the marketplace depends on how everybody bids, not just on how you bid. And it only takes one bid to be kind of out of expectation to completely distort your view of how things could play out. So, just going to defer a little bit on that one, but on the first point, Tim, I'd love you to make a few comments.\nTim Noel: Thanks, Josh, for the question. So, as we think about margins in the MA business and as it relates to our bid, I think we've talked about the consistent approach to how we plan margins. And we maintain -- continue to maintain that and we're operating comfortably within that margin range as we have in the past and as we're planning in 2025. And then when I think about our pricing approach for 2025, as Andrew mentioned, too early to get into a lot of specifics as CMS is reviewing those bids right now. But we're in a posture and how we've priced those products as we'll be comfortable with whatever growth is the outcome of the products that we bring to marketplace in 2025.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Tim. And, Josh, appreciate the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Yes. Hi. Thanks. Can you speak in a little greater detail about your expectation that the Medicaid pressure starts to subside in the second half of the year? I guess specifically, can you maybe speak to what you actually know about rates today, either draft or finalized, versus perhaps speaking to a general reliance on actuarially sound rates playing out over a reasonable period of time? Just trying to understand the level of visibility that you have a bit better. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Okay. Hey, Stephen, thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Krista Nelson, who leads our Medicaid business to respond to that. Kristen?\nKrista Nelson: Yeah, thanks so much for the question. So as it relates to visibility, we've got visibility into the majority of our rates for \u201824. And while there's just a slight gap in the second quarter, we really like how our 7/1 rates are shaping up and continue to work with state partners to influence key assumptions before those rates become final in the future. And while we might see a little bit of dislocation the rest of the year, states have really committed to accurately reflecting the change in acuity from redeterminations into current and future adjustments and really expect this to even out as we pace through the remainder of \u201824 and early \u201825. Thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: Krista, thanks so much. So I mean, listen, Stephen, I think you heard there why we're confident that this is really a kind of time-fenced issue and in the grand scheme of things, I would characterize this as a margin. It's a part of what you've seen in this small deviation in Q2, but we don't really see it as a sustainably structural issue and you heard exactly why just there. So, thanks, Krista. And, Stephen, thanks for your question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. Just a quick clarification and then a question about second half MLR. So first, the clarification. On the MLR, it sounded like, John, you're guiding to a core MLR at the high end of the range or 84.5%, and then I would add 30 basis points of the one-timers for the full year that you've seen in the first half, that would leave GAAP MLR at 84.8%. Is this correct and to be clear, is there any expectation for further one-timers in the second half of the year? Or should the third and fourth quarter kind of be clean? And then my question is just around, core MLR in the first quarter, ex the one-timers was 84.2%. Sounds like it'll be 84.8% in the second half. Maybe you could help us think about 3Q versus 4Q just to make sure our expectations are set correctly, given how much focus there is here. Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Justin. I\u2019d say first, yes, the way you described our assumptions around core full year MLR are consistent with our expectations. So how you describe that is quite consistent. As it relates to just looking at towards the 3Q and such, I'd expect that to be in the neighborhood of 84%, very likely a few tens of basis points higher than that. So, it's kind of a little bit above that in that zone. As it relates to kind of other elements that we've pulled out here, no, they shouldn't be material. Those cyber effects should continue to abate. As we mentioned, we're not adjusting for the elements we talked about the provider and coding intensity, so that kind of pulls through a little bit. But there shouldn't be any material other impacts that we're thinking about. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. Thanks, Justin. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Actually, I was hoping we could maybe do a similar exercise as Justin just asked about with MLR for OptumHealth margins. And maybe first, if you can talk about how the OH margins came in at 2Q relative to your expectations. And then how you're thinking about OH margins progressing in 3Q and 4Q? And then how comfortable you are with getting into that -- the full year target range that you had provided. And, John, I thought it might be helpful to -- as we think about the sort of pacing in the back half of the year, in particular, how you're thinking about an exit rate for OptumHealth margins as we're exiting 2024 would be helpful? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Scott, thanks so much for your question. I'm going to ask Dr. Amar Desai, who leads OptumHealth to give you a few comments there. I mean, let me just preface that by saying, look, we feel good -- very good about the continued progression and in particular, the way in which OptumHealth is -- has adjusted to deal with the new funding environment. I'm also very, very encouraged by the degree of external payer engagement with our OptumHealth platform as they deal with the environment themselves and look at Optum as a part of that solution. And I think the performance of the business you see is, it continues to improve over last year. You continue to see decent progression. And let me ask Amar to give you a little bit of a sense of how he sees the second half of the year playing out.\nAmar Desai: Hi, Scott. Thanks for the question. So as Andrew said, we're in the middle of the first year of a large rate reduction over the next three years, effectively being a price cut. And as we think about the initiatives, we're pleased with the early success, mitigating the impact of that changing rate environment. In '23, we developed a three-year plan to manage through V-28. Medical cost management and affordability initiatives was at the center of it. Proactive clinical engagement that impacts member experience and total cost of care is obviously core to that, including better prevention and chronic disease management and then disciplined operating cost management, more efficient ways to work, improvements in productivity, driving consistency in our workflows and systems, which Andrew and John alluded to. We're executing very well on this plan, seeing solid progress across each of these areas. As an example, at this time last year, we had engaged 62% of all members. Year-to-date, we've engaged three-fourth of all members and above that for our highest risk membership. We're also focused on coordination of care, particularly at transition points in care, where we've increased post-discharge visits for patients who have been hospitalized that has, in fact, reduced readmission rates by 10% in our most mature markets. So, as we pace through the balance of the year, we expect to continue to build on this momentum across engagement, affordability and operating cost management and are confident in the 7.7% to 8% target for the year.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Amar, thanks so much. And, Scott, thanks again for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. Just wanted to clarify, I guess, something and ask another question. It wasn't clear to me what you were saying about no favorable reserve development. Does that mean the $800 million that you mentioned previously is still somehow in the numbers? Or is that kind of worked its way through at the end of Q2? And then I guess just trying to understand better where the outperformance is because obviously, you guys have assumed $0.60 to $0.70 of Change costs in your guidance but reaffirm the numbers and it doesn't sound like Medicare is the answer, doesn't sound like Medicaid is the answer, Change isn't the answer. So where has the outperformance come in that\u2019s allowed you to maintain guidance? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. This is John. So yeah, exactly what we said there was nothing material there going on in development. No favorable P&L impacting development in the quarter, very similar to last quarter in terms of there was just no impact being there. And in terms of just a comment -- or questions regarding outperformance, well, maybe some across a number of the businesses in terms of where we're seeing, we're seeing very strong growth, certainly in our commercial health benefits business, we're seeing strong growth. We're seeing margin progression in OptumHealth. So we're seeing advancement. The -- really, the strong approach that the team at M&R took and tell how they looked at '24 in terms of overcoming the headwinds at V-28 and the very disciplined approach they took to how they stepped out into the marketplace with the products that they took. Even with some of the elements that we talked about that we\u2019re overcoming there, but certainly, all those creating a good impact from us. Clearly, just across the company, the strong operating efficiencies that the company is driving, strong and sustained. And as I said, look, we will continue to make investments, but really a significant progress on that and still very early stage. So as Andrew commented in terms of the potential we have as we look over the next three years and this impact, and we're just getting some of these businesses to a maturity level where we think we can really harness that. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yeah. Thanks, John. And let me just also reiterate that point. I mean part of what you're seeing here, Kevin, is obviously, the big change this year was the V-28 funding cut price reduction, which obviously focuses primarily on our Medicare Advantage business that Tim runs and the OptumHealth business that Amar runs, both of whom are responding super well. But let's be clear, while those pricing cuts are focused on two businesses, team UHG is responding, right? The entire corporation is engaged in how it manages itself better, reduces cost across the company, leverages technology, accelerates our consumer agenda, all designed to play our part across the board in how we offset the pressure that's been inflicted on those two important businesses. Why we're confident we can navigate this? I think you're seeing that in the performance of the business, and we're going to continue -- it\u2019s why I said what I said earlier today. We're going to continue to focus on every aspect of our business to make sure that the model we've laid out and we believe is the right one for delivering best value care for patients is the one that prospers and we're super confident in that. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Andrew Mok with Barclays.\nAndrew Mok: Hi, good morning. The OptumInsight backlog was down about $200 million sequentially. Can you give us color on the drivers of that and the nature of conversations you're having with providers following the cyberattack? Do you expect further declines in the backlog this year? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Andrew, thanks so much for that. Let me ask Roger Connor to address that. It's pretty straightforward. But let me ask Roger to answer that and maybe give you a little bit more flavor on what he's seeing.\nRoger Connor: Yeah, Andrew, thanks very much for the question. Just in terms of backlog, obviously, an important measure and there has been some impact from the Change events within that. What it doesn't include, obviously, is what we're doing in terms of bringing in new clients and what we're doing in our whole innovation space. But fundamentally, we are very confident in terms of the performance going into next year with the cyber event certainly from an impact on the overall health system is not absolutely minimal. When you look at our overall focus, it's now on driving that business recovery. And that's all about bringing volume back into the system. And we're seeing that actually really ramping up and seeing momentum acceleration. We're not only trying to bring volume back into our current customers. We're also going to bring new clients in, and that's exciting because this event has really transformed the marketplace. They're looking for, again, access to innovation, access to security in the system and that\u2019s what we've brought back. We've brought back a very secure system, and that is resonating or seeing that momentum. You add that to the underlying strength of the OptumInsight business. Again, Change is only 15% of our overall business performance this year, was planned. That's why we're confident in terms of getting back to our baseline performance in 2025.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Roger. Thanks, Andrew. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the provider coding activity that you called out and asked maybe what you saw kind of change in the quarter and what actions you're taking to address this change? And is this pressure something that accounted for in bids for next year? And then if I could just ask a very quick clarification on the Change impact on EPS. You talked about the return to baseline performance in 2025. Does that mean you would expect to recover the $0.60 to $0.70 [that is in] (ph) earnings this year? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Okay. Thanks so much for the question, Nathan. Brian, if you'd like to go first?\nBrian Thompson: Sure. I'll answer that first part on the upshift that we saw in provider level of care coding patterns. We actually believe that was largely induced by our level of care waivers that we did during the cyber disruption. The reason we believe that is we really saw a higher level of mix to inpatient versus observation after we went back to turning on our utilization management protocols. Pretty distinct on April 15th and thereafter. So that's why we see that. Certainly aware of that activity as we plan for 2025 in our bid. So, really no concerns with respect to that. I feel like it's an anomaly tied to what we saw during our waiver. And we have reinforced our utilization management protocols and believe that these impacts will dampen as we pace through the remainder of the year.\nJohn Rex: Yeah. And regarding Change, yes, as we mentioned in our comments and Roger mentioned, our ambition is to get back to baseline expectations performance for that business in 2025. So those baseline expectations being what we would have expected prior to any of this happening. And clearly this quarter, we have increased the impact of the business disruption here. So as we bring those back, there's the pacing of those revenues coming back, taking sometimes a little bit more time to bring in, but that is our ambition, actually, as we look ahead.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John, Brian. I mean, again, just on this business interruption piece, I mean, I think in all honesty, we were a little optimistic in hindsight at the pace at which we thought people would come back in terms of putting their flow through the system once it was reconnected. I think as we've looked at the last several weeks, that momentum and pace, and particularly as we look at new clients come in and as well as returning clients feel good about where we are now. So I think probably a little overoptimistic three months ago. I think now, I feel like we have this now and we're in good position and the rest of the year we've got a clear path how this plays out. And I think the platform that we've rebuilt is going to serve people extremely well. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks. So on the earlier topic of potential offsets, I wanted to ask on Optum Rx and with the recent level of industry attention kind of on the PBM business as well as kind of specialty pharmacy, how should we think about how those drivers are playing out relative to your expectations, whether it's biosimilars or GLP-1s in terms of that therapeutic category, how should we think about those near-term drivers across Optum Rx? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Erin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather, who runs Optum for us, to make a couple of comments on that, if you don't mind, Heather.\nHeather Cianfrocco: Sure. Just basically, I think you can see in the quarter, just strong performance, maybe a couple of things I would just highlight for that. We've talked for a few years about the investments we've been making in Optum Rx on both the PBM side, but also on the pharmacy side. PBM side, you've seen the growth there in client and just in volume, sort of same with respect to volume within our existing clients as well. We take that as a sign of strong retention of existing clients and continuing to perform with them. I think the thing I'd highlight on the PBM side is, I've said this before, the modular effect of the PBM business. We serve at the privilege of our clients, so what they need, we serve, And that is we administer their benefit. And we offer the programs, the services to drive affordability of medications for them in the best interest of their members. And we've brought a lot of products and services in the last year. Two or three new products this market that are leading differentiating in the marketplace that we are seeing our health plans and our employers take advantage of this year that are really market differentiating and we are seeing that drive not just growth with health plans, but growth in products and services. So I think you're seeing that show up. The other thing you're seeing is the cost efficiency show up in the business. One of the -- Andrew brought up an example. And you're seeing some of the timing of supply chain efficiency. On the services side of the business, you mentioned specialty, I call out the diversification of the pharmacies in general. Remember, we've got the integrated behavioral health business which continues to grow and expand. It's a very differentiated business in that it's co-located and it's specifically directed at those behavioral health members to ensure access and affordability and holistic care to individuals with mental health conditions. And then our frontier and our infusion services that really drive those specialty medications in-home, we're seeing continued need for that from our PBM clients, but also non-PBM clients. And so that's where we're really seeing that diversified growth. So you're just seeing that show up in continued, consistent performance in that business through the quarter.\nAndrew Witty: Heather, thank you. Erin, thanks so much for the question. We have time for one final question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Great, thanks. For OptumHealth, could you talk a little bit about what pricing has been like there? And, in Investor Day, it seemed like you may have seen some improved pricing as far as global cap rates, and likewise given higher global cap rates out of the MA business. Was wondering if \u201825, we should be expecting continued improvement in that, or whether there needs to be a retrenchment or retracing of that kind of makeup for what was given? And also, are you starting to exclude things from global cap as you look at 2025? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Lance. Thanks for the question. And love the cheeky attempt at the end of the call to get us to predict, give you some numbers for \u201825. We're going to defer from that, but well done on the last-ditch effort. I'm going to ask Amar to give you a little bit more of a kind of general sense of how we're seeing that. And please go ahead, Amar.\nAmar Desai: Thanks for the question, Lance. Look, we continue to have very strong relationships across our over 100 plan partners. And in fact, in a pretty dynamic rate and benefit environment, we've seen increased outreach from payers looking for an enduring partner that's very adept at operating within fully capitated value-based arrangements. In particular, the discussions have been productive around benefit design, funding, market level planning and we're confident in the position as we go into 2025. We're down the path in adding plan partners as well as adding geographies for 2025. Foundational within that to those relationships and as we think about those arrangements is quality, quality of care of our providers that are anchored in the community, our strong ability to drive clinical outcomes, improvements and achievement in star measures, and of course strong documentation and diagnosis. We also are seeing that the strength of our network that's aligned in geographies is an important focus area for plan partners, and of course continued focus on clinical engagement which I mentioned previously. So when you take that together, great momentum across those areas gives us confidence as we drive value for our plan partners and as we pace through the next two years of the risk model changes and grow.\nAndrew Witty: Amar, thank you very much. And as I think you could probably sense from those couple of answers that Amar has given you over the course of the call, Amar leads a very, very special team of people running a very, very special business in terms of what it\u2019s able to do on behalf of patients and the way it's able to provide great work experience for the healthcare professionals and colleagues who work in that business. I'm very pleased with how the continuation of that business progresses. We're coming toward the end of the call. I'd like to thank you all for your questions this morning. As you've heard, our focus on fundamental execution, our restless spirit, and our ability to adapt to changing environments gives us great confidence as we look ahead and as a testament to the hard work and discipline of the people of UnitedHealth Group who work every day to serve patients, consumers, and care providers, customers efficiently and effectively. We appreciate your time this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Hi, Scott. Thanks for the question. So as Andrew said, we're in the middle of the first year of a large rate reduction over the next three years, effectively being a price cut. And as we think about the initiatives, we're pleased with the early success, mitigating the impact of that changing rate environment. In '23, we developed a three-year plan to manage through V-28. Medical cost management and affordability initiatives was at the center of it. Proactive clinical engagement that impacts member experience and total cost of care is obviously core to that, including better prevention and chronic disease management and then disciplined operating cost management, more efficient ways to work, improvements in productivity, driving consistency in our workflows and systems, which Andrew and John alluded to. We're executing very well on this plan, seeing solid progress across each of these areas. As an example, at this time last year, we had engaged 62% of all members. Year-to-date, we've engaged three-fourth of all members and above that for our highest risk membership. We're also focused on coordination of care, particularly at transition points in care, where we've increased post-discharge visits for patients who have been hospitalized that has, in fact, reduced readmission rates by 10% in our most mature markets. So, as we pace through the balance of the year, we expect to continue to build on this momentum across engagement, affordability and operating cost management and are confident in the 7.7% to 8% target for the year. Thanks for the question, Lance. Look, we continue to have very strong relationships across our over 100 plan partners. And in fact, in a pretty dynamic rate and benefit environment, we've seen increased outreach from payers looking for an enduring partner that's very adept at operating within fully capitated value-based arrangements.

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The second quarter results we reported today reflect diversified and durable growth and a commitment to ensuring high quality care is available to every person we're privileged to serve. In the first half of the year, revenues grew by nearly $14 billion, with strong contributions from across the enterprise, led by double-digit growth at Optum. UnitedHealth Group entered the second half of the year with continuing and broad-based growth momentum. As a result, we are affirming our full year adjusted earnings outlook even as we absorb $0.60 to $0.70 per share in business disruption impacts related to the cyberattack. These results come from the sustained focus of the 400,000 people of UnitedHealth Group on adding value for patients, consumers and customers through the fundamental execution of our key priorities. We're also well positioned for growth in 2025. In the selling season to date, the most sophisticated thoughtful buyers of health benefits and services in the US, such as large employers, unions, states, seniors, all continue to choose the offerings of UnitedHealth Group, when they're looking for managed care, pharmacy services or a Medicare Advantage plan that provides the best value. This consistent growth reflects customers' recognition of the need for a company like ours. As you know, UnitedHealth Group strives to help reduce the fragmentation and lack of coordination that drives up costs and erodes care outcomes in the $5 trillion US healthcare marketplace. We aim to better coordinate and align incentives among caregivers, payers, and pharmacy, enabling us to focus on the whole patient throughout their health journey. We believe this increases value for customers and consumers, improves people's experience and health, reduces redundancies and waste, and ultimately leads to a more sustainable health system. For example, the proven health and economic value to consumers and taxpayers of Medicare Advantage. A recent study by Milliman found that the cost of taxpayers of Medicare Advantage is 4% less than traditional fee-for-service Medicare. At the same time, Medicare Advantage provides seniors well over $2,000 per year in additional value through lower out-of-pocket cost and important services like dental, vision and hearing, none of which fee-for-service Medicare covers. That means a lot to the majority of the people Medicare Advantage serves, who have limited economic resources and otherwise would lack access to such services. The home visits we offer seniors further illustrate the value of MA. Last year, our medical professionals made more than 2.5 million home visits. As a direct result, our clinicians identified 300,000 seniors with emergent health needs that may otherwise have gone undiagnosed. They connected more than 500,000 seniors to essential resources to help them with unaddressed needs such as food insecurity, medication affordability, transportation, and financial support. They also identified and helped close more than 3 million gaps in care that made a real difference in people's lives. Within 90 days of one of our home visits, 75% of patients received follow-up in a clinical setting. Additionally, Medicare Advantage patients with chronic conditions who receive these home visits end up with better managed and more stable health outcomes, as evidenced by spending measurably less time than fee-for-service patients in emergency room and other hospital settings. The bottom line, our home visit programs help patients live healthier lives and save taxpayers money. It is only Medicare Advantage that makes programs and results like this possible. Similarly, Optum Rx clients continue to appreciate the efforts we make to ensure delivery of the lowest cost drugs in the face of drug companies' sole ability to set prices. They also recognize the importance of the comprehensive pharmacy services we provide to people that's driving our momentum this year and bodes well for 2025. We also continue to bring practical innovation to people through new products and services, and by using new and emerging technologies to improve our own operating efficiency. For example, Surest continues to differentiate itself in the marketplace, which is why more and more customers are offering it to their employees, and why the offering continues to grow substantially. Additionally, investments in modernization of legacy technology and new emerging technologies are enabling our consumer-centric advancement of healthcare. For example, our growing AI portfolio made up of hundreds of practical use cases will generate billions of dollars of efficiencies over the next several years. These investments enable us to improve consumer experience, enhance provider find and price care capabilities to meet people's needs and improve clinical back-office execution. We expect technology innovation to become an increasingly core driver of our growth over the next two to five years. And now, I'll turn it over to our President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. John, thank you. As I said in November at our investor conference, we operate in an environment where change is constant. What you've come to see is that when changes happen, foreseen or unforeseen, we just deal with it. UnitedHealth Group is a nimble and adaptable enterprise, well suited to meet the challenges that come our way and the opportunities we pursue with the many and diverse capabilities available to us. In this first half, as we've done before, we navigated a complex external environment while managing through a significant business disruption. We continue to deliver on our growth objectives and are committed to delivering on our 13% to 16% long-term growth target. We'll now answer any questions you might have. Operator, please. Yeah, A.J., thanks for the question. Let me ask John to get right to it. Well said, John. And maybe just to reiterate one thing John said and then maybe add a further point, A.J. Super important just to hear what you said in terms of that member mix, obviously, we deal with it during this year, but we obviously had the opportunity to incorporate into our '25 planning and bids. So, feel very good about that. And then the secondly, maybe just to reflect, step back just a little bit on as we think of MLR. Really, the biggest incoming dynamic on MLR at the beginning of this year was the funding reduction in MA, the V-28 significant reduction in funding. And you can see that we are fundamentally navigating that, I think, extremely well. And yes, there are a couple of areas of pressure at the margin. I think as you just heard from John, they're primarily boxed off in terms of they're going to work their way through the pricing cycle with Medicaid or in the case of concerns around coding activity, we're very focused on that, confident we'll be able to -- we are addressing that. So those things feel transitory. Most importantly, we feel good about the way our response to the V-28 funding cut is playing out for us in the overall business. And really that -- as we started the year, that was the much bigger thing to make sure we got right, and I'm feeling like we're well on our way through the first year of this three-year cycle, and we've talked to you repeatedly about how critical it is to make sure we navigate that over the long run, and we feel good about that. So, thanks, A.J. Next question? Lisa, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask John to comment a little bit. Let me make a couple of kind of upfront comments and then maybe a couple of examples more specifically to help you a little bit on this. So, to get your last point, we are running now hundreds of AI use case deployments. I'd say the first wave of those are essentially allowing us to do things much more quickly, much more reliably, much more efficiently than humans can do them. So an ability to navigate complexity to find answers within complex datasets. And super important, and I'll give you a couple of examples of how that begins to help us as we go on. I think we are now -- you will also start to see as we roll through the end of this year and next year, those same kind of tools begin to be deployed in fundamental reimagination of business process. So one is essentially allowing an existing process to run more efficiently. The second is, can we actually take steps out of a process and really start to change things. I'd call out payment integrity as a front-runner in that particular regard. And you'll start to see a lot of movement there over the next year or so, Lisa. And it's going to be, I think, OptumInsight '25, '26, '27 in terms of deployment of technology to change many of the processes that we've been used to for decades is coming, and that's going to be a very exciting phase. If you look in the short run, I'll give you a couple of examples. And this plays a little bit around technology. I certainly wouldn't say these are all Generative AI examples, but they're certainly digitization examples. They are certainly technology-enabled examples. So for example, we brought on this year at OptumRx a record number of clients. You've seen the growth. You can imagine the number of folks who've been signed up into Rx platforms. We actually spent 9% less this year in the onboarding of that record volume than we did the prior year, 9%, that's entirely due to digitization, technology efficiency deployed through the organization. Let me take you into another part of the organization, OptumHealth. We've more or less increased our number of risk -- fully risk delegated lives within OptumHealth by about 40% over the last two years. That's -- by the way, that's in excess of 1 million -- almost 1.5 million more lives over that period with zero increase in personnel headcount in the risk-based businesses. So, zero increase in headcount in a business which has increased its served members by close to 40%. So those are just a couple of examples. You're seeing that show up in those two examples, Optum. That's why you're starting to see that leverage flow through the Optum business line and it's something we obviously expect to continue to sustain over many, many quarters and years. And, John, I'd love you to go a little deeper. Great. So, Lisa, thanks for raising it. You can tell it's a big focus for us. We laid out when V-28 first was announced, that one of the three ways that we would respond to this is we would double down on our own cost management efficiency and productivity, you're absolutely seeing that. And that coincides with an extraordinarily and exciting moment around technological innovation, whether that's Generative AI, digitization, all wrapped together in our march toward a greater consumer focus within the organization. All of that really hangs together is very much the core focus of how we think about things going forward. Thanks, Lisa. Next question. Hey, Josh, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Tim Noel to address the first part of your question. On the second part, you're not going to be surprised. I'm going to defer from making any predictions about next year. It's still a little early. We'd like to see where everybody else plays out in this cycle. I think we [also are] (ph) in the 2024 cycle. Ultimately, the way growth plays out in the marketplace depends on how everybody bids, not just on how you bid. And it only takes one bid to be kind of out of expectation to completely distort your view of how things could play out. So, just going to defer a little bit on that one, but on the first point, Tim, I'd love you to make a few comments. Great. Thanks so much, Tim. And, Josh, appreciate the question. Next question, please. Okay. Hey, Stephen, thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Krista Nelson, who leads our Medicaid business to respond to that. Kristen? Krista, thanks so much. So I mean, listen, Stephen, I think you heard there why we're confident that this is really a kind of time-fenced issue and in the grand scheme of things, I would characterize this as a margin. It's a part of what you've seen in this small deviation in Q2, but we don't really see it as a sustainably structural issue and you heard exactly why just there. So, thanks, Krista. And, Stephen, thanks for your question. Next question, please. Thanks, John. Thanks, Justin. Next question, please. Scott, thanks so much for your question. I'm going to ask Dr. Amar Desai, who leads OptumHealth to give you a few comments there. I mean, let me just preface that by saying, look, we feel good -- very good about the continued progression and in particular, the way in which OptumHealth is -- has adjusted to deal with the new funding environment. I'm also very, very encouraged by the degree of external payer engagement with our OptumHealth platform as they deal with the environment themselves and look at Optum as a part of that solution. And I think the performance of the business you see is, it continues to improve over last year. You continue to see decent progression. And let me ask Amar to give you a little bit of a sense of how he sees the second half of the year playing out. Great. Amar, thanks so much. And, Scott, thanks again for the question. Next question please. Yeah. Thanks, John. And let me just also reiterate that point. I mean part of what you're seeing here, Kevin, is obviously, the big change this year was the V-28 funding cut price reduction, which obviously focuses primarily on our Medicare Advantage business that Tim runs and the OptumHealth business that Amar runs, both of whom are responding super well. But let's be clear, while those pricing cuts are focused on two businesses, team UHG is responding, right? The entire corporation is engaged in how it manages itself better, reduces cost across the company, leverages technology, accelerates our consumer agenda, all designed to play our part across the board in how we offset the pressure that's been inflicted on those two important businesses. Why we're confident we can navigate this? I think you're seeing that in the performance of the business, and we're going to continue -- it's why I said what I said earlier today. We're going to continue to focus on every aspect of our business to make sure that the model we've laid out and we believe is the right one for delivering best value care for patients is the one that prospers and we're super confident in that. Next question? Andrew, thanks so much for that. Let me ask Roger Connor to address that. It's pretty straightforward. But let me ask Roger to answer that and maybe give you a little bit more flavor on what he's seeing. Great. Thanks so much, Roger. Thanks, Andrew. Next question. Okay. Thanks so much for the question, Nathan. Brian, if you'd like to go first? Thanks, John, Brian. I mean, again, just on this business interruption piece, I mean, I think in all honesty, we were a little optimistic in hindsight at the pace at which we thought people would come back in terms of putting their flow through the system once it was reconnected. I think as we've looked at the last several weeks, that momentum and pace, and particularly as we look at new clients come in and as well as returning clients feel good about where we are now. So I think probably a little overoptimistic three months ago. I think now, I feel like we have this now and we're in good position and the rest of the year we've got a clear path how this plays out. And I think the platform that we've rebuilt is going to serve people extremely well. Next question. Erin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather, who runs Optum for us, to make a couple of comments on that, if you don't mind, Heather. Heather, thank you. Erin, thanks so much for the question. We have time for one final question, please. Hey, Lance. Thanks for the question. And love the cheeky attempt at the end of the call to get us to predict, give you some numbers for \u201825. We're going to defer from that, but well done on the last-ditch effort. I'm going to ask Amar to give you a little bit more of a kind of general sense of how we're seeing that. And please go ahead, Amar. Amar, thank you very much. And as I think you could probably sense from those couple of answers that Amar has given you over the course of the call, Amar leads a very, very special team of people running a very, very special business in terms of what it's able to do on behalf of patients and the way it's able to provide great work experience for the healthcare professionals and colleagues who work in that business. I'm very pleased with how the continuation of that business progresses. We're coming toward the end of the call. I'd like to thank you all for your questions this morning. As you've heard, our focus on fundamental execution, our restless spirit, and our ability to adapt to changing environments gives us great confidence as we look ahead and as a testament to the hard work and discipline of the people of UnitedHealth Group who work every day to serve patients, consumers, and care providers, customers efficiently and effectively. We appreciate your time this morning. Thank you."

            "name": "John Rex",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. I'll start this morning by providing context on some of the unique items in the quarter. Then, I'll follow with perspectives on care activity and general business updates. The overarching theme I hope you leave with today is that UnitedHealth Group continues to deliver broadly diversified growth with expanding opportunities, work that positions us for continued strong performance in '25 and beyond. Now to update on Change Healthcare. Our focus has centered on the patients, care providers and customers who rely on us to keep the health system running. Payment and claims [slows] (ph) for most care providers are back to normal, but we know that is not the case for some, so we continue to work with those who are not there yet. UnitedHealth Group has provided more than $9 billion in loans and advance payments to help providers mitigate the impact of the attack, all at no cost to them. Cyber impacts in the quarter totaled $0.92 per share, and we now estimate the full year impact will be $1.90 to $2.05 per share. But let me break that down a couple of steps further for you. Of the total in the quarter, $0.64 per share were direct costs incurred in restoring the clearinghouse platform and other response efforts. These included higher medical expenses directly stemming from the temporary pause of some care management activities. For the full year, we now estimate these direct costs at $1.30 to $1.35 per share. The $0.40 to $0.45 per share increase in this estimate is primarily related to care provider financial support and costs for producing and mailing the consumer notifications that will begin later this month. As a reminder, these direct costs are included in net earnings but are excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The other component affecting our results relates to disruption of the ongoing Change Healthcare business. This largely encompasses the loss of revenues combined with the costs of keeping these capabilities fully ready to serve. Notably, these effects are not excluded from adjusted earnings. In the second quarter, this impact was $0.28 per share. For the full year, we now estimate the business disruption impacts at $0.60 to $0.70 per share compared to the $0.30 to $0.40 we estimated last quarter. Most of the service functionality is now restored and revenues are rebuilding even as the pacing of this process varies. These important services are now more modern, secure and capable, and continuing to advance rapidly. Our ambition continues to be to return to baseline performance in '25 and to grow strongly from there. Turning to international. Following the sale last quarter of our much larger Brazil operations, we classified the remaining South American businesses as held for sale. This is a natural step following the Brazil sale. We highly value the relationships we have built with our dedicated colleagues over the last several years and wish them continued success. In a diverse enterprise with a strong growth record and capabilities such as ours, such portfolio evolutions enable us to keep our focus on the many compelling growth opportunities before us. The second quarter includes a total of $1.3 billion in South American impacts, the majority of which is non-cash and largely due to foreign currency translation losses accumulated over the years. About $220 million of this stems from a regulatory action in Chile, affecting all health plans. You'll see that as a component in the supplemental financial tables we provided this morning. The action relates to industry premium increases dating back to 2020, but as configured, will be reflected in consumer premium credits to be issued in future years. As a result, the entire $220 million was recorded as a reduction to premium revenue in the second quarter, increasing our reported medical care ratio by about 25 basis points. Turning to the second quarter medical care ratio, it was also impacted by about 40 basis points, or $290 million due to the suspension of some care management activities after the cyberattack. That makes for a total of about 65 basis points of non-repeating impacts, including South America. Beyond these effects, the care ratio in the quarter was also modestly affected by three other factors. One being member mix within Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans, which this year has been shaped by the unusual competitive benefit configurations in the marketplace. A second being the timing mismatch between the current health status of remaining Medicaid members and the state rate updates, a timing mismatch we expect to realign in the months ahead. And third, the lingering upshift in provider coding intensity, which we believe was spurred by the temporary suspension of our care review activities and carried past. This impact is not reflected in our cyberattack direct response costs, and we have been addressing it. Nonetheless, we continue to expect our full year medical care ratio, excluding 30 basis points of cyber and South American effects to be within the range we offered in November, albeit at the upper end. For our 2025 Medicare Advantage planning process, we assumed care patterns and mix at the levels we are seeing today, in addition to fully incorporating the second of the three-year phased funding cuts, and we have been fully attuned to how the Inflation Reduction Act will affect Medicare Part D offerings in '25. Also, as noted, we expect the Medicaid timing mismatch to subside as rates are updated throughout the remainder of this year and into next, appropriately reflecting current member health status. Turning to the performance of our businesses. At UnitedHealthcare, revenues of $74 billion grew by $3.6 billion. UHC domestic commercial membership grew 2.3 million in the first half of this year as employers and consumers responded to our distinctive offerings. And while the '25 selling season is ongoing, we are encouraged by the continued momentum we see. Our recently filed Medicare Advantage bid for '25, again took a balanced approach to provide as much stability for seniors as possible, while factoring in the realities of the funding cuts and current care patterns. You can expect us to continue to prioritize balanced and durable performance over transitory market share gains. In Medicaid, we expect membership levels to stabilize as we head into the second half of the year and our teams are executing well with both renewals and expansions. Optum Health revenues grew by 13% to $27 billion, and the operating margin expanded over last year. We are on track to approach 5 million patients in value-based care by the end of this year and are progressing strongly on our earlier and deeper engagement with patients, with a purposeful focus on our newer regions to more rapidly improve health outcomes and experiences. Optum Rx revenues grew 13% to over $32 billion, driven by strong customer response to the differentiated value, consumer experience and clinical expertise we offer. At Optum Insight, for the services beyond Change Healthcare, we see strong performance in line with our expectations. The revenue backlog increased to nearly $33 billion, growth of over $1 billion from a year ago, driven by business process and information technology services for health systems. A few additional items of note. As we highlighted in April, we established an additional $800 million in medical reserves in the first quarter to reflect the potential for the cyberattack to have affected claims receipt timing. With claims now flowing at more normalized levels, we continue to prudently analyze these trends. Similar to last quarter, the second quarter results do not reflect any favorable earnings impacting medical reserve development. Days [and] (ph) claims payable at 45.2 compared to 47.1 in the first quarter. The change was due primarily to the return to more normal claims submission patterns from providers and to a lesser extent, some impact from reclassifying the remaining South American operations to held for sale. Cash flows from operations in the quarter were $6.7 billion, or 1.5 times net income, even with the accelerated funding for care providers. In June, our Board of Directors increased the dividend by 12%, marking the 15th consecutive year of double-digit dividend increases to shareholders. During the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we prioritized devoting resources to support care providers in the wake of the cyberattack over some activities such as share repurchase. It was the right thing to do, devoting all our efforts to provide stability for the health system. Still, with our ongoing strong capital capacities and with support needs abating, we expect to achieve the full year repurchase objective we shared with you last November. In summary, it is the confidence we have in the performance of our diversified businesses that allows us to affirm full year adjusted EPS in the range of $27.50 to $28.00, the objective we established last year. Even as we have absorbed the unanticipated $0.60 to $0.70 in business disruption impacts. Within this, we expect a balanced pacing in the second half. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew. Good morning, A.J. Yeah, and really kind of three items that we're talking to in addition to those two here, also the member mix component here when you bring it all together, those additional items that we're looking at in terms of -- versus where we were and how we're thinking about it. I would say they're in kind of roughly equivalent -- in roughly equivalent zone in terms of their impact here. And then how they flow throughout the year -- the rest of year, really, you'll see some of those elements. So, as it relates to Medicaid impacts, pricing goes on over a period of, say, kind of 12 months or so. So there's pricing that occurs over the rest of this year into next year. So those elements in terms of catching up -- that mismatch catching up with the acuity that we have in the remaining population occurs over a period. Certainly, we are addressing the elements we talked about in terms of what we're seeing in the coding up shift, and we're well underway in addressing those elements, but we'll continue to address them throughout the course of the year. The member mix is kind of the member mix we have now at this point. And that really pertains to just the elements that I mentioned in my prepared comments about some of the benefit design impacts and how that impacted both our growth and also the type of membership that we were left with as we saw our full configuration. That really lasts with us throughout the year. So -- but that was an element we also incorporated into our view for 2025 as we approached our bids for '25. Thank you. Yeah. Good morning, Lisa. As you can -- I guess I'd start by -- it is early in that journey in terms of the potential and opportunity for what we can do. And yes, it was a very strong quarter in terms of cost management. But let me just step back a moment here. As you can imagine, given how some of these businesses were built and the fragmentation of the system, there are duplicative functions and uneven consumer experiences throughout that we're addressing. And as our businesses begin to scale, our ability to produce efficiency accelerates while, at same time, we can improve those customer experiences and expand the best practice across the broader base. The comments that Andrew was offering in his answer to your question, it's just really a natural outgrowth as these businesses begin to move beyond what we have viewed the earliest phases to a more adolescent phase. That's what we're seeing. Very strong this quarter. Over the longer term, we can expect advancement. I wouldn't expect it to remain at this level consistently as we look ahead over the next few quarters, though. It was a super strong quarter. But we are going to look to invest in many of these items that Andrew just articulated here, getting to a more modern streamlined experiences as these businesses evolve further. So I wouldn't expect it to persist right at this level as we make those investments, and we're anxious and ambitious to make those investments. Good morning, Justin. I'd say first, yes, the way you described our assumptions around core full year MLR are consistent with our expectations. So how you describe that is quite consistent. As it relates to just looking at towards the 3Q and such, I'd expect that to be in the neighborhood of 84%, very likely a few tens of basis points higher than that. So, it's kind of a little bit above that in that zone. As it relates to kind of other elements that we've pulled out here, no, they shouldn't be material. Those cyber effects should continue to abate. As we mentioned, we're not adjusting for the elements we talked about the provider and coding intensity, so that kind of pulls through a little bit. But there shouldn't be any material other impacts that we're thinking about. Thank you. Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. This is John. So yeah, exactly what we said there was nothing material there going on in development. No favorable P&L impacting development in the quarter, very similar to last quarter in terms of there was just no impact being there. And in terms of just a comment -- or questions regarding outperformance, well, maybe some across a number of the businesses in terms of where we're seeing, we're seeing very strong growth, certainly in our commercial health benefits business, we're seeing strong growth. We're seeing margin progression in OptumHealth. So we're seeing advancement. The -- really, the strong approach that the team at M&R took and tell how they looked at '24 in terms of overcoming the headwinds at V-28 and the very disciplined approach they took to how they stepped out into the marketplace with the products that they took. Even with some of the elements that we talked about that we're overcoming there, but certainly, all those creating a good impact from us. Clearly, just across the company, the strong operating efficiencies that the company is driving, strong and sustained. And as I said, look, we will continue to make investments, but really a significant progress on that and still very early stage. So as Andrew commented in terms of the potential we have as we look over the next three years and this impact, and we're just getting some of these businesses to a maturity level where we think we can really harness that. Thank you. Yeah. And regarding Change, yes, as we mentioned in our comments and Roger mentioned, our ambition is to get back to baseline expectations performance for that business in 2025. So those baseline expectations being what we would have expected prior to any of this happening. And clearly this quarter, we have increased the impact of the business disruption here. So as we bring those back, there's the pacing of those revenues coming back, taking sometimes a little bit more time to bring in, but that is our ambition, actually, as we look ahead."

So, as we think about margins in the MA business and as it relates to our bid, I think we've talked about the consistent approach to how we plan margins. And we maintain -- continue to maintain that and we're operating comfortably within that margin range as we have in the past and as we're planning in 2025. And then when I think about our pricing approach for 2025, as Andrew mentioned, too early to get into a lot of specifics as CMS is reviewing those bids right now. But we're in a posture and how we've priced those products as we'll be comfortable with whatever growth is the outcome of the products that we bring to marketplace in 2025."

And while we might see a little bit of dislocation the rest of the year, states have really committed to accurately reflecting the change in acuity from redeterminations into current and future adjustments and really expect this to even out as we pace through the remainder of \u201824 and early \u201825.

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under US Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial and Earnings Reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 16, 2024, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We have a lot to cover. First, we'll discuss the status and impact of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, then we'll turn to the performance of our businesses, which continue to grow and perform well. It's important to underscore at the outset that even as we have devoted significant attention to addressing the Change Healthcare attack, the vast majority of the 400,000 people of this enterprise have remained as usual, intensely focused on delivering for all those we serve. That dedication is reflected in our overall performance this quarter. Directly as a result of their hard and -- hard work and the broad performance of our diversified businesses, we're able to reconfirm our full year adjusted earnings outlook, even as we absorb $0.30 to $0.40 per share in business disruption impacts related to Change Healthcare. Now turning to Change Healthcare, this was an unprecedented attack by a malicious actor on the US health system. We promptly disconnected the affected services and turned our focus to two main areas, restoration and support. The attack disrupted the ability of care providers to file claims and be paid for their work, we moved quickly to fill this gap. Fortunately, we were able to bring to bear the substantial resources of UnitedHealth Group to drive the recovery and begin to mitigate the impact. Resources, which are standalone to Change Healthcare, would not have had access to on its own. These are the resources and the philosophy that underpinned our remediation of healthcare.gov back in 2013, and our distribution of CMS COVID emergency relief funds to care providers in 2020. Here, we assisted care providers in financial need, providing over $6 billion in funding, all at no cost to them. We rapidly deployed resources to develop alternative solutions and move promptly to restore claims and payment services. We've made substantial progress and we will not rest until care providers' connectivity needs are met. And to help care providers mitigate workflow disruptions and help ensure the uninterrupted delivery of care, for a period of time, we suspended some care management activities. I'm immensely grateful for our colleagues who continue to work tirelessly day and night to restore services, free up funds for providers, and protect the broader health system. Let me touch on two more items we know are of interest to you. First is care activity. The central point is that overall care patterns are consistent with what we anticipated last year heading into 2024 and within the outlook we shared with you in November. The second item is the essential value of Medicare Advantage to seniors. Here are what we see, some of the core facts regarding Medicare Advantage. It drives better health outcomes, provides a higher-value, significantly more comprehensive benefit for people, all at a lower cost to beneficiaries and taxpayers, and is more popular with and valuable to seniors than traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage consumers spend on average 45% less on premiums and out-of-pocket costs than those in traditional Medicare. That translates into nearly $2,400 in savings annually and several times more for the country's most underserved and medically challenged populations. That's one of the many reasons why more than half of seniors choose Medicare Advantage today versus 30% 10 years ago and why we believe these offerings will continue to grow strongly for years to come. 2025 is the second year of the significant three-year phase funding reductions to Medicare Advantage introduced by CMS last year. Here, in early 2024, we're at the beginning of our thoughtful responsible three-year plan we developed last year to adapt to those changes. Our strategy continues to focus on providing as much stability as possible in the reduced funding environment. Improving outcomes and experiences for the consumers we're privileged to serve, and delivering the performance you expect from us. We believe our long-term perspective and the deliberate multi-year approach we began last year is serving us well, putting us into a position of sustainable competitive strength. Among a handful of notable business developments to share, UnitedHealthcare was honored to secure major Medicaid wins in Virginia, Texas and Michigan. While we're disappointed in the outcome in Florida, we'll be seeking to better understand the process and considerations there. There is a substantial pipeline of Medicaid RFPs and we're confident that our offerings will resonate in other states as well. UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits continued their momentum from last year, growing to serve two million more people in the first quarter, the largest increase in years. This growth was across UHC's commercial customer segments from individuals up through the largest of employers. This is further evidence of our innovative and consumer-centric products have established the footing for sustained growth. We also see continued momentum at Optum Rx, coming off last year's record-selling season with a recent win in Hawaii and the renewal of our contract with the Department of Veteran Affairs. We're grateful for the opportunity to support them. And Optum Health is tracking well to achieve its objective of growing to serve another 750,000 patients in value-based arrangements this year in partnership with many payers. Before I turn it over to John Rex, our President and Chief Financial Officer, I want to acknowledge Dirk McMahon, recently retired after more than 20 years of service, I'd like to thank him for his leadership and partnership. Dirk has left an indelible mark on this company through the example he set and the many of our leaders he has mentored. John?\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Andrew. This morning I'll first provide color on some of the unique items in the quarter directly related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, followed by care activity trends, business updates, and finally thoughts on the remainder of '24. But first, let me start at the most fundamental level. The UnitedHealth Group businesses continued to grow and perform well during the quarter, and we are encouraged by the momentum and the many opportunities to serve we're seeing across the enterprise. On the Change Healthcare cyberattack, as Andrew noted, our guiding focus throughout has been to make sure patient care is delivered and care providers' access to funding is secured as we work to bring back services fully. The cyber impacts in the quarter totaled about $870 million or $0.74 per share. At this distance, we estimate the full year impact will be $1.15 per share to $1.35 per share. Let me break that down into its key components. Of the $870 million, about $595 million were direct costs due to the clearinghouse platform restoration and other response efforts, including medical expenses directly relating to the temporary suspension of some care management activities. For the full year, we estimate these direct costs at $1 billion to $1.15 billion or $0.85 per share to $0.95 per share. It's important to note these direct costs are included in net earnings, but are excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The other component affecting our results relates to the disruption of ongoing Change Healthcare business. This is driven by the loss of revenues associated with the affected services, all while incurring the support and costs to keep these capabilities fully ready to return to service. Notably, these effects are not excluded from adjusted earnings. In the first quarter, this impact was about $280 million or $0.25 per share. At this distance, we currently estimate the business disruption at $350 million to $450 million or $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share for the year. This, of course, will depend on the ultimate timing of service and transaction volume restoration. These elements are broken out for you in the supplemental tables provided with our press release this morning. Of course, we will provide regular updates on our progress and outlook throughout the course of the year. While much of Change Healthcare's functionality and services have been restored, we are working hard to restore more and the objective we all share is for an even stronger Change Healthcare to be fully returned to expected performance levels next year. I'll come back to some of these elements in more detail in just a moment. Turning to underlying care patterns. The headline is that these continue within our expectations. Outpatient care activity among seniors remains consistent with the elevated levels we began seeing in the first half of '23 and for which we planned. So we continue to be comfortable with the outlook we established last June when we filed our 2024 Medicare Advantage benefit offerings. The winter seasonal activity we discussed with you in January, particularly related to strong vaccine uptake, higher respiratory illness incidents, and related physician office visits has subsided. Overall inpatient care activity also remains within our expectations. The first quarter medical care ratio at 84.3% included roughly 40 basis points or about $340 million related to the temporary suspension of some care management activities. These have been recently reinstated. The majority of the remaining $325 million of full year medical expense impact included in our outlook will land in the second quarter. Notably, we did not reflect any favorable earnings impacting medical reserve development in the quarter. Out of prudence, due to the potential for the cyberattack to affect claims receipt timing, we reflected an additional $800 million of claims reserves. We'll continue with a judicious view as we progress over the next several quarters. Turning to the performance of our businesses. The most important takeaway is they are growing and performing at a level, which allows us to maintain the adjusted earnings per share objectives we established last November, even while taking on the business disruption impacts of the Change Healthcare attack. At UnitedHealthcare, revenues of $75.4 billion grew nearly $5 billion. Within our domestic commercial membership, we're off to a strong start, powered by disciplined growth, serving 2.1 million new consumers in the first quarter. We are encouraged by the momentum and positive customer response to our differentiated offerings and look forward to building further upon that momentum heading into '25. For Medicare Advantage, as you would anticipate, we are deeply into our '25 planning activities. As we finalize our '25 benefit designs over the next several weeks, we will build competitive offerings that once again appropriately reflect the funding and cost environment. We approached this last year with a deliberate three-year plan, which continues firmly on track and positions us well going into '25. Our Medicaid business ended the first quarter with 7.7 million members. As Andrew noted, key wins in Texas, Virginia, and Michigan demonstrate the value state customers see in our offerings. In Virginia, UHC was the highest-scoring plan with particular strength in member-centric care, benefits and service delivery, quality, and value-based payments. In Texas, UHC was awarded the maximum number of possible service areas, expanding the number of people we will have the opportunity to serve. And in Michigan, UHC achieved perfect scores in such critical consumer-centric areas as social determinants of health and health equity, further solidifying our value proposition. Optum Health's revenues grew by 16% to $26.7 billion, as we increased the number of patients served and are on track to approach five million patients in value-based care by year end. For the most complex patients that Optum Health serves, we have engaged 75% through the first quarter this year, a significant increase in the number of patients engaged over last year. This reflects progressively earlier connectivity with patients and the ability to improve their health outcomes and experiences more rapidly. Optum Rx revenues grew 12% to $30.8 billion, driven by new client starts, continued expansion within existing partnerships, and growth within pharmacy services. Optum Insight, as you know, is where the Change Healthcare business resides. In the quarter, about $500 million of the $870 million total impact is within Optum Insight. Just under half of this are direct response costs, think clearinghouse restoration activities, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings, and slightly over half are the business disruption effects, which are not excluded from adjusted earnings. For many of the impact of Change Healthcare services, transaction volume drives revenues. So the effect of the attack in the period is one of keeping all the lights brightly burning at full readiness to resume services, while revenue production was essentially suspended. To be clear, the Optum Insight team did the critical and right thing, promptly shutting off services and finding any method possible to keep the care system working, including helping clients find alternative solutions. Coming out of this incident, the team will be working tirelessly with customers to recover transaction volumes and demonstrate that Change Healthcare is ready to serve and is more valuable than ever. Beyond Change Healthcare, the Optum Insight revenue backlog increased to nearly $33 billion, growth of over $2 billion from a year ago, driven by health system partnerships to provide business process and information technology services. A couple of other items of note that were affected by the cyberattack. Days claims payable in the first quarter were 47.1 compared to the 47.9 in the fourth quarter '23, and 47.8 a year ago. The accelerated payments to care providers and the Brazil sale reduced what would have been our reported measure for the quarter by about three days. The medical cost payable balance increased $1.6 billion from year-end '23 to $34 billion. The change reflects a $3 billion increase in the incurred but not yet reported component or IBNR. This is a result of the prudent ongoing claims receipt assessment, offset by a $1.6 billion reduction in the fully processed claims component, due to care provider payments acceleration. Cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.1 billion, impacted by about $3 billion due to the funding acceleration to care providers and collection extensions to affected customers, and were additionally impacted by the timing of some public sector receipts. To summarize, a continued focus on better serving patients and the health system underpins our mission and growth drivers, which remain strong. And as we move further into this year, the broadly strong performance across our enterprise allows us to continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $27.50 to $28.00, even as we incorporate a $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share of business disruption impacts. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, John. As we look out over the next several years, we, like many others, see a healthcare environment in need of improvements in quality, value, simplification, and consumer responsiveness. While we're a comparatively small part of the $5 trillion US Health System, UnitedHealth Group's strategy is focused on helping to meet those very needs and we're well-positioned to do so. Our focus on understanding opportunities to align incentives, notably led via our value-based care offerings, demonstrates what can be achieved through partnership and realignment of ways of working. Our commitment to improving all we do for consumers stimulates our drive to help bring care to patients, where they need and want it, at prices and with an experience worthy of the 2020s. We have a proven commitment to making available our insights and innovations widely and quickly throughout the market alongside our relentless multi-payer orientation at Optum. We remain committed to partnering with others throughout healthcare to help make the health system more modern and responsive. Our success depends on enabling partners and customers outside our company to succeed. The combination of this strategic design, strengths, and behaviors underpins our high confidence in our ability to navigate the inevitable environmental change and challenge, and it reinforces our confidence in our ability to perform and grow strongly as you have come to expect from us. With that, operator, we'll turn to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much and thanks for all the comments. I just want to go back to your comment around your three-year plan as it pertains to V28, does the 2025 final bid change anything around that plan? And how do I think about the impact in the quarter of V28 in both Optum Health as well as on the UnitedHealth side?\nAndrew Witty: Yeah, Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Yeah, as we've said a few times and certainly repeated this morning, we've looked at the changes that CMS finalized last year really thoughtfully and we see this as a three-year strategy in response. Obviously, it's phased in over three years. We want to make sure we don't do anything that chases short-term growth, for example, but puts a lot -- puts at risk long-term sustainability. What you're also not going to see from ours is a kind of knee-jerk reaction between growth and margin. We want to be very focused on ensuring that year in, year out, we're a super reliable performer in this environment. As you look at the most recent final rate, I don't think it really changes the story. Obviously, a little disappointing that we don't think CMS really reflected what we've seen over the last year in terms of actual in-market medical trend. But in reality, it's just a little extra pressure for '25 on top of what we'd already seen previously. We're well-positioned for that in terms of all the work we've been doing really from the get go last year. Really from February last year, we've been getting ourselves lined up for this. You're seeing that reflected in Q1 in a few really key features, right? So you're seeing really strong cost control inside the company as you'd absolutely expect us to do, making sure that we're not incurring any expense that we don't need to support our members and patients on the outside of the organization. You saw us take a very thoughtful bid strategy last year, and of course, we continue to focus on how to make sure that we manage medical cost as effectively as possible, ensuring quality of care delivered and avoiding waste. All of that plays through. I'm very, very pleased with how this first quarter has played out in that respect. If you look at the performance of Optum Health and our MA business within UnitedHealthcare, both very strong performance during this quarter despite the pressure that's been incurred on them from the rate notice last year and I think that bodes super well for the rest of this year and the strategy that we've laid out for the next three. Thanks, Lisa. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you just explain what medical costs you categorized as accommodations to support care providers? I think the UM management that you guys are talking about, what a certain medical -- what puts a certain medical expense in that bucket? And then when you look at your actual claims received or claims processed inventories, what percentage of a normal or expected quarter did you actually see in the quarter versus how much did you just sort of put into IBNR?\nAndrew Witty: Josh, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Brian Thompson in a second just to give you a little bit more color on the first part of your question. Listen, I think by the time we got to the end of the quarter, we had the overwhelming majority of what we'd anticipate in receipt -- in terms of claims received into the organization because it's always a little bit tricky to be absolute about that, because you're kind of comparing against what you would have expected, and as you obviously know, every quarter you see corrections both up and down in terms of actual claim submissions catching up with what you may have estimated and that's been obviously the feature of this marketplace. But overall, I would say, UHC claims receipt was very, very close to normal by the time we closed the quarter. But maybe, Brian, you could give a little more color commentary on how you would characterize some of that relief we gave.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. I appreciate the question. Yeah, Josh, I believe we started March 8th and what we did, I call it foregone utilization management protocols and those are really in two categories. The first is we suspended our inpatient level of care reviews, where we assess for appropriateness of inpatient versus outpatient and that was the lion's share of our adjustment and we've got a long history of understanding those elements. It's just a unit cost adjustment. So pretty simple and easy to estimate and adjust for. The second element inside those practices was some outpatient prior authorizations that we also suspended. Those were a smaller element inside this quarter. Those will play out a little bit more in next quarter as you think about that lag between notice and actual incurral date. But again, pretty easy for us to estimate. These are practices we've had in place for a very long time and feel comfortable about the adjustment that we made.\nAndrew Witty: Brian, thanks so much. And just again to confirm, as you heard from John, we brought those processes back into play in the last few days. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Congratulations on working through all this. Maybe just to make sure I understand a little more, the $800 million reserve that you're holding out and you did comment, you didn't take any prior period development to the bottom-line. I guess it sounds like you've used the word prudent several times in describing that. How much -- just maybe to follow-up on the last question, how much of that is things that either from which you get insight from Optum Health or from your own ability to look at prior year claims versus what you've seen so far is what you really think is going to happen and how much of that is sort of add-on just because of the moving parts out there? And then it sounds like you're basically saying that the care dynamics are similar, is there anything you call out outpatient, inpatient that suggest any variance relative to your MLR assumptions for the year when you started out?\nAndrew Witty: So I'm going to ask John just to comment on the $800 million more specifically. I mean, I think as we said a couple of times, A.J., really not seeing anything stand out in terms of care pattern differentiation from what we really expected. I mean, as we mentioned earlier, that kind of pressure we saw at the end of Q4 and rolling into the very beginning of the year around some kind of winter syndrome vaccination dynamics, we talked about a lot last time. As expected that did subside. Beyond that, I would -- which was what we were anticipating. Beyond that, I wouldn't say there's anything really to call out within all of that. John, could you maybe go a little deeper on the $800 million?\nJohn Rex: Yeah, good morning, A.J. Yeah, so picking up on comment Andrew had made earlier, so what you're really doing there is estimating what you didn't see. So claims receipts that you may have not received in the quarter and trying to make an accommodation for that, as you said, a prudent accommodation for that. Just to acknowledge, that there clearly had to be some disruption in the quarter in claims patterns and so you're trying to make some estimation in that zone to anticipate that. So you need to put it somewhere in the zone, it's not zero and it's not 800, somewhere in between, probably as you think about those elements and where you might -- where you might land and so as we look out. And you should expect that we'll probably continue with a judicious view over this, over the next several quarters actually also. We want to make sure that we've got full visibility into this that the claims are flowing and as we sit here on April 16th, it does. We see at UHC. We see a fairly normal claims receipts and payments flows going on at this point, but we really want to be careful on that because we know there are certain care providers out there that may have been left out a bit, and so we'll continue to be very judicious next quarter also in terms of assessing that.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. Thank you, A.J. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. First, I just wanted to quickly follow-up on A.J.'s question here around $800 million. Can you just be specific around, is that conservatism related to 2023, meaning you would have had up to $800 million of development that would have benefited the quarter or are you saying that you just took extra reserves that actually impacted Q1? Because we're looking at an MLR that's 50 basis points above where you kind of expected it and if you're saying trend is in line, so we're trying to figure out, was there a 50 basis point miss or are you saying that really that's just the conservatism here. And then any -- my question was really around the relative visibility on cost trend, right? Last year, it was somewhat opaque. You kind of told us that there was some uncertainty and then if that uncertainty turned to certainty around, hey, trend is higher in Q2. How do you feel about your visibility this year? Do we have to wait till 2Q to kind of be able to declare that, hey, we're kind of through this and you're not seeing what the rest of the industry is seeing or do you do you think we probably have to get that updated again in second quarter? And lastly, any commentary on Q2 MLR and where you think you end up in the full year range for MLR would certainly be helpful if you could provide? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Okay, Justin. Thanks for those questions. Let me -- I'm going to ask John in a second just to go back and again just give you a little bit more definition around the $800 million as you asked. Just in terms of -- and just in terms of cost trend and let me make a couple of comments and ask Brian maybe to go a little deeper as well and then come back to John. As I look at the cost trend this year versus last year, some big differences. So last year, really I think the core of the story of what led to that sort of step shift, if I can put it that way, in early Q2 -- Q2 of last year. I think that was really -- and the hindsight tells us that was really around a kind of post-COVID or end of COVID story playing out in terms of capacity coming on stream most importantly and to some degree of pent-up demand. I actually think the capacity coming on stream was as much an issue driver of that as anything else. So I think to some degree a one-off. We don't see anything like that. We've seen much more stabilization. We haven't seen a step down from that trend. We'd be super clear about that. We haven't seen it kind of go back down again, but we've certainly seen that kind of sustained activity without aggressive acceleration. And then the other thing, I would say to you is, as you would expect, given that shift we saw last year in the intervening year, we've put in a lot of sensing mechanisms across our organization, both in UAC and Optum, to look for early warning signals of changes, quite a low granularity in terms of trying to figure out how this pattern plays out. Now as all our actuaries and any actual will tell you that the gold standard of knowledge on trend is a paid claim, but nonetheless, we've tried to put in place a lot more prospective sensing capability. And again, that's kind of consistent with what we're sharing with you. So we're not really anticipating a big change there. I mean, obviously, the future is the future, but as we sit today, everything looks pretty much as expected. Brian, you may want to give a bit more from a UHC perspective.\nBrian Thompson: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. And I think you summarized it well. I'll reiterate what you heard from John, which is what we're seeing in these underlying service types, inpatient, outpatient, et cetera, are in line with what we had planned for, so I'll reiterate that. Just to add to that level of improved visibility this year over last, certainly COVID being the biggest driver, but also re-determinations. Last year, we were at the beginning of that. This year, we're nearing the end of that. So two key unknowns a year ago I think that contributed to perhaps a little less visibility, both of which I think we've really got a better view to this year. And the last thing I'll just point out is, as we've paced through one-one, I also feel good about our business mix. Again, early in the stages of evaluation of that, but how our growth has changed and what we've seen in those profiles from the growth that you're seeing in our Commercial business to the growth in our Medicare business as well, really feel good about all those elements. So, yes, optimistic about the rest of the year and how it's playing out against what we had planned for.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks, Brian. And John?\nJohn Rex: Yeah, Justin, good morning. So I think the way you look at it, so overall the net view being, so we didn't let any earnings or medical care ratio impacting development flow-through into the quarter. And when you look at it, so you can come at it, as to the normative course of assessments would have indicated some potential for favorable development in the quarter. We would -- we took a position also that there was likelihood that there were claims we didn't receive. And so in terms of the claims completion factors and such and so how that may have impacted and so you're really netting that all off in the course of the quarter to try to just normalize that out, not having any impact from any of those -- from those elements, and taking a pretty prudent view of where you might be in terms of the claims you received. In terms of your question here on the Q2 MCR, at this distance, I put it in a similar zip code to 1Q, including similar impact from the cyber effects that we had also, and as I noted in response to A.J.'s question, we'll be continued to be very judicious as we look at those patterns also on claims receipts. So we'll continue with the judicious view of how we think about -- how we think about development and those impacts as we step out here in the next couple of quarters to make sure we're getting our claims receipt timings fully incurred here.\nAndrew Witty: Great. John, thanks so much. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Yeah, hi, thanks. The business disruption costs you've projected beyond the first quarter are, I think, smaller maybe than most had expected despite the fact we've heard commentary from stakeholders reducing their dependence on Change Healthcare during the quarter. I guess, what are you seeing from customers on that front? I guess, how much of that recovery do you have on the revenue line? Do you have line-of-sight to versus you have to drive throughout the balance of the year to get to that no impact to 2025 that you seem to expect? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yeah, Stephen, thanks so much. So I'm going to ask Roger Connor, who runs Optum Insight to give you a little detail on this. First off, so I just want to -- I just want to take a moment to pay credit to the teams for the speed in which they brought back the overwhelming majority, the functionality of Optum -- of Change Healthcare after the attack. It's been extraordinary example of really the resources of UHG, and frankly, the support of many of the biggest companies across America in the tech environment coming in to help recover from this particular attack, which was straight out an attack on the US Health System, and designed to create maximum damage I think. We've got through that very well in terms of the remediation and the build back to functionality, and Roger, maybe you could share a little bit of what you're seeing and expect in terms of customer dynamics over the next few months.\nRoger Connor: Yeah, we'll do. Stephen, thanks very much for the question. So the way that we're thinking about the whole cyberattack response is two key areas of focus. First of all, as Andrew mentioned, good progress on system restoration. If you look at the biggest areas where we have the largest number of customers, that's pharmacy, claim, and payment, we're up to 80% functionality and that's continuing to improve day-by-day. Now we've still got work to do. We've got another set of products coming online in the number in the coming weeks, but pleased with that progress. I think your question is really about our next focus, which is recovering the business and this is about bringing those products back, but actually bringing them back stronger where we can. We're adding functionality where we can too. But then also bringing back customers, who because of the outage have to go elsewhere to get things like their clearance house support. Now we are confident in our ability to do that. Why? Well, first of all, the portfolio and the differentiation we have, which is good. But also, as you can imagine, we're talking to those customers all the time and they want their functionality back. They like what they've got or they had with Change and they want to get that back. So we're working with them to ensure that we can actually do that. Also, we provided financial support to a number of our clients and they appreciate that. They have said to us that they appreciate it. That's a signal that we are committed both to them, but then also to this marketplace as well. So when you add those elements up, Stephen, that's where we're confident. We've got more work to do. This has been a heavy lift and we're going to continue that work. But that's why we're confident in getting back to that baseline performance in 2025.\nAndrew Witty: Roger, thanks so much. And I think, Stephen, what you heard in Roger's response there is a couple of really important features of the character of UnitedHealth Group, super high resilience and we will always stand by our customers and clients, and when an attack like this happens, which puts our customers and clients at risk, we will do whatever it takes to make sure they get through that, whether it's technical fixes or financial support, we are going to stand by our clients, who in this case are the providers and the systems across America who look after American patients and we will do that. And I think that means a lot to a lot of people and it's an important capability to have running through the backbone of American healthcare. With that, Stephen, thanks for the question. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Just want to go more -- a little bit more into the visibility that you guys think that you have into claims today. It sounds like you feel like you're largely back, but I guess, where would you say today that you are from a percent visibility into claims versus the same time last year? And I know that there's forecasted improvement, but I think there's a lot of focus on the ability to price 2025 correctly. So by the time you're submitting your MA bids, how much back to normal? What percentage back to normal do you think you'll be from a claims perspective at that point? And then finally, I'm used to hearing you guys reiterate 13% to 16% long term EPS growth, but I didn't hear that in the prepared remarks. I just wasn't sure if that was due to time or whether there was anything that you were trying to say there. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: All right. So I'm going to ask John to comment on your substantive question, Kevin, and I'm going to ask you just to stay on the line for my last paragraph for closing comments for the second part of your question. John?\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Kevin. So as we sit here today on April 16th, I would say, UHC is pretty much back to normal levels in terms of claim submission activity. We view it as normalized now. That we're seeing claims slowing like they -- we'd expect them to be flowing and moving along. So that's all progressing quite well, which assists a lot with the piece that you were just describing here in terms of where we think that is and as we move forward and look over the next month plus to finalize our bid submissions and such. So feel good about that in terms of our visibility and insights.\nAndrew Witty: Yeah. Thanks so much, John, and thanks so much, Kevin. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the reported DOJ investigation. I'd be curious, has the company had kind of dialogue with the DOJ and do you have a sense of timeline for what the next steps might be as we look about what -- for what the possible outcome of this process could be?\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. Listen, I think you'd probably expect we don't comment on these sorts of matters and I don't think it would be appropriate to do so today, and certainly, we never have done in the past. So it's not something we're going to get into in the call, but I appreciate the interest. Thanks. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Andrew Mok with Barclays.\nAndrew Mok: Hi. Good morning. Commercial risk and ASO membership both came in above the high end of your initial guidance, can you help us understand what drove the membership -- a better membership results for each segment? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much for the question. I'll ask Dan Kueter, who runs our E&I business from UHC to respond to that. Dan?\nDan Kueter: Yeah. Hi, Andrew, and thanks for the question. Certainly encouraged with the broad based growth, share gaining growth, I would say, in our Individual segment, our Local Market segment, and our National Accounts business. Some of the key drivers underlying that, about a third of our Group growth gains were attached to our most innovative products and the expansion of those into 37 states now, on a fully-insured basis, to be -- and also fully available nationally on an ASO fee-based business. Specifically inside the risk business, our individual and family exchange-based plans were a significant driver of the growth. We've seen some latency. From membership, we expected that would have come in from re-determinations into the final portions of 2023, now begin to emerge into 2024. That's been a significant contributor to that risk-based growth in the first quarter. As a punchline, I like our growth, I like the pricing, very much like the profile of both the groups and the consumers that we're attracting. And finally, I'm really pleased with the consumer experience that our teams are delivering to those that we serve. Thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much. And as you saw, Dan's organization delivered an extraordinary two million member growth in the first quarter, one of the highest growth rates we've seen for many, many years. And I think that really comes down to relentless focus on modernization of service offer and then delivery of that service offer, and I'm very proud of the whole team in the UHC Commercial businesses domestically for what they've done. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Thanks. Question on Optum Health. As we're looking at outlook there, we've been really focused on capacity growth in the systems, do you guys have any insights for your capacity growth in Optum Health? Obviously, you've been taking some cost actions there, so interested in hiring trends. And then second, have you been renegotiating risk deals? I know that there was likely some of that for '24. What's the outlook for that and the impact of that in '24 and the outlook of that for '25? Thanks a lot.\nAndrew Witty: Yeah, Lance, thanks so much. And I'm glad you've asked about Optum Health. I'm going to ask Dr. Desai to respond to that. Amar runs our Optum Health business. He has been doing a great job of continuing to mature that business for us, which for me, I think is one of the great headlines of Optum Health. Its continuous maturation as a sophisticated value-based care delivery organization, and Amar, maybe you could respond to Lance's question.\nAmar Desai: Yeah, thanks for the question, Lance. I'll take the first one in terms of hiring trends. We continue to work with more providers in a deeper way continuing to grow across a range of arrangements. As you know, physicians across the country work with us in contracted affiliated arrangements as well as employed arrangements and we continue to have strong partnership and growth, both organically and also through some of our inorganic M&A activity. We don't see a capacity constraint there. In fact, we've continued to see incredible growth with our payer partners to the second part of your question. The risk partner growth continues to increase across multiple payers. It's being driven by some of the funding and benefit dynamics that are out there. Folks are looking for a real stable partner to be able to grow with. We have worked with them continuously in terms of our contracts, both looking at the benefit and funding changes and ensuring that the funding level is appropriate for the risk that we're taking on, and to be able to provide very high quality care across our membership. So we're very proud of the growth we've had and we'll continue to do so. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Amar, thanks so much. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nSarah James: Thank you. We wanted to understand a little bit better the $3 billion in IBNR. So just our back-of-the-envelope math suggests if 15% to 20% of claims from UHC run-through change, post-event that would be like assuming a third of the change-related claims are delayed, is that in the ballpark of where your change completion factor assumptions were? And keeping that conservative assumption of a claims like throughout the year, what does that imply for the seasonality of the remaining $0.41 to $0.61 GAAP impact from change?\nAndrew Witty: Sarah James, thanks so much. John?\nJohn Rex: Yeah. So I don't know if I'd kind of go right with some of those stats that you pulled out in terms of where those fell, but here's some insights I can offer on that. So, one of the elements we wanted to break out on the IBNR component is, so, as you know, what we report on the balance sheet you received this morning, medical costs payable is a combination of IBNR and medical claims payable. And so we're hoping to provide some more transparency for you as you looked at the quarter and such, and a $3 billion increase in IBNR is significant. And then offsetting that on the -- on that line item would have been the -- really the funding advances. The component where we just made sure that as soon as the claim was in-house processed, we were speeding it out-the-door to get it to providers. That was one of the components in addition to the interest-free loans we made that we were helping the provider community -- the provider community with. As you talked -- as you discussed kind of where we were, let's say, today, we feel that UnitedHealthcare is essentially at normalized levels in terms of -- in terms of claims receipts. As we sit here, we're going to be super prudent in how we look at that because we know there are providers out there that could still be having trouble submitting claims, and still having troubles with payment flows and such, and so we're going to be very appropriately constrained in how we think about that dynamic playing out here over the next -- over the next couple of quarters. But really, those are the kind of mechanics of what's going on between the IBNR component that you spotlighted and the full line of medical costs payable.\nAndrew Witty: Right. Thanks, John. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on that point, John. My understanding is, on the IBNR that you report in your Qs and Ks includes unprocessed claims, inventories, so the $3 billion, is that just going to tie to the number we see when the Q comes out? Are you saying the $3 billion really is true unreported claims at this point?\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Gary. John?\nJohn Rex: $3 billion is IBNR directly, that is to your point. That is the IBNR component of it, Gary.\nAndrew Witty: Okay. Thanks, John. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Okay, thanks. On capital deployment, you didn't change your expectations for share repurchases, but how should we think about the priorities more broadly, whether it's M&A or otherwise in your ability to be opportunistic on that front? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Erin, thanks so much. I'll ask John to comment on it.\nJohn Rex: Yeah, Erin. Yeah, we didn't update any of those components here. We continue to take a very balanced view in terms of how we think about our opportunities. You saw, certainly, that we had activity in the quarter from -- in terms of both share repurchase and dividends. Also, we continue with robust opportunities in the marketplace in terms of other capabilities that we are looking at. So that all continues strong. So you'll see us continue to balance those out nicely in terms of -- in terms of the opportunities that are out there and with capacities really to approach all those elements strongly.\nAndrew Witty: Yeah, and I continue to see very interesting diverse pipeline of M&A opportunity across the marketplace in terms of business areas that we have interest in. As I think you see some of the funding changes play out across the -- across the next few years, I suspect that may also create new opportunities for us as different companies assess their positions. I think how we look at this situation is we have a good strong strategy for how we navigate through this dynamic. You're seeing that play out super well in the first quarter performance of Optum Health and UHC and I think it gives us a sense of real confidence as we look not just in terms of our performance, but potentially how we might think about M&A opportunity. And as you rightly said, be somewhat opportunistic if those moments arrive. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners.\nWhit Mayo: Thanks. Good morning. Just back on the 2025 rate notice, I think you're -- if I'm hearing you correctly, it sounds like you're framing this as modestly disappointing, but perhaps manageable. Just any more color on growth expectations for next year? And then if you could elaborate on the broker agent changes, what this could potentially mean for your strategy seems like a meaningful change. Don't know, if you think about investing more into captive broker strategies, just any color would be helpful. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much for the question. I mean, obviously, we're not going to get into give kind of '25 numbers or expectation just yet, but Tim Noel, who runs our M&R business, certainly give you some good perspective on the rest of your question. Tim?\nTim Noel: Yeah, good morning, Whit. Thanks for the question. So on the final notice and some of the distribution elements of that, we continue to believe that there's opportunities to improve the distribution environment in Medicare Advantage and have been in a dialog with CMS for several years on how to do that. Some of the elements of the final notice that were published recently are directly in line with some of our recommendations and some of them are relatively consistent, but not totally as we had conceived them. I would also say right now, it's a little bit early to comment on how this might rebalance some of the channel mix, as still some questions on how some of the key elements of that will be rolled out. So we're still waiting for a little bit more detail before we can get more specific on how it impacts go-to-market in '25.\nWhit Mayo: Great. Thanks so much, Tim. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.\nAnn Hynes: Hi. Good morning. So, I would say your commentary on care patterns is definitely more positive than what investors feared. And you referenced several times that trend came in line with your expectations, can you actually tell us what growth rates you're assuming like the major trend categories in guidance, whether that's inpatient and outpatient, and maybe some year-over-year growth versus historical averages? And within that, can you specifically talk about what you're assuming for MA? That'd be great. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: John, would you like to start that?\nJohn Rex: Yeah. Ann, good morning. So the components that I would call outliers are the similar components that we've talked about for a while here in terms of trend outlooks. So in particular, still go back to outpatient care for senior, what we've seen in orthopedic, cardiac, those kind of categories primarily have been the big factors. I think you brought up a really important point though. So the percentage growth in those was much bigger last year. You're coming off an environment where both the supply side had been constrained and the willingness of seniors, in particular, consumers to access that environment had been constrained for a couple of years. So those percentage factors were quite significant. You heard us talk about very significant levels on those double-digit levels of last year as we looked at those. The way we look at those really though is because you would expect that to start normalizing in terms of the percentage change. So you really look at that in terms of the number of units consumed per patient served. And so you look at those levels, that's what we're talking about and we're seeing those kind of continuing at those levels. They're continuing at those levels in terms of the number of units consumed, delivered, and -- but those percentage levels, of course, would start normalizing out a little bit in terms of what you'd seen. So that continues to be the area. It's outpatient care for seniors. It's those categories that we'd call real outlier areas versus our historical levels of trend factors. The other -- the other historical levels of trend factors remain much closer to kind of our traditional views that we've always had as a company. In the quarter, other things you look at just to get indications, and by the way, we kind of vastly expanded all those areas. First fills, you've heard us talk about that a lot. Also, first fills in the quarter, an indication of outpatient care, physician visit activity, it's kind of normalized in there also in terms of stabilizing for us and many -- the many other factors of the company historically looked at. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. And maybe ask Brian maybe to give you a little bit more from a UHC perspective, and then maybe Heather also from a Optum perspective in a second, just maybe reflect a little bit on the work you're doing in terms of how we -- obviously, medical trend is one thing, then there's a question of how well we're able to engage with folks to actually help them manage their cost and maybe come to you in a second, Heather, on some of the word that you're leading at Optum. So Brian, first?\nBrian Thompson: Sure. I think John said it well. The first headline is what we're seeing is what we plan for. But as he alluded to, some of those elements, we plan for them to be elevated year-over-year. And I don't want to lose sight of unit costs. We've talked for some time that multi-year provider group and hospital contracts renew a little later than perhaps the inflation we've seen and that is up year-over-year. The biggest driver was the outpatient. We're really pleased to see that in line with as John explained. But also, we've been able to see increases in Specialty Rx. We've planned for those. Those are in our pricing appropriately, et cetera. And we've certainly worked hard to create more access in the behavioral space. So all of those elements are modestly up, but up as we had planned for and they'll hopefully sound familiar to you because we spoke to all of these at our investor conference as we ended the year. So I think that's what I would summarize or add to John's commentary. Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: So, I would say, incredibly consistent on the Optum side. So maybe just focusing on the medical first. So I mean, I think you've heard us say this, when you look, when we came out of last year, looking into this year, our focus was on the behavioral health, those outpatient sides consistent with UnitedHealthcare. And what was very important for Optum Health was using that capacity that Amar explained in our physicians, as well as those wrap-around services and our investments to ensure that we were looking at those care patterns. So, we feel really good about coming into this year. That work we've done, John referenced engagement with particularly those most complex numbers, 75% already engaged. And that PCP engagement, that member engagement is incredibly important, whether it's with their PCP directly or it's with some of our care -- our own care management wrap-around services. Because it identifies affordability opportunities incredibly quickly. It also identifies chronic disease that needs to be managed and it gets them connected to primary care quickly. So that's our focus for the year and that's why we feel good about that our ability to control utilization on the medical side particularly. And again, what we'll remind you is a reduced funding environment as we go into this year. So that's what brings us -- that's what brings that value-based care proposition, incredible value to all of our payers. On the pharmacy side, I call it, same things. For our clients, that specialty trend is a focus and we bring those products and solutions and that's why we've seen growth on the PBM side and our pharmacies around our clinical model and the continued innovative products that we're bringing to bear. So you're seeing that pull-through in the diversified growth and strength of the performance on the Optum Rx side as well.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Heather. Just one number Heather just shared with you there, which I'm very pleased of and it's a significant improvement year-over-year is that 75% engagement of the most complex members in Optum Health. And just for that, that means three out of every four most complex, most disadvantaged folks in the country have had a direct engagement with us in the first three months of the year. That's a great rate of touch. Opens the door then for us really getting to know those folks, helping the system, helping bring the system to support that many of these people, particularly those who are trapped in their homes have just not had access to that kind of care opportunity. That engagement is the first step of doing that. We have -- we really believe that is a key to how we not only deliver an effective care delivery from a cost point of view, but also make sure they get the very best quality that they deserve. So really pleased to see that step up year-over-year. I think we have time for one last question. If we could take that question, please, Jennifer.\nOperator: Yes, we'll go to our last question from Jessica Tassan with Piper Sandler.\nJessica Tassan: [Technical Difficulty] A few more details maybe on the --\nAndrew Witty: Sorry, we missed the beginning of your question.\nJessica Tassan: Hi. Sorry about that. I'm interested in a few more details maybe around the launch of Change 2.0. If you could talk a little about what payer receptivity to reconnection has been? Whether Change retains its legacy data rights post breach? And then just any change or updated thoughts on kind of the long-term thesis on Change for something like a real-time transparent payments and decision support network? Thanks so much.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks very much for the question. Let me ask Roger to kick that one off.\nRoger Connor: Yeah, Jessica, thanks very much for the question. First of all, on your first part about Change 2.0. Again, we're just confident in terms of our ability to reconnect. I mentioned the level of functional restoration that we have. You can imagine now the next stage of this is working with payer and provider to reconnect them in a safe way and an appropriate way, and all of the conversations that we're having with them are positive as we work through it. As I mentioned, there's still work to do and that's going to take us a little bit of time, but we're continuing to work through that functionality. I think it's important also to recognize, where Change sits in the overall Optum Insight portfolio. Change Healthcare was about 15% of our projected revenue for this year and when you look at -- that means I've got thousands of people who are continuing to work on other products outside of Change, not impacted by this and their underlying performance this quarter has been strong. If you adjust for the Change out, that business' earnings actually grew by around 10%. But what we haven't slowed either, as you mentioned, is our innovation agenda. The excitement of the Change portfolio across the Optum Insight portfolio is what we can bring to this market to transform it from an innovation point-of-view. And the real-time settlement work that we're doing, plus work that we've been doing with Optum Health on value-based care and provider risk enablement, that's all still going ahead. So in terms of our innovation agenda and the performance of the underlying business within Optum Insight, we're very positive.\nAndrew Witty: Roger, thanks so much. And yeah, absolutely, Change Healthcare, the important acquisition for the group and I think important for the country that we own Change Healthcare. Without UnitedHealth Group owning Change Healthcare, this attack would likely still have happened and it would have -- it would have left Change Healthcare, I think, extremely challenged to come back because it was a part of UnitedHealth Group, we've been able to bring it back. We're going to bring it back much stronger than it was before. And secondarily, all of the reasons that we were interested in bringing the Change Healthcare capabilities and customer connectivity closer to UnitedHealth Group still absolutely holds fast in terms of the potential innovation around things like real-time settlement, clinical decision support capabilities, all of those products are the future services of the future, which ought to be characteristics of a modern healthcare environment. Those are all the reasons why we believe Change and Health -- and UHG were better together. This cyberattack has unfortunately created another true validation of why that was the right thing to do because it meant UHG was in position to resolve this much more quickly than I think would ever have been imaginable in a standalone situation.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, everybody, for all of your questions this morning. It's been a bit more of a complex quarter for sure this time around, but one that's also showed the depth and breadth of our company's capabilities. We're recovering quickly from the Change Healthcare attack and are a stronger, more capable company as a result. We're continuing to build our business based on the five strategic growth pillars that we're relentlessly focused on, and we're steadfastly confident in our ability to achieve our 13% to 16% long-term growth objective as we look to the years ahead. We very much appreciate all of your time and attention this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Sure. I appreciate the question. Yeah, Josh, I believe we started March 8th and what we did, I call it foregone utilization management protocols and those are really in two categories. The first is we suspended our inpatient level of care reviews, where we assess for appropriateness of inpatient versus outpatient and that was the lion's share of our adjustment and we've got a long history of understanding those elements. It's just a unit cost adjustment. So pretty simple and easy to estimate and adjust for. The second element inside those practices was some outpatient prior authorizations that we also suspended. Those were a smaller element inside this quarter. Those will play out a little bit more in next quarter as you think about that lag between notice and actual incurral date. But again, pretty easy for us to estimate. These are practices we've had in place for a very long time and feel comfortable about the adjustment that we made. Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. And I think you summarized it well. I'll reiterate what you heard from John, which is what we're seeing in these underlying service types, inpatient, outpatient, et cetera, are in line with what we had planned for, so I'll reiterate that. Just to add to that level of improved visibility this year over last, certainly COVID being the biggest driver, but also re-determinations. Last year, we were at the beginning of that. This year, we're nearing the end of that. So two key unknowns a year ago I think that contributed to perhaps a little less visibility, both of which I think we've really got a better view to this year. And the last thing I'll just point out is, as we've paced through one-one, I also feel good about our business mix. Again, early in the stages of evaluation of that, but how our growth has changed and what we've seen in those profiles from the growth that you're seeing in our Commercial business to the growth in our Medicare business as well, really feel good about all those elements. So, yes, optimistic about the rest of the year and how it's playing out against what we had planned for. Sure. I think John said it well. The first headline is what we're seeing is what we plan for. But as he alluded to, some of those elements, we plan for them to be elevated year-over-year. And I don't want to lose sight of unit costs.

            "content": "Yeah, thanks for the question, Lance. I'll take the first one in terms of hiring trends. We continue to work with more providers in a deeper way continuing to grow across a range of arrangements. As you know, physicians across the country work with us in contracted affiliated arrangements as well as employed arrangements and we continue to have strong partnership and growth, both organically and also through some of our inorganic M&A activity. We don't see a capacity constraint there. In fact, we've continued to see incredible growth with our payer partners to the second part of your question. The risk partner growth continues to increase across multiple payers. It's being driven by some of the funding and benefit dynamics that are out there. Folks are looking for a real stable partner to be able to grow with. We have worked with them continuously in terms of our contracts, both looking at the benefit and funding changes and ensuring that the funding level is appropriate for the risk that we're taking on, and to be able to provide very high quality care across our membership. So we're very proud of the growth we've had and we'll continue to do so. Thanks."

            "name": "Roger Connor",
            "content": "Yeah, we'll do. Stephen, thanks very much for the question. So the way that we're thinking about the whole cyberattack response is two key areas of focus. First of all, as Andrew mentioned, good progress on system restoration. If you look at the biggest areas where we have the largest number of customers, that's pharmacy, claim, and payment, we're up to 80% functionality and that's continuing to improve day-by-day. Now we've still got work to do. We've got another set of products coming online in the number in the coming weeks, but pleased with that progress. I think your question is really about our next focus, which is recovering the business and this is about bringing those products back, but actually bringing them back stronger where we can. We're adding functionality where we can too. But then also bringing back customers, who because of the outage have to go elsewhere to get things like their clearance house support. Now we are confident in our ability to do that. Why? Well, first of all, the portfolio and the differentiation we have, which is good. But also, as you can imagine, we're talking to those customers all the time and they want their functionality back. They like what they've got or they had with Change and they want to get that back. So we're working with them to ensure that we can actually do that. Also, we provided financial support to a number of our clients and they appreciate that. They have said to us that they appreciate it. That's a signal that we are committed both to them, but then also to this marketplace as well. So when you add those elements up, Stephen, that's where we're confident. We've got more work to do. This has been a heavy lift and we're going to continue that work. But that's why we're confident in getting back to that baseline performance in 2025. Yeah, Jessica, thanks very much for the question. First of all, on your first part about Change 2.0. Again, we're just confident in terms of our ability to reconnect. I mentioned the level of functional restoration that we have. You can imagine now the next stage of this is working with payer and provider to reconnect them in a safe way and an appropriate way, and all of the conversations that we're having with them are positive as we work through it.

            "name": "Andrew Witty",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We have a lot to cover. First, we'll discuss the status and impact of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, then we'll turn to the performance of our businesses, which continue to grow and perform well. It's important to underscore at the outset that even as we have devoted significant attention to addressing the Change Healthcare attack, the vast majority of the 400,000 people of this enterprise have remained as usual, intensely focused on delivering for all those we serve. That dedication is reflected in our overall performance this quarter. Directly as a result of their hard and -- hard work and the broad performance of our diversified businesses, we're able to reconfirm our full year adjusted earnings outlook, even as we absorb $0.30 to $0.40 per share in business disruption impacts related to Change Healthcare. Now turning to Change Healthcare, this was an unprecedented attack by a malicious actor on the US health system. We promptly disconnected the affected services and turned our focus to two main areas, restoration and support. The attack disrupted the ability of care providers to file claims and be paid for their work, we moved quickly to fill this gap. Fortunately, we were able to bring to bear the substantial resources of UnitedHealth Group to drive the recovery and begin to mitigate the impact. Resources, which are standalone to Change Healthcare, would not have had access to on its own. These are the resources and the philosophy that underpinned our remediation of healthcare.gov back in 2013, and our distribution of CMS COVID emergency relief funds to care providers in 2020. Here, we assisted care providers in financial need, providing over $6 billion in funding, all at no cost to them. We rapidly deployed resources to develop alternative solutions and move promptly to restore claims and payment services. We've made substantial progress and we will not rest until care providers' connectivity needs are met. And to help care providers mitigate workflow disruptions and help ensure the uninterrupted delivery of care, for a period of time, we suspended some care management activities. I'm immensely grateful for our colleagues who continue to work tirelessly day and night to restore services, free up funds for providers, and protect the broader health system. Let me touch on two more items we know are of interest to you. First is care activity. The central point is that overall care patterns are consistent with what we anticipated last year heading into 2024 and within the outlook we shared with you in November. The second item is the essential value of Medicare Advantage to seniors. Here are what we see, some of the core facts regarding Medicare Advantage. It drives better health outcomes, provides a higher-value, significantly more comprehensive benefit for people, all at a lower cost to beneficiaries and taxpayers, and is more popular with and valuable to seniors than traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage consumers spend on average 45% less on premiums and out-of-pocket costs than those in traditional Medicare. That translates into nearly $2,400 in savings annually and several times more for the country's most underserved and medically challenged populations. That's one of the many reasons why more than half of seniors choose Medicare Advantage today versus 30% 10 years ago and why we believe these offerings will continue to grow strongly for years to come. 2025 is the second year of the significant three-year phase funding reductions to Medicare Advantage introduced by CMS last year. Here, in early 2024, we're at the beginning of our thoughtful responsible three-year plan we developed last year to adapt to those changes. Our strategy continues to focus on providing as much stability as possible in the reduced funding environment. Improving outcomes and experiences for the consumers we're privileged to serve, and delivering the performance you expect from us. We believe our long-term perspective and the deliberate multi-year approach we began last year is serving us well, putting us into a position of sustainable competitive strength. Among a handful of notable business developments to share, UnitedHealthcare was honored to secure major Medicaid wins in Virginia, Texas and Michigan. While we're disappointed in the outcome in Florida, we'll be seeking to better understand the process and considerations there. There is a substantial pipeline of Medicaid RFPs and we're confident that our offerings will resonate in other states as well. UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits continued their momentum from last year, growing to serve two million more people in the first quarter, the largest increase in years. This growth was across UHC's commercial customer segments from individuals up through the largest of employers. This is further evidence of our innovative and consumer-centric products have established the footing for sustained growth. We also see continued momentum at Optum Rx, coming off last year's record-selling season with a recent win in Hawaii and the renewal of our contract with the Department of Veteran Affairs. We're grateful for the opportunity to support them. And Optum Health is tracking well to achieve its objective of growing to serve another 750,000 patients in value-based arrangements this year in partnership with many payers. Before I turn it over to John Rex, our President and Chief Financial Officer, I want to acknowledge Dirk McMahon, recently retired after more than 20 years of service, I'd like to thank him for his leadership and partnership. Dirk has left an indelible mark on this company through the example he set and the many of our leaders he has mentored. John? Thank you, John. As we look out over the next several years, we, like many others, see a healthcare environment in need of improvements in quality, value, simplification, and consumer responsiveness. While we're a comparatively small part of the $5 trillion US Health System, UnitedHealth Group's strategy is focused on helping to meet those very needs and we're well-positioned to do so. Our focus on understanding opportunities to align incentives, notably led via our value-based care offerings, demonstrates what can be achieved through partnership and realignment of ways of working. Our commitment to improving all we do for consumers stimulates our drive to help bring care to patients, where they need and want it, at prices and with an experience worthy of the 2020s. We have a proven commitment to making available our insights and innovations widely and quickly throughout the market alongside our relentless multi-payer orientation at Optum. We remain committed to partnering with others throughout healthcare to help make the health system more modern and responsive. Our success depends on enabling partners and customers outside our company to succeed. The combination of this strategic design, strengths, and behaviors underpins our high confidence in our ability to navigate the inevitable environmental change and challenge, and it reinforces our confidence in our ability to perform and grow strongly as you have come to expect from us. With that, operator, we'll turn to questions. Yeah, Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Yeah, as we've said a few times and certainly repeated this morning, we've looked at the changes that CMS finalized last year really thoughtfully and we see this as a three-year strategy in response. Obviously, it's phased in over three years. We want to make sure we don't do anything that chases short-term growth, for example, but puts a lot -- puts at risk long-term sustainability. What you're also not going to see from ours is a kind of knee-jerk reaction between growth and margin. We want to be very focused on ensuring that year in, year out, we're a super reliable performer in this environment. As you look at the most recent final rate, I don't think it really changes the story. Obviously, a little disappointing that we don't think CMS really reflected what we've seen over the last year in terms of actual in-market medical trend. But in reality, it's just a little extra pressure for '25 on top of what we'd already seen previously. We're well-positioned for that in terms of all the work we've been doing really from the get go last year. Really from February last year, we've been getting ourselves lined up for this. You're seeing that reflected in Q1 in a few really key features, right? So you're seeing really strong cost control inside the company as you'd absolutely expect us to do, making sure that we're not incurring any expense that we don't need to support our members and patients on the outside of the organization. You saw us take a very thoughtful bid strategy last year, and of course, we continue to focus on how to make sure that we manage medical cost as effectively as possible, ensuring quality of care delivered and avoiding waste. All of that plays through. I'm very, very pleased with how this first quarter has played out in that respect. If you look at the performance of Optum Health and our MA business within UnitedHealthcare, both very strong performance during this quarter despite the pressure that's been incurred on them from the rate notice last year and I think that bodes super well for the rest of this year and the strategy that we've laid out for the next three. Thanks, Lisa. Next question. Josh, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Brian Thompson in a second just to give you a little bit more color on the first part of your question. Listen, I think by the time we got to the end of the quarter, we had the overwhelming majority of what we'd anticipate in receipt -- in terms of claims received into the organization because it's always a little bit tricky to be absolute about that, because you're kind of comparing against what you would have expected, and as you obviously know, every quarter you see corrections both up and down in terms of actual claim submissions catching up with what you may have estimated and that's been obviously the feature of this marketplace. But overall, I would say, UHC claims receipt was very, very close to normal by the time we closed the quarter. But maybe, Brian, you could give a little more color commentary on how you would characterize some of that relief we gave. Brian, thanks so much. And just again to confirm, as you heard from John, we brought those processes back into play in the last few days. Next question. So I'm going to ask John just to comment on the $800 million more specifically. I mean, I think as we said a couple of times, A.J., really not seeing anything stand out in terms of care pattern differentiation from what we really expected. I mean, as we mentioned earlier, that kind of pressure we saw at the end of Q4 and rolling into the very beginning of the year around some kind of winter syndrome vaccination dynamics, we talked about a lot last time. As expected that did subside. Beyond that, I would -- which was what we were anticipating. Beyond that, I wouldn't say there's anything really to call out within all of that. John, could you maybe go a little deeper on the $800 million? Thanks, John. Thank you, A.J. Next question. Okay, Justin. Thanks for those questions. Let me -- I'm going to ask John in a second just to go back and again just give you a little bit more definition around the $800 million as you asked. Just in terms of -- and just in terms of cost trend and let me make a couple of comments and ask Brian maybe to go a little deeper as well and then come back to John. As I look at the cost trend this year versus last year, some big differences. So last year, really I think the core of the story of what led to that sort of step shift, if I can put it that way, in early Q2 -- Q2 of last year. I think that was really -- and the hindsight tells us that was really around a kind of post-COVID or end of COVID story playing out in terms of capacity coming on stream most importantly and to some degree of pent-up demand. I actually think the capacity coming on stream was as much an issue driver of that as anything else. So I think to some degree a one-off. We don't see anything like that. We've seen much more stabilization. We haven't seen a step down from that trend. We'd be super clear about that. We haven't seen it kind of go back down again, but we've certainly seen that kind of sustained activity without aggressive acceleration. And then the other thing, I would say to you is, as you would expect, given that shift we saw last year in the intervening year, we've put in a lot of sensing mechanisms across our organization, both in UAC and Optum, to look for early warning signals of changes, quite a low granularity in terms of trying to figure out how this pattern plays out. Now as all our actuaries and any actual will tell you that the gold standard of knowledge on trend is a paid claim, but nonetheless, we've tried to put in place a lot more prospective sensing capability. And again, that's kind of consistent with what we're sharing with you. So we're not really anticipating a big change there. I mean, obviously, the future is the future, but as we sit today, everything looks pretty much as expected. Brian, you may want to give a bit more from a UHC perspective. Great. Thanks, Brian. And John? Great. John, thanks so much. Next question. Yeah, Stephen, thanks so much. So I'm going to ask Roger Connor, who runs Optum Insight to give you a little detail on this. First off, so I just want to -- I just want to take a moment to pay credit to the teams for the speed in which they brought back the overwhelming majority, the functionality of Optum -- of Change Healthcare after the attack. It's been extraordinary example of really the resources of UHG, and frankly, the support of many of the biggest companies across America in the tech environment coming in to help recover from this particular attack, which was straight out an attack on the US Health System, and designed to create maximum damage I think. We've got through that very well in terms of the remediation and the build back to functionality, and Roger, maybe you could share a little bit of what you're seeing and expect in terms of customer dynamics over the next few months. Roger, thanks so much. And I think, Stephen, what you heard in Roger's response there is a couple of really important features of the character of UnitedHealth Group, super high resilience and we will always stand by our customers and clients, and when an attack like this happens, which puts our customers and clients at risk, we will do whatever it takes to make sure they get through that, whether it's technical fixes or financial support, we are going to stand by our clients, who in this case are the providers and the systems across America who look after American patients and we will do that. And I think that means a lot to a lot of people and it's an important capability to have running through the backbone of American healthcare. With that, Stephen, thanks for the question. Next question. All right. So I'm going to ask John to comment on your substantive question, Kevin, and I'm going to ask you just to stay on the line for my last paragraph for closing comments for the second part of your question. John? Yeah. Thanks so much, John, and thanks so much, Kevin. Next question. Hey, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. Listen, I think you'd probably expect we don't comment on these sorts of matters and I don't think it would be appropriate to do so today, and certainly, we never have done in the past. So it's not something we're going to get into in the call, but I appreciate the interest. Thanks. Next question. Thanks so much for the question. I'll ask Dan Kueter, who runs our E&I business from UHC to respond to that. Dan? Great. Thanks so much. And as you saw, Dan's organization delivered an extraordinary two million member growth in the first quarter, one of the highest growth rates we've seen for many, many years. And I think that really comes down to relentless focus on modernization of service offer and then delivery of that service offer, and I'm very proud of the whole team in the UHC Commercial businesses domestically for what they've done. Next question. Yeah, Lance, thanks so much. And I'm glad you've asked about Optum Health. I'm going to ask Dr. Desai to respond to that. Amar runs our Optum Health business. He has been doing a great job of continuing to mature that business for us, which for me, I think is one of the great headlines of Optum Health. Its continuous maturation as a sophisticated value-based care delivery organization, and Amar, maybe you could respond to Lance's question. Great. Amar, thanks so much. Next question. Sarah James, thanks so much. John? Right. Thanks, John. Next question. Thanks so much, Gary. John? Okay. Thanks, John. Next question. Erin, thanks so much. I'll ask John to comment on it. Yeah, and I continue to see very interesting diverse pipeline of M&A opportunity across the marketplace in terms of business areas that we have interest in. As I think you see some of the funding changes play out across the -- across the next few years, I suspect that may also create new opportunities for us as different companies assess their positions. I think how we look at this situation is we have a good strong strategy for how we navigate through this dynamic. You're seeing that play out super well in the first quarter performance of Optum Health and UHC and I think it gives us a sense of real confidence as we look not just in terms of our performance, but potentially how we might think about M&A opportunity. And as you rightly said, be somewhat opportunistic if those moments arrive. Next question. Thanks so much for the question. I mean, obviously, we're not going to get into give kind of '25 numbers or expectation just yet, but Tim Noel, who runs our M&R business, certainly give you some good perspective on the rest of your question. Tim? John, would you like to start that? Thanks, John. And maybe ask Brian maybe to give you a little bit more from a UHC perspective, and then maybe Heather also from a Optum perspective in a second, just maybe reflect a little bit on the work you're doing in terms of how we -- obviously, medical trend is one thing, then there's a question of how well we're able to engage with folks to actually help them manage their cost and maybe come to you in a second, Heather, on some of the word that you're leading at Optum. So Brian, first? Great. Thanks so much, Heather. Just one number Heather just shared with you there, which I'm very pleased of and it's a significant improvement year-over-year is that 75% engagement of the most complex members in Optum Health. And just for that, that means three out of every four most complex, most disadvantaged folks in the country have had a direct engagement with us in the first three months of the year. That's a great rate of touch. Opens the door then for us really getting to know those folks, helping the system, helping bring the system to support that many of these people, particularly those who are trapped in their homes have just not had access to that kind of care opportunity. That engagement is the first step of doing that. We have -- we really believe that is a key to how we not only deliver an effective care delivery from a cost point of view, but also make sure they get the very best quality that they deserve. So really pleased to see that step up year-over-year. I think we have time for one last question. If we could take that question, please, Jennifer. Sorry, we missed the beginning of your question. Thanks very much for the question. Let me ask Roger to kick that one off. Roger, thanks so much. And yeah, absolutely, Change Healthcare, the important acquisition for the group and I think important for the country that we own Change Healthcare. Without UnitedHealth Group owning Change Healthcare, this attack would likely still have happened and it would have -- it would have left Change Healthcare, I think, extremely challenged to come back because it was a part of UnitedHealth Group, we've been able to bring it back. We're going to bring it back much stronger than it was before. And secondarily, all of the reasons that we were interested in bringing the Change Healthcare capabilities and customer connectivity closer to UnitedHealth Group still absolutely holds fast in terms of the potential innovation around things like real-time settlement, clinical decision support capabilities, all of those products are the future services of the future, which ought to be characteristics of a modern healthcare environment. Those are all the reasons why we believe Change and Health -- and UHG were better together. This cyberattack has unfortunately created another true validation of why that was the right thing to do because it meant UHG was in position to resolve this much more quickly than I think would ever have been imaginable in a standalone situation. Thanks, everybody, for all of your questions this morning. It's been a bit more of a complex quarter for sure this time around, but one that's also showed the depth and breadth of our company's capabilities. We're recovering quickly from the Change Healthcare attack and are a stronger, more capable company as a result. We're continuing to build our business based on the five strategic growth pillars that we're relentlessly focused on, and we're steadfastly confident in our ability to achieve our 13% to 16% long-term growth objective as we look to the years ahead. We very much appreciate all of your time and attention this morning. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. This morning I'll first provide color on some of the unique items in the quarter directly related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, followed by care activity trends, business updates, and finally thoughts on the remainder of '24. But first, let me start at the most fundamental level. The UnitedHealth Group businesses continued to grow and perform well during the quarter, and we are encouraged by the momentum and the many opportunities to serve we're seeing across the enterprise. On the Change Healthcare cyberattack, as Andrew noted, our guiding focus throughout has been to make sure patient care is delivered and care providers' access to funding is secured as we work to bring back services fully. The cyber impacts in the quarter totaled about $870 million or $0.74 per share. At this distance, we estimate the full year impact will be $1.15 per share to $1.35 per share. Let me break that down into its key components. Of the $870 million, about $595 million were direct costs due to the clearinghouse platform restoration and other response efforts, including medical expenses directly relating to the temporary suspension of some care management activities. For the full year, we estimate these direct costs at $1 billion to $1.15 billion or $0.85 per share to $0.95 per share. It's important to note these direct costs are included in net earnings, but are excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The other component affecting our results relates to the disruption of ongoing Change Healthcare business. This is driven by the loss of revenues associated with the affected services, all while incurring the support and costs to keep these capabilities fully ready to return to service. Notably, these effects are not excluded from adjusted earnings. In the first quarter, this impact was about $280 million or $0.25 per share. At this distance, we currently estimate the business disruption at $350 million to $450 million or $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share for the year. This, of course, will depend on the ultimate timing of service and transaction volume restoration. These elements are broken out for you in the supplemental tables provided with our press release this morning. Of course, we will provide regular updates on our progress and outlook throughout the course of the year. While much of Change Healthcare's functionality and services have been restored, we are working hard to restore more and the objective we all share is for an even stronger Change Healthcare to be fully returned to expected performance levels next year. I'll come back to some of these elements in more detail in just a moment. Turning to underlying care patterns. The headline is that these continue within our expectations. Outpatient care activity among seniors remains consistent with the elevated levels we began seeing in the first half of '23 and for which we planned. So we continue to be comfortable with the outlook we established last June when we filed our 2024 Medicare Advantage benefit offerings. The winter seasonal activity we discussed with you in January, particularly related to strong vaccine uptake, higher respiratory illness incidents, and related physician office visits has subsided. Overall inpatient care activity also remains within our expectations. The first quarter medical care ratio at 84.3% included roughly 40 basis points or about $340 million related to the temporary suspension of some care management activities. These have been recently reinstated. The majority of the remaining $325 million of full year medical expense impact included in our outlook will land in the second quarter. Notably, we did not reflect any favorable earnings impacting medical reserve development in the quarter. Out of prudence, due to the potential for the cyberattack to affect claims receipt timing, we reflected an additional $800 million of claims reserves. We'll continue with a judicious view as we progress over the next several quarters. Turning to the performance of our businesses. The most important takeaway is they are growing and performing at a level, which allows us to maintain the adjusted earnings per share objectives we established last November, even while taking on the business disruption impacts of the Change Healthcare attack. At UnitedHealthcare, revenues of $75.4 billion grew nearly $5 billion. Within our domestic commercial membership, we're off to a strong start, powered by disciplined growth, serving 2.1 million new consumers in the first quarter. We are encouraged by the momentum and positive customer response to our differentiated offerings and look forward to building further upon that momentum heading into '25. For Medicare Advantage, as you would anticipate, we are deeply into our '25 planning activities. As we finalize our '25 benefit designs over the next several weeks, we will build competitive offerings that once again appropriately reflect the funding and cost environment. We approached this last year with a deliberate three-year plan, which continues firmly on track and positions us well going into '25. Our Medicaid business ended the first quarter with 7.7 million members. As Andrew noted, key wins in Texas, Virginia, and Michigan demonstrate the value state customers see in our offerings. In Virginia, UHC was the highest-scoring plan with particular strength in member-centric care, benefits and service delivery, quality, and value-based payments. In Texas, UHC was awarded the maximum number of possible service areas, expanding the number of people we will have the opportunity to serve. And in Michigan, UHC achieved perfect scores in such critical consumer-centric areas as social determinants of health and health equity, further solidifying our value proposition. Optum Health's revenues grew by 16% to $26.7 billion, as we increased the number of patients served and are on track to approach five million patients in value-based care by year end. For the most complex patients that Optum Health serves, we have engaged 75% through the first quarter this year, a significant increase in the number of patients engaged over last year. This reflects progressively earlier connectivity with patients and the ability to improve their health outcomes and experiences more rapidly. Optum Rx revenues grew 12% to $30.8 billion, driven by new client starts, continued expansion within existing partnerships, and growth within pharmacy services. Optum Insight, as you know, is where the Change Healthcare business resides. In the quarter, about $500 million of the $870 million total impact is within Optum Insight. Just under half of this are direct response costs, think clearinghouse restoration activities, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings, and slightly over half are the business disruption effects, which are not excluded from adjusted earnings. For many of the impact of Change Healthcare services, transaction volume drives revenues. So the effect of the attack in the period is one of keeping all the lights brightly burning at full readiness to resume services, while revenue production was essentially suspended. To be clear, the Optum Insight team did the critical and right thing, promptly shutting off services and finding any method possible to keep the care system working, including helping clients find alternative solutions. Coming out of this incident, the team will be working tirelessly with customers to recover transaction volumes and demonstrate that Change Healthcare is ready to serve and is more valuable than ever. Beyond Change Healthcare, the Optum Insight revenue backlog increased to nearly $33 billion, growth of over $2 billion from a year ago, driven by health system partnerships to provide business process and information technology services. A couple of other items of note that were affected by the cyberattack. Days claims payable in the first quarter were 47.1 compared to the 47.9 in the fourth quarter '23, and 47.8 a year ago. The accelerated payments to care providers and the Brazil sale reduced what would have been our reported measure for the quarter by about three days. The medical cost payable balance increased $1.6 billion from year-end '23 to $34 billion. The change reflects a $3 billion increase in the incurred but not yet reported component or IBNR. This is a result of the prudent ongoing claims receipt assessment, offset by a $1.6 billion reduction in the fully processed claims component, due to care provider payments acceleration. Cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.1 billion, impacted by about $3 billion due to the funding acceleration to care providers and collection extensions to affected customers, and were additionally impacted by the timing of some public sector receipts. To summarize, a continued focus on better serving patients and the health system underpins our mission and growth drivers, which remain strong. And as we move further into this year, the broadly strong performance across our enterprise allows us to continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $27.50 to $28.00, even as we incorporate a $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share of business disruption impacts. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew. Yeah, good morning, A.J. Yeah, so picking up on comment Andrew had made earlier, so what you're really doing there is estimating what you didn't see. So claims receipts that you may have not received in the quarter and trying to make an accommodation for that, as you said, a prudent accommodation for that. Just to acknowledge, that there clearly had to be some disruption in the quarter in claims patterns and so you're trying to make some estimation in that zone to anticipate that. So you need to put it somewhere in the zone, it's not zero and it's not 800, somewhere in between, probably as you think about those elements and where you might -- where you might land and so as we look out. And you should expect that we'll probably continue with a judicious view over this, over the next several quarters actually also. We want to make sure that we've got full visibility into this that the claims are flowing and as we sit here on April 16th, it does. We see at UHC. We see a fairly normal claims receipts and payments flows going on at this point, but we really want to be careful on that because we know there are certain care providers out there that may have been left out a bit, and so we'll continue to be very judicious next quarter also in terms of assessing that. Yeah, Justin, good morning. So I think the way you look at it, so overall the net view being, so we didn't let any earnings or medical care ratio impacting development flow-through into the quarter. And when you look at it, so you can come at it, as to the normative course of assessments would have indicated some potential for favorable development in the quarter. We would -- we took a position also that there was likelihood that there were claims we didn't receive. And so in terms of the claims completion factors and such and so how that may have impacted and so you're really netting that all off in the course of the quarter to try to just normalize that out, not having any impact from any of those -- from those elements, and taking a pretty prudent view of where you might be in terms of the claims you received. In terms of your question here on the Q2 MCR, at this distance, I put it in a similar zip code to 1Q, including similar impact from the cyber effects that we had also, and as I noted in response to A.J.'s question, we'll be continued to be very judicious as we look at those patterns also on claims receipts. So we'll continue with the judicious view of how we think about -- how we think about development and those impacts as we step out here in the next couple of quarters to make sure we're getting our claims receipt timings fully incurred here. Good morning, Kevin. So as we sit here today on April 16th, I would say, UHC is pretty much back to normal levels in terms of claim submission activity. We view it as normalized now. That we're seeing claims slowing like they -- we'd expect them to be flowing and moving along. So that's all progressing quite well, which assists a lot with the piece that you were just describing here in terms of where we think that is and as we move forward and look over the next month plus to finalize our bid submissions and such. So feel good about that in terms of our visibility and insights. Yeah. So I don't know if I'd kind of go right with some of those stats that you pulled out in terms of where those fell, but here's some insights I can offer on that. So, one of the elements we wanted to break out on the IBNR component is, so, as you know, what we report on the balance sheet you received this morning, medical costs payable is a combination of IBNR and medical claims payable. And so we're hoping to provide some more transparency for you as you looked at the quarter and such, and a $3 billion increase in IBNR is significant. And then offsetting that on the -- on that line item would have been the -- really the funding advances. The component where we just made sure that as soon as the claim was in-house processed, we were speeding it out-the-door to get it to providers. That was one of the components in addition to the interest-free loans we made that we were helping the provider community -- the provider community with. As you talked -- as you discussed kind of where we were, let's say, today, we feel that UnitedHealthcare is essentially at normalized levels in terms of -- in terms of claims receipts. As we sit here, we're going to be super prudent in how we look at that because we know there are providers out there that could still be having trouble submitting claims, and still having troubles with payment flows and such, and so we're going to be very appropriately constrained in how we think about that dynamic playing out here over the next -- over the next couple of quarters. But really, those are the kind of mechanics of what's going on between the IBNR component that you spotlighted and the full line of medical costs payable. $3 billion is IBNR directly, that is to your point. That is the IBNR component of it, Gary. Yeah, Erin. Yeah, we didn't update any of those components here. We continue to take a very balanced view in terms of how we think about our opportunities. You saw, certainly, that we had activity in the quarter from -- in terms of both share repurchase and dividends. Also, we continue with robust opportunities in the marketplace in terms of other capabilities that we are looking at. So that all continues strong. So you'll see us continue to balance those out nicely in terms of -- in terms of the opportunities that are out there and with capacities really to approach all those elements strongly. Yeah. Ann, good morning. So the components that I would call outliers are the similar components that we've talked about for a while here in terms of trend outlooks. So in particular, still go back to outpatient care for senior, what we've seen in orthopedic, cardiac, those kind of categories primarily have been the big factors. I think you brought up a really important point though. So the percentage growth in those was much bigger last year. You're coming off an environment where both the supply side had been constrained and the willingness of seniors, in particular, consumers to access that environment had been constrained for a couple of years. So those percentage factors were quite significant. You heard us talk about very significant levels on those double-digit levels of last year as we looked at those. The way we look at those really though is because you would expect that to start normalizing in terms of the percentage change. So you really look at that in terms of the number of units consumed per patient served. And so you look at those levels, that's what we're talking about and we're seeing those kind of continuing at those levels. They're continuing at those levels in terms of the number of units consumed, delivered, and -- but those percentage levels, of course, would start normalizing out a little bit in terms of what you'd seen. So that continues to be the area. It's outpatient care for seniors. It's those categories that we'd call real outlier areas versus our historical levels of trend factors. The other -- the other historical levels of trend factors remain much closer to kind of our traditional views that we've always had as a company. In the quarter, other things you look at just to get indications, and by the way, we kind of vastly expanded all those areas. First fills, you've heard us talk about that a lot. Also, first fills in the quarter, an indication of outpatient care, physician visit activity, it's kind of normalized in there also in terms of stabilizing for us and many -- the many other factors of the company historically looked at. Thank you."

            "content": "Yeah. Hi, Andrew, and thanks for the question. Certainly encouraged with the broad based growth, share gaining growth, I would say, in our Individual segment, our Local Market segment, and our National Accounts business. Some of the key drivers underlying that, about a third of our Group growth gains were attached to our most innovative products and the expansion of those into 37 states now, on a fully-insured basis, to be -- and also fully available nationally on an ASO fee-based business. Specifically inside the risk business, our individual and family exchange-based plans were a significant driver of the growth. We've seen some latency. From membership, we expected that would have come in from re-determinations into the final portions of 2023, now begin to emerge into 2024. That's been a significant contributor to that risk-based growth in the first quarter. As a punchline, I like our growth, I like the pricing, very much like the profile of both the groups and the consumers that we're attracting. And finally, I'm really pleased with the consumer experience that our teams are delivering to those that we serve. Thanks for the question."

            "content": "Yeah, good morning, Whit. Thanks for the question. So on the final notice and some of the distribution elements of that, we continue to believe that there's opportunities to improve the distribution environment in Medicare Advantage and have been in a dialog with CMS for several years on how to do that. Some of the elements of the final notice that were published recently are directly in line with some of our recommendations and some of them are relatively consistent, but not totally as we had conceived them. I would also say right now, it's a little bit early to comment on how this might rebalance some of the channel mix, as still some questions on how some of the key elements of that will be rolled out. So we're still waiting for a little bit more detail before we can get more specific on how it impacts go-to-market in '25."
