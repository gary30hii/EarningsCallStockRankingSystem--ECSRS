I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over now to Durga Doraisamy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Doraisamy, you may now begin the conference.\nDurga Doraisamy : Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. Today\u2019s discussion will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; and Pat Grismer, CFO. And for Q&A, we will be joined by Roz Brewer, Chief Operating Officer and Group President, Americas; John Culver, Group President, International, Channel Development and Global Coffee, Tea & Cocoa. This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. In addition, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 by comparing actual results to our previous forecast. These forecasts were created prior to the spread of the virus were based on information available at the time and on a variety of assumptions, which we believe were reasonable. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. GAAP results in fiscal 2020 include several items related to strategic actions including restructuring and impairment charges, transaction and integration costs and other items. These items are excluded from our non-GAAP results.

This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website through Friday, November 27, 2020. I will now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?\nKevin Johnson : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. 2020 has been an extraordinary year. As together, everyone on this planet has been navigating a global pandemic and all of the implications that come along with it. This shared experience gives us much to reflect upon, learn from and be inspired by. I\u2019m very proud of how Starbucks partners responded, pulling together to support one another, creating safe that familiar experiences for our customers and serving communities. Starbucks partners who probably wear the green apron have been at the forefront of these efforts and I am enormously grateful for the courage, compassion and dedication that they\u2019ve shown throughout this churn. They inspire me and fuel my positive outlook for the future. There are three words that I hope you take away from today\u2019s call, confidence, resilience and optimism. Let me explain. First, in the most dynamic of times, Starbucks is consistently executing. Our recovery is progressing extremely well as evidenced by better-than-expected sales and profits in the fourth quarter which gives us great confidence going forward. Second, we have accelerated several growth strategies and are innovating rapidly to adapt to new customer behaviors and preferences building a new level of resilience for the future. And third, Starbucks partners have risen to the occasion which coupled with an innovation agenda that elevates the customer experience, introduces exciting new beverages and extends our digital customer relationships, leaves us very well positioned, and gives me a tremendous sense of optimism for fiscal \u201921 and the future of the Starbucks Coffee Company. In these unprecedented times, Starbucks is more focused than ever on making the investments necessary to position our brand and our Company our long-term success. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing behind our best-in-class digital ecosystem and aligning our product portfolio store base and partner-led customer experience with evolving preferences and consumption patterns. Our track record of delivering across these areas underpins the resilience of our business during this pandemic and will support Starbucks continued leadership. Let me begin in the U.S. I could not be more pleased with our U.S. sales recovery which progress faster than we anticipated in our final quarter of fiscal 2020. We finished the quarter with the comparable store sales decline of 4% for the month of September, a vast improvement from the approximately 65% decline we experienced at the depth of the pandemic only five months ago. Fourth quarter comparable store sales declined 9% in the U.S. relative to the same quarter in the prior year well above the better end of our guidance range. Importantly, transaction volumes in the U.S. climbed steadily throughout the quarter as we methodically and carefully restored in-store seating with approximately 63% of our U.S. stores offering limited seating as we exited the quarter. Ticket growth was relatively stable across the quarter at approximately 20% remaining meaningfully above historical levels aided by continued strength in our drive-through channel where customers tend to place larger orders. Central to the strength of our U.S. recovery has been a relentless focus on rapid innovation, adapting and adjusting to new customer behaviors while continuing to drive the three strategies that are fundamental to our Growth at Scale agenda, elevating the customer experience, driving relevant beverage innovation and expanding digital customer engagement. The first pillar of our Growth at Scale strategy, customer experience is a key competitive differentiator for Starbucks and something that is paying dividends as customers now more than ever are seeking the comfort and care that Starbucks uniquely provides. As customers continue to adapt to work from home and study from home realities, they create safe, familiar and convenient experiences, and have shifted their buying behavior accordingly. And we\u2019ve adapted rapidly to meet those evolving needs. Broadly speaking we\u2019ve seen U.S. transactions migrate from dense metro centers to the suburbs, from cafes to drive-throughs, from early mornings to mid mornings with outpaced recovery on the weekends. We\u2019ve adjusted our operations to match these new customer behavior patterns including multiple, new protocols to provide a safe experience for our partners and customers. And this has resulted in customer connection scores, which are well above prior year levels. By caring for our partners since the start of this pandemic, providing them with economic certainty at a time of great vulnerability, we successfully maintained very high levels of partner engagement and this is paying off in the form of high quality customer experiences. Those best moment that inspired Starbucks customers to continue coming back. As evidence of these traffic shifts, U.S. sales comps were solidly positive for our drive-through locations and suburban stores for the fourth quarter and the month of September, respectively. Although this was offset by negative sales comps in our debt metro stores, particularly on week days, those numbers reflect the fact that approximately 3% of our stores were temporarily closed across the entire quarter, effectively weighing down the market comp by about 2 percentage points. To increase throughput and accommodate higher transaction volumes at our suburban locations, we\u2019ve rolled out curbside pickup to approximately 800 U.S. company-operated locations and are on track to be a nearly 2,000 stores across the U.S. by the end of fiscal 2021. We\u2019ve also introduced handheld point of sale devices to about 100 stores with the goal of deploying these devices to approximately 400 additional stores by the end of Q1. And we are continuing to restore in-store seating across all of our stores in the U.S. as conditions allow. Building on the strength of our customer experience, differentiated products continue to be an important traffic driver as well encompassing seasonal favorites as well as new innovations. The re-launch of our Pumpkin Spice platform in late August was a catalyst to our Q4 results. With Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew which was first offered last year actually outselling Pumpkin Spice Latte this season leading the entire Pumpkin platform to a record high in average daily units. Our cold beverages continue to resonate with customers led by Starbucks Refreshers and Cold Brew with both delivered, delivering double-digit growth in Q4 and void by positive year-over-year growth in beverages. These results reflect not only the appeal of our products, but also the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns which reinforce the trust and familiarity of the Starbucks brand at a time when customers are craving our return to normalcy. And finally, as customers are increasingly seeking convenient and contactless experiences, our expanding drive-through presence and industry leading mobile platform, our primary vehicles to increasing convenience and digital customer engagement have been instrumental to the strength of our recovery. As evidence of this, approximately 75% of U.S. sales volume in Q4 was drive-through and mobile orders. Although this was meaningfully down from 90% in Q3, reflecting a sizable shift to on-premise occasions in Q4. As we progressively restored seating in our cafes, this is notably higher than pre-COVID levels at approximately 60% of sales. Moreover, our mobile order transactions continue to grow, increasing from 18% in Q2 to 24% in Q4 aided by continued improvements to our mobile app as well as an increased messaging across our marketing channels to drive further awareness introducing more customers to our mobile app which drove engagement to mobile order and benefited us operationally. Of course, another key driver of increased digital customer engagement is our Starbucks Rewards program. In Q4, Starbucks Rewards drove 47% of U.S. company operated tender for a second consecutive quarter, up from 43% in our fiscal Q1 prior to the onset of COVID-19. Importantly, Starbucks Rewards contribution improved throughout the quarter and returned to pre-COVID levels mainly driven by recovery in member spend and higher mobile order and pay usage, as I outlined previously. Additionally, our 90-day active rewards member base increased by 3 million members in Q4 approaching pre-COVID levels at $19.3 million, up 10% from the prior year. The successful launch of Stars for Everyone in mid-September was a key highlight in the quarter. The momentum we saw and the number of customers who downloaded the Starbucks app in Q3 continued throughout Q4 and the number of active customers who joined the Starbucks Rewards program grew slightly in Q4 relative to Q3, likely helped by the late quarter launch of Stars for everyone. These early results indicate that the flexibility of rewards payment options, including the removal of the stored value card requirement to earn stars is resonating with customers. This gives us optimism regarding our ability to meaningfully grow the number of 90 day active Starbucks Rewards members in fiscal 2021. Before moving on from our U.S. business, I\u2019d like to remind you that as we announced in June, we are in the midst of accelerating the transformation of our dense metro business by closing lower performing stores while continuing to capture that traffic where customers need us to be, including existing drive-through stores, new formats, such as curbside and more efficient Starbucks pickup locations. We expect much of this work to be completed in the next 12 to 18 months. At the same time, we remain focused on our strategy of developing drive-through locations largely in suburban and semi-rural locations, extending the reach of the Starbucks brand with high volume, high margin stores providing our customers the convenience they are seeking. We continue to grow our delivery business through our partnership with Uber Eats providing customers the ultimate form of convenience. I cannot be more excited about the upward trajectory and level of innovation, we\u2019re seeing in our U.S. business. I\u2019ll now move on to China, our second lead growth market. Building on the positive momentum in Q3, China demonstrated sequential improvements in monthly comparable store sales across Q4 delivering minus 3% for the quarter. This was in line with our expectations led by initiatives very similar to what I described in the U.S., outstanding customer experience, new product innovation, notably, our new tea cloud platform and continued expansion of our digital platform, but what\u2019s most remarkable about the recovery in China, in my view is the rapid reacceleration of new store development which is our number one driver of growth in China. I\u2019m pleased to say that despite the challenging environment imposed by the pandemic, we crossed both the 4,600 and the 4,700 store milestone in Q4, opening almost 260 stores in the fourth quarter alone. That\u2019s an impressive 581 stores or 14% growth in the last 12 months. This is an incredible achievement by the team considering, we temporarily paused new store development activity in China for a couple of months starting in late January. Our disciplined approach to store development is paying off as these new stores are off to a strong start with early returns substantially in line with pre-COVID levels. As part of our store development program in China, the local team has innovated a new retail format that caters to the need state of convenience. Starbucks Now which is very similar to Starbucks Pickups in the U.S. With speed and agility Starbucks China opened 40 New stores in fiscal 2020 with the presence in nine Chinese cities. Early results are very encouraging. And the team is increasing the pace of development for this innovative concept. On the digital front, we saw continued strength in our mobile platform in China with mobile order sales mix more than doubling in the past 12 months to 26% in Q4, with 13% coming from delivery and 13% from Mobile Order & Pay well above the mid-teen levels we saw pre-COVID. The digital innovations we launched in China throughout fiscal 2020, including a new WeChat Mini program and the enhanced Starbucks Rewards program along with our digital partnership with Alibaba has fueled customer engagement and strong sequential growth in active Starbucks Rewards members. In Q4, China\u2019s 90-day active members increased 36% over Q3 to 13.5 million representing 34% growth over the prior year. As of the U.S. business, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the continued recovery and industry leading innovation in China. The customer trends we are seeing in specialty retail extend to Coffee at Home, where demand remains elevated through the pandemic. We are applying our innovation mindset and agility to our Channel Development business to capture share in at-home coffee and to maximize reach of the Starbucks brand across all channels and platforms. In the U.S., Starbucks share of total package coffee grew significantly in Q4 with 17% growth in dollar sales outpacing the coffee category, which grew 9% in the quarter. Consumption of our domestic, ready to drink coffee products grew 15% in Q4, somewhat offsetting this strength was softness in the foodservice business as offices, hotels, colleges and entertainment centers continue to experience low levels of traffic. Through the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle, we accelerated growth and innovation, while maintaining our commitment to sustainability in Q4, including the introduction of non-dairy Starbucks Creamers with 100% recyclable packaging to our full portfolio of at-home products. We entered nine new markets in the quarter, bringing Starbucks at-home coffee presence through the Global Coffee Alliance to 62 markets in just 24 months. We also continue to meet customers where they are through our global ready to drink portfolio. Notably, the continued performance of ready-to-drink Nitro Cold Brew, the number 1 innovation in the category this year. Exceeding expectations. Overall, we are very pleased with the accelerated expansion of the Starbucks brand around the world through the channel business. This is truly a brand amplifier. In summary, the Starbucks brand is stronger than ever. Our business recovery is progressing well, and through rapid innovation, we\u2019ve built a new level of resilience for the future. We believe that the investments we made to protect our partners well-being and provide them with economic certainty combined with our principled approach to decision-making and transparency of our communications have built trust with all stakeholders and will pay dividends long into the future. I open my remarks by suggesting three words for you to take away from this call, confidence in our strategy, resilience built from our innovation agility that continues to drive our business recovery and optimism about fiscal \u201921 and the future of Starbucks. I close by adding one additional word for all Starbucks stakeholders to take away from today, gratitude. None of this would have been possible without the positive spirit and incredibly hard work of our 400,000 green apron partners around the world who serve our customers each day. They live our Company mission and values every day. Partners are the heartbeat of Starbucks and they fill me with gratitude and inspiration. Thank you, partners. Let me now hand the call over to Pat to discuss our financial performance for Q4 and fiscal 2020 as well as our guidance for fiscal year \u201921. Pat?\nPat Grismer: Thank you, Kevin and good afternoon, everyone. As Kevin shared, we are delighted with the performance of all our operating segments, driving a strong finish to our fiscal 2020. For the quarter, Starbucks reported global revenue of $6.2 billion, down 8% from the prior year. We estimate the COVID-19 impact on Q4 consolidated revenue to be approximately $1.2 billion driven by modified operations and reduced customer traffic. Q4 EPS was considerably higher than the guidance range we provided on our last earnings call, driven by faster-than-expected sales and margin recovery as well as a lower tax rate from the impact of certain discrete items. Q4 GAAP EPS declined from $0.67 in the prior year to $0.33 inclusive of higher-than-expected restructuring and impairment costs related to the acceleration of our strategy to reposition and restructure our Company-operated store portfolio in the Americas. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.51, down from $0.70 in the prior year. The estimated negative impact of COVID-19 on Q4 EPS was $0.35. I will now provide some segment highlights and discuss consolidated margin performance for Q4, and will then provide guidance for fiscal 2021, including the expected impact of the 53rd week. Starting with the Americas. At $4.2 billion, Americas\u2019 Q4 revenue was 9% lower than the prior year, primarily due to a 9% decline in comparable store sales as well as lower product sales and royalty revenues from our licensees as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. We estimate that Q4 decline in Americas revenue and operating income attributable to COVID-19 to be approximately $830 million and $400 million respectively. This equates to a flow-through rate on lost sales of about 48% in Q4, essentially, returning to the segment\u2019s typical 50% variable flow-through rate. This is a significant sequential improvement from Q3 reflecting a decrease in catastrophe wages and enhanced pay programs as well as an increase in labor efficiency. Relative to the prior year, Americas Q4 non-GAAP operating margin contracted 350 basis points to 16.7% primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 including sales deleverage and additional costs incurred, as well as growth in retail partner wages and benefits, partially offset by improved labor efficiency. Importantly, Americas\u2019 sales and profitability trended positively across the quarter with sequential improvements each month. The U.S. posted a comparable sales decline of 4% in September, improving from minus 11% in August and the business achieved positive profitability and every month of the quarter. Moving on to International. Including a 2% VAT benefit, the segment\u2019s comparable store sales of minus 10% in Q4, reflects faster-than-expected sales recovery in Japan, boosted by successful seasonal product promotions and strong drive-through performance. I would now like to highlight the fourth quarter performance of our lead international growth market, China. For the month of September, China\u2019s comparable store sales were up 1%, including a 4 percentage point VAT exemption benefit, reflecting a slight sequential improvement to August\u2019s comp on a like-for-like basis. For the fourth quarter, China\u2019s comparable store sales declined 3% including VAT favorability of 4 percentage points. International\u2019s Q4 revenue of $1.5 billion was a 5% reduction versus the prior year, primarily due to the 10% decline in comparable store sales. Also contributing to the decline were lower product sales to and royalties from our licensees due to COVID-19. We estimate that the COVID-19 impact on the decline in International\u2019s Q4 revenue and operating income was approximately $300 million and $150 million respectively. International\u2019s flow-through rate on lost sales improved from roughly 55% in Q3 to approximately 50% in Q4, primarily due to higher labor efficiency and lower waste, partially offset by a reduction in certain temporary benefits including government relief programs. International\u2019s Q4 Non-GAAP operating margin declined by 540 basis points from the prior year to 16.3%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, largely stemming from sales deleverage and non-restructuring store asset impairments, as well as strategic investments, mainly technology and digital initiatives. On to Channel Development. Revenue was $464 million in Q4, a 9% decline from the prior year, primarily due to Global Coffee Alliance transition-related items including a structural change in our single-serve business. Excluding these transition-related items, Channel Development\u2019s revenue declined by approximately 1% from the prior year, reflecting the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the segment\u2019s foodservice business, partially offset by growth in at-home coffee and ready-to-drink. Channel Development\u2019s Q4 operating margin expanded by 510 basis points to 42.7% mainly due to a business mix shift, driven by the strength in our ready-to-drink products as well as the structural change in our single-serve business. At the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was 13.2% in Q4, down from 17.2% in the prior year, unsurprisingly, much of the year-over-year reduction in our operating margins for Q4 was due to sales deleverage attributable to COVID-19 as well as growth in wages and benefits and non-restructuring store asset impairments and strategic investments, partially offset by labor efficiencies and supply chain savings. We estimate, the COVID-19 impact to Q4 non-GAAP operating income to be roughly $550 million. In relation to the $1.2 billion of COVID \u201919 impact on Q4 Consolidated revenue that I mentioned earlier, this equates to a flow-through rate of approximately 46% on lost revenue, which is close to the 50% variable flow-through rate that we typically observe in our business. I will now provide guidance for fiscal 2021. Starting with the key driver of our growth, comparable sales growth for our Company-operated stores, barring any new significant and sustained waves of COVID-19 infections and or global economic disruptions, we expect global comparable store sales growth of 18% to 23% in fiscal 2021 fueled by sustained improvement in comparable store transactions across both of our key markets, the U.S. and China. These estimates are based on the experience we\u2019ve gained from navigating the impact of COVID-19 for the past nine months, including the more resilient operating protocols that we\u2019ve built into our business as well as the traffic driving initiatives and innovation that we plan for the year ahead. For the Americas and the U.S., we expect comparable store sales to grow between 17% to 22% in fiscal 2021 and we continue to expect to achieve full comparable store sales recovery in the U.S. by the end of our fiscal second quarter. This assumes that we are able to continue to restore cafe seating and operating hours at our U.S stores nearing full capacity by the end of the second quarter. . For the International segment, we expect comparable store sales to grow between 25% and 30% in fiscal 2021. This estimate is predicated on COVID-19 impacts continuing to lessen in Japan as well as China\u2019s current operating environment remaining substantially unchanged with full seating and regular operating hours in almost all locations. We continue to expect China\u2019s comparable store sales to fully recover by the end of our first quarter, excluding the benefit from the temporary VAT exemption, which we will continue to expect will expire in January. For the full fiscal year in 2021, we expect China\u2019s comparable store sales to grow between 27% and 32%. Moving on to the next key growth driver, retail store development. Although we expect to open more stores globally in fiscal 2021 than we did last year targeting approximately 2,150 new store openings compared to about 2,000 in fiscal \u201920, we expect store closures to increase versus prior year from approximately 600 in fiscal \u201920 to about 1,050 in fiscal \u201921. This is primarily due to the accelerated repositioning of our U.S. store portfolio and the restructuring of our Canada business, but also reflects a slightly. higher pace of closures in our International license store portfolio. As a result, we expect to add approximately 1,100 net new Starbucks stores globally in fiscal 2021, down from approximately 1,400 in fiscal 2020. For the Americas, we expect new store openings to be approximately 850 located mostly in the U.S. with roughly 800 store closures across the segment in fiscal 2021, yielding approximately 50 net new stores. The closures are part of the trade area transformation initiative that we announced in June to accelerate the evolution of our store footprint intense metro centers, clearing the way for the development of new, more efficient retail store formats that cater the customers\u2019 increasing desire for convenience, while also improving trade area profitability. Compared to the plans we announced in June, our guidance for fiscal \u201921 reflects an additional 200 store closures in the Americas Company operated store portfolio, based on our current outlook on store performance, mostly in dense metro centers where there is the potential for sales transfer. For International, we expect to open approximately 1,300 new stores in fiscal \u201921 and close approximately 250 stores, yielding 1,050 net new stores next year, including approximately 600 net new stores in China. This reflects a slower pace of International licensed store development as well as a slightly higher pace of International licensed store closures relative to fiscal 2020, in part, due to the impacts of COVID-19 resulting from the relatively slow pace of recovery in many markets outside the U.S. Importantly, we believe these impacts are temporary, and we expect the pace of global net store development to return to our long-term growth guidance of 6% to 7% annually in fiscal 2022. We expect Channel Development\u2019s revenue in fiscal 2021 to range between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, including the 53rd week. The anticipated decline in the segment\u2019s revenue from $1.9 billion in fiscal 2020 is primarily attributable to a structural change in our single-serve business that was announced in February. Pursuant to an arrangement between Nestle and Keurig Dr Pepper, resulting in a more royalty based revenue construct for Starbucks that took it back last month. We do not expect the profitability of our single-serve business to be materially impacted by this change. Adding it all up, we expect consolidated revenue to range between $28 billion and $29 billion in fiscal 2021, including approximately $500 million attributable to the 53rd week. Let\u2019s move on to fiscal 2021 operating margin. Globally, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2021 to improve significantly over the prior year, driven primarily by three tailwinds, partially offset by incremental strategic investments in our business. The three tailwinds are number 1, sales leverage, as we continue to recover from the impacts of COVID-19. Number 2, the absence of certain COVID-19 related expenses unique to the prior year; and number 3, ongoing supply chain efficiencies. The strategic investments are concentrated in three areas, number 1, enhanced partner wages and benefits; number 2, technology to drive further digital customer engagement, expand retail sales and improve store operating efficiency; and number 3, environmental sustainability primarily within our supply chain to reduce waste water consumption and carbon emissions. These investments are spread across our product and distribution costs, store operating expenses and G&A. Let me add one additional point to the operating margin equation for fiscal 2021. We expect commodities to have minimal year-over-year impact on our product and distribution costs. At this point, our overall coffee needs are mostly priced locked for fiscal 2021. Combining the impact of all these margin drivers, we expect non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal 2021 to be between 16% and 17% starting well below the lower end of this range in the first half of the year and rising above the upper end of this range in the back half of the year. Similarly, we expect our retail operating segments to deliver significant margin improvement on a non-GAAP basis as fiscal 2021 progresses. For Channel Development, we expect operating margin to exceed pre-COVID-19 levels and approach the mid \u201940s driven by the structural change in our single-serve business which I just described. Below the operating income line, we expect interest expense to be between $470 million and $480 million in fiscal 2021 versus $437 million in fiscal 2020. The increase is driven by debt issuances totaling $4.75 billion in the past eight months. Importantly, we remain committed to our BBB plus BAA1 one credit rating and leverage cap of 3 times rent adjusted EBITDA. While the impacts of COVID-19 have resulted in the Company exceeding that leverage cap, we view these impacts as temporary and we expect our leverage to return to near targeted levels in the latter part of fiscal 2021 as our operating cash flow continues to improve and we extinguish upcoming debt maturities. Based on the strength of our cash flow, I\u2019m happy to report that we paid off a $500 million term loan in Q4 and as we previously announced, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend representing the 10th consecutive annual increase since Starbucks commenced paying a dividend in 2010. As to our tax rate in fiscal 2021, we expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the mid 20% range. This compares with GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 20.6% and 20.7% respectively in fiscal 2020 which benefited from certain discrete tax items that are not expected to repeat to the same degree in fiscal 2021. Finally, we currently expect the suspension of our share repurchase program to continue through the balance of fiscal 2021. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to total approximately $1.9 billion, slightly higher than what we spent in fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to two things, number 1, the re-acceleration of new store development following a temporary pause during the pandemic; and number 2, an expansion of our global supply chain, notably the development of the Coffee Innovation Park in China that we announced earlier this year. Finally, at this juncture, we foresee minimal impact from foreign currency movements in fiscal 2021. When you add it all up, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $2.34 to $2.54 in fiscal 2021, including approximately $0.10 for the 53rd week. We expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.90 in fiscal 2021 including again approximately $0.10 for the extra week demonstrating further recovery and approaching pre-pandemic levels. For Q1, specifically, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.37 and non-GAAP EPS in the range $0.50 to $0.55, reflecting our current stage of recovery. Given this expectation for Q1 EPS and combined with the normal seasonality that tends to dampen our EPS in Q2, we expect meaningfully higher EPS in the third and fourth quarters compared to the first two quarters of the year. So let me wrap things up. We are delighted with the pace of business recovery in fiscal 2020 and the momentum that it provides for fiscal 2021. We remain confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of our growth model, and we are committed to making the investments necessary to sustain our competitive advantages reinforced by the consistent execution of a focused agenda. On that note, I would like to express my appreciation to our green apron partners who deliver the Starbucks customer experience in a manner that is truly unmatched and exemplifies our Company\u2019s mission and values, which are the foundation of our business. With that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by Roz Brewer and John Culver, as Durga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you very much. I mean, obviously, you have a lot to unpack in the call, and congratulations on the progress that you've made. Yet the question was really on U.S. segment margins, but I think I can apply it, to China, here as well. A lot of companies have embarked on simplification efforts that have driven margins, you very specifically have not, as you've continued to give the customer the choice that they expect, but -- but you have had a very significant shift in mobile order and pay, which I assume you could potentially be leading you to some of the labor efficiencies that you alluded to, a couple of times in the call. So the question, is as we kind of think about, you're getting back to previous margins that were achieved in both of those segments what type of an average unit volume may be relative to 2019, do you think you need to achieve to get back to previous margins? And are we in a in an environment, on an average unit volume recovery, where we can potentially start, you're talking about some relatively near-term peaks?\nKevin Johnson: Thanks, John. We'll hand that to Pat to handle that.\nPat Grismer: Thank you, John, for the question. So with respect to the impact of the increase in our digital business, on our labor productivity, we've been very pleased with the growth of our digital business. But even as that has increased, and even as some of our cafe seating has remained closed, we've added operational complexities to the business like enhanced and more frequent cleaning, and managing social distancing in our cafes, including as customers come in for mobile order and pay pickup. And that is to ensure safety in our stores for both our partners and our customers, which has been instrumental to our ability to welcome customers back to the business. And so this is attended to offset some of the improved labor productivity that we would have otherwise realized. And as a result of these new operational complexities, along with the incremental investments we're making to enhance partner wages and benefits. Our fiscal \u201821 margin guidance reflects that labor recovery will trail sales recovery, with overall labor productivity, returning to pre-COVID levels by Q4. But I do want to clarify that the team remains very much focused on ensuring that we are driving enhanced productivity in our stores. And that's largely through the redesign of in-store operating routines, as well as the introduction of new technologies as we continue to automate tasks. So it's really through a combination of how we've responded to the new operating environment to provide that safe and welcoming store atmosphere that our partners and customers require, along with how we're able to benefit from sales leverage as we recover our business. Now, you asked what is the average unifying that we would need to achieve and how that compares to fiscal \u201819. As you know, we're anticipating that we will have fully recovered comparable store sales by the end of our fiscal second quarter, but there will be a two quarter lag beyond that, because of the dynamics I mentioned before we expect to see full margin recovery, and that includes the improved labor productivity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great, thank you very much. Question on the unit growth side of things, China and then more broadly, but China specifically, I think your guidance culminates in like 12% plus unit growth in fiscal \u201821, which looks like a step-down from the prior 15% plus. And I know you talked about the global unit growth is falling a little short of your 6% to 7%, as well. So specifically, China, you think you're going to get back to that 15% plus post-COVID or is it maybe more of the large numbers, whether there's any gaining factors, gaining partners or real estate or demand. And kind of in that context, I'm just wondering, as everyone talks about the better opportunity from independent store closures and more attractive real estate, whether you're seeing either of those things at this point. Thank you very much.\nKevin Johnson: Thanks, Jeffrey. I'll hand over to John Culver. John you would take that.\nJohn Culver: Yes, Jeffrey. For China, we actually have accelerated store growth. And we had a record quarter open 259 stores in Q4. And feel very good about our year-over-year growth in the store count perspective at 14%. We do see a pathway back to getting back to the historical levels. We're guiding to the 600, but we're continuing to look for new opportunities to go faster, where it makes sense. At the same time, we're innovating from a concept standpoint with Starbucks now, and the acceleration of that and we're encouraged by what we're seeing thus far. And then if you look at the new stores and the performance overall, we are seeing, emerging back into those historical return trends. And that gives us a lot of room for optimism in terms of the store growth model. So we are fully committed to accelerating growth, we're going to be opportunistic about it, we believe in the number that we're committed to and where we can get back more, we will go after it. We've had ongoing discussions with landlords as part of that. And they're looking to partner with us for the relevant sites, and continuing to grow our business. So for us, we will continue to push hard on store development. It accounts for roughly 75% to 80% of our total revenue growth. So we see this as a big piece, given the long runway we see there.\nPat Grismer: And Jeffrey, this is Pat. Just to build on what John has said, I think it was a couple of years ago, at our China Investor Conference that we talked about a longer term goal of reaching 6,000 stores in China by the end of fiscal \u201822, we\u2019ve remained optimistic that we will achieve that number and that does imply that following fiscal \u201821, we will see an acceleration in the pace of new unit development in China.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. I also wanted to ask a question about unit development in the Americas and maybe the closures, is your thinking thought changed on the closures about, 800 closures you make in the U.S. to get to that of that 50? I think originally you talked about 400 in the U.S. and 200 in Canada, is that you including licensed in that for example or is that just an acceleration of the tow company closures? And you also talked about where you are in developing that new prototype a [indiscernible] at Starbucks now or Starbucks to go but where are you in that evolution of open more stores? And how do you think about that in the equation for \u201921 development?\nKevin Johnson: Hey Roz, you want to take that?\nRoz Brewer: Yes. Thanks, John. Good question. So concerning the number of store closures in the U.S., we remain pretty much in line with historical levels at -- and as you stated about 850 new stores 800 closures. What we've learned as we've gone through the COVID process, we are learning more about where our customers are returning to access their coffee. So we've accelerated the closures that we have planned for the U.S. stores. Part of this is also to learning what our new formats can offer us. And so you ask the question about our new formats, we are increasing the number of units that we have in the new format, for instance, it also includes new channels as well. So we have current sized stores at about 800 in the U.S. 2,000 of those by the end of \u201821. We\u2019ve actually are working on restoring seating in our stores, we have roughly 65% of our stores with restore seating. And so as we move forward, we have opened three of the new units that we are \u2013 have in the New York area and one in Toronto areas. And we're accelerating that throughout this year. And adding more of those units as we go throughout the year, but we build your call -- pickup stores. And we will continue to deliver those as we go throughout the year.\nPat Grismer: And John, just to build on what Roz has said with respect to the composition of our store closures as we reposition the portfolio. When we announced our trade area transformation back in June via our 8-K, we talked about 600 closures in the Americas that was 400 in the U.S. and 200 in Canada, all company operated stores. And so with the incremental 200 store closures that we've announced that's about 100 in the U.S. and 100 in Canada. And you know, part of the reason why we've taken that up is that as our team has started the process of repositioning the portfolio over the course of the summer, accelerating the strategic plans we already had in place, what we've learned is that we've been able to manage the closures much more efficiently than we originally anticipated. And that's largely about the average lease exit costs. So with this new information, we were able to go back and take a look at the portfolio, along with insights we have into how the dense metro trade areas are performing and identify an incremental 200 store closures that would create shareholder value through our ability to capture sales transfer from the stores that are closing at nearby locations, while also reducing cash operating losses at underperforming stores, avoiding future CapEx that would otherwise have to spend to remodel some of these stores. And that more than pays for these lease exit costs per unit and so the additional experience just over the course of the summer put us in a much stronger position to move even more rapidly with a strategic transformation of our state. And the thing I would point out that is a big benefit of that. And certainly working in our guidance is a meaningful improvement to not only our Americas operating margin, but then how that flows through to the enterprise. At the enterprise level, it's on the order of 40 basis points. So we're really pleased with how our team has been able to respond to their learnings over the course of the summer, and put together even more aggressive plans that are going to put us in a much more profitable position, and also structured the business for stronger growth going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from one of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please, please proceed with your question.\nSara Senatore: Thank you, and I hope you can hear me I've been having a little bit of trouble. And I wanted to ask about same-store sales target. I think the implication is that next year volumes would be somewhere between flat with 2019 and up 5%. in the U.S., considering that you started at 2020 with a plus 6% is that conservative, and also as we think about ticket versus traffic, you said that some of it is obviously COVID related the higher ticket, but you also get higher ticket from just drive through. So through the possible the comp recovery is perhaps less traffic driven, then we might expect, considering what happened this past year? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: Pat once you start and let Roz then add some color to it.\nPat Grismer: Thanks Sara. Thank you, Sara. As to the total comp expectations for next year, I think in the current environment, notwithstanding the fact that we are very pleased with the strength of our recovery thus far, there is significant uncertainty as to how things are going to unfold, whether as a consequence of the progression of the pandemic, or what may be happening in the broader economy and how those two are linked, as we've thought about what is an appropriate level to target. And we've been able to leverage models that our team has built, we have an -- we have an artificial intelligence data analysis team that does extraordinary work to help inform not only how we operate our stores based on prevailing conditions that each and every store, but also what we're expecting, next year to look like for each and every store, taking into consideration both internal and external variables. And based on those projections, it's fair to say that we have hedged somewhat to be appropriately conservative in the current environment. And based on our progress today, we remain very pleased. And that includes a faster than expected acceleration over the course of the summer yielding in what we consider to be very strong results for our fourth quarter that is provided significant momentum as we enter this year. So I would say that on balance, our expectations are somewhat conservative, but appropriately so in the current environment. And that remains our guidance policy is to communicate outcomes that we have no reasonable degree of confidence we can deliver against and I think our experience here in the last year to the depths of the pandemic has reinforced our ability to do that pretty well. I will ask Roz to comment on the second part of your question in relation to ticket growth. And what's driving that and how we see that trending into next year versus traffic?\nRoz Brewer: Yes, and there's two things I'll do. First of all, in terms of returning transactions, back to our stores, there's four areas we're looking at, and I'll start there. First of all, looking at increasing the members in our loyalty program, we introduced the new stars for everyone program in mid September, and that is moving in the right direction, we're pleased with what we're seeing so far. Secondly, as we just talked about repositioning our store portfolio, to better meet our customers where they are today and more importantly, where they'll be in the future. So it's good for us now and good for the future work that we need to do for our customers. And then also enhancing our engagement of our partners and we know when our customers and our partners connect they experience and the best moments in our stores yield benefits for us. And then lastly, creating that leveraging a robust pipeline of beverage innovation, which we've seen in our fall outline of the pumpkin spice products, and that's going forward. In terms of the work that we're doing in terms of ticket. Ticket has been enhanced, we're looking at ticket at about $21 right now. And so, what's happening there is that during the time of the pandemic, we reduced our reliance on price and so we're just now reintroducing price that we're keeping price in the range of 1% to 2%. So we continue to see beverage in terms of the size of the beverage, so larger size beverages, multiple beverages and then food attached. And so ticket continues to be strong for us and we're projecting to hold back through the year.\nPat Grismer: And Sara just to provide a little bit more fabric on some of the numbers. And I believe Roz may have inadvertently said $21 and she meant 21%. But just to help you understand some of the underlying drivers, at the onset of COVID, ticket comp in the U.S. company operated stores accelerated to 25% well beyond, what we had expected, and that was driven primarily by a shift in sales mix toward our drive through an MLP channels, where average spend tends to be higher in part due to a higher incidence of group orders. Now in the fourth quarter ticket growth moderated as compared to those previous highs but remained well above pre -COVID levels in the range of 3% to 4%. And that's where it came in at 21% for the quarter, and that was driven by order consolidation, a mix shift to higher priced cold beverages like a refreshers and frappuccino and an increase in upsizing as more customers treated themselves to [vendors and transits]. We do expect further moderation of ticket growth in future quarters, particularly as we lap the U.S. onset of COVID-19 in the latter part of our fiscal second quarter, I would say that our average ticket has also benefited from the customer appeal of our plant based offerings, which are premium priced. Specifically, we're seeing positive momentum in the alternate dairy space, as its share of U.S. company offered to net sales nearly doubled in the quarter. And this includes the impact of modifiers for alternate milk. And with the addition of oat milk in fiscal \u201821, we expect to see ongoing ticket benefits from premium product innovation, and modifier growth. Maybe a couple of things, I think you may find interesting in terms of how this relates to how consumer behavior is changing and how it's showing up in our business. Remote working has shifted urban transactions to the suburbs. And this has led to higher order consolidation has customers who previously purchased for only themselves are increasingly buying for others. And then as they're coming, they're not just adding beverages for, the larger party size, but food attached is at record highs, and it continues to grow. In fact, it's grown the fastest and drive through an MLP. We think because menu visibility is clearly sparking trial with personal recommendations, which will accelerate in the new year and even larger unlock moving forward. Now, while beverage attach has trended down slightly through the quarter, which we continue to expect will happen as our transactions grow. Food attach actually grew. And we believe that trial is the start of routine. So we see this as a very encouraging development. And I guess the last thing I would say is that our innovation and our promotions are resonating with customers giving us optimism as we head into the holiday. Now we enjoyed strengthen new products like the impossible breakfast sandwich and also our new breakfast wraps, plus broken refreshers. And those are giving existing customers reasons to visit more frequently. And it's giving new customers reasons to visit. We're excited with the momentum we saw from our fall promotion. And so that gives us confidence that as we move into the month of November with our holiday promotion, we will sustain the momentum. So a variety of things related to the ticket growth that give us reason for optimism as we enter the New Year. But again, we expect that to moderate as we start to lap more material impacts of COVID in the back half of the year as our traffic continues to grow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of David Tarantino with Baird. Proceed with your question.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good afternoon. I had a question, I guess about the U.S. comp trend, exiting the quarter. And it was a pretty impressive move from August to September. So I was wondering if you could maybe he's together the factors that drove that step change in the comps. And then if you're willing, is that the trend that you're seeing so far in the current quarter? And, Pat, if you could maybe just help us understand what you're assuming for the current quarter in that EPS guidance?\nKevin Johnson: I will ask Roz you add some color on the action that you think drove that and Pat and follow up on David second question.\nRoz Brewer: Sure. So going into the fourth quarter, there were several things that helped us with our comp performance. One of those things is increasing the number of stores that we had open, expanding drive-thru performance and actually bringing efficiency to the drive-thru so that we had better out the window performance and putting practices and efficiencies and work into place in terms of labor deployment in those stores. In addition to that, we had great success with introducing our hot beverages around pumpkin spice and the coke, Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew product and then in addition to that, we also saw improvement as we advance our seating and return seating into our stores. We did recognize that our customers began to feel more comfortable coming out, we saw advancements happening in our metro suburban stores, which we already had drive-thru stores located in those areas, in addition to seeing more regular business coming from the morning, time to mid-morning, and having our baristas ready in the stores at those times. So as the customer was adjusting, we were adjusting along with them. And so the combination of our in-store efficiencies, labor deployment, new beverages, in addition to drive-thru effectiveness, we began to see improved comp performance in our stores exceeding fourth quarter.\nPat Grismer: And David, just to build on what Roz said \u2013 Roz nailed it in terms of what the key drivers were that improvement from minus 11% in August to minus 4% in September. You may be wondering, if we hit minus 4% in September, why are we saying that we won't see full comparable store sales recovery for another six months, until the end of our second quarter, that is the end of March. And what I would highlight is that, the closer we get to full recovery, I would say the harder it becomes to recapture or recover, those remaining few percentages, because when you think back to where we were in the April May timeframe and how our business progressed across the summer, much of the improvement was attributable to reopening stores. And then as Roz mentioned, reopening seating and, alongside all the great operational improvements that our store managers and their teams have brought to life. Now we're at a point where we have to rely more heavily on some of the newer store innovations in relation to things like curbside pickup, or handheld POS at the drive-thru to improve productivity. So we can capture more of the demand that is there at our drive-thru. So we do expect more gradual improvement from this point forward. Just as our recovery today has not been linear, we don't think that it's going to necessarily be linear going forward, either. But what I will tell you is that the strong momentum that we enjoyed exiting September has continued into the month of October. So we're really pleased with how the first quarter of the new fiscal year is shaping up. But we do expect that the overall pace of progression as the sequential improvements will taper as we get closer and closer to full recovery. And we're very excited about how things are shaping up overall. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please proceed you\u2019re your question.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thank you. Roz can you talk about what you're observing in coffee consumption per capita based on what you observe in the domestic MSR data. And what I'm trying to get better understand is that based on improving sales later in the morning, and potentially with other members ordering larger beverage sizes, and or MSR [guests] more frequently versus what you saw a few months ago. Can the argument be made that U.S. consumers are functioning on higher caffeine consumption to help get through the pandemic, as work from home patterns don't seem likely to reverse for the foreseeable future.\nRoz Brewer: So in terms of what we're seeing from customers and their coffee consumption, what we're seeing is that their routines are actually changing. And they're shifting their patterns based on this work from home, as you described. So we're seeing, our morning business shift to mid morning, we're seeing a shift from our weekday business to our weekends, we've had some extremely strong weekends. And so I think what we're seeing more so in terms of, more or less coffee consumption, it is their routines that are adjusting that. The other thing that we've seen, as Pat talked about earlier, is that we're seeing them by multiple beverages. So we do think that we are seeing them by maybe in group and for family, and for and also adding food to those orders. But in terms of coffee consumption, it's hard to say I do know, also two that are ready to drink business. And John might want to talk about that for a minute is also improving. So we are holding and retaining our customer throughout the day if they're at retail or if they're at a consumer.\nJohn Culver: Yes, let me just pick up a little bit on what Roz was talking about. We are seeing rapid growth and shared gains for Starbucks down the aisle. And Kevin highlighted in it that we saw the packaged coffee business here in the U.S. grows 17% in the quarter far outpacing the category at 9% growth. So we're getting more than our fair share that growth in terms of the share growth that we're seeing the Starbucks brand grew 130 basis points. Our roasting ground share on Starbucks grow 160 and our cake cup share grew 40 basis points. And then that also translates over into RTD and in RTD we saw considerable growth there. And in particular, strong share gains, both across the addressable RTD coffee category at 50 basis points, chilled coffee at 230 basis points gain and a shelf stable RTD coffee at 140 basis points gain. So as consumers are shifting, Starbucks is available and they're consuming it in their home and they're turning to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. It's great to hear that company is using or analyzing consumer data to evaluate how consumer behavior has shifted and another companies use the data to help identify store closures and Starbuck pickup locations. But how is the company using the data to improve comp sales? And do you believe you have a lot further opportunities towards that effort?\nKevin Johnson: Yes, Chris, this is Kevin. Let me comment and I'll see if Roz and John want to add but. Clearly, right now, what the data is telling us and what we've optimized around our experiences that are safe, familiar and convenient. And clearly in the pandemic and part of this is our artificial intelligence tools are monitoring customer behavior and partner sentiment along with data that's fed to us on the spread of COVID to give us insight at a per store level. But the safe familiar and convenient is kind of the three terms that we would characterize globally that customers are looking for. And that's why number one, we've deployed these safety protocols consistently throughout our stores, we know how to if we can turn the dial up and open more seating or open other channels we do we have to turn the dial back in a market or near a store where the virus is spreading, we know how to do that and we know how to do that at a store level, community level. The convenient part is artificial intelligence tools and the data has shown us if we enable the channels of convenience, that Roz and John both described in the U.S. and China, whether it's drive-thru, mobile order for pickup, mobile or for delivery, curbside, we enable those channels and then we find ways to increase the throughput in those channels Roz mentioned increasing, the out the window time at drive-thru. A lot of that's been determined by we know if we add this handheld point of sale in a drive-thru line and we go out in the line we can speed up the ordering process which helps us then better serve customers. So the data is helping us understand where we have opportunities to \u2013 well, first of all, it helps us understand consumer behavior so that we can get the themes that we have to focus on. When we focus on specific areas of that customer experience that data is helping inform us where we're making progress and where we're unlocking new opportunities for comp growth. And we're doing that across certainly across the USA and China and then leveraging that to help us rest of world. Roz, maybe your job if you have other things you want to add. I'll give you an opportunity to comment.\nRoz Brewer: The other area that we are monitoring very closely in terms of customer preferences is combining what we're learning about the customer with our brand equity work that we do. And it's in fuel -- it's really fueling our beverage innovation to give you an example, the work that we're doing around contributing to the recovery around beverages, if you look at that, we're growing in the cold space, just monitoring the sales rate of cold, and then optimizing the innovation in that area. So we're using the data to fuel our innovation for the future. We're also doing that as we look at new ways of managing our equipment. And so when you look at our new equipment that is coming online over this year is all AI enabled, that's also allowing us to learn more about maintenance in the stores and how we apply labor. So we are actually trying to use the data, on so many different fronts to actually improve comp performance, and monitor where the customer will be in the future.\nPat Grismer: And I would just add, Chris, from a China perspective, it is all the information is telling us it's about the digital footprint, and how we engage our customers and make the -- their ability to interact with Starbucks seamless, and frictionless. And so a real big focus on rewards and rewards members, we up level the program in June, our total rewards members grew 175% year-over-year in the quarter, we're now at $7.2 million members in China. Our 90-day assets grew to $13.5 million or up 34% year-over-year. And then what we're seeing, in addition to that is this translation into the mobile order and pay and mobile order and delivery aspect of the business. And that accounted for 26% of transactions in the quarter for China. And that is up versus the low single-digits prior to pre-COVID pandemic. So this digital footprint is something that we are investing heavily in China to continue to innovate, continue to rapidly deploy it, engage our customers, and then we've expanded it as well, we now sit across all of Alibaba\u2019s platforms, as well as the WeChat platform for delivery. And as part of that we just introduced social gifting for delivery on the WeChat platform. So really building out that footprint in a big way. Starbucks now exists in 98% of our stores in China. And then the delivery program itself sits in 84% of our footprint in China, covering all our customers. So digital is a big piece. The other piece that's emerging is health and wellness. And we've launched the good campaign earlier this year, which is our plant based beverages, as well as food offerings. And in particular, we're seeing great success with oat milk, and the success that that's having. And you're seeing this thirst from our customers around healthy options for themselves. So the team is working hard to develop those. And then obviously, on the store piece, it's the third place environment, how do we continue to innovate around the third place environment, whether it is the now store, but then also how are our reserve store showing up? And how are we continuing to elevate that brand because a third place is still very, very relevant in China.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you, question on rewards and digital your 90-day rewards user growth was 10%. And I was just thinking about how impressive that is given the fact that traffic was down 25% due to COVID. So I guess the stars for everyone is working. And it's -- and perhaps you think of it this way that it's building your reservoir of digital connections, that that's maybe understated by rewards users on a regular basis, because of course there are these people that have opted out lately due to COVID or had their lives disrupted. So are you thinking of it that way that there is a larger pool of lapsed users? That would be an easy get on the back end of this that are data rewards members but not regular ones. And do you have a sense of how large that group is? Thank you.\nKevin Johnson: Roz, you want to take that?\nRoz Brewer: Sure. So just to ground in a few data points there. You're right at the end of September, our 90-day active Starbucks reward members grew to about 19.3 million and that's up more than 10% as you stated. So what we're seeing in that is that, we are engaging our occasional customer. And that is something that we have not been able to do before we introduced stars for everyone. So what we're seeing right now is strong activation growth very early on with stars for everyone. We're really optimistic in the ability to gain significantly more members in fiscal 2021 of those 90-day active members. We\u2019ll continue to innovate around the convenience and that loyalty piece and attract new customers and fueling growth in that area. One of the things that we're seeing is that whatever we introduce new down to the stores, we have a much broader audience to introduce that to so we're seeing quite a bit of pickup there. And we're encouraged by what we see. So we do expect those numbers to climb. And it is bolstered by stars for everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from one of [Krista], with RBC Capital Markets. Proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, Thanks for taking the question. Just on the margin guidance, how does that contemplate the shifts in transaction versus ticket? And I think Pat you talked earlier about the growth in food attached. So assuming that there's maybe perhaps normalization there, yes, how does that impact your margin guidance? And what's implied there?\nPat Grismer: Thank you for the question. And as we thought about the evolution of our margins over the course of fiscal \u201821, we've taken into account several things. The first and I would say the most important is how we are rebuilding transactions across the year and how that provides us. The sales leverage that is we've earned here in recent months is so important to our ability to drive improved profitability of our business, we further break that down into, which channel it's coming through, and what the implications are, for average spend, and then how we see our mix, further shifting. So we have taken that into account, as we've thought through, this range of 16% to 17%, overall operating margin for the company for the entire fiscal year, recognizing that we will be below the bottom end of that range in the first half of the year, and then above the top end of that range in the latter half of the year. And that takes into account not only the progression of our sales recovery, but importantly, how we are rebuilding margin while continuing to make investments, that the investments are pretty substantial. Just as we invested heavily through the depths of the crisis, we have some pretty significant investments planned for fiscal \u201821, behind the things that really drive our business. So we're thinking about what is needed for the long-term to strengthen key points of competitive advantage to unlock future sales growth. And that starts with our partners. So we've planned substantial investments behind the enhanced partner wages and benefits. We've planned very substantial investments in technology in order to extend the strength and the growth of our digital platform and how that contributes to our business in ways that both John and Roz have articulated. And then finally, we're making incremental investments behind our bold ambitions and environmental sustainability. Those things tend to be, offsets to the sales leverage that we realize as we go as we re-grow our business. And then also, the ongoing efficiencies that we gain through operating productivity in our stores, as well as ongoing supply chain efficiencies. So it truly is a mix of sales growth, the composition of that growth in terms of how we see both ticket and transactions evolving over the course of the year and then taking into consideration the investments necessary to strengthen the brand for the long-term because we know those investments are important to maintain those key points of competitive advantage.\nOperator: Our next question comes to line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nGregory Francfort: Hey, thanks for the question. I'm going to react into Charles's question a little bit differently. But I guess when we look at the coffee category and you guys in the U.S. are back till almost flat. Pumpkins [indiscernible] modestly positive, you're pointing out that the grocery store business is up? Where's the chair coming from? Is it coming from independent coffee shops? Are they coming from other limited service players? Or are Americans just getting over caffeinated at the moment? I'm just curious, your thoughts on that matter? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: Well, thanks for the question. I'll kind of go back to some data we shared on the addressable market of coffee in our last investor conference. And if you recall, the projection was that the addressable market of coffee was going to be growing at roughly a 5% CAGR year-after-year and where I think there was probably a little bit of a blip back in March and April, during the period that where people were sheltering at home. I don't think that has slowed down the growth for the addressable market of coffee. So if the question is do we believe the market for coffee is going to is growing and going to continue to grow? The answer is yes. Then the second part is how are we doing on gaining share, I think is John Culver highlighted when you when you look at home coffee, clearly the data that we're getting from down the aisle is we are growing significant share in a rapidly growing market for at home coffee. And if you look at, we've tracked over the last several months where we've grown our same-store comparables in the U.S. on a sequential basis. And we track that we have regained some substantial portion of the share that that we probably gave back when we shut down all of our stores in April. So I think we are in a growing addressable market of coffee, I think we are in a share taking position, I think the investments that we are making for trade area transformation, and everything that we have done to tune the customer experience, the beverage innovation and our digital customer relationships, we are poised for ongoing share gains in a growing addressable market for coffee.\nGregory Francfort: Thanks Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKatherine Fogertey: Great, thank you. It was really helpful and the [lots] of guidance that you provided on the call today. Just curious as we contemplate, the potential for second wave or for the virus to kind of research or, even potentially, the consumer spending to weaken from here. What are the levers that you have to pull? How committed are you to these strategic investments? And maybe said another way, should the flow through be roughly 50%? Or are there reasons to believe that, it might kind of revert closer to levels that you thought earlier this year? Thank you.\nKevin Johnson: Katherine, let me comment, then I'll hand over to Pat to add to this. First of all, one of the things when I talked about in my comments about resilience, what I believe to be true is we have developed these store protocols that now has been embedded in the operation processes for how we run our Starbucks stores around the world. And those store protocols have been -- they are enabling us to operate in the world of COVID. And so even in the world of COVID, where in certain markets is the curve is increasing. In other markets, the curve is flattening, we've been able to see sequential improvements in same-store comparables, and I attribute that to the fact that those store protocols, we've now operationalized, we know how to keep our partner safe, we know how to serve coffee to our customers in our store and keep our customers safe. And we are staying true to what to what really drove the turnaround of this company over the last two or three years, which is elevating the customer experience, relevant beverage innovation and digital customer relationships. So if I look at what's, you think about what could unfold over the next year. So we're operating in this environment. And I feel very confident we know how to do that, because we've built this new level of resilience throughout the company to do that, that said, the investments many of the investments Pat has described are long-term investments that are going to pay great returns for shareholders, years to come. So for us, it's more about are we building long term shareholder value versus -- are we, are we having to tune those investments quarter-to-quarter now we have some flexibility in that. But at the end of the day, we want to play the long game. And we are so well positioned right now, in my opinion, because we have now adapted the way we operate the company for this world of COVID. We've identified the shifts in consumer behavior, we're rapidly adapting to that new reality, we're investing ahead of that curve in a growing addressable market for coffee. And that just positions us to come out of this gaining massive amounts of share, creating significant shareholder value. And so we're operating playing the long game. Now that said, I'll let Pat comment on, the part of your question that said, hey, if we hit, some unforeseen things, how much flexibility do we have on the cost side? So Pat?\nPat Grismer: I think Kevin said it really well, in terms of the level of resilience that we've built into our business, which gives us the ability to manage much more effectively going forward. And we have seen examples already, just in the last couple of quarters, whether in Beijing, in Dalian in China or as well as in States like California, Texas, and Florida in the U.S., when each case we've been able to work with local authorities adjust their store operations as needed. And we found that the operational disruption of these second wave so to speak is less severe than the initial wave in terms of the depth of impact and its duration. Now, if in fact, we see a more significant impact goes beyond our ability to manage, as Kevin has described through our ability to dial up and dial back, then I would expect that there would be some margin compression, we will do our best as we did through the depths of the pandemic, to slow discretionary spending, where it makes sense to slow CapEx, where it makes sense, but we are absolutely committed to making the investments that we know are essential to our ability to strengthen our brand positioning, to strengthen our key points of competitive advantage, they're going to put us in the best position to unlock the full value of the Starbucks brand for the long-term. And we have the, the financial ability, we have the balance sheet, to continue to make those investments as we did, and ensure that for the long-term, we are the best position in the category.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your question? \nDennis Geiger: Great, thank you. Curious if you could frame up whether the bigger opportunity to continue to drive sales is more about the operational adjustments to meet the existing demand, or about opportunities to drive new incremental demand, if you can parse that out. I know, a lot has been shared on kind of the innovative operational adjustments in recent months to meet that current demand. And they talked about how, the schedule for continued rollout of curbside and handheld et cetera. So just kind of curious, factoring all that in, where we are kind of on that, meeting these existing demand, timeline, thinking about the your employees and your partner's doing a better job even being more efficient in this new environment with what they have, plus the new stuff coming to, curious and if you could kind of frame up those two components a bit more? Thank you.\nKevin Johnson: Yes, thanks. Roz once you go first and then and then let me add a thought.\nRoz Brewer: Yes. So what you're seeing right now is an acceleration of plans that we had that -- we're planning to take place over the next three to five years. And what we're doing is accelerating our innovation, particularly around trade area transformation, to reposition our stores for growth. And so the new formats that you see coming to market, we're planning for our future growth. And so we're bringing on more productivity within these models. It will help us optimize sales, but actually expand our margin position. So you're seeing accelerated innovation right now we're moving a lot faster and bringing our innovation forward. And that was all based on future growth. So we're moving in that direction, just at a faster pace.\nKevin Johnson: Yes, and I'll just add that, certainly what we've done with stars for everyone in the investments, we're making a digital that's all about long-term, growth and relationships. That's why we launched stars for everyone. We're tracking the number of new app downloads each week. And we've seen that spike we track the number of new rewards customers, we sign up, we see in that go up, we track the number of inactive rewards that members that we convert to active rewards members. So that expanded customer reach digitally is going to be a huge asset, even I'll say post-COVID or post-vaccine. But the fact that we're focusing on customer experience, beverage innovation, in addition to digital is important for the following reason. People are craving, the opportunity to socialize right now. And they can't, everyone's being careful working from home schooling from home being cautious when they go out. So safe, familiar and convenient is important right now. But once there's a vaccine therapeutics that now allow people to feel more comfortable socializing, and being part of a community, we predict there's going to be a huge, huge demand for that third place experience again. That seating in those stores and people coming to enjoy their beverage and their food with others and socialize in our stores and be a part of the community once but this is down the road, when there's vaccine and therapeutics there's going to be, a huge, huge wave of demand for that. And so not only are we laying the foundation, with the digital relationships and taking care of our customers with safe, familiar, convenient, but we are also investing in ensuring that when that demand unfolds, that third place experience will be at the pinnacle of serving those customers who want to come and be a part of a community and socialize again, because that's what -- that's something that we all aspire for.\nOperator:\ndo with your:\nAndrew Strelzik: Great, thank you. Excuse me, that's actually a good seg-way for my question. I was actually hoping you could share more color on what you observed when you open the lobbies with full or partial seating. It seems like how quickly customer behaviors change once you do that, how incremental it is to comps, how that check growth to that customer compares to the overall check growth that you shared. And if there's any regional differences or nuances, I'd be interested in that as well? Thank you.\nRoz Brewer: So, Andrew, in terms of what we're seeing as we reopen seating in our stores, we actually saw, first of all, a great need and demand for this, we immediately saw people working in our stores bringing their work into our cafes, and sitting for long periods of time, we had adjusted seating in all of our stores. So there's social distancing in the stores. We also have new cleaning protocols in the store so that when someone leaves the table, and a new customer comes in, they know that the table is clean. So the feedback that we're getting from our customers is that they feel safe and clean inside the Starbucks. So we're providing them safety, we're providing them familiarity, and then we're introducing them to our new beverage lineup. And so we're seeing great customer engagement right now as we open seating. In terms of regional activity that we're seeing, so in central business districts, likely unlike the New York financial district, where businesses have been open, as you can imagine, traffic is still slight in some of those stores. That's that 6% that you see that has not reopened. And then lastly, I would tell you that we are seeing movement towards purchasing your coffee stores near your home. So our metro suburban areas are doing well drive-thru are doing well. And actually seating in those metro suburban areas are doing extremely well. We're also seeing, just great customer engagement, even with people still coming through the drive-thru window, and taking advantage of the work that we're doing with curbside. So it's full engagement. And what we're really pleased about is that you can access coffee just about in any way that you feel safe. And that's the feedback that we are getting from our customers.\nKevin Johnson: Yes, just reinforce what Roz said, when we opened the cafe for limited seating, the response is immediate. And the impact on same-store comp is immediate. Customers are craving that and we do it in a safe way. And as long as we continue to stay true to our principles about prioritizing the health and well-being of our Starbucks partners and the customers we serve. And partnering with local health officials to help mitigate contain the spread of the virus, and showing up in a positive and responsible way and the communities we serve as long as we stay true to those principles, provide that great experience and do it in a safe way and continue to innovate with relevant new beverages, and expand digital. We are well positioned. And we know how to do this.\nOperator: With that this concludes our question and answer session. I will turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Johnson for any closing remarks.\nKevin Johnson: Well, thank you, everyone. As we conclude the call today, I want to thank you all again for joining us. As always, we're committed to leading into the future and communicating with all of you transparently and communicating with all our stakeholders, transparency, balancing our company's purpose and profit, and keeping you informed of our aspirations and the progress along the way. To that end, we look forward to hosting you soon and talking about our path forward at our virtual December 9 Investor Day. And we hope you can all join us virtually for that. And we want to take this opportunity to wish you and your families a Happy Halloween and warm wishes for the holiday season ahead. And yes, holiday season is upon us. And next week, our peppermint mocha returns for its 18th year alongside an exciting holiday menu in our stores. So we hope to see you at Starbucks where we were going to create that safe, familiar and convenient experience for each of you in our stores or at the curbside or at the drive-thru window whatever fits your needs. And we hope to bring a little holiday spark to you and your loved ones in the weeks ahead. So thanks for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Roz Brewer",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, John. Good question. So concerning the number of store closures in the U.S., we remain pretty much in line with historical levels at -- and as you stated about 850 new stores 800 closures. What we've learned as we've gone through the COVID process, we are learning more about where our customers are returning to access their coffee. So we've accelerated the closures that we have planned for the U.S. stores. Part of this is also to learning what our new formats can offer us. And so you ask the question about our new formats, we are increasing the number of units that we have in the new format, for instance, it also includes new channels as well. So we have current sized stores at about 800 in the U.S. 2,000 of those by the end of \u201821. We've actually are working on restoring seating in our stores, we have roughly 65% of our stores with restore seating. And so as we move forward, we have opened three of the new units that we are \u2013 have in the New York area and one in Toronto areas. And we're accelerating that throughout this year. And adding more of those units as we go throughout the year, but we build your call -- pickup stores. And we will continue to deliver those as we go throughout the year. Yes, and there's two things I'll do. First of all, in terms of returning transactions, back to our stores, there's four areas we're looking at, and I'll start there. First of all, looking at increasing the members in our loyalty program, we introduced the new stars for everyone program in mid September, and that is moving in the right direction, we're pleased with what we're seeing so far. Secondly, as we just talked about repositioning our store portfolio, to better meet our customers where they are today and more importantly, where they'll be in the future. So it's good for us now and good for the future work that we need to do for our customers. And then also enhancing our engagement of our partners and we know when our customers and our partners connect they experience and the best moments in our stores yield benefits for us. And then lastly, creating that leveraging a robust pipeline of beverage innovation, which we've seen in our fall outline of the pumpkin spice products, and that's going forward. In terms of the work that we're doing in terms of ticket. Ticket has been enhanced, we're looking at ticket at about $21 right now. And so, what's happening there is that during the time of the pandemic, we reduced our reliance on price and so we're just now reintroducing price that we're keeping price in the range of 1% to 2%. So we continue to see beverage in terms of the size of the beverage, so larger size beverages, multiple beverages and then food attached. And so ticket continues to be strong for us and we're projecting to hold back through the year. Sure. So going into the fourth quarter, there were several things that helped us with our comp performance. One of those things is increasing the number of stores that we had open, expanding drive-thru performance and actually bringing efficiency to the drive-thru so that we had better out the window performance and putting practices and efficiencies and work into place in terms of labor deployment in those stores. In addition to that, we had great success with introducing our hot beverages around pumpkin spice and the coke, Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew product and then in addition to that, we also saw improvement as we advance our seating and return seating into our stores. We did recognize that our customers began to feel more comfortable coming out, we saw advancements happening in our metro suburban stores, which we already had drive-thru stores located in those areas, in addition to seeing more regular business coming from the morning, time to mid-morning, and having our baristas ready in the stores at those times. So as the customer was adjusting, we were adjusting along with them. And so the combination of our in-store efficiencies, labor deployment, new beverages, in addition to drive-thru effectiveness, we began to see improved comp performance in our stores exceeding fourth quarter. So in terms of what we're seeing from customers and their coffee consumption, what we're seeing is that their routines are actually changing. And they're shifting their patterns based on this work from home, as you described. So we're seeing, our morning business shift to mid morning, we're seeing a shift from our weekday business to our weekends, we've had some extremely strong weekends. And so I think what we're seeing more so in terms of, more or less coffee consumption, it is their routines that are adjusting that. The other thing that we've seen, as Pat talked about earlier, is that we're seeing them by multiple beverages. So we do think that we are seeing them by maybe in group and for family, and for and also adding food to those orders. But in terms of coffee consumption, it's hard to say I do know, also two that are ready to drink business. And John might want to talk about that for a minute is also improving. So we are holding and retaining our customer throughout the day if they're at retail or if they're at a consumer. The other area that we are monitoring very closely in terms of customer preferences is combining what we're learning about the customer with our brand equity work that we do. And it's in fuel -- it's really fueling our beverage innovation to give you an example, the work that we're doing around contributing to the recovery around beverages, if you look at that, we're growing in the cold space, just monitoring the sales rate of cold, and then optimizing the innovation in that area. So we're using the data to fuel our innovation for the future. We're also doing that as we look at new ways of managing our equipment. And so when you look at our new equipment that is coming online over this year is all AI enabled, that's also allowing us to learn more about maintenance in the stores and how we apply labor. So we are actually trying to use the data, on so many different fronts to actually improve comp performance, and monitor where the customer will be in the future. Sure. So just to ground in a few data points there. You're right at the end of September, our 90-day active Starbucks reward members grew to about 19.3 million and that's up more than 10% as you stated. So what we're seeing in that is that, we are engaging our occasional customer. And that is something that we have not been able to do before we introduced stars for everyone. So what we're seeing right now is strong activation growth very early on with stars for everyone. We're really optimistic in the ability to gain significantly more members in fiscal 2021 of those 90-day active members. We'll continue to innovate around the convenience and that loyalty piece and attract new customers and fueling growth in that area. One of the things that we're seeing is that whatever we introduce new down to the stores, we have a much broader audience to introduce that to so we're seeing quite a bit of pickup there. And we're encouraged by what we see. So we do expect those numbers to climb. And it is bolstered by stars for everyone. Yes. So what you're seeing right now is an acceleration of plans that we had that -- we're planning to take place over the next three to five years. And what we're doing is accelerating our innovation, particularly around trade area transformation, to reposition our stores for growth. And so the new formats that you see coming to market, we're planning for our future growth. And so we're bringing on more productivity within these models. It will help us optimize sales, but actually expand our margin position. So you're seeing accelerated innovation right now we're moving a lot faster and bringing our innovation forward. And that was all based on future growth. So we're moving in that direction, just at a faster pace. So, Andrew, in terms of what we're seeing as we reopen seating in our stores, we actually saw, first of all, a great need and demand for this, we immediately saw people working in our stores bringing their work into our cafes, and sitting for long periods of time, we had adjusted seating in all of our stores. So there's social distancing in the stores. We also have new cleaning protocols in the store so that when someone leaves the table, and a new customer comes in, they know that the table is clean. So the feedback that we're getting from our customers is that they feel safe and clean inside the Starbucks. So we're providing them safety, we're providing them familiarity, and then we're introducing them to our new beverage lineup. And so we're seeing great customer engagement right now as we open seating. In terms of regional activity that we're seeing, so in central business districts, likely unlike the New York financial district, where businesses have been open, as you can imagine, traffic is still slight in some of those stores. That's that 6% that you see that has not reopened. And then lastly, I would tell you that we are seeing movement towards purchasing your coffee stores near your home. So our metro suburban areas are doing well drive-thru are doing well. And actually seating in those metro suburban areas are doing extremely well. We're also seeing, just great customer engagement, even with people still coming through the drive-thru window, and taking advantage of the work that we're doing with curbside. So it's full engagement. And what we're really pleased about is that you can access coffee just about in any way that you feel safe. And that's the feedback that we are getting from our customers."

            "name": "Pat Grismer",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin and good afternoon, everyone. As Kevin shared, we are delighted with the performance of all our operating segments, driving a strong finish to our fiscal 2020. For the quarter, Starbucks reported global revenue of $6.2 billion, down 8% from the prior year. We estimate the COVID-19 impact on Q4 consolidated revenue to be approximately $1.2 billion driven by modified operations and reduced customer traffic. Q4 EPS was considerably higher than the guidance range we provided on our last earnings call, driven by faster-than-expected sales and margin recovery as well as a lower tax rate from the impact of certain discrete items. Q4 GAAP EPS declined from $0.67 in the prior year to $0.33 inclusive of higher-than-expected restructuring and impairment costs related to the acceleration of our strategy to reposition and restructure our Company-operated store portfolio in the Americas. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.51, down from $0.70 in the prior year. The estimated negative impact of COVID-19 on Q4 EPS was $0.35. I will now provide some segment highlights and discuss consolidated margin performance for Q4, and will then provide guidance for fiscal 2021, including the expected impact of the 53rd week. Starting with the Americas. At $4.2 billion, Americas' Q4 revenue was 9% lower than the prior year, primarily due to a 9% decline in comparable store sales as well as lower product sales and royalty revenues from our licensees as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. We estimate that Q4 decline in Americas revenue and operating income attributable to COVID-19 to be approximately $830 million and $400 million respectively. This equates to a flow-through rate on lost sales of about 48% in Q4, essentially, returning to the segment's typical 50% variable flow-through rate. This is a significant sequential improvement from Q3 reflecting a decrease in catastrophe wages and enhanced pay programs as well as an increase in labor efficiency. Relative to the prior year, Americas Q4 non-GAAP operating margin contracted 350 basis points to 16.7% primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 including sales deleverage and additional costs incurred, as well as growth in retail partner wages and benefits, partially offset by improved labor efficiency. Importantly, Americas' sales and profitability trended positively across the quarter with sequential improvements each month. The U.S. posted a comparable sales decline of 4% in September, improving from minus 11% in August and the business achieved positive profitability and every month of the quarter. Moving on to International. Including a 2% VAT benefit, the segment's comparable store sales of minus 10% in Q4, reflects faster-than-expected sales recovery in Japan, boosted by successful seasonal product promotions and strong drive-through performance. I would now like to highlight the fourth quarter performance of our lead international growth market, China. For the month of September, China's comparable store sales were up 1%, including a 4 percentage point VAT exemption benefit, reflecting a slight sequential improvement to August's comp on a like-for-like basis. For the fourth quarter, China's comparable store sales declined 3% including VAT favorability of 4 percentage points. International's Q4 revenue of $1.5 billion was a 5% reduction versus the prior year, primarily due to the 10% decline in comparable store sales. Also contributing to the decline were lower product sales to and royalties from our licensees due to COVID-19. We estimate that the COVID-19 impact on the decline in International's Q4 revenue and operating income was approximately $300 million and $150 million respectively. International's flow-through rate on lost sales improved from roughly 55% in Q3 to approximately 50% in Q4, primarily due to higher labor efficiency and lower waste, partially offset by a reduction in certain temporary benefits including government relief programs. International's Q4 Non-GAAP operating margin declined by 540 basis points from the prior year to 16.3%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, largely stemming from sales deleverage and non-restructuring store asset impairments, as well as strategic investments, mainly technology and digital initiatives. On to Channel Development. Revenue was $464 million in Q4, a 9% decline from the prior year, primarily due to Global Coffee Alliance transition-related items including a structural change in our single-serve business. Excluding these transition-related items, Channel Development's revenue declined by approximately 1% from the prior year, reflecting the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the segment's foodservice business, partially offset by growth in at-home coffee and ready-to-drink. Channel Development's Q4 operating margin expanded by 510 basis points to 42.7% mainly due to a business mix shift, driven by the strength in our ready-to-drink products as well as the structural change in our single-serve business. At the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was 13.2% in Q4, down from 17.2% in the prior year, unsurprisingly, much of the year-over-year reduction in our operating margins for Q4 was due to sales deleverage attributable to COVID-19 as well as growth in wages and benefits and non-restructuring store asset impairments and strategic investments, partially offset by labor efficiencies and supply chain savings. We estimate, the COVID-19 impact to Q4 non-GAAP operating income to be roughly $550 million. In relation to the $1.2 billion of COVID '19 impact on Q4 Consolidated revenue that I mentioned earlier, this equates to a flow-through rate of approximately 46% on lost revenue, which is close to the 50% variable flow-through rate that we typically observe in our business. I will now provide guidance for fiscal 2021. Starting with the key driver of our growth, comparable sales growth for our Company-operated stores, barring any new significant and sustained waves of COVID-19 infections and or global economic disruptions, we expect global comparable store sales growth of 18% to 23% in fiscal 2021 fueled by sustained improvement in comparable store transactions across both of our key markets, the U.S. and China. These estimates are based on the experience we've gained from navigating the impact of COVID-19 for the past nine months, including the more resilient operating protocols that we've built into our business as well as the traffic driving initiatives and innovation that we plan for the year ahead. For the Americas and the U.S., we expect comparable store sales to grow between 17% to 22% in fiscal 2021 and we continue to expect to achieve full comparable store sales recovery in the U.S. by the end of our fiscal second quarter. This assumes that we are able to continue to restore cafe seating and operating hours at our U.S stores nearing full capacity by the end of the second quarter. . For the International segment, we expect comparable store sales to grow between 25% and 30% in fiscal 2021. This estimate is predicated on COVID-19 impacts continuing to lessen in Japan as well as China's current operating environment remaining substantially unchanged with full seating and regular operating hours in almost all locations. We continue to expect China's comparable store sales to fully recover by the end of our first quarter, excluding the benefit from the temporary VAT exemption, which we will continue to expect will expire in January. For the full fiscal year in 2021, we expect China's comparable store sales to grow between 27% and 32%. Moving on to the next key growth driver, retail store development. Although we expect to open more stores globally in fiscal 2021 than we did last year targeting approximately 2,150 new store openings compared to about 2,000 in fiscal '20, we expect store closures to increase versus prior year from approximately 600 in fiscal '20 to about 1,050 in fiscal '21. This is primarily due to the accelerated repositioning of our U.S. store portfolio and the restructuring of our Canada business, but also reflects a slightly. higher pace of closures in our International license store portfolio. As a result, we expect to add approximately 1,100 net new Starbucks stores globally in fiscal 2021, down from approximately 1,400 in fiscal 2020. For the Americas, we expect new store openings to be approximately 850 located mostly in the U.S. with roughly 800 store closures across the segment in fiscal 2021, yielding approximately 50 net new stores. The closures are part of the trade area transformation initiative that we announced in June to accelerate the evolution of our store footprint intense metro centers, clearing the way for the development of new, more efficient retail store formats that cater the customers' increasing desire for convenience, while also improving trade area profitability. Compared to the plans we announced in June, our guidance for fiscal '21 reflects an additional 200 store closures in the Americas Company operated store portfolio, based on our current outlook on store performance, mostly in dense metro centers where there is the potential for sales transfer. For International, we expect to open approximately 1,300 new stores in fiscal '21 and close approximately 250 stores, yielding 1,050 net new stores next year, including approximately 600 net new stores in China. This reflects a slower pace of International licensed store development as well as a slightly higher pace of International licensed store closures relative to fiscal 2020, in part, due to the impacts of COVID-19 resulting from the relatively slow pace of recovery in many markets outside the U.S. Importantly, we believe these impacts are temporary, and we expect the pace of global net store development to return to our long-term growth guidance of 6% to 7% annually in fiscal 2022. We expect Channel Development's revenue in fiscal 2021 to range between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, including the 53rd week. The anticipated decline in the segment's revenue from $1.9 billion in fiscal 2020 is primarily attributable to a structural change in our single-serve business that was announced in February. Pursuant to an arrangement between Nestle and Keurig Dr Pepper, resulting in a more royalty based revenue construct for Starbucks that took it back last month. We do not expect the profitability of our single-serve business to be materially impacted by this change. Adding it all up, we expect consolidated revenue to range between $28 billion and $29 billion in fiscal 2021, including approximately $500 million attributable to the 53rd week. Let's move on to fiscal 2021 operating margin. Globally, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2021 to improve significantly over the prior year, driven primarily by three tailwinds, partially offset by incremental strategic investments in our business. The three tailwinds are number 1, sales leverage, as we continue to recover from the impacts of COVID-19. Number 2, the absence of certain COVID-19 related expenses unique to the prior year; and number 3, ongoing supply chain efficiencies. The strategic investments are concentrated in three areas, number 1, enhanced partner wages and benefits; number 2, technology to drive further digital customer engagement, expand retail sales and improve store operating efficiency; and number 3, environmental sustainability primarily within our supply chain to reduce waste water consumption and carbon emissions. These investments are spread across our product and distribution costs, store operating expenses and G&A. Let me add one additional point to the operating margin equation for fiscal 2021. We expect commodities to have minimal year-over-year impact on our product and distribution costs. At this point, our overall coffee needs are mostly priced locked for fiscal 2021. Combining the impact of all these margin drivers, we expect non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal 2021 to be between 16% and 17% starting well below the lower end of this range in the first half of the year and rising above the upper end of this range in the back half of the year. Similarly, we expect our retail operating segments to deliver significant margin improvement on a non-GAAP basis as fiscal 2021 progresses. For Channel Development, we expect operating margin to exceed pre-COVID-19 levels and approach the mid '40s driven by the structural change in our single-serve business which I just described. Below the operating income line, we expect interest expense to be between $470 million and $480 million in fiscal 2021 versus $437 million in fiscal 2020. The increase is driven by debt issuances totaling $4.75 billion in the past eight months. Importantly, we remain committed to our BBB plus BAA1 one credit rating and leverage cap of 3 times rent adjusted EBITDA. While the impacts of COVID-19 have resulted in the Company exceeding that leverage cap, we view these impacts as temporary and we expect our leverage to return to near targeted levels in the latter part of fiscal 2021 as our operating cash flow continues to improve and we extinguish upcoming debt maturities. Based on the strength of our cash flow, I'm happy to report that we paid off a $500 million term loan in Q4 and as we previously announced, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend representing the 10th consecutive annual increase since Starbucks commenced paying a dividend in 2010. As to our tax rate in fiscal 2021, we expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the mid 20% range. This compares with GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 20.6% and 20.7% respectively in fiscal 2020 which benefited from certain discrete tax items that are not expected to repeat to the same degree in fiscal 2021. Finally, we currently expect the suspension of our share repurchase program to continue through the balance of fiscal 2021. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to total approximately $1.9 billion, slightly higher than what we spent in fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to two things, number 1, the re-acceleration of new store development following a temporary pause during the pandemic; and number 2, an expansion of our global supply chain, notably the development of the Coffee Innovation Park in China that we announced earlier this year. Finally, at this juncture, we foresee minimal impact from foreign currency movements in fiscal 2021. When you add it all up, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $2.34 to $2.54 in fiscal 2021, including approximately $0.10 for the 53rd week. We expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.90 in fiscal 2021 including again approximately $0.10 for the extra week demonstrating further recovery and approaching pre-pandemic levels. For Q1, specifically, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.37 and non-GAAP EPS in the range $0.50 to $0.55, reflecting our current stage of recovery. Given this expectation for Q1 EPS and combined with the normal seasonality that tends to dampen our EPS in Q2, we expect meaningfully higher EPS in the third and fourth quarters compared to the first two quarters of the year. So let me wrap things up. We are delighted with the pace of business recovery in fiscal 2020 and the momentum that it provides for fiscal 2021. We remain confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of our growth model, and we are committed to making the investments necessary to sustain our competitive advantages reinforced by the consistent execution of a focused agenda. On that note, I would like to express my appreciation to our green apron partners who deliver the Starbucks customer experience in a manner that is truly unmatched and exemplifies our Company's mission and values, which are the foundation of our business. With that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by Roz Brewer and John Culver, as Durga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator? Thank you, John, for the question. So with respect to the impact of the increase in our digital business, on our labor productivity, we've been very pleased with the growth of our digital business. But even as that has increased, and even as some of our cafe seating has remained closed, we've added operational complexities to the business like enhanced and more frequent cleaning, and managing social distancing in our cafes, including as customers come in for mobile order and pay pickup. And that is to ensure safety in our stores for both our partners and our customers, which has been instrumental to our ability to welcome customers back to the business. And so this is attended to offset some of the improved labor productivity that we would have otherwise realized. And as a result of these new operational complexities, along with the incremental investments we're making to enhance partner wages and benefits. Our fiscal \u201821 margin guidance reflects that labor recovery will trail sales recovery, with overall labor productivity, returning to pre-COVID levels by Q4. But I do want to clarify that the team remains very much focused on ensuring that we are driving enhanced productivity in our stores. And that's largely through the redesign of in-store operating routines, as well as the introduction of new technologies as we continue to automate tasks. So it's really through a combination of how we've responded to the new operating environment to provide that safe and welcoming store atmosphere that our partners and customers require, along with how we're able to benefit from sales leverage as we recover our business. Now, you asked what is the average unifying that we would need to achieve and how that compares to fiscal \u201819. As you know, we're anticipating that we will have fully recovered comparable store sales by the end of our fiscal second quarter, but there will be a two quarter lag beyond that, because of the dynamics I mentioned before we expect to see full margin recovery, and that includes the improved labor productivity. And Jeffrey, this is Pat. Just to build on what John has said, I think it was a couple of years ago, at our China Investor Conference that we talked about a longer term goal of reaching 6,000 stores in China by the end of fiscal \u201822, we've remained optimistic that we will achieve that number and that does imply that following fiscal \u201821, we will see an acceleration in the pace of new unit development in China. And John, just to build on what Roz has said with respect to the composition of our store closures as we reposition the portfolio. When we announced our trade area transformation back in June via our 8-K, we talked about 600 closures in the Americas that was 400 in the U.S. and 200 in Canada, all company operated stores. And so with the incremental 200 store closures that we've announced that's about 100 in the U.S. and 100 in Canada. And you know, part of the reason why we've taken that up is that as our team has started the process of repositioning the portfolio over the course of the summer, accelerating the strategic plans we already had in place, what we've learned is that we've been able to manage the closures much more efficiently than we originally anticipated. And that's largely about the average lease exit costs. So with this new information, we were able to go back and take a look at the portfolio, along with insights we have into how the dense metro trade areas are performing and identify an incremental 200 store closures that would create shareholder value through our ability to capture sales transfer from the stores that are closing at nearby locations, while also reducing cash operating losses at underperforming stores, avoiding future CapEx that would otherwise have to spend to remodel some of these stores. And that more than pays for these lease exit costs per unit and so the additional experience just over the course of the summer put us in a much stronger position to move even more rapidly with a strategic transformation of our state. And the thing I would point out that is a big benefit of that. And certainly working in our guidance is a meaningful improvement to not only our Americas operating margin, but then how that flows through to the enterprise. At the enterprise level, it's on the order of 40 basis points. So we're really pleased with how our team has been able to respond to their learnings over the course of the summer, and put together even more aggressive plans that are going to put us in a much more profitable position, and also structured the business for stronger growth going forward. Thanks Sara. Thank you, Sara. As to the total comp expectations for next year, I think in the current environment, notwithstanding the fact that we are very pleased with the strength of our recovery thus far, there is significant uncertainty as to how things are going to unfold, whether as a consequence of the progression of the pandemic, or what may be happening in the broader economy and how those two are linked, as we've thought about what is an appropriate level to target. And we've been able to leverage models that our team has built, we have an -- we have an artificial intelligence data analysis team that does extraordinary work to help inform not only how we operate our stores based on prevailing conditions that each and every store, but also what we're expecting, next year to look like for each and every store, taking into consideration both internal and external variables. And based on those projections, it's fair to say that we have hedged somewhat to be appropriately conservative in the current environment. And based on our progress today, we remain very pleased. And that includes a faster than expected acceleration over the course of the summer yielding in what we consider to be very strong results for our fourth quarter that is provided significant momentum as we enter this year. So I would say that on balance, our expectations are somewhat conservative, but appropriately so in the current environment. And that remains our guidance policy is to communicate outcomes that we have no reasonable degree of confidence we can deliver against and I think our experience here in the last year to the depths of the pandemic has reinforced our ability to do that pretty well. I will ask Roz to comment on the second part of your question in relation to ticket growth. And what's driving that and how we see that trending into next year versus traffic? And Sara just to provide a little bit more fabric on some of the numbers. And I believe Roz may have inadvertently said $21 and she meant 21%. But just to help you understand some of the underlying drivers, at the onset of COVID, ticket comp in the U.S. company operated stores accelerated to 25% well beyond, what we had expected, and that was driven primarily by a shift in sales mix toward our drive through an MLP channels, where average spend tends to be higher in part due to a higher incidence of group orders. Now in the fourth quarter ticket growth moderated as compared to those previous highs but remained well above pre -COVID levels in the range of 3% to 4%. And that's where it came in at 21% for the quarter, and that was driven by order consolidation, a mix shift to higher priced cold beverages like a refreshers and frappuccino and an increase in upsizing as more customers treated themselves to [vendors and transits]. We do expect further moderation of ticket growth in future quarters, particularly as we lap the U.S. onset of COVID-19 in the latter part of our fiscal second quarter, I would say that our average ticket has also benefited from the customer appeal of our plant based offerings, which are premium priced. Specifically, we're seeing positive momentum in the alternate dairy space, as its share of U.S. company offered to net sales nearly doubled in the quarter. And this includes the impact of modifiers for alternate milk. And with the addition of oat milk in fiscal \u201821, we expect to see ongoing ticket benefits from premium product innovation, and modifier growth. Maybe a couple of things, I think you may find interesting in terms of how this relates to how consumer behavior is changing and how it's showing up in our business. Remote working has shifted urban transactions to the suburbs. And this has led to higher order consolidation has customers who previously purchased for only themselves are increasingly buying for others. And then as they're coming, they're not just adding beverages for, the larger party size, but food attached is at record highs, and it continues to grow. In fact, it's grown the fastest and drive through an MLP. We think because menu visibility is clearly sparking trial with personal recommendations, which will accelerate in the new year and even larger unlock moving forward. Now, while beverage attach has trended down slightly through the quarter, which we continue to expect will happen as our transactions grow. Food attach actually grew. And we believe that trial is the start of routine. So we see this as a very encouraging development. And I guess the last thing I would say is that our innovation and our promotions are resonating with customers giving us optimism as we head into the holiday. Now we enjoyed strengthen new products like the impossible breakfast sandwich and also our new breakfast wraps, plus broken refreshers. And those are giving existing customers reasons to visit more frequently. And it's giving new customers reasons to visit. We're excited with the momentum we saw from our fall promotion. And so that gives us confidence that as we move into the month of November with our holiday promotion, we will sustain the momentum. So a variety of things related to the ticket growth that give us reason for optimism as we enter the New Year. But again, we expect that to moderate as we start to lap more material impacts of COVID in the back half of the year as our traffic continues to grow. And David, just to build on what Roz said \u2013 Roz nailed it in terms of what the key drivers were that improvement from minus 11% in August to minus 4% in September. You may be wondering, if we hit minus 4% in September, why are we saying that we won't see full comparable store sales recovery for another six months, until the end of our second quarter, that is the end of March. And what I would highlight is that, the closer we get to full recovery, I would say the harder it becomes to recapture or recover, those remaining few percentages, because when you think back to where we were in the April May timeframe and how our business progressed across the summer, much of the improvement was attributable to reopening stores. And then as Roz mentioned, reopening seating and, alongside all the great operational improvements that our store managers and their teams have brought to life. Now we're at a point where we have to rely more heavily on some of the newer store innovations in relation to things like curbside pickup, or handheld POS at the drive-thru to improve productivity. So we can capture more of the demand that is there at our drive-thru. So we do expect more gradual improvement from this point forward. Just as our recovery today has not been linear, we don't think that it's going to necessarily be linear going forward, either. But what I will tell you is that the strong momentum that we enjoyed exiting September has continued into the month of October. So we're really pleased with how the first quarter of the new fiscal year is shaping up. But we do expect that the overall pace of progression as the sequential improvements will taper as we get closer and closer to full recovery. And we're very excited about how things are shaping up overall. Thanks, David. And I would just add, Chris, from a China perspective, it is all the information is telling us it's about the digital footprint, and how we engage our customers and make the -- their ability to interact with Starbucks seamless, and frictionless. And so a real big focus on rewards and rewards members, we up level the program in June, our total rewards members grew 175% year-over-year in the quarter, we're now at $7.2 million members in China. Our 90-day assets grew to $13.5 million or up 34% year-over-year. And then what we're seeing, in addition to that is this translation into the mobile order and pay and mobile order and delivery aspect of the business. And that accounted for 26% of transactions in the quarter for China. And that is up versus the low single-digits prior to pre-COVID pandemic. So this digital footprint is something that we are investing heavily in China to continue to innovate, continue to rapidly deploy it, engage our customers, and then we've expanded it as well, we now sit across all of Alibaba's platforms, as well as the WeChat platform for delivery. And as part of that we just introduced social gifting for delivery on the WeChat platform. So really building out that footprint in a big way. Starbucks now exists in 98% of our stores in China. And then the delivery program itself sits in 84% of our footprint in China, covering all our customers. So digital is a big piece. The other piece that's emerging is health and wellness. And we've launched the good campaign earlier this year, which is our plant based beverages, as well as food offerings. And in particular, we're seeing great success with oat milk, and the success that that's having. And you're seeing this thirst from our customers around healthy options for themselves. So the team is working hard to develop those. And then obviously, on the store piece, it's the third place environment, how do we continue to innovate around the third place environment, whether it is the now store, but then also how are our reserve store showing up? And how are we continuing to elevate that brand because a third place is still very, very relevant in China. Thank you for the question. And as we thought about the evolution of our margins over the course of fiscal \u201821, we've taken into account several things. The first and I would say the most important is how we are rebuilding transactions across the year and how that provides us. The sales leverage that is we've earned here in recent months is so important to our ability to drive improved profitability of our business, we further break that down into, which channel it's coming through, and what the implications are, for average spend, and then how we see our mix, further shifting. So we have taken that into account, as we've thought through, this range of 16% to 17%, overall operating margin for the company for the entire fiscal year, recognizing that we will be below the bottom end of that range in the first half of the year, and then above the top end of that range in the latter half of the year. And that takes into account not only the progression of our sales recovery, but importantly, how we are rebuilding margin while continuing to make investments, that the investments are pretty substantial. Just as we invested heavily through the depths of the crisis, we have some pretty significant investments planned for fiscal \u201821, behind the things that really drive our business. So we're thinking about what is needed for the long-term to strengthen key points of competitive advantage to unlock future sales growth. And that starts with our partners. So we've planned substantial investments behind the enhanced partner wages and benefits. We've planned very substantial investments in technology in order to extend the strength and the growth of our digital platform and how that contributes to our business in ways that both John and Roz have articulated. And then finally, we're making incremental investments behind our bold ambitions and environmental sustainability. Those things tend to be, offsets to the sales leverage that we realize as we go as we re-grow our business. And then also, the ongoing efficiencies that we gain through operating productivity in our stores, as well as ongoing supply chain efficiencies. So it truly is a mix of sales growth, the composition of that growth in terms of how we see both ticket and transactions evolving over the course of the year and then taking into consideration the investments necessary to strengthen the brand for the long-term because we know those investments are important to maintain those key points of competitive advantage. I think Kevin said it really well, in terms of the level of resilience that we've built into our business, which gives us the ability to manage much more effectively going forward. And we have seen examples already, just in the last couple of quarters, whether in Beijing, in Dalian in China or as well as in States like California, Texas, and Florida in the U.S., when each case we've been able to work with local authorities adjust their store operations as needed. And we found that the operational disruption of these second wave so to speak is less severe than the initial wave in terms of the depth of impact and its duration. Now, if in fact, we see a more significant impact goes beyond our ability to manage, as Kevin has described through our ability to dial up and dial back, then I would expect that there would be some margin compression, we will do our best as we did through the depths of the pandemic, to slow discretionary spending, where it makes sense to slow CapEx, where it makes sense, but we are absolutely committed to making the investments that we know are essential to our ability to strengthen our brand positioning, to strengthen our key points of competitive advantage, they're going to put us in the best position to unlock the full value of the Starbucks brand for the long-term. And we have the, the financial ability, we have the balance sheet, to continue to make those investments as we did, and ensure that for the long-term, we are the best position in the category."

            "name": "John Culver",
            "content": "Yes, Jeffrey. For China, we actually have accelerated store growth. And we had a record quarter open 259 stores in Q4. And feel very good about our year-over-year growth in the store count perspective at 14%. We do see a pathway back to getting back to the historical levels. We're guiding to the 600, but we're continuing to look for new opportunities to go faster, where it makes sense. At the same time, we're innovating from a concept standpoint with Starbucks now, and the acceleration of that and we're encouraged by what we're seeing thus far. And then if you look at the new stores and the performance overall, we are seeing, emerging back into those historical return trends. And that gives us a lot of room for optimism in terms of the store growth model. So we are fully committed to accelerating growth, we're going to be opportunistic about it, we believe in the number that we're committed to and where we can get back more, we will go after it. We've had ongoing discussions with landlords as part of that. And they're looking to partner with us for the relevant sites, and continuing to grow our business. So for us, we will continue to push hard on store development. It accounts for roughly 75% to 80% of our total revenue growth. So we see this as a big piece, given the long runway we see there. Yes, let me just pick up a little bit on what Roz was talking about. We are seeing rapid growth and shared gains for Starbucks down the aisle. And Kevin highlighted in it that we saw the packaged coffee business here in the U.S. grows 17% in the quarter far outpacing the category at 9% growth. So we're getting more than our fair share that growth in terms of the share growth that we're seeing the Starbucks brand grew 130 basis points. Our roasting ground share on Starbucks grow 160 and our cake cup share grew 40 basis points. And then that also translates over into RTD and in RTD we saw considerable growth there. And in particular, strong share gains, both across the addressable RTD coffee category at 50 basis points, chilled coffee at 230 basis points gain and a shelf stable RTD coffee at 140 basis points gain. So as consumers are shifting, Starbucks is available and they're consuming it in their home and they're turning to us."

            "name": "Kevin Johnson",
            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. 2020 has been an extraordinary year. As together, everyone on this planet has been navigating a global pandemic and all of the implications that come along with it. This shared experience gives us much to reflect upon, learn from and be inspired by. I'm very proud of how Starbucks partners responded, pulling together to support one another, creating safe that familiar experiences for our customers and serving communities. Starbucks partners who probably wear the green apron have been at the forefront of these efforts and I am enormously grateful for the courage, compassion and dedication that they've shown throughout this churn. They inspire me and fuel my positive outlook for the future. There are three words that I hope you take away from today's call, confidence, resilience and optimism. Let me explain. First, in the most dynamic of times, Starbucks is consistently executing. Our recovery is progressing extremely well as evidenced by better-than-expected sales and profits in the fourth quarter which gives us great confidence going forward. Second, we have accelerated several growth strategies and are innovating rapidly to adapt to new customer behaviors and preferences building a new level of resilience for the future. And third, Starbucks partners have risen to the occasion which coupled with an innovation agenda that elevates the customer experience, introduces exciting new beverages and extends our digital customer relationships, leaves us very well positioned, and gives me a tremendous sense of optimism for fiscal '21 and the future of the Starbucks Coffee Company. In these unprecedented times, Starbucks is more focused than ever on making the investments necessary to position our brand and our Company our long-term success. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing behind our best-in-class digital ecosystem and aligning our product portfolio store base and partner-led customer experience with evolving preferences and consumption patterns. Our track record of delivering across these areas underpins the resilience of our business during this pandemic and will support Starbucks continued leadership. Let me begin in the U.S. I could not be more pleased with our U.S. sales recovery which progress faster than we anticipated in our final quarter of fiscal 2020. We finished the quarter with the comparable store sales decline of 4% for the month of September, a vast improvement from the approximately 65% decline we experienced at the depth of the pandemic only five months ago. Fourth quarter comparable store sales declined 9% in the U.S. relative to the same quarter in the prior year well above the better end of our guidance range. Importantly, transaction volumes in the U.S. climbed steadily throughout the quarter as we methodically and carefully restored in-store seating with approximately 63% of our U.S. stores offering limited seating as we exited the quarter. Ticket growth was relatively stable across the quarter at approximately 20% remaining meaningfully above historical levels aided by continued strength in our drive-through channel where customers tend to place larger orders. Central to the strength of our U.S. recovery has been a relentless focus on rapid innovation, adapting and adjusting to new customer behaviors while continuing to drive the three strategies that are fundamental to our Growth at Scale agenda, elevating the customer experience, driving relevant beverage innovation and expanding digital customer engagement. The first pillar of our Growth at Scale strategy, customer experience is a key competitive differentiator for Starbucks and something that is paying dividends as customers now more than ever are seeking the comfort and care that Starbucks uniquely provides. As customers continue to adapt to work from home and study from home realities, they create safe, familiar and convenient experiences, and have shifted their buying behavior accordingly. And we've adapted rapidly to meet those evolving needs. Broadly speaking we've seen U.S. transactions migrate from dense metro centers to the suburbs, from cafes to drive-throughs, from early mornings to mid mornings with outpaced recovery on the weekends. We've adjusted our operations to match these new customer behavior patterns including multiple, new protocols to provide a safe experience for our partners and customers. And this has resulted in customer connection scores, which are well above prior year levels. By caring for our partners since the start of this pandemic, providing them with economic certainty at a time of great vulnerability, we successfully maintained very high levels of partner engagement and this is paying off in the form of high quality customer experiences. Those best moment that inspired Starbucks customers to continue coming back. As evidence of these traffic shifts, U.S. sales comps were solidly positive for our drive-through locations and suburban stores for the fourth quarter and the month of September, respectively. Although this was offset by negative sales comps in our debt metro stores, particularly on week days, those numbers reflect the fact that approximately 3% of our stores were temporarily closed across the entire quarter, effectively weighing down the market comp by about 2 percentage points. To increase throughput and accommodate higher transaction volumes at our suburban locations, we've rolled out curbside pickup to approximately 800 U.S. company-operated locations and are on track to be a nearly 2,000 stores across the U.S. by the end of fiscal 2021. We've also introduced handheld point of sale devices to about 100 stores with the goal of deploying these devices to approximately 400 additional stores by the end of Q1. And we are continuing to restore in-store seating across all of our stores in the U.S. as conditions allow. Building on the strength of our customer experience, differentiated products continue to be an important traffic driver as well encompassing seasonal favorites as well as new innovations. The re-launch of our Pumpkin Spice platform in late August was a catalyst to our Q4 results. With Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew which was first offered last year actually outselling Pumpkin Spice Latte this season leading the entire Pumpkin platform to a record high in average daily units. Our cold beverages continue to resonate with customers led by Starbucks Refreshers and Cold Brew with both delivered, delivering double-digit growth in Q4 and void by positive year-over-year growth in beverages. These results reflect not only the appeal of our products, but also the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns which reinforce the trust and familiarity of the Starbucks brand at a time when customers are craving our return to normalcy. And finally, as customers are increasingly seeking convenient and contactless experiences, our expanding drive-through presence and industry leading mobile platform, our primary vehicles to increasing convenience and digital customer engagement have been instrumental to the strength of our recovery. As evidence of this, approximately 75% of U.S. sales volume in Q4 was drive-through and mobile orders. Although this was meaningfully down from 90% in Q3, reflecting a sizable shift to on-premise occasions in Q4. As we progressively restored seating in our cafes, this is notably higher than pre-COVID levels at approximately 60% of sales. Moreover, our mobile order transactions continue to grow, increasing from 18% in Q2 to 24% in Q4 aided by continued improvements to our mobile app as well as an increased messaging across our marketing channels to drive further awareness introducing more customers to our mobile app which drove engagement to mobile order and benefited us operationally. Of course, another key driver of increased digital customer engagement is our Starbucks Rewards program. In Q4, Starbucks Rewards drove 47% of U.S. company operated tender for a second consecutive quarter, up from 43% in our fiscal Q1 prior to the onset of COVID-19. Importantly, Starbucks Rewards contribution improved throughout the quarter and returned to pre-COVID levels mainly driven by recovery in member spend and higher mobile order and pay usage, as I outlined previously. Additionally, our 90-day active rewards member base increased by 3 million members in Q4 approaching pre-COVID levels at $19.3 million, up 10% from the prior year. The successful launch of Stars for Everyone in mid-September was a key highlight in the quarter. The momentum we saw and the number of customers who downloaded the Starbucks app in Q3 continued throughout Q4 and the number of active customers who joined the Starbucks Rewards program grew slightly in Q4 relative to Q3, likely helped by the late quarter launch of Stars for everyone. These early results indicate that the flexibility of rewards payment options, including the removal of the stored value card requirement to earn stars is resonating with customers. This gives us optimism regarding our ability to meaningfully grow the number of 90 day active Starbucks Rewards members in fiscal 2021. Before moving on from our U.S. business, I'd like to remind you that as we announced in June, we are in the midst of accelerating the transformation of our dense metro business by closing lower performing stores while continuing to capture that traffic where customers need us to be, including existing drive-through stores, new formats, such as curbside and more efficient Starbucks pickup locations. We expect much of this work to be completed in the next 12 to 18 months. At the same time, we remain focused on our strategy of developing drive-through locations largely in suburban and semi-rural locations, extending the reach of the Starbucks brand with high volume, high margin stores providing our customers the convenience they are seeking. We continue to grow our delivery business through our partnership with Uber Eats providing customers the ultimate form of convenience. I cannot be more excited about the upward trajectory and level of innovation, we're seeing in our U.S. business. I'll now move on to China, our second lead growth market. Building on the positive momentum in Q3, China demonstrated sequential improvements in monthly comparable store sales across Q4 delivering minus 3% for the quarter. This was in line with our expectations led by initiatives very similar to what I described in the U.S., outstanding customer experience, new product innovation, notably, our new tea cloud platform and continued expansion of our digital platform, but what's most remarkable about the recovery in China, in my view is the rapid reacceleration of new store development which is our number one driver of growth in China. I'm pleased to say that despite the challenging environment imposed by the pandemic, we crossed both the 4,600 and the 4,700 store milestone in Q4, opening almost 260 stores in the fourth quarter alone. That's an impressive 581 stores or 14% growth in the last 12 months. This is an incredible achievement by the team considering, we temporarily paused new store development activity in China for a couple of months starting in late January. Our disciplined approach to store development is paying off as these new stores are off to a strong start with early returns substantially in line with pre-COVID levels. As part of our store development program in China, the local team has innovated a new retail format that caters to the need state of convenience. Starbucks Now which is very similar to Starbucks Pickups in the U.S. With speed and agility Starbucks China opened 40 New stores in fiscal 2020 with the presence in nine Chinese cities. Early results are very encouraging. And the team is increasing the pace of development for this innovative concept. On the digital front, we saw continued strength in our mobile platform in China with mobile order sales mix more than doubling in the past 12 months to 26% in Q4, with 13% coming from delivery and 13% from Mobile Order & Pay well above the mid-teen levels we saw pre-COVID. The digital innovations we launched in China throughout fiscal 2020, including a new WeChat Mini program and the enhanced Starbucks Rewards program along with our digital partnership with Alibaba has fueled customer engagement and strong sequential growth in active Starbucks Rewards members. In Q4, China's 90-day active members increased 36% over Q3 to 13.5 million representing 34% growth over the prior year. As of the U.S. business, I'm incredibly proud of the continued recovery and industry leading innovation in China. The customer trends we are seeing in specialty retail extend to Coffee at Home, where demand remains elevated through the pandemic. We are applying our innovation mindset and agility to our Channel Development business to capture share in at-home coffee and to maximize reach of the Starbucks brand across all channels and platforms. In the U.S., Starbucks share of total package coffee grew significantly in Q4 with 17% growth in dollar sales outpacing the coffee category, which grew 9% in the quarter. Consumption of our domestic, ready to drink coffee products grew 15% in Q4, somewhat offsetting this strength was softness in the foodservice business as offices, hotels, colleges and entertainment centers continue to experience low levels of traffic. Through the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle, we accelerated growth and innovation, while maintaining our commitment to sustainability in Q4, including the introduction of non-dairy Starbucks Creamers with 100% recyclable packaging to our full portfolio of at-home products. We entered nine new markets in the quarter, bringing Starbucks at-home coffee presence through the Global Coffee Alliance to 62 markets in just 24 months. We also continue to meet customers where they are through our global ready to drink portfolio. Notably, the continued performance of ready-to-drink Nitro Cold Brew, the number 1 innovation in the category this year. Exceeding expectations. Overall, we are very pleased with the accelerated expansion of the Starbucks brand around the world through the channel business. This is truly a brand amplifier. In summary, the Starbucks brand is stronger than ever. Our business recovery is progressing well, and through rapid innovation, we've built a new level of resilience for the future. We believe that the investments we made to protect our partners well-being and provide them with economic certainty combined with our principled approach to decision-making and transparency of our communications have built trust with all stakeholders and will pay dividends long into the future. I open my remarks by suggesting three words for you to take away from this call, confidence in our strategy, resilience built from our innovation agility that continues to drive our business recovery and optimism about fiscal '21 and the future of Starbucks. I close by adding one additional word for all Starbucks stakeholders to take away from today, gratitude. None of this would have been possible without the positive spirit and incredibly hard work of our 400,000 green apron partners around the world who serve our customers each day. They live our Company mission and values every day. Partners are the heartbeat of Starbucks and they fill me with gratitude and inspiration. Thank you, partners. Let me now hand the call over to Pat to discuss our financial performance for Q4 and fiscal 2020 as well as our guidance for fiscal year '21. Pat? Thanks, John. We'll hand that to Pat to handle that. Thanks, Jeffrey. I'll hand over to John Culver. John you would take that. Hey Roz, you want to take that? Pat once you start and let Roz then add some color to it. I will ask Roz you add some color on the action that you think drove that and Pat and follow up on David second question. Yes, Chris, this is Kevin. Let me comment and I'll see if Roz and John want to add but. Clearly, right now, what the data is telling us and what we've optimized around our experiences that are safe, familiar and convenient. And clearly in the pandemic and part of this is our artificial intelligence tools are monitoring customer behavior and partner sentiment along with data that's fed to us on the spread of COVID to give us insight at a per store level. But the safe familiar and convenient is kind of the three terms that we would characterize globally that customers are looking for. And that's why number one, we've deployed these safety protocols consistently throughout our stores, we know how to if we can turn the dial up and open more seating or open other channels we do we have to turn the dial back in a market or near a store where the virus is spreading, we know how to do that and we know how to do that at a store level, community level. The convenient part is artificial intelligence tools and the data has shown us if we enable the channels of convenience, that Roz and John both described in the U.S. and China, whether it's drive-thru, mobile order for pickup, mobile or for delivery, curbside, we enable those channels and then we find ways to increase the throughput in those channels Roz mentioned increasing, the out the window time at drive-thru. A lot of that's been determined by we know if we add this handheld point of sale in a drive-thru line and we go out in the line we can speed up the ordering process which helps us then better serve customers. So the data is helping us understand where we have opportunities to \u2013 well, first of all, it helps us understand consumer behavior so that we can get the themes that we have to focus on. When we focus on specific areas of that customer experience that data is helping inform us where we're making progress and where we're unlocking new opportunities for comp growth. And we're doing that across certainly across the USA and China and then leveraging that to help us rest of world. Roz, maybe your job if you have other things you want to add. I'll give you an opportunity to comment. Roz, you want to take that? Well, thanks for the question. I'll kind of go back to some data we shared on the addressable market of coffee in our last investor conference. And if you recall, the projection was that the addressable market of coffee was going to be growing at roughly a 5% CAGR year-after-year and where I think there was probably a little bit of a blip back in March and April, during the period that where people were sheltering at home. I don't think that has slowed down the growth for the addressable market of coffee. So if the question is do we believe the market for coffee is going to is growing and going to continue to grow? The answer is yes. Then the second part is how are we doing on gaining share, I think is John Culver highlighted when you when you look at home coffee, clearly the data that we're getting from down the aisle is we are growing significant share in a rapidly growing market for at home coffee. And if you look at, we've tracked over the last several months where we've grown our same-store comparables in the U.S. on a sequential basis. And we track that we have regained some substantial portion of the share that that we probably gave back when we shut down all of our stores in April. So I think we are in a growing addressable market of coffee, I think we are in a share taking position, I think the investments that we are making for trade area transformation, and everything that we have done to tune the customer experience, the beverage innovation and our digital customer relationships, we are poised for ongoing share gains in a growing addressable market for coffee. Katherine, let me comment, then I'll hand over to Pat to add to this. First of all, one of the things when I talked about in my comments about resilience, what I believe to be true is we have developed these store protocols that now has been embedded in the operation processes for how we run our Starbucks stores around the world. And those store protocols have been -- they are enabling us to operate in the world of COVID. And so even in the world of COVID, where in certain markets is the curve is increasing. In other markets, the curve is flattening, we've been able to see sequential improvements in same-store comparables, and I attribute that to the fact that those store protocols, we've now operationalized, we know how to keep our partner safe, we know how to serve coffee to our customers in our store and keep our customers safe. And we are staying true to what to what really drove the turnaround of this company over the last two or three years, which is elevating the customer experience, relevant beverage innovation and digital customer relationships. So if I look at what's, you think about what could unfold over the next year. So we're operating in this environment. And I feel very confident we know how to do that, because we've built this new level of resilience throughout the company to do that, that said, the investments many of the investments Pat has described are long-term investments that are going to pay great returns for shareholders, years to come. So for us, it's more about are we building long term shareholder value versus -- are we, are we having to tune those investments quarter-to-quarter now we have some flexibility in that. But at the end of the day, we want to play the long game. And we are so well positioned right now, in my opinion, because we have now adapted the way we operate the company for this world of COVID. We've identified the shifts in consumer behavior, we're rapidly adapting to that new reality, we're investing ahead of that curve in a growing addressable market for coffee. And that just positions us to come out of this gaining massive amounts of share, creating significant shareholder value. And so we're operating playing the long game. Now that said, I'll let Pat comment on, the part of your question that said, hey, if we hit, some unforeseen things, how much flexibility do we have on the cost side? So Pat? Yes, thanks. Roz once you go first and then and then let me add a thought. Yes, and I'll just add that, certainly what we've done with stars for everyone in the investments, we're making a digital that's all about long-term, growth and relationships. That's why we launched stars for everyone. We're tracking the number of new app downloads each week. And we've seen that spike we track the number of new rewards customers, we sign up, we see in that go up, we track the number of inactive rewards that members that we convert to active rewards members. So that expanded customer reach digitally is going to be a huge asset, even I'll say post-COVID or post-vaccine. But the fact that we're focusing on customer experience, beverage innovation, in addition to digital is important for the following reason. People are craving, the opportunity to socialize right now. And they can't, everyone's being careful working from home schooling from home being cautious when they go out. So safe, familiar and convenient is important right now. But once there's a vaccine therapeutics that now allow people to feel more comfortable socializing, and being part of a community, we predict there's going to be a huge, huge demand for that third place experience again. That seating in those stores and people coming to enjoy their beverage and their food with others and socialize in our stores and be a part of the community once but this is down the road, when there's vaccine and therapeutics there's going to be, a huge, huge wave of demand for that. And so not only are we laying the foundation, with the digital relationships and taking care of our customers with safe, familiar, convenient, but we are also investing in ensuring that when that demand unfolds, that third place experience will be at the pinnacle of serving those customers who want to come and be a part of a community and socialize again, because that's what -- that's something that we all aspire for. Yes, just reinforce what Roz said, when we opened the cafe for limited seating, the response is immediate. And the impact on same-store comp is immediate. Customers are craving that and we do it in a safe way. And as long as we continue to stay true to our principles about prioritizing the health and well-being of our Starbucks partners and the customers we serve. And partnering with local health officials to help mitigate contain the spread of the virus, and showing up in a positive and responsible way and the communities we serve as long as we stay true to those principles, provide that great experience and do it in a safe way and continue to innovate with relevant new beverages, and expand digital. We are well positioned. And we know how to do this. Well, thank you, everyone. As we conclude the call today, I want to thank you all again for joining us. As always, we're committed to leading into the future and communicating with all of you transparently and communicating with all our stakeholders, transparency, balancing our company's purpose and profit, and keeping you informed of our aspirations and the progress along the way. To that end, we look forward to hosting you soon and talking about our path forward at our virtual December 9 Investor Day. And we hope you can all join us virtually for that. And we want to take this opportunity to wish you and your families a Happy Halloween and warm wishes for the holiday season ahead. And yes, holiday season is upon us. And next week, our peppermint mocha returns for its 18th year alongside an exciting holiday menu in our stores. So we hope to see you at Starbucks where we were going to create that safe, familiar and convenient experience for each of you in our stores or at the curbside or at the drive-thru window whatever fits your needs. And we hope to bring a little holiday spark to you and your loved ones in the weeks ahead. So thanks for joining us."

Finally, for your calendar planning purposes, please note that our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call has been tentatively scheduled for Thursday, October 29, 2020. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.\nKevin Johnson: Well, good afternoon, and welcome. Thank you for joining us today. It\u2019s been three months since our last earnings call as the entire world, all of humanity has been navigating the COVID-19 pandemic through this very dynamic and challenging period. In times of adversity, values matter. And I\u2019m very proud of how Starbucks partners around the world have responded during this global pandemic. United by our mission and values and guided by three simple principles. Prioritizing the health and well being of Starbucks partners and the customers we serve. Supporting local government and health officials as they work to mitigate and contain the virus. And showing up in a responsible and positive way in each and every community we serve. The dedication, agility and positive energy of our partners inspires me. And for that, I am grateful. Throughout this dynamic period, I believe the combination of principal decision making and transparency in our communication has built trust, trust with all stakeholders. We provided Starbucks partners economic certainty through the shutdown, while prioritizing their health. As we reopen stores, we created safe, familiar and convenient experiences for our customers. We remain committed to doing so as we adapt the store portfolio to cater to evolving patterns of consumer behavior, including on-the-go consumption, mobile order and pickup, drive through and contactless pickup and delivery in accordance with our multi-year strategy, which has been further validated by the unfortunate dynamics created by COVID-19. We showed up in the community to provide free coffee to the frontline healthcare workers who have been caring for those in need. We collaborated with our suppliers. And every step of the way we supported our global license partners in markets around the world. With the strong balance sheet, we took appropriate steps to ensure liquidity and maintained our quarterly dividend payment to shareholders, while maintaining flexibility for the future. And we did all of this while continuing to advance our long-term strategy to position Starbucks for continued success. Trust is earned. And building trust with all stakeholders is a very important attribute of Starbucks. I believe the significant investments we made this quarter have inspired Starbucks partners, strengthened customer loyalty and will pay dividends long into the future as the Starbucks brand is stronger than ever. On today\u2019s call, I will summarize the business recovery results that we are driving as we navigate the current situation and how we are rapidly adapting our business for this new reality. My hope is that from this call you understand and take away two important points. First, our recovery plan is working. With the vast majority of stores around the world now reopened, we saw meaningful improvements in both sales and profitability as the quarter unfolded. Additionally, customer affinity for Starbucks is very strong, as demonstrated by improvements in our customer connection scores, growth in customer loyalty and market share gains. While we anticipate these improvements to continue, our balance sheet and the strategic actions we have taken to position Starbucks to weather a more protracted disruption in global economic activity. And second, in response to clear shifts in consumer behavior and preferences, we are now accelerating strategic initiatives for the future and positioning Starbucks for continued, long-term growth. We have moved aggressively to advance our evolution of the store base, to accommodate trends that we have long seen emerging in our business that were only exacerbated by COVID-19. When taken together, these two points indicate a bright future ahead for all stakeholders of the Starbucks Coffee Company. Let me begin in the U.S. where the recovery accelerated throughout Q3. We exited the quarter with 96% of stores open, up from 44% at the beginning of the quarter. With health and well being top of mind, we monitored trends and quickly adapted to support our partners and serve our customers safely and responsibly. Through a combination of new store operating protocols and service channels, we were able to amplify a number of contactless experiences for our customers, including drive-through, entryway pickup with mobile order-and-pay and delivery. And with new proprietary data-driven decision tools that monitor public health conditions, government guidelines, customer preferences and partner sentiment in real-time, we were able to gradually and safely reopen a select number of our U.S. stores for limited seating experiences, expanding to nearly 30% of our U.S. company-operated stores by the end of the quarter. As a result, weekly U.S. comps steadily improved throughout the quarter from the low point, a decline of minus 65% in mid-April up to minus 16% as we exited Q3. And through all of this, we posted all-time high customer connection scores. Looking specifically at the comps of the 3,100 U.S. stores that remained open throughout the entire quarter, those stores improved sequentially from minus 14% comp in May to minus 1% in June to a positive 2% comp for July month-to-date. We have now developed new levels of agility and resilience that position us well for the future with the mindset and capability to safely, effectively and confidently drive our continued recovery. We recognize that markets will experience varying levels of COVID-19 impact until new therapeutics and vaccines are developed, and we are well-positioned to navigate this phase of the pandemic. Today, customers are seeking safe, familiar and convenient experiences in many aspects of their lives. And in that regard, our digital assets have proven to be a competitive advantage. Within the quarter, we saw significant acceleration in the number of customers who downloaded the Starbucks App and joined Starbucks Rewards, totaling 3 million in the quarter and up 17% from Q2. Additionally, engagement with Starbucks Rewards customers outpaced non-Starbucks Rewards members with year-over-year sales growth from Starbucks Rewards customers turning positive in early July. As a result, Starbucks Rewards as a percentage of tender in Q3, rose 4 percentage points from a year ago to 46%, which is above the pre-COVID tread, highlighting our success in acquiring new loyalty members as well as re-engaging our existing customer base. And finally, customer usage of mobile ordering increased to 22% of total transactions, up 6 percentage points from a year ago. Although, our digital platform continues to be a source of strength, disruption to the weekday morning routines, notably, commuting to work and school is a headwind we are focused on across the U.S. as we continue to recover our business. We continue to see improvements in the morning peak period as well as some customer occasions shifting to later in the morning daypart. As we see customer visits shifting from urban cafes to suburban drive-throughs, customers are also purchasing multiple beverages and food items on a single order, essentially a group order. These dynamics have contributed to a meaningful increase in average spend per order compared to pre-pandemic levels, leading to 25% average ticket comp growth for the quarter. As we reopen stores to include mobile orders, entryway pickup and in-store to-go orders, ticket growth moderated and transaction volume increased as the quarter unfolded. Almost 90% of sales volumes in Q3 flow through the combination of drive-through and mobile order-and-pay. In addition, with national coverage in the U.S., Starbucks Delivers transactions tripled in Q3 from Q2 levels, with the highest volume in the late morning and mid-day. All of this indicates that customers are adapting their routines, and we are well-positioned to drive further recovery by simply increasing throughput and enhancing those safe, familiar and convenient experiences customers desire. As I will discuss in greater detail later, that is why we are accelerating innovative store formats, like Starbucks Pickup and new operating protocols, such as curbside delivery as they align closely with the customer preferences that have evolved as a result of COVID-19. Let me now move on to China where at the end of Q3, 99% of stores had reopened with approximately 90% having regular operating hours and over 70% having full seating. Building on the positive recovery momentum from Q2, China demonstrated sequential improvements in monthly comparable sales across Q3, exceeding our expectations for the quarter. In addition to comp sales recovery, we reignited new store development, crossing the 4,400 store milestone with the opening of almost 100 net new stores in the quarter. Mobile order sales mix reached 23% of sales in Q3 with 12% coming from delivery and 11% from mobile order-and-pay, well above the mid-teens levels we saw pre-COVID. As digital adoption accelerates in China, we continue to innovate in ways that deepen customer relationships and extend the reach of the Starbucks experience across a variety of digital platforms and ecosystems. In May, we launched a new WeChat Mini program with new functionality for WeChat users, including Starbucks Delivers. And in June, we enhanced the Starbucks Rewards program, introducing a multi-tier redemption system, similar to what we rolled out in the U.S. last year. Fueled by these new digital initiatives, we have seen strong sequential growth in active rewards members. In fact, the Q3 90-day active members increased 25% over Q2 to 9.9 million, representing 9% growth over the prior year. We are pleased with the progress we are making in China to recover sales. However, we are reminded by the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Beijing, and the corresponding actions taken to mitigate the spread that our new normal requires us to monitor the situation in every community, rapidly adapt and innovate in ways that continue to bring more customers into our stores and increase the frequency of those visits. With the differentiated capabilities and strategic advantages we enjoy in China, including our digital partnership with Alibaba and our access to emerging technologies through our co-investment relationship with Sequoia Capital, we are confident that we will substantially recover our sales in China by the end of this calendar year, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand in our fastest growing market. Moving to Channel Development. This has been a quarter where demand for at-home coffee has soared, and our Channel Development business has demonstrated tremendous resilience and gained market share as customers adjust to their at-home routines. In the U.S., Starbucks share of total packaged coffee grew significantly in Q3. 21% growth in dollar sales, outpacing the coffee category, which grew 13% in the quarter. Our domestic ready-to-drink business grew by 11%, gaining 2 points of share in Q3. Our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle combined with our ready-to-drink partners, including PepsiCo and Tingyi, have extended our ability to meet customers where they are, which is particularly important in the current environment. We are now in 53 markets with the Global Coffee Alliance, more than tripling our at-home coffee presence versus a year ago. And we expect to be in over 60 markets by the end of this fiscal year. With our near-term business recovery fully in motion and delivering results, let me now focus on how we are leveraging this disruptive period to accelerate value-creating initiatives that further differentiate Starbucks and fuel predictable, sustainable, long-term growth. Why is this important? In every industry there are periods of disruption that create great opportunity for those businesses that adapt to the disruption, invest in relevant ways and strengthen their differentiation and competitive advantage. Those businesses that fail to evolve, typically fall behind. Given the strength of our brand, our advanced digital capabilities and our strong balance sheet, I believe this is one of those rare opportunities to move aggressively and further differentiate Starbucks from our competition, and I will highlight three areas where we are doing just that. Convenience store formats, digital customer engagement and plant-based menu items. Over the years, we have demonstrated a clear track record of re-imagining store formats to better serve customers. And we are now re-imagining how we further elevate the customer experience by leveraging these various store formats to create a network of stores in a community. Think of this as blending highly complementary store formats throughout a community that collectively better serve the expanding and shifting need states of customers in that community. And thus, increasing revenue in the trade area, while optimizing profitability and investment returns. We have been blending store formats in suburban markets for years where we have complemented traditional Starbucks stores, the third place experience, with drive-through and mobile order pickup experiences that serve customers\u2019 need for convenience. We are introducing a simple handheld device to further increase throughput and improve the customer experience. And we are introducing a new curbside pickup experience that will be available in 700 to 1,000 locations by the end of this quarter, which enables incremental customer business. In urban core markets where drive-throughs and curbside aren\u2019t feasible, we will begin to reposition our store formats to create a blend of traditional Starbucks stores with new Starbucks Pickup stores. These stores are built in a smaller footprint and create a familiar and convenient walk-through experience that is very relevant to customers in urban markets. Each of these Starbucks Pickup stores will ideally be located within a three-minute to five-minute walk from a traditional Starbucks store, giving customers the flexibility to enjoy their beverage in our store or on-the-go. We plan to accelerate the development of over 50 of these stores over the next 12 months to 18 months with a view to have several hundred in the U.S. over the next three years to five years. We have also accelerated the rollout of a similar concept in China, Starbucks Now stores, adding nine new locations in Q3 for a total of 15. We are seeing first-hand the power of integrating physical and digital customer touch points to meet customers\u2019 growing need for convenience. In addition to accelerating our store transformation strategy, we are creating new capabilities that expand digital customer engagement. We\u2019re having great success bringing new customers onto the app and into the rewards program. We will build on this momentum in the fall when we introduce a new pay-as-you-go option for Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. and Canada. This significant new addition will open up an invitation to join Starbucks Rewards to a much wider audience. While nearly half of our sales now comes from Rewards members who are pre-loading their store value cards, we\u2019ve heard from many more customers that they would like an option to earn rewards when paying directly with cash, credit, debit and select digital wallets. By adding this capability to Starbucks Rewards, we will give customers more ways to pay and earn rewards when using the Starbucks App. In China, since we began our China digital partnership with Alibaba two years ago, we\u2019ve worked together to deliver innovative digital services to our customers and transform to coffee industry in China. As part of our ongoing partnership, we are expanding our reach to customers across the Chinese Mainland by introducing the Starbucks Now mobile order-and-pay feature to multiple platforms in the Alibaba Digital Economy, including Taobao, Digital Mapping, an information provider and map, local services app Qbay and Alipay, which serve a combined user base of nearly 1 billion customers. Through these apps, customers will be able to pre-order and pay for their favorite Starbucks beverage and food online and then pickup in-person at most Starbucks stores across the Chinese Mainland. Previously, this service was only available through our Starbucks China Mobile App. This is a significant step forward, and we value our partnership with Alibaba greatly. We are listening to our customers and continually seeking ways to make Starbucks more relevant, inviting and uplifting through personalized human connection, the seamless link between the customer experience we create in our stores and the power of the digital customer relationships. Finally, our recent announcements of plant-based beverage and food innovation through partnerships with Beyond Meat, Impossible and Oatly, reflect the fact that customers want more plant-based options. We believe that customers are embracing plant-based choices because they are good, good. Good for your health and good for the planet. We are shifting more beverage and food menu items to include plant-based options. Recent examples include Cold Brew with Cinnamon Almondmilk Foam in the U.S. And Oat Milk versions of two signature Starbucks beverages in China, Oat Milk Latte and Oat Milk Matcha Latte. Early results from these innovations are very encouraging. We are accelerating efforts to expand these offerings for our customers. And in the process, making meaningful progress against our planet positive goals. Let me close by reinforcing two key messages, I hope you take away from this call. First, our recovery strategy is working, as evidenced by the improving business results across all of our key segments. Second, we have future-proofed our business model and reinforced our balance sheet to enable us to play offense by accelerating key strategic initiatives that further differentiate Starbucks and reinforced the long-term sustainable growth opportunity ahead. Those two points reinforce an optimistic view of our future. Before we conclude this call, I want to thank you all for joining us today. The last several months have been quite unprecedented in regard to public health and commerce given the impacts of COVID-19. Simultaneously, there is a powerful awakening underway in America to address systemic racism and social inequality, issues that Starbucks has always embraced, believing that we have a role and responsibility to advance positive change. That has never been more true than it is today. The mission and values that unite Starbucks partners continue to help us navigate these complex times and inspire us to promote equity, create opportunities and build resilient communities. And building upon the deliberate actions we have taken to provide a warm, welcoming and safe environment for everyone, our work will not end. This is who we are at our core. And it is what our partners and customers expect of us. I again thank all Starbucks partners. Your commitment, dedication and caring for one another as well as our customers and the communities in which we operate through this pandemic is heartwarming. You are the heartbeat of Starbucks, and I am proud to work in service of you. As always, we look forward to bringing you along our journey to create opportunities and strengthen our communities. Thank you for your time and attention today and for your ongoing support. Now, over to Pat.\nPat Grismer: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by echoing Kevin\u2019s appreciation for all Starbucks partners who have worked tirelessly to deliver safe, convenient and familiar experiences for our customers and to support our communities under very challenging circumstances. They are the heartbeat of our company and our inspiration. Although the impacts of COVID-19 weighed heavily on our Q3 financial results, we are encouraged by the fact that our sales and profits across all our operating segments recovered more quickly than we expected, and that our very strong balance sheet has allowed us to make significant and important investments in the business for the long-term, while weathering the pandemic. For the quarter, Starbucks reported global revenue of $4.2 billion, down 38% from the prior year. We estimate the COVID-19 impact on consolidated revenue to be approximately $3.1 billion, primarily due to temporary store closures, restricted sales channels, shortened operating hours and reduced customer traffic. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 was a loss of $0.46, down from a profit of $0.78 in the prior year inclusive of an estimated $1.20 negative impact of COVID-19, which includes flow through on the revenue impact that I noted earlier as well as significant investments that we made in response to the pandemic, which I will outline later. Non-GAAP EPS was considerably better than the preliminary guidance range that we provided in our 8-K on June 10, driven by better than expected sales and margins. I will first provide some highlights of segment operating results and consolidated margin performance for Q3. I will then discuss our guidance for Q4 and fiscal 2020, followed by a preliminary perspective on fiscal 2021. At $2.8 billion revenue for our Americas segment was 40% lower in Q3 than the prior year, largely due to a 41% decline in comparable store sales, including minus 40% in the U.S. We estimate the decline in Americas revenue and operating income attributable to COVID-19 in Q3 to be approximately $2.3 billion and $1.5 billion respectively. This equates to a flow through rate on lost sales of approximately 65% for Q3, which was a significant improvement from Q2, but still materially higher than the 50% variable flow through rate that we typically observe in our business, primarily due to incremental partner support costs, net of certain government stimulus program benefits as well as incremental store operating expenses. Importantly, both sales and profitability trended positively across the quarter with sequential improvements in each month and comparable store sales were towards the better end of our guidance range. The U.S. business posted a comparable sales decline of 19% in June, improving from minus 43% in May, restoring the business to positive profitability for the month. Moving on to International. The segment\u2019s comparable store sales declined by 37% in Q3 relative to the prior year, but exceeded the expectations we shared last month, primarily driven by Japan\u2019s faster than expected pace of sales recovery, boosted by successful seasonal product promotions. The segment\u2019s comparable store sales in Q3 also reflect a 2% benefit related to temporary value-added tax or VAT exemption in China. This benefit was largely offset by traffic softness that emerged in Beijing in the last two weeks of the quarter due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in that city. For the month of June, China\u2019s comparable store sales declined 16% after excluding an 8 percentage point VAT exemption benefit, about half of which was related to a true-up for the first two months of the quarter. This was a notable sequential improvement to May\u2019s comp on a like-for-like basis. For the third quarter, China\u2019s comparable store sales declined 19% including VAT favorability of 4 percentage points. International\u2019s revenue of $950 million in Q3 was a 40% reduction versus the prior year, primarily due to the 37% decline in comparable store sales. Also contributing to the decline were lower product sales to our licensees as a result of lost sales related to the COVID-19 outbreak as well as temporary royalty relief that we granted our international licensees. And there was an additional 2% revenue dilutive impact of transitioning our Thailand business to licensed operations last year. These adverse year-over-year revenue impacts were partially offset by net new store growth of 9% over the past 12 months. We estimate that the COVID-19 impact to decline in International\u2019s Q3 revenue and operating income with approximately $760 million and $420 million respectively. The improvement in International\u2019s flow through rate on lost sales up roughly 55% in Q3 from 60% in Q2 was attributable to favorable items unique to the period, primarily temporary government relief programs, the temporary extension of China loyalty program benefits during the pandemic and limited time rent concessions in both China and Japan. On to Channel Development. Revenue was $447 million in Q3, a decline of 16% from the prior year. When normalizing for the 21% unfavorable impact of lapping, Global Coffee Alliance transition-related items that benefited the prior year, including higher inventory sales as Nestle prepared to fulfill customer orders, Channel Development\u2019s revenue grew 5% in Q3 over the prior year. The growth was driven by strong packaged coffee and single serve product sales, offsetting the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the segment\u2019s foodservice business. Channel Development\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin was 35.6%, an improvement of 120 basis points over the prior year. Normalizing for the 460 basis point impact of the transition activities I just mentioned, Channel Development\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin contracted 340 basis points in Q3. The contraction was due primarily to a business mix shift within Channel Development as well as deleverage on fixed coffee manufacturing costs shared across the company\u2019s operating segments driven by lower retail production volumes, resulting from COVID-19. At the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was minus 12.6% in Q3, down from 18.3% in the prior year. As you would expect, much of the year-over-year reduction in our operating margin was due to sales deleverage as well as incremental expenses to provide a safe experience in our stores, all related to the impacts of COVID-19. We estimate this to be approximately 80% of the margin decline. The remaining 20% primarily reflects substantial and very intentional investments that we are making in the brand and to build trust with key stakeholders, recognizing that these relationships are an essential part of our brand and critical to our ability to not only recover from the effects of the pandemic, but also to strengthen our competitive position for long-term growth. These investments totaled approximately $350 million in the quarter and were focused on three key areas. First, we invested in our partners as they are critical to the Starbucks experience and instrumental to our long-term success. For most of the quarter, including during the period of extensive store closures, we provided our partners with salary, wage and benefits continuation as well as temporary premium pay in the U.S. and Canada for those who work on the front lines of our business and enhanced assistance related to personal care and well being, net of subsidies from certain government stimulus program benefits. This represented about 85% of our total investments for the quarter. Second, we supported our international licensees who are our partners in driving long-term growth globally by temporarily extending more flexible development terms and royalty relief. And third, we helped several strategic suppliers weather this crisis with certain accelerated payments in effect through July. And by honoring minimum supplier commitments during periods of depressed sales volumes so they can sustain the supply of our proprietary products and services in support of our ongoing product innovation. We are fortunate that the scale of our business and the strength of our balance sheet enabled us to invest as we did consistent with our mission and values as a company, while positioning us well for the future. Our $3 billion bond issuance in May enabled us to fund these investments, cover our capital expenditures, pre-fund next year\u2019s bond maturities at attractive rates, and of course, sustain our quarterly dividend payments, honoring our commitment to shareholders. Importantly, as we exited Q3, we were cash flow positive with upward momentum, setting us on a solid path to reduce our financial leverage in future quarters. Moving on to our outlook for Q4 and fiscal 2020, starting with the metric that, in our view, defines recovery for our retail business comparable store sales growth. Globally, we expect comparable store sales for Q4 and for fiscal 2020 to decline between 12% and 17%, demonstrating sustained sequential improvement, including across both of our key markets of the U.S. and China. We also expect Americas and U.S. comparable store sales to be down 12% to 17% for Q4 and for fiscal 2020. While the recent flare-ups of COVID-19 in several parts of the U.S. underscore the persistent uncertainty in our operating environment, we expect continued improvement in our U.S. business in Q4, bolstered by the focused actions that Kevin described in relation to our contactless customer experience, digital capabilities and beverage innovation. Currently, with modified operations and limited cafe seating in nearly 40% of our stores as well as 4% of the portfolio remaining closed, we estimate that our fiscal July comparable store sales for U.S. company-operated locations will be approximately minus 14%, a sequential improvement from the minus 19% that we delivered in June even as we dialed back some of our U.S. operations in response to some regional COVID-19 flare-ups. Moving on to our International segment. With the expectation of COVID-19 impacts continuing to ease in the fourth quarter, particularly in Japan, we now expect International\u2019s comparable store sales to decline between 10% and 15% in Q4, including a 3% favorable VAT impact. For China specifically, we expect Q4 comparable store sales to range between flat and minus 5%. Although this is generally in line with our previous guidance and now reflects both a new tailwind and the new headwind, the new tailwind is the temporary VAT exemption, which I mentioned earlier, benefiting China\u2019s fourth quarter comp sales growth by about 4 percentage points. The new headwind is a combination of factors. First, COVID-related emergency response measures in Beijing where Starbucks currently has over 360 locations. And second, a prolonged slowdown in international and domestic travel, impacting Starbucks locations at China\u2019s airports and tourist venues. For the full fiscal year, we expect China\u2019s comparable store sales to decline in the range of 15% to 20%, including a 2% favorable VAT impact. And for International, we expect full year comparable store sales to decline in the range of 20% to 25% in fiscal 2020, including a 1% favorable VAT impact. As an indication of a continued recovery that we\u2019re seeing in this business, we estimate that China\u2019s comparable store sales growth will decline approximately 12% to 14% for the month of July when excluding a 4 percentage point benefit from the temporary VAT exemption. This is sequentially better than June\u2019s results when China\u2019s comparable store sales growth declined 16% when excluding VAT favorability at 8 percentage points. We expect the VAT exemption will expire at the end of December. Finally, Channel Development. This segment\u2019s revenue is expected to decline between 5% and 6% on a reported basis for the full year and fiscal 2020, relative to the prior year as we lap certain transition items related to the Global Coffee Alliance that benefited the segment\u2019s top-line growth in fiscal 2019. Adding it all up at the enterprise level, globally, we expect revenue to decline between 10% to 15% in Q4 versus the prior year, primarily reflecting the negative impact of COVID-19, which we estimate to range between approximately $1.4 billion to $1.65 billion. We estimate the operating income decline related to COVID-19 to be approximately $850 million to $1.1 billion globally, reflecting a flow through rate of roughly 60% to 65% on lost sales in Q4. This is roughly comparable to the flow through rate that we delivered in Q3 as we expect improved sales leverage in Q4 will be offset by the absence of non-recurring margin benefits that we realized in Q3. With continued sales and margin recovery, we currently expect the business will return to profitability in Q4 with EPS improving very meaningfully compared to Q3. We now expect GAAP EPS in Q4 of $0.06 to $0.21 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.33. This current outlook for Q4, coupled with our better than expected results in Q3, yields a rates to our full year expectations for EPS in fiscal 2020 compared to our prior forecast. We now expect GAAP EPS in fiscal 2020 of $0.50 to $0.65 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 to $0.98. Now I\u2019d like to share some perspective on our U.S. and China recovery curves going forward. Based on what we\u2019ve learned as we\u2019ve navigated the impact of COVID-19 for the past six months as well as the innovations and growth that we planned for next year, and barring any new major and sustained waves of infection and/or global economic disruptions, we anticipate that comparable store sales will substantially recover in China and the U.S. in fiscal 2021 by the end of our first quarters and second quarters respectively. Additionally, we expect that margin recovery for each business will trail sales recovery by about two quarters. As we believe we are now past the depth of the pandemic and are on a steady path to full recovery, and as we successfully bridged our liquidity needs, we will now return to our normal cadence of investor updates and look forward to sharing our continued progress with our fourth quarter earnings report in October. In summary, Starbucks sales and profits are recovering nicely. Our liquidity position remains strong and continues to improve. And we are continuing to invest in growth and the future of our business. It has been a very challenging quarter for Starbucks, as it has for many other businesses, but we believe the worst is behind us. We\u2019ve developed a new level of agility and resilience for the future. The considerable investments we have made in our partners and other stakeholders, which honor our company mission and values combined with evolving our store portfolio, leave us as confident as ever in a unique strength and appeal of our brand and position us to unlock the full potential of Starbucks. And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions joined by Roz Brewer, as Durga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just looking to talk a little bit about the broader outlook from a consumer perspective. It seems like on the heels of COVID, most consumers and investors alike seem like we are entering a recession. So couple of questions related to that. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about your performance a dozen or so years ago and why maybe the brand better insulated this go around, maybe comparing and contrasting the U.S. versus China? And then just to clarify, I think you mentioned that the China comps you expect to substantially recover by the end of fiscal 1Q, perhaps a little bit of a delay from I think you were previously saying by the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. I\u2019m wondering whether you\u2019re seeing any signs of a China consumer slowdown at all in recent weeks? Thank you very much.\nKevin Johnson: Yes. Jeffrey, this is Kevin. I\u2019ll take your questions. First of all, I\u2019ll start with your second question, China. I think as we see a resurgence of cases, similar to what we\u2019ve seen in Beijing, that causes a little bit of \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s caused a little bit of the delay by a quarter in China. Not significantly, it\u2019s about, I\u2019d say, four or five weeks and now Beijing is back on a positive trajectory. But because it was such a large market, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s slowed it down. But it has nothing to do, in my opinion, with the \u2013 anything related to the economic. It was more \u2013 it\u2019s more just as a resurgence happens in a large market like that that we \u2013 when it happens like that, we\u2019re able to sort of turn the dial back slightly on the range of customers\u2019 experiences we serve through to the principles that we outlined and we help support government and local health officials as they contain the spread of the virus. They successfully have done that Beijing. And so then we start turning the dial backup and opening up those customer experiences. And I think that\u2019s a very positive thing because I think as a company, we\u2019ve now taken this playbook that was developed in China and adapted for the U.S. and we basically have embedded it into our store protocols and our operating procedures. So that in 32 stores around the world, if there happens to be a flare-up in a certain city or a certain portion of a market, the stores in that market has the agility to basically turn the dial down if they need to or turn it back up if things are recovering. And that puts us in a position of confidence in how we can continue to navigate the global pandemic as it evolves. And so that was the contributing factor in China. In terms of recession, I\u2019ll leave the predictions of economic growth to the economists. But what we\u2019ve seen is continued demand for Starbucks. In fact, you look at what we\u2019ve outlined. The number one thing we can do to continue to grow our same-store comps and the recovery is basically increase the throughput in the channels that are safe, familiar and convenient. And that\u2019s why, for example, we\u2019re deploying these handheld point-of-sales. I don\u2019t know how many of you have seen a drive-thru, Starbucks drive-thru. There is typically cars lined up and often times out into the street. So where we deploy this handheld point-of-sale, we can now have a Starbucks partner out there taking orders walking through that line of cars, which is going to dramatically increase the throughput at drive-thru. Similar, enabling curbside will open up more customer occasions for us to continue to drive more transactions into our stores. And so I think based on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the demand and by being able to increase throughput in those channels that are viewed as safe and convenient by our customers, that\u2019s going to help us on the recovery curve. In terms of should recession \u2013 recessionary period start to hit, I think we\u2019ve differentiated ourselves. We\u2019ve got lots of points of presence. We\u2019re serving customers. I think the brand is strong. Our digital reach is strong. And I think we\u2019re well positioned to navigate anything that might come our way.\nPat Grismer: Jeffrey, this is Pat. One thing I would say to build on what Kevin has said is that if you compare Starbucks today to where we were during the last economic recession. Today, we have an industry-leading digital platform and a rewards program that didn\u2019t exist back in 2008, 2009. And that\u2019s an important part of competitive advantage and gives us more resilience today compared to 10 years ago.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSara Senatore: Hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask a bit about the guidance, if I could. You said that sales and operating profits recovered more quickly than expected. But to me, it looks like the big difference is more on the profit line with the comps this quarter kind of pretty consistent maybe with guidance. I was just curious, basically what the \u2013 why there was sort of better than expected flow through considering how much of it was a function of discretionary investments? And then if I look at 4Q, just trying to understand again the comps actually maybe the midpoint of the same or a bit lower in most markets, but are you being conservative again on the EPS? Just trying to understand, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. But if I sort of reconcile the top-line versus the EPS, it seems like there has been a little bit of a disconnect this quarter, and I\u2019m trying to figure out if that will happen again in 4Q or even next year since you\u2019ve said that profit recovery might lag top-line? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: Thanks, Sara. Pat, do you want to take that one?\nPat Grismer: Yes. Thank you, Sara. So in relation to Q3, compared to the expectations we had when we filed our 8-K on June 10, you\u2019re absolutely right. We saw a much better flow through, more profit performance than we did improvement in sales. We did see stronger than expected sales recovery across the month, but the profit improvement was outsized in relation to the sales recovery, as you highlighted. And that\u2019s primarily due to the fact that as we have increasing the better visibility to the shape of our sales recovery curve, our operators are in a much stronger position to manage with much greater efficiency labor deployment and the inventory. And so as a consequence, we saw much better profitability than we had anticipated. I would also highlight in particular the performance of our Japan business because they had a rather strong improvement in sales. And because they are a company-owned market, we saw that \u2013 saw with that a significant improvement in profit for the month of June compared to our original expectations. In relation to Q4, I think it\u2019s fair to say that our outlook is pretty comparable to what we had forecasted as of that June 10 8-K. We have narrowed the range for the U.S. business and for the Americas generally because we have more visibility to our results for the quarter as we\u2019re nearly one month into our fourth quarter. At the same time, we have much better visibility to our ability to manage the middle of the P&L. And so we feel very comfortable with the ranges that we\u2019ve given for EPS as well. In relation to next year, you asked about fiscal 2021, and I\u2019ve provided in my prepared remarks a very preliminary perspective on the shape of our sales recovery curve, noting that our margin recovery would likely lag sales recovery by a couple of quarters. The fact is that it\u2019s very early to predict what next year is going to look like. But based on the experience we\u2019ve gained to-date, based on how well we know our brand and how consumers are responding to our brand, based on the strength of our rewards program and our digital platform, we are building operating plans for next year that presume the levels of sales and profit recovery that I mentioned. So it is on that basis that we\u2019ve provided preliminary perspective, and we\u2019ll continue to keep investors updated as we go. Looking forward to providing more refined perspective with our Q4 earnings call, by which time, we will have developed our operating plans for fiscal 2021. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good afternoon, and congrats on navigating through what we hope is the worst of the COVID shock here. But I have a question really on the U.S. business. And I think, Kevin, you mentioned the morning routine business is going to be the most difficult to build back. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on what the plan is to build that back specifically? And perhaps, what you\u2019ve seen in the markets where the economies maybe opened up earlier, if you\u2019re starting to see that business come back, for example, in the southeast or other markets that might have opened earlier than some of the core markets?\nKevin Johnson: Yes, David. Thanks for your question or your comments and for your question. Why don\u2019t I let Roz describe sort of the initiatives we have focused on that morning daypart, and then I\u2019ll sort of punctuate a couple of things. So Roz, let me hand it over to you.\nRoz Brewer: Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, David for the question. First of all, morning daypart, as you well described is important to us. We have seen a shift in the customer in terms of how they view their morning. And we\u2019re seeing a shift to mid-morning around that 9:30 timeframe and then another pickup in the afternoon, around 2:00 PM. And because we\u2019ve created so many tools, a decision-driven tool that we\u2019ve designed specifically for labor planning, we\u2019ve shifted our labor to those timeframes, understanding what has shifted in the customers\u2019 patterns and their routines. In addition, we\u2019re also seeing that in some of our really dense workplaces, for instance, downtown areas where we have stores where there is more work from home in those geographies, those have been slower to recover. And so we\u2019re watching those carefully. But those are also the areas, those dense areas that we are bringing in our new trade area transformation work, we\u2019re realigning the network of stores to increase what we are seeing in terms of revenue in that trade area and optimizing the profitability. So those dense areas are being transformed by the new network of stores. Additionally, I\u2019ll tell you that we are doing the work to reach a broader level of customer base with the new design in our loyalty program. And so you may have heard the announcement around our new pay-as-you-go plan. That will allow us to expand payment options and ways to earn stars. And this we believe will provide meaningful impact on our business results overall. Also, helping us understand the activity of the customer as we reward the loyalty and delivering personalized offers to the expanded customer base. So starting this fall in U.S. and Canada, you\u2019ll be able to download the Starbucks App and sign-up for Starbucks Rewards. You\u2019ll be able to pay with a credit or debit card, cash or select a mobile wallet to earn the stars without having to pre-load a Starbucks card within the app. And so customers can link those card payments to the PayPal account. And we believe these are the kinds of initiatives that will make a difference as we try to regain the most important parts of our business and watch what happens as the transition from work from home returns back to work from office, and we\u2019ll be watching the customer patterns very carefully and adjusting. We\u2019re really comfortable that we now have so many different channels to our business. Adding drive-thrus out in those metro suburban areas near where people are working from home, it\u2019s our highest concentration of drive-thru units. And so we feel like this new agility and resilience that we\u2019ve built into the business will allow us to look at that morning daypart, adjust to the transitions we\u2019re seeing in mid-morning early afternoon and then bring in a new customer base, additional customer base with the new rewards program.\nKevin Johnson: Thank you, Roz. I think you hit the right thing, the digital customer relationships. Just keep in mind, we just added 3 million new digital customers that registered for the rewards program and being able to communicate with them personally. And then as Roz said, the work they\u2019ve done on increasing throughput at drive-thru and watching curbside, that just opens up new channels. So that\u2019s spot on. Thank you, Roz.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. At this time, there is no response from Ms. Zackfia\u2019s line. As your question has been withdrawn, and I will proceed to the next question. The next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Glass: Thanks, and good afternoon. I wanted to go back to the comment, Pat, you made about the margins recovering slower than sales. Just to add a high level, a lot of retailers or restaurants have determined they can do more with less during this period of time, and they\u2019ve learned that they can make labor more efficient, menus more efficient. Why wouldn\u2019t that be the same case for Starbucks in margins? Like, it should be the opposite. And I would also think the digital transactions are more profitable, so that would sort of accelerate that or is there some embedded assumption about reinvestments so that some of these new channels actually aren\u2019t as margin accretive as maybe I\u2019m assuming?\nKevin Johnson: Yes, John. Happy to answer your question. We do expect margins will improve gradually as we move through the fourth quarter and into next year. But in the next couple of quarters, we do expect margins will continue to lag prior year. And although the margin impacts of partner benefits and inventory reserves are expected to subside considerably in Q4, the leading driver of margin pressure will be continuing to deleverage a fixed costs, such as occupancy and depreciation expense as we work to restore sales. So it\u2019s largely a function of the speed with which we can recover sales and then how we manage some incremental cost to our business, because we do expect to see certain costs persist due to our new way of operating, that includes cleaning supplies and the associated labor. But it is premature to say whether those costs will drive a structural change to our operating margin as we continue to innovate our operating systems and technology to improve throughput and drive efficiencies. We also expect a margin tailwind from the transformation of our U.S. urban market strategy as that is rolled out and includes the repositioning of some existing assets, and that will help to offset any new incremental costs. And we also expect margin benefits from ongoing efforts to renegotiate operating leases. So we do expect to see a combination of margin headwinds and tailwinds, but far away the biggest driver of the margin recovery will be the sales recovery. We do expect that there will be a lag between sales recovery and margin recovery as we continue to refine our ability to operate differently in the new environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi. Hope you guys can hear me now?\nKevin Johnson: Hi, Sharon. We can hear you.\nSharon Zackfia: Okay, perfect. So I wanted to follow-up on Roz\u2019s comments about the pay-as-you-go feature for Starbucks Rewards. Is that just rolling out in the U.S. or are you also making any modifications overseas? And can you help us think about where that has the greatest impact? I mean, is it a customer acquisition tool? Does it really widen the funnel? Is it a frequency dynamic? And any kind of initial margin thoughts. I know that the rewards is a little bit less frequent, I think than the regular rewards program. But any clarity around that would be helpful.\nKevin Johnson: Great. Go ahead, Roz.\nRoz Brewer: Sure. So Sharon, first of all, the current Starbucks Rewards members, they will continue to enjoy all the benefits of the current program, current loyalty program and usage of the app. And then those members can choose to keep paying with their pre-loaded Starbucks card to earn two stars per $1. And they now have the option to earn one star per $1 spent when you pay with a credit or debit card, cash or select mobile wallet. So that is \u2013 so it serves two purposes. One, to expand the funnel on the customer base. But we actually believe it will get even deeper penetration with our Starbucks Rewards members as well. So it will do both of those things. We are rolling this out in U.S. and in Canada. So this program is just to North America at this time, and there is a different program that we use in China.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you so much. First a follow-up on the efficiency question then a separate one on efficiency as well. It would be kind of be apparent that you would be able to run stores with less operating hours if there is a shift towards digital, if there is a shift towards off-premise. If you can give a comment on that specifically, because that\u2019s what we are hearing from other restaurants? And then secondly, as we kind of think about the organization and the overall \u2013 growth plan that the company has, what types of efficiency and effectiveness exercises have perhaps emerged beyond what you\u2019ve previously said on a corporate or G&A perspective, a support perspective as we think about 2021 and 2022 of perhaps optimizing some of the organizational structure?\nKevin Johnson: Thanks, John. Roz, why don\u2019t you take part of John\u2019s question on what we\u2019re doing with operating hours and sort of efficiency in the store? And then, Pat, why don\u2019t you take the back half of this question on G&A and how that all comes together on the P&L. Roz?\nRoz Brewer: Yes. So first of all, John, what we\u2019re doing to prepare for labor in the stores is critical for us. As you can imagine, labor being for any retailers are greatest expense. And so being very efficient in terms of how we manage those labor hours in addition to the productivity. And so we have productivity tools in the store that help us manage when labor hours are needed. We\u2019re watching things as simple as infectious rates. And so when those rates rise in certain areas, we will adjust the hours in those stores, we\u2019ll know that we have partners available to work and we will apply them to the store. And so we do have methods in place to make sure that we\u2019re managing just as efficiently as possible in these uncertain times. So we have that work ongoing. We\u2019ve also \u2013 you\u2019ve likely heard earlier, probably four to six weeks ago where we made an adjustment in our stores around partners who wanted to return to the stores and those who decided that they wanted to work elsewhere and find a new career. And so we\u2019ve adjusted appropriately. However, we continue to run hours based on store and demand in that area, and we\u2019ve created our own decision tools to decide what that looks like. So we continue to work that like we\u2019ve done in the past with a lot more visibility over what\u2019s needed to fulfill the demand in those stores.\nPat Grismer: And then, John, just to pick up on some additional aspects of our margin outlook. It\u2019s important to bear in mind that as we do innovate new channels of distribution at our stores, for example, curbside delivery or as we anticipate the longer term growth of third-party delivery, those channels require incremental costs, but they are necessary in order to capture the incremental sales. So those would be a couple of examples where we see growth that may be margin percentage dilutive, but dollar profit accretive. And so to Roz\u2019s point, the team continues to work through ways that we can improve operating efficiency in the store to help offset some of these incremental investments, to accommodate an evolution in the overall shape of our business.\nRoz Brewer: Pat, I\u2019d also like add that we are also working, as we\u2019ve talked about before, to look at equipment efficiencies in our stores. And so the Mastrena 2 is at 4,000 stores as we speak. And so we continue to look at equipment and all operations behind the bar as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Roz, I\u2019m trying to get a better sense of the size of the prize at curbside delivery. So just curious, how many stores are offering the curbside pickup up now in the context of how many stores that are non-urban stores that are drive-thru in the portfolio? And curious on how you see this progressing and really what limits the speed at which you can add this capability given it obviously is a lot easier from a process perspective relative to the new real estate you\u2019re exploring in some of these smaller format locations?\nKevin Johnson: Roz, do you want to take that?\nRoz Brewer: Sure. Andrew, thanks for the question. So we were in test of about 250 stores, really pleased with what we saw in those stores with curbside, which encouraged us to accelerate, and we will be in close to 1,000 stores in short order here. So we continue to push curbside. The interesting thing about curbside for us is that it is tech-enabled. So you can access a curbside from the app where it is available currently. And so we\u2019re continuing to roll that out. And so we expect to continue to see what we saw in that 250 store test trial that we\u2019ve been running just prior to COVID. So this is an acceleration of a plan that we\u2019ve already had. And so we look forward to curbside to give our customers just one more contactless opportunity and our partners a chance to deliver the best customer service to our customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. Just had one follow-up on the dayparts. I guess, from the text it says, I mean, you\u2019re seeing growth and it seems to be shifting in the later part of the morning. But I guess with the down 14% in July, is it correct to assume that the afternoon daypart or post-10:00 AM daypart is meaningfully positive? And then I wonder if you can comment a little bit about marketing? One of your bigger peers today talked about having sort of entering the second half of this year with \u2013 the calendar year with a war chest for marketing dollar spend. What type of dollars should we think about on a year-over-year basis? Have you sort of deferred some to be spent and accrued it in the first half that could be actually deployed and put into the marketplace in the second half? Thank you.\nKevin Johnson: Thank you, Matt. Roz, why don\u2019t you go ahead and take both of those questions if you could?\nRoz Brewer: Sure. So Matt, to your first question about daypart, one of the things that we\u2019re seeing also as it shift to later morning and another pickup in the afternoon is we\u2019re seeing expanded ticket. So we are seeing group ordering where we believe we\u2019re seeing larger beverage size and additional beverage and food attached. And so we talked about that increase being 25% of what we\u2019ve seen in our ticket expansion. So we are seeing that. To the rest of your question around marketing, we\u2019ve continued marketing. In the very beginning, we ceased marketing because we had so many stores that were in transition from cafe to drive-thru. We reignited marketing. You\u2019ve seen it in our work with our Happy Hour, our Double-Star Days and then the initiation of our summer time beverages, and then the discussion around our plant-based menu. You will see us coming into the fall with excitement around our work with Pumpkin Spice Latte. You\u2019ll see us market for holiday beverage plans. And then the work that we plan to do to market, the new loyalty program. And the new loyalty program again is another way for us to have a new customer base attached to an app that we can speak to frequently and bring them into the store and increase frequency. So we have marketing plan for the remaining of the year and throughout fiscal year 2021.\nPat Grismer: And just to build on what Roz just said in relation to our fiscal 2020 spend, to Roz\u2019s point, the level of spend in Q3 was markedly higher as a percentage of revenue than Q2, in part due to some of the deferral of our marketing activity. We do anticipate that our level of overall marketing spend in Q4 as a percentage of revenue will be pretty comparable to our full year rate. We are not anticipating that that overall level of spend will diminish going forward. But I would highlight that as a concept, our advertising spend has historically been pretty low because of the strength of our brand and the amount of marketing that we attract.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you. Pat, just unpacking your comments on the 2021 same-store sales recovery, do you anticipate store level volumes in the U.S. fully recovering to pre-COVID levels by 2021 or do you really need an environment to shift where employment is fully restored and people are back to their pre-COVID routines or can you get back there in this new normal environment we\u2019re all living in?\nPat Grismer: Yes. Brian, thanks for your question. As I said in my prepared remarks, our preliminary perspective on fiscal 2021 presumes that there will be no major second wave or no major macroeconomic dislocation. It\u2019s nearly impossible to predict whether and when those might happen. Based on what we know today, based on how we see our business is recovering, we anticipate and we are developing an operating plan around the assumption that our U.S. business fully recover sales, meaning back to pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of the second fiscal quarter, and that would be end of March. We\u2019re expecting China will fully recover about one quarter sooner. And then as I mentioned, we\u2019re anticipating margin recovery will lag sales recovery by about two quarters. So it\u2019s a very preliminary perspective. Just to share with the investment community how we\u2019re thinking about the shape of next year, I\u2019m not being able to predict whether and when some other events might happen. We have to get on with our business. We have to prepare operating plans and focus our teams on continuing to deliver results. We\u2019re pleased overall with the progress we\u2019ve seen to-date. We still have a long ways to go to get back to full recovery. But we\u2019re optimistic based on the strength of our brand and the strategies and the initiatives that we have to drive sales and to improve margins.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of them have been answered already. But I am curious how you think about this potential longer term shift in work from home for many consumers? And how you think about product innovation around that? Specifically, do you see yourselves potentially offering some new items that you wouldn\u2019t be able to if consumers were not working from home as often? And also even with curbside, do you see potential to add some new products that you might not be able to add without that option?\nKevin Johnson: Yes. Jon, let me comment then Roz I\u2019ll let you add anything, I think, look, we\u2019ve always been really clear that the three things that we focus on that really drive our growth is; number one, the customer experience. That\u2019s the experience in our stores and these different channels we\u2019re talking about. Number two is extending that experience in our store to digital customer relations \u2013 relationships. And number three is primarily beverage innovation. We\u2019re beverage first company and then we attach food. And so I think that same formula works whether you work from home or you work from work. I do think what is the focus right now until there\u2019s a vaccine, we just realized that we\u2019ve got to focus on those experiences that customers optimize around whether they\u2019re working from home or not, which are safe, familiar and convenient. And so our beverage innovation is going to continue to focus on all the great things we\u2019ve been doing around our cold beverage lineup, with cold foam, coffee forward beverages, our refreshers, all of that is going to continue to move forward. And I don\u2019t necessarily see that as being a driver of the fact that people work from home or we have curbside. We\u2019re going to continue to innovate in ways that are relevant to our customers independent of the channel by which they buy from us. I do think, as Roz pointed out, we\u2019re seeing larger ticket. And I think part of that is a function of people work from home. They make a Starbucks run and they buy for the whole family or they\u2019re buying more group sort of orders. They\u2019re attaching more food. And I think that bodes well for the innovation that we\u2019ve been driving and announcing around our plant-based offerings. Plant-based is becoming a very popular whether it\u2019s plant-based milks or the Impossible breakfast sandwich that we launched in the U.S., the Beyond Meat offerings that we put on the menu in Canada and China. And so our innovation agenda is going to continue to drive around the things that we know are relevant to our customers, things that inspire our partners and stay true to handcrafted beverages, that\u2019s what differentiates us. And I think we\u2019re going to maintain a focus on those things. Roz, I\u2019ll let \u2013 if there\u2019s anything else you want to add or \u2013 and then Pat who got some comments too. So let\u2019s go to Roz.\nRoz Brewer: Yes, just a few things. First of all, although our sales mix has really tilted to more towards launch and afternoon since the onset of COVID, morning still remains a significant daypart for us. So we\u2019re not walking away from that. There are some things that we\u2019re considering in terms of innovation and then there are some things that we are accelerating in the innovation pipeline. For instance, we are going to be introducing a plant-based protein box because we know in the afternoon there is this extra boost needed. And so that will come forward quicker than planned. We\u2019re also looking at things like, for instance, with curbside, we\u2019re trying to bring the lobby to door side. So just recently, we added merchandise to the app. So then if you wanted to order for gift-giving, some of our serveware, a mug, a nice cup. So we\u2019ve done some of those things, and we\u2019ll continue to do that because we\u2019re really listening to the customer and understanding what they need and we can evolve and then we can accelerate our innovation pipeline just as quickly as we can. Pat, you wanted to add something?\nPat Grismer: Yes. Thank you, Roz. I\u2019d like to highlight specifically how our Channel Development business has benefited from work from home and how the team is looking at opportunities to capitalize on that. The volume we were seeing in at-home coffee remained at elevated levels across the quarter. Starbucks outperformed the category. We gained share. And our core strategies for at-home coffee are generally the same, but we are looking at opportunities to sustain the momentum that we gained as consumers adjusted their at-home routines. For example, we\u2019re focusing on accelerating e-commerce based on the shift in shopping patterns and meeting consumers\u2019 evolving needs. We\u2019re also looking at premiumizing the category, expanding consumption and driving loyalty through our Channel Development business as well. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Thank you. Roz, would you help us understand the potential sales lift for a store that adds curbside? And maybe describe some of the other initiatives that you believe could have a meaningful impact on capacity and throughput? And then, Pat, do you expect the benefit from the qualified payroll credits to be smaller in the fourth quarter than they were in the third.\nKevin Johnson: Roz, why don\u2019t you take the first part and then Pat will comment.\nRoz Brewer: Sure. Let me start off. First of all, Chris, your question around curbside and what would we expect in terms of upside there. It\u2019s encouraging what we saw in our trial base. So \u2013 and we know that contactless experience for our customer is more present than ever. So we believe in this new channel for us. But it\u2019s really too early for us to tell what the real benefit will be. But we\u2019ll come back to you as this thing grows. We\u2019ll let you know how that\u2019s working for us. In terms of capacity and what we think could help, for instance, our drive-thru. This new handheld, that capacity that we are creating, allows us to do what a lot of retailers call busting the line actually. And so we\u2019re able to get out of the store, get out in that line, put an order and in a queue much faster and get those out-the-window times down and get the beverage and food items to the customer much quicker. We\u2019re also doing work that handheld will enable if you wanted to just \u2013 if the line began to get long, if you are picking up and trying to walk into the stores. So between handheld and curbside, we feel like we\u2019re going to be able to deliver a different customer service and it will unlock and enable some efficiencies that we need and speed. And so we\u2019re looking at those two as key drivers.\nPat Grismer: And Chris, in relation to your question regarding the government stimulus program benefits. The lion\u2019s share of our investment in Q3 was around catastrophe pay, a form of partner support and care. And that\u2019s where the government stimulus program benefits kicked in on helping to offset a portion of that. So for Q4, since we have effectively sunsetted our catastrophe pay, we\u2019re not anticipating significant expense in Q4. And as a result, we would not anticipate significant government stimulus program benefits by way of payroll tax credits.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks. Kevin, you talked some about how solid customer demand remains, and perhaps, it sounds maybe little changed from pre-COVID levels, and therefore, I think you\u2019re highlighting the importance of throughput and operations to continuing to drive sales. But anything more you can share with respect to existing customers using the brand a little bit less for net now that their brand \u2013 that their routine has changed, perhaps, offset by new customers that you gained or that have become heavier users over the last few months? And ultimately, is that a net benefit because the new customers become sticky, existing customers return to their routines? Anything more there \u2013 metrics to share or just kind of how you\u2019re thinking about that customer dynamics? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: Yes. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start by saying, throughout this quarter, we have navigated the pandemic in a way that I consider very consistent with Starbucks mission and values. And in many ways, we navigated this by prioritizing the safety and the health and well being of our partners and the customers we serve. And unlike many, many others in the industry, in April, \u2013 yes, In April, we closed all our stores with the exception of drive-thrus. And that was clearly to provide a safe environment for our partners and as well as the contactless experience for us to handcraft beverages and food items for our customers. During that period, we had significant demand through the drive-thru. It was quite amazing. The lines and the amount of time the customer wait in line in drive-thru to get their Starbucks. And so that was the first indication that there is a very powerful customer affinity to Starbucks, even in a global pandemic. Now, as we started re-opening stores in May and customers \u2013 we began to \u2013 with mobile ordering and contactless entryway pickup, we continue to see customers coming back to us. Clearly, the priority or the customer behavior was around safe, familiar, convenient experiences. And so that\u2019s why I think we saw such a dramatic increase in the number of app downloads and customers that joined the rewards program because that is the safest way to order. You order on your phone and then you can pick it up contactless or you can get it for delivery. And so that was another indication. So we quickly figure out, if we launch curbside, we\u2019re going to get more customers. If we put handheld point-of-sale at the drive-thru lines, we get drive-thru. When we open our stores for to-go orders or even limited seating, we see customers come back. And yet at the same time, we stayed true to the principles that we outlined, which is prioritize the health and well being of our Starbucks partners, the customers we serve, to also support government, local health officials as they work to contain the spread of the virus, and third is to just show up in a positive and responsible way in every community we serve. Now when I look at the data, our customer connection scores are at an all-time high. And part of that is, I believe, the way that we\u2019ve navigated this has built trust. It\u2019s built trust in our Starbucks partners that we\u2019re always going to do the right thing. We put people ahead of profit, whether it was providing economic certainty for our partners or ensuring that our customers had safe ways to interact with us. I think that deposit in the reservoir of trust is building and strengthening customer affinity. Obviously, the deployment of mobile reach is building more customers that become sticky. They build that relationship with Starbucks, we can communicate with them, we can serve their needs, we can personalize that experience for them. And then the investments we\u2019re making to make it easier for customers to have those experience is just is continuing to unfold. And we saw that certainly in the month of June where we saw a very good response from customers that helped us exceed expectations on what we would see in sales and then that\u2019s continued into July to progress. So when I look at the fact that our share in the month of June, we gained share in the month of June, and I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re on a path to continue to gain share. So if there is any question that closing stores was going to create a longer term loss of market share is disproven because we saw clearly in the month of May, we did \u2013 we were even on share in the month of June, we gained share. And I suspect as we keep doing these things, we\u2019re going to continue to gain share. And in the process, customer connection scores are at an all-time high and our customer affinity that we measure on a regular basis is also very strong. So I think we have line of sight visibility to what our customers need and want. And as we deliver that, they respond. And I think the plan that we have in place in accelerating the strategic initiatives are right in the sweet spot of customer shift and customer behavior. So I think about this as the investments we made this quarter, we\u2019re playing the long game. This is about building trust with our customers and then positioning Starbucks for long-term sustainable growth. And I feel very good about the fact that we\u2019re now in a position where we\u2019ve operationalize these store protocols and we know how to adapt very rapidly and we do that with distributed leadership. 32,000 stores around the world. There\u2019s 32,000 store managers, each one of them is paying attention to what\u2019s happening in their community. They have the playbook. They know how to adapt. And so we are in many ways we\u2019re back in March, April, people would describe this as we are navigating a crisis, this global pandemic. Well, today, we\u2019re not \u2013 this is not a crisis any longer in my opinion. We are navigating a global pandemic, but we know exactly how to do it. That\u2019s woven into the fabric of how we operate, and partners are rising to the occasion. So I feel very good about where we\u2019re at. I feel very good about the strategic initiatives. And the data that we see on customer response is spot on. So that\u2019s where we are from where we were 90 days ago when we spoke with you last on the earnings call. And it\u2019s all credit to our Starbucks partners. They\u2019ve done a phenomenal job.\nOperator: And that was our last question today. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Johnson.\nKevin Johnson: Let me just thank all of you for joining us today. My hope is that through this discussion we\u2019ve been able to give you a sense of the confidence we have in our ability to navigate this global pandemic. Our recovery strategy is working. And we\u2019re accelerating the strategic initiatives that further differentiate Starbucks for the future. We\u2019re doing this in a way that is true to our mission and our values, and we\u2019re on the front foot right now. But also acknowledging that like everyone else in this world, we\u2019ve got to monitor and adapt and be agile. But I\u2019m very proud of my Starbucks partners and how they\u2019ve responded. And I just want to take an opportunity to thank all of you, our stakeholders, for your support and we look forward to the continued dialog. So thanks everybody.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks Coffee company\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2020 conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Pat Grismer",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by echoing Kevin's appreciation for all Starbucks partners who have worked tirelessly to deliver safe, convenient and familiar experiences for our customers and to support our communities under very challenging circumstances. They are the heartbeat of our company and our inspiration. Although the impacts of COVID-19 weighed heavily on our Q3 financial results, we are encouraged by the fact that our sales and profits across all our operating segments recovered more quickly than we expected, and that our very strong balance sheet has allowed us to make significant and important investments in the business for the long-term, while weathering the pandemic. For the quarter, Starbucks reported global revenue of $4.2 billion, down 38% from the prior year. We estimate the COVID-19 impact on consolidated revenue to be approximately $3.1 billion, primarily due to temporary store closures, restricted sales channels, shortened operating hours and reduced customer traffic. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 was a loss of $0.46, down from a profit of $0.78 in the prior year inclusive of an estimated $1.20 negative impact of COVID-19, which includes flow through on the revenue impact that I noted earlier as well as significant investments that we made in response to the pandemic, which I will outline later. Non-GAAP EPS was considerably better than the preliminary guidance range that we provided in our 8-K on June 10, driven by better than expected sales and margins. I will first provide some highlights of segment operating results and consolidated margin performance for Q3. I will then discuss our guidance for Q4 and fiscal 2020, followed by a preliminary perspective on fiscal 2021. At $2.8 billion revenue for our Americas segment was 40% lower in Q3 than the prior year, largely due to a 41% decline in comparable store sales, including minus 40% in the U.S. We estimate the decline in Americas revenue and operating income attributable to COVID-19 in Q3 to be approximately $2.3 billion and $1.5 billion respectively. This equates to a flow through rate on lost sales of approximately 65% for Q3, which was a significant improvement from Q2, but still materially higher than the 50% variable flow through rate that we typically observe in our business, primarily due to incremental partner support costs, net of certain government stimulus program benefits as well as incremental store operating expenses. Importantly, both sales and profitability trended positively across the quarter with sequential improvements in each month and comparable store sales were towards the better end of our guidance range. The U.S. business posted a comparable sales decline of 19% in June, improving from minus 43% in May, restoring the business to positive profitability for the month. Moving on to International. The segment's comparable store sales declined by 37% in Q3 relative to the prior year, but exceeded the expectations we shared last month, primarily driven by Japan's faster than expected pace of sales recovery, boosted by successful seasonal product promotions. The segment's comparable store sales in Q3 also reflect a 2% benefit related to temporary value-added tax or VAT exemption in China. This benefit was largely offset by traffic softness that emerged in Beijing in the last two weeks of the quarter due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in that city. For the month of June, China's comparable store sales declined 16% after excluding an 8 percentage point VAT exemption benefit, about half of which was related to a true-up for the first two months of the quarter. This was a notable sequential improvement to May's comp on a like-for-like basis. For the third quarter, China's comparable store sales declined 19% including VAT favorability of 4 percentage points. International's revenue of $950 million in Q3 was a 40% reduction versus the prior year, primarily due to the 37% decline in comparable store sales. Also contributing to the decline were lower product sales to our licensees as a result of lost sales related to the COVID-19 outbreak as well as temporary royalty relief that we granted our international licensees. And there was an additional 2% revenue dilutive impact of transitioning our Thailand business to licensed operations last year. These adverse year-over-year revenue impacts were partially offset by net new store growth of 9% over the past 12 months. We estimate that the COVID-19 impact to decline in International's Q3 revenue and operating income with approximately $760 million and $420 million respectively. The improvement in International's flow through rate on lost sales up roughly 55% in Q3 from 60% in Q2 was attributable to favorable items unique to the period, primarily temporary government relief programs, the temporary extension of China loyalty program benefits during the pandemic and limited time rent concessions in both China and Japan. On to Channel Development. Revenue was $447 million in Q3, a decline of 16% from the prior year. When normalizing for the 21% unfavorable impact of lapping, Global Coffee Alliance transition-related items that benefited the prior year, including higher inventory sales as Nestle prepared to fulfill customer orders, Channel Development's revenue grew 5% in Q3 over the prior year. The growth was driven by strong packaged coffee and single serve product sales, offsetting the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the segment's foodservice business. Channel Development's non-GAAP operating margin was 35.6%, an improvement of 120 basis points over the prior year. Normalizing for the 460 basis point impact of the transition activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's non-GAAP operating margin contracted 340 basis points in Q3. The contraction was due primarily to a business mix shift within Channel Development as well as deleverage on fixed coffee manufacturing costs shared across the company's operating segments driven by lower retail production volumes, resulting from COVID-19. At the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was minus 12.6% in Q3, down from 18.3% in the prior year. As you would expect, much of the year-over-year reduction in our operating margin was due to sales deleverage as well as incremental expenses to provide a safe experience in our stores, all related to the impacts of COVID-19. We estimate this to be approximately 80% of the margin decline. The remaining 20% primarily reflects substantial and very intentional investments that we are making in the brand and to build trust with key stakeholders, recognizing that these relationships are an essential part of our brand and critical to our ability to not only recover from the effects of the pandemic, but also to strengthen our competitive position for long-term growth. These investments totaled approximately $350 million in the quarter and were focused on three key areas. First, we invested in our partners as they are critical to the Starbucks experience and instrumental to our long-term success. For most of the quarter, including during the period of extensive store closures, we provided our partners with salary, wage and benefits continuation as well as temporary premium pay in the U.S. and Canada for those who work on the front lines of our business and enhanced assistance related to personal care and well being, net of subsidies from certain government stimulus program benefits. This represented about 85% of our total investments for the quarter. Second, we supported our international licensees who are our partners in driving long-term growth globally by temporarily extending more flexible development terms and royalty relief. And third, we helped several strategic suppliers weather this crisis with certain accelerated payments in effect through July. And by honoring minimum supplier commitments during periods of depressed sales volumes so they can sustain the supply of our proprietary products and services in support of our ongoing product innovation. We are fortunate that the scale of our business and the strength of our balance sheet enabled us to invest as we did consistent with our mission and values as a company, while positioning us well for the future. Our $3 billion bond issuance in May enabled us to fund these investments, cover our capital expenditures, pre-fund next year's bond maturities at attractive rates, and of course, sustain our quarterly dividend payments, honoring our commitment to shareholders. Importantly, as we exited Q3, we were cash flow positive with upward momentum, setting us on a solid path to reduce our financial leverage in future quarters. Moving on to our outlook for Q4 and fiscal 2020, starting with the metric that, in our view, defines recovery for our retail business comparable store sales growth. Globally, we expect comparable store sales for Q4 and for fiscal 2020 to decline between 12% and 17%, demonstrating sustained sequential improvement, including across both of our key markets of the U.S. and China. We also expect Americas and U.S. comparable store sales to be down 12% to 17% for Q4 and for fiscal 2020. While the recent flare-ups of COVID-19 in several parts of the U.S. underscore the persistent uncertainty in our operating environment, we expect continued improvement in our U.S. business in Q4, bolstered by the focused actions that Kevin described in relation to our contactless customer experience, digital capabilities and beverage innovation. Currently, with modified operations and limited cafe seating in nearly 40% of our stores as well as 4% of the portfolio remaining closed, we estimate that our fiscal July comparable store sales for U.S. company-operated locations will be approximately minus 14%, a sequential improvement from the minus 19% that we delivered in June even as we dialed back some of our U.S. operations in response to some regional COVID-19 flare-ups. Moving on to our International segment. With the expectation of COVID-19 impacts continuing to ease in the fourth quarter, particularly in Japan, we now expect International's comparable store sales to decline between 10% and 15% in Q4, including a 3% favorable VAT impact. For China specifically, we expect Q4 comparable store sales to range between flat and minus 5%. Although this is generally in line with our previous guidance and now reflects both a new tailwind and the new headwind, the new tailwind is the temporary VAT exemption, which I mentioned earlier, benefiting China's fourth quarter comp sales growth by about 4 percentage points. The new headwind is a combination of factors. First, COVID-related emergency response measures in Beijing where Starbucks currently has over 360 locations. And second, a prolonged slowdown in international and domestic travel, impacting Starbucks locations at China's airports and tourist venues. For the full fiscal year, we expect China's comparable store sales to decline in the range of 15% to 20%, including a 2% favorable VAT impact. And for International, we expect full year comparable store sales to decline in the range of 20% to 25% in fiscal 2020, including a 1% favorable VAT impact. As an indication of a continued recovery that we're seeing in this business, we estimate that China's comparable store sales growth will decline approximately 12% to 14% for the month of July when excluding a 4 percentage point benefit from the temporary VAT exemption. This is sequentially better than June's results when China's comparable store sales growth declined 16% when excluding VAT favorability at 8 percentage points. We expect the VAT exemption will expire at the end of December. Finally, Channel Development. This segment's revenue is expected to decline between 5% and 6% on a reported basis for the full year and fiscal 2020, relative to the prior year as we lap certain transition items related to the Global Coffee Alliance that benefited the segment's top-line growth in fiscal 2019. Adding it all up at the enterprise level, globally, we expect revenue to decline between 10% to 15% in Q4 versus the prior year, primarily reflecting the negative impact of COVID-19, which we estimate to range between approximately $1.4 billion to $1.65 billion. We estimate the operating income decline related to COVID-19 to be approximately $850 million to $1.1 billion globally, reflecting a flow through rate of roughly 60% to 65% on lost sales in Q4. This is roughly comparable to the flow through rate that we delivered in Q3 as we expect improved sales leverage in Q4 will be offset by the absence of non-recurring margin benefits that we realized in Q3. With continued sales and margin recovery, we currently expect the business will return to profitability in Q4 with EPS improving very meaningfully compared to Q3. We now expect GAAP EPS in Q4 of $0.06 to $0.21 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.33. This current outlook for Q4, coupled with our better than expected results in Q3, yields a rates to our full year expectations for EPS in fiscal 2020 compared to our prior forecast. We now expect GAAP EPS in fiscal 2020 of $0.50 to $0.65 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 to $0.98. Now I'd like to share some perspective on our U.S. and China recovery curves going forward. Based on what we've learned as we've navigated the impact of COVID-19 for the past six months as well as the innovations and growth that we planned for next year, and barring any new major and sustained waves of infection and/or global economic disruptions, we anticipate that comparable store sales will substantially recover in China and the U.S. in fiscal 2021 by the end of our first quarters and second quarters respectively. Additionally, we expect that margin recovery for each business will trail sales recovery by about two quarters. As we believe we are now past the depth of the pandemic and are on a steady path to full recovery, and as we successfully bridged our liquidity needs, we will now return to our normal cadence of investor updates and look forward to sharing our continued progress with our fourth quarter earnings report in October. In summary, Starbucks sales and profits are recovering nicely. Our liquidity position remains strong and continues to improve. And we are continuing to invest in growth and the future of our business. It has been a very challenging quarter for Starbucks, as it has for many other businesses, but we believe the worst is behind us. We've developed a new level of agility and resilience for the future. The considerable investments we have made in our partners and other stakeholders, which honor our company mission and values combined with evolving our store portfolio, leave us as confident as ever in a unique strength and appeal of our brand and position us to unlock the full potential of Starbucks. And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions joined by Roz Brewer, as Durga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator? Jeffrey, this is Pat. One thing I would say to build on what Kevin has said is that if you compare Starbucks today to where we were during the last economic recession. Today, we have an industry-leading digital platform and a rewards program that didn't exist back in 2008, 2009. And that's an important part of competitive advantage and gives us more resilience today compared to 10 years ago. Yes. Thank you, Sara. So in relation to Q3, compared to the expectations we had when we filed our 8-K on June 10, you're absolutely right. We saw a much better flow through, more profit performance than we did improvement in sales. We did see stronger than expected sales recovery across the month, but the profit improvement was outsized in relation to the sales recovery, as you highlighted. And that's primarily due to the fact that as we have increasing the better visibility to the shape of our sales recovery curve, our operators are in a much stronger position to manage with much greater efficiency labor deployment and the inventory. And so as a consequence, we saw much better profitability than we had anticipated. I would also highlight in particular the performance of our Japan business because they had a rather strong improvement in sales. And because they are a company-owned market, we saw that \u2013 saw with that a significant improvement in profit for the month of June compared to our original expectations. In relation to Q4, I think it's fair to say that our outlook is pretty comparable to what we had forecasted as of that June 10 8-K. We have narrowed the range for the U.S. business and for the Americas generally because we have more visibility to our results for the quarter as we're nearly one month into our fourth quarter. At the same time, we have much better visibility to our ability to manage the middle of the P&L. And so we feel very comfortable with the ranges that we've given for EPS as well. In relation to next year, you asked about fiscal 2021, and I've provided in my prepared remarks a very preliminary perspective on the shape of our sales recovery curve, noting that our margin recovery would likely lag sales recovery by a couple of quarters. The fact is that it's very early to predict what next year is going to look like. But based on the experience we've gained to-date, based on how well we know our brand and how consumers are responding to our brand, based on the strength of our rewards program and our digital platform, we are building operating plans for next year that presume the levels of sales and profit recovery that I mentioned. So it is on that basis that we've provided preliminary perspective, and we'll continue to keep investors updated as we go. Looking forward to providing more refined perspective with our Q4 earnings call, by which time, we will have developed our operating plans for fiscal 2021. Thank you. And then, John, just to pick up on some additional aspects of our margin outlook. It's important to bear in mind that as we do innovate new channels of distribution at our stores, for example, curbside delivery or as we anticipate the longer term growth of third-party delivery, those channels require incremental costs, but they are necessary in order to capture the incremental sales. So those would be a couple of examples where we see growth that may be margin percentage dilutive, but dollar profit accretive. And so to Roz's point, the team continues to work through ways that we can improve operating efficiency in the store to help offset some of these incremental investments, to accommodate an evolution in the overall shape of our business. And just to build on what Roz just said in relation to our fiscal 2020 spend, to Roz's point, the level of spend in Q3 was markedly higher as a percentage of revenue than Q2, in part due to some of the deferral of our marketing activity. We do anticipate that our level of overall marketing spend in Q4 as a percentage of revenue will be pretty comparable to our full year rate. We are not anticipating that that overall level of spend will diminish going forward. But I would highlight that as a concept, our advertising spend has historically been pretty low because of the strength of our brand and the amount of marketing that we attract. Yes. Brian, thanks for your question. As I said in my prepared remarks, our preliminary perspective on fiscal 2021 presumes that there will be no major second wave or no major macroeconomic dislocation. It's nearly impossible to predict whether and when those might happen. Based on what we know today, based on how we see our business is recovering, we anticipate and we are developing an operating plan around the assumption that our U.S. business fully recover sales, meaning back to pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of the second fiscal quarter, and that would be end of March. We're expecting China will fully recover about one quarter sooner. And then as I mentioned, we're anticipating margin recovery will lag sales recovery by about two quarters. So it's a very preliminary perspective. Just to share with the investment community how we're thinking about the shape of next year, I'm not being able to predict whether and when some other events might happen. We have to get on with our business. We have to prepare operating plans and focus our teams on continuing to deliver results. We're pleased overall with the progress we've seen to-date. We still have a long ways to go to get back to full recovery. But we're optimistic based on the strength of our brand and the strategies and the initiatives that we have to drive sales and to improve margins. Yes. Thank you, Roz. I'd like to highlight specifically how our Channel Development business has benefited from work from home and how the team is looking at opportunities to capitalize on that. The volume we were seeing in at-home coffee remained at elevated levels across the quarter. Starbucks outperformed the category. We gained share. And our core strategies for at-home coffee are generally the same, but we are looking at opportunities to sustain the momentum that we gained as consumers adjusted their at-home routines. For example, we're focusing on accelerating e-commerce based on the shift in shopping patterns and meeting consumers' evolving needs. We're also looking at premiumizing the category, expanding consumption and driving loyalty through our Channel Development business as well. Thanks. And Chris, in relation to your question regarding the government stimulus program benefits. The lion's share of our investment in Q3 was around catastrophe pay, a form of partner support and care. And that's where the government stimulus program benefits kicked in on helping to offset a portion of that. So for Q4, since we have effectively sunsetted our catastrophe pay, we're not anticipating significant expense in Q4. And as a result, we would not anticipate significant government stimulus program benefits by way of payroll tax credits."

            "name": "Roz Brewer",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, David for the question. First of all, morning daypart, as you well described is important to us. We have seen a shift in the customer in terms of how they view their morning. And we're seeing a shift to mid-morning around that 9:30 timeframe and then another pickup in the afternoon, around 2:00 PM. And because we've created so many tools, a decision-driven tool that we've designed specifically for labor planning, we've shifted our labor to those timeframes, understanding what has shifted in the customers' patterns and their routines. In addition, we're also seeing that in some of our really dense workplaces, for instance, downtown areas where we have stores where there is more work from home in those geographies, those have been slower to recover. And so we're watching those carefully. But those are also the areas, those dense areas that we are bringing in our new trade area transformation work, we're realigning the network of stores to increase what we are seeing in terms of revenue in that trade area and optimizing the profitability. So those dense areas are being transformed by the new network of stores. Additionally, I'll tell you that we are doing the work to reach a broader level of customer base with the new design in our loyalty program. And so you may have heard the announcement around our new pay-as-you-go plan. That will allow us to expand payment options and ways to earn stars. And this we believe will provide meaningful impact on our business results overall. Also, helping us understand the activity of the customer as we reward the loyalty and delivering personalized offers to the expanded customer base. So starting this fall in U.S. and Canada, you'll be able to download the Starbucks App and sign-up for Starbucks Rewards. You'll be able to pay with a credit or debit card, cash or select a mobile wallet to earn the stars without having to pre-load a Starbucks card within the app. And so customers can link those card payments to the PayPal account. And we believe these are the kinds of initiatives that will make a difference as we try to regain the most important parts of our business and watch what happens as the transition from work from home returns back to work from office, and we'll be watching the customer patterns very carefully and adjusting. We're really comfortable that we now have so many different channels to our business. Adding drive-thrus out in those metro suburban areas near where people are working from home, it's our highest concentration of drive-thru units. And so we feel like this new agility and resilience that we've built into the business will allow us to look at that morning daypart, adjust to the transitions we're seeing in mid-morning early afternoon and then bring in a new customer base, additional customer base with the new rewards program. Sure. So Sharon, first of all, the current Starbucks Rewards members, they will continue to enjoy all the benefits of the current program, current loyalty program and usage of the app. And then those members can choose to keep paying with their pre-loaded Starbucks card to earn two stars per $1. And they now have the option to earn one star per $1 spent when you pay with a credit or debit card, cash or select mobile wallet. So that is \u2013 so it serves two purposes. One, to expand the funnel on the customer base. But we actually believe it will get even deeper penetration with our Starbucks Rewards members as well. So it will do both of those things. We are rolling this out in U.S. and in Canada. So this program is just to North America at this time, and there is a different program that we use in China. Yes. So first of all, John, what we're doing to prepare for labor in the stores is critical for us. As you can imagine, labor being for any retailers are greatest expense. And so being very efficient in terms of how we manage those labor hours in addition to the productivity. And so we have productivity tools in the store that help us manage when labor hours are needed. We're watching things as simple as infectious rates. And so when those rates rise in certain areas, we will adjust the hours in those stores, we'll know that we have partners available to work and we will apply them to the store. And so we do have methods in place to make sure that we're managing just as efficiently as possible in these uncertain times. So we have that work ongoing. We've also \u2013 you've likely heard earlier, probably four to six weeks ago where we made an adjustment in our stores around partners who wanted to return to the stores and those who decided that they wanted to work elsewhere and find a new career. And so we've adjusted appropriately. However, we continue to run hours based on store and demand in that area, and we've created our own decision tools to decide what that looks like. So we continue to work that like we've done in the past with a lot more visibility over what's needed to fulfill the demand in those stores. Pat, I'd also like add that we are also working, as we've talked about before, to look at equipment efficiencies in our stores. And so the Mastrena 2 is at 4,000 stores as we speak. And so we continue to look at equipment and all operations behind the bar as well. Sure. Andrew, thanks for the question. So we were in test of about 250 stores, really pleased with what we saw in those stores with curbside, which encouraged us to accelerate, and we will be in close to 1,000 stores in short order here. So we continue to push curbside. The interesting thing about curbside for us is that it is tech-enabled. So you can access a curbside from the app where it is available currently. And so we're continuing to roll that out. And so we expect to continue to see what we saw in that 250 store test trial that we've been running just prior to COVID. So this is an acceleration of a plan that we've already had. And so we look forward to curbside to give our customers just one more contactless opportunity and our partners a chance to deliver the best customer service to our customers. Sure. So Matt, to your first question about daypart, one of the things that we're seeing also as it shift to later morning and another pickup in the afternoon is we're seeing expanded ticket. So we are seeing group ordering where we believe we're seeing larger beverage size and additional beverage and food attached. And so we talked about that increase being 25% of what we've seen in our ticket expansion. So we are seeing that. To the rest of your question around marketing, we've continued marketing. In the very beginning, we ceased marketing because we had so many stores that were in transition from cafe to drive-thru. We reignited marketing. You've seen it in our work with our Happy Hour, our Double-Star Days and then the initiation of our summer time beverages, and then the discussion around our plant-based menu. You will see us coming into the fall with excitement around our work with Pumpkin Spice Latte. You'll see us market for holiday beverage plans. And then the work that we plan to do to market, the new loyalty program. And the new loyalty program again is another way for us to have a new customer base attached to an app that we can speak to frequently and bring them into the store and increase frequency. So we have marketing plan for the remaining of the year and throughout fiscal year 2021. Yes, just a few things. First of all, although our sales mix has really tilted to more towards launch and afternoon since the onset of COVID, morning still remains a significant daypart for us. So we're not walking away from that. There are some things that we're considering in terms of innovation and then there are some things that we are accelerating in the innovation pipeline. For instance, we are going to be introducing a plant-based protein box because we know in the afternoon there is this extra boost needed. And so that will come forward quicker than planned. We're also looking at things like, for instance, with curbside, we're trying to bring the lobby to door side. So just recently, we added merchandise to the app. So then if you wanted to order for gift-giving, some of our serveware, a mug, a nice cup. So we've done some of those things, and we'll continue to do that because we're really listening to the customer and understanding what they need and we can evolve and then we can accelerate our innovation pipeline just as quickly as we can. Pat, you wanted to add something? Sure. Let me start off. First of all, Chris, your question around curbside and what would we expect in terms of upside there. It's encouraging what we saw in our trial base. So \u2013 and we know that contactless experience for our customer is more present than ever. So we believe in this new channel for us. But it's really too early for us to tell what the real benefit will be. But we'll come back to you as this thing grows. We'll let you know how that's working for us. In terms of capacity and what we think could help, for instance, our drive-thru. This new handheld, that capacity that we are creating, allows us to do what a lot of retailers call busting the line actually. And so we're able to get out of the store, get out in that line, put an order and in a queue much faster and get those out-the-window times down and get the beverage and food items to the customer much quicker. We're also doing work that handheld will enable if you wanted to just \u2013 if the line began to get long, if you are picking up and trying to walk into the stores. So between handheld and curbside, we feel like we're going to be able to deliver a different customer service and it will unlock and enable some efficiencies that we need and speed. And so we're looking at those two as key drivers."

            "name": "Kevin Johnson",
            "content": "Well, good afternoon, and welcome. Thank you for joining us today. It's been three months since our last earnings call as the entire world, all of humanity has been navigating the COVID-19 pandemic through this very dynamic and challenging period. In times of adversity, values matter. And I'm very proud of how Starbucks partners around the world have responded during this global pandemic. United by our mission and values and guided by three simple principles. Prioritizing the health and well being of Starbucks partners and the customers we serve. Supporting local government and health officials as they work to mitigate and contain the virus. And showing up in a responsible and positive way in each and every community we serve. The dedication, agility and positive energy of our partners inspires me. And for that, I am grateful. Throughout this dynamic period, I believe the combination of principal decision making and transparency in our communication has built trust, trust with all stakeholders. We provided Starbucks partners economic certainty through the shutdown, while prioritizing their health. As we reopen stores, we created safe, familiar and convenient experiences for our customers. We remain committed to doing so as we adapt the store portfolio to cater to evolving patterns of consumer behavior, including on-the-go consumption, mobile order and pickup, drive through and contactless pickup and delivery in accordance with our multi-year strategy, which has been further validated by the unfortunate dynamics created by COVID-19. We showed up in the community to provide free coffee to the frontline healthcare workers who have been caring for those in need. We collaborated with our suppliers. And every step of the way we supported our global license partners in markets around the world. With the strong balance sheet, we took appropriate steps to ensure liquidity and maintained our quarterly dividend payment to shareholders, while maintaining flexibility for the future. And we did all of this while continuing to advance our long-term strategy to position Starbucks for continued success. Trust is earned. And building trust with all stakeholders is a very important attribute of Starbucks. I believe the significant investments we made this quarter have inspired Starbucks partners, strengthened customer loyalty and will pay dividends long into the future as the Starbucks brand is stronger than ever. On today's call, I will summarize the business recovery results that we are driving as we navigate the current situation and how we are rapidly adapting our business for this new reality. My hope is that from this call you understand and take away two important points. First, our recovery plan is working. With the vast majority of stores around the world now reopened, we saw meaningful improvements in both sales and profitability as the quarter unfolded. Additionally, customer affinity for Starbucks is very strong, as demonstrated by improvements in our customer connection scores, growth in customer loyalty and market share gains. While we anticipate these improvements to continue, our balance sheet and the strategic actions we have taken to position Starbucks to weather a more protracted disruption in global economic activity. And second, in response to clear shifts in consumer behavior and preferences, we are now accelerating strategic initiatives for the future and positioning Starbucks for continued, long-term growth. We have moved aggressively to advance our evolution of the store base, to accommodate trends that we have long seen emerging in our business that were only exacerbated by COVID-19. When taken together, these two points indicate a bright future ahead for all stakeholders of the Starbucks Coffee Company. Let me begin in the U.S. where the recovery accelerated throughout Q3. We exited the quarter with 96% of stores open, up from 44% at the beginning of the quarter. With health and well being top of mind, we monitored trends and quickly adapted to support our partners and serve our customers safely and responsibly. Through a combination of new store operating protocols and service channels, we were able to amplify a number of contactless experiences for our customers, including drive-through, entryway pickup with mobile order-and-pay and delivery. And with new proprietary data-driven decision tools that monitor public health conditions, government guidelines, customer preferences and partner sentiment in real-time, we were able to gradually and safely reopen a select number of our U.S. stores for limited seating experiences, expanding to nearly 30% of our U.S. company-operated stores by the end of the quarter. As a result, weekly U.S. comps steadily improved throughout the quarter from the low point, a decline of minus 65% in mid-April up to minus 16% as we exited Q3. And through all of this, we posted all-time high customer connection scores. Looking specifically at the comps of the 3,100 U.S. stores that remained open throughout the entire quarter, those stores improved sequentially from minus 14% comp in May to minus 1% in June to a positive 2% comp for July month-to-date. We have now developed new levels of agility and resilience that position us well for the future with the mindset and capability to safely, effectively and confidently drive our continued recovery. We recognize that markets will experience varying levels of COVID-19 impact until new therapeutics and vaccines are developed, and we are well-positioned to navigate this phase of the pandemic. Today, customers are seeking safe, familiar and convenient experiences in many aspects of their lives. And in that regard, our digital assets have proven to be a competitive advantage. Within the quarter, we saw significant acceleration in the number of customers who downloaded the Starbucks App and joined Starbucks Rewards, totaling 3 million in the quarter and up 17% from Q2. Additionally, engagement with Starbucks Rewards customers outpaced non-Starbucks Rewards members with year-over-year sales growth from Starbucks Rewards customers turning positive in early July. As a result, Starbucks Rewards as a percentage of tender in Q3, rose 4 percentage points from a year ago to 46%, which is above the pre-COVID tread, highlighting our success in acquiring new loyalty members as well as re-engaging our existing customer base. And finally, customer usage of mobile ordering increased to 22% of total transactions, up 6 percentage points from a year ago. Although, our digital platform continues to be a source of strength, disruption to the weekday morning routines, notably, commuting to work and school is a headwind we are focused on across the U.S. as we continue to recover our business. We continue to see improvements in the morning peak period as well as some customer occasions shifting to later in the morning daypart. As we see customer visits shifting from urban cafes to suburban drive-throughs, customers are also purchasing multiple beverages and food items on a single order, essentially a group order. These dynamics have contributed to a meaningful increase in average spend per order compared to pre-pandemic levels, leading to 25% average ticket comp growth for the quarter. As we reopen stores to include mobile orders, entryway pickup and in-store to-go orders, ticket growth moderated and transaction volume increased as the quarter unfolded. Almost 90% of sales volumes in Q3 flow through the combination of drive-through and mobile order-and-pay. In addition, with national coverage in the U.S., Starbucks Delivers transactions tripled in Q3 from Q2 levels, with the highest volume in the late morning and mid-day. All of this indicates that customers are adapting their routines, and we are well-positioned to drive further recovery by simply increasing throughput and enhancing those safe, familiar and convenient experiences customers desire. As I will discuss in greater detail later, that is why we are accelerating innovative store formats, like Starbucks Pickup and new operating protocols, such as curbside delivery as they align closely with the customer preferences that have evolved as a result of COVID-19. Let me now move on to China where at the end of Q3, 99% of stores had reopened with approximately 90% having regular operating hours and over 70% having full seating. Building on the positive recovery momentum from Q2, China demonstrated sequential improvements in monthly comparable sales across Q3, exceeding our expectations for the quarter. In addition to comp sales recovery, we reignited new store development, crossing the 4,400 store milestone with the opening of almost 100 net new stores in the quarter. Mobile order sales mix reached 23% of sales in Q3 with 12% coming from delivery and 11% from mobile order-and-pay, well above the mid-teens levels we saw pre-COVID. As digital adoption accelerates in China, we continue to innovate in ways that deepen customer relationships and extend the reach of the Starbucks experience across a variety of digital platforms and ecosystems. In May, we launched a new WeChat Mini program with new functionality for WeChat users, including Starbucks Delivers. And in June, we enhanced the Starbucks Rewards program, introducing a multi-tier redemption system, similar to what we rolled out in the U.S. last year. Fueled by these new digital initiatives, we have seen strong sequential growth in active rewards members. In fact, the Q3 90-day active members increased 25% over Q2 to 9.9 million, representing 9% growth over the prior year. We are pleased with the progress we are making in China to recover sales. However, we are reminded by the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Beijing, and the corresponding actions taken to mitigate the spread that our new normal requires us to monitor the situation in every community, rapidly adapt and innovate in ways that continue to bring more customers into our stores and increase the frequency of those visits. With the differentiated capabilities and strategic advantages we enjoy in China, including our digital partnership with Alibaba and our access to emerging technologies through our co-investment relationship with Sequoia Capital, we are confident that we will substantially recover our sales in China by the end of this calendar year, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand in our fastest growing market. Moving to Channel Development. This has been a quarter where demand for at-home coffee has soared, and our Channel Development business has demonstrated tremendous resilience and gained market share as customers adjust to their at-home routines. In the U.S., Starbucks share of total packaged coffee grew significantly in Q3. 21% growth in dollar sales, outpacing the coffee category, which grew 13% in the quarter. Our domestic ready-to-drink business grew by 11%, gaining 2 points of share in Q3. Our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle combined with our ready-to-drink partners, including PepsiCo and Tingyi, have extended our ability to meet customers where they are, which is particularly important in the current environment. We are now in 53 markets with the Global Coffee Alliance, more than tripling our at-home coffee presence versus a year ago. And we expect to be in over 60 markets by the end of this fiscal year. With our near-term business recovery fully in motion and delivering results, let me now focus on how we are leveraging this disruptive period to accelerate value-creating initiatives that further differentiate Starbucks and fuel predictable, sustainable, long-term growth. Why is this important? In every industry there are periods of disruption that create great opportunity for those businesses that adapt to the disruption, invest in relevant ways and strengthen their differentiation and competitive advantage. Those businesses that fail to evolve, typically fall behind. Given the strength of our brand, our advanced digital capabilities and our strong balance sheet, I believe this is one of those rare opportunities to move aggressively and further differentiate Starbucks from our competition, and I will highlight three areas where we are doing just that. Convenience store formats, digital customer engagement and plant-based menu items. Over the years, we have demonstrated a clear track record of re-imagining store formats to better serve customers. And we are now re-imagining how we further elevate the customer experience by leveraging these various store formats to create a network of stores in a community. Think of this as blending highly complementary store formats throughout a community that collectively better serve the expanding and shifting need states of customers in that community. And thus, increasing revenue in the trade area, while optimizing profitability and investment returns. We have been blending store formats in suburban markets for years where we have complemented traditional Starbucks stores, the third place experience, with drive-through and mobile order pickup experiences that serve customers' need for convenience. We are introducing a simple handheld device to further increase throughput and improve the customer experience. And we are introducing a new curbside pickup experience that will be available in 700 to 1,000 locations by the end of this quarter, which enables incremental customer business. In urban core markets where drive-throughs and curbside aren't feasible, we will begin to reposition our store formats to create a blend of traditional Starbucks stores with new Starbucks Pickup stores. These stores are built in a smaller footprint and create a familiar and convenient walk-through experience that is very relevant to customers in urban markets. Each of these Starbucks Pickup stores will ideally be located within a three-minute to five-minute walk from a traditional Starbucks store, giving customers the flexibility to enjoy their beverage in our store or on-the-go. We plan to accelerate the development of over 50 of these stores over the next 12 months to 18 months with a view to have several hundred in the U.S. over the next three years to five years. We have also accelerated the rollout of a similar concept in China, Starbucks Now stores, adding nine new locations in Q3 for a total of 15. We are seeing first-hand the power of integrating physical and digital customer touch points to meet customers' growing need for convenience. In addition to accelerating our store transformation strategy, we are creating new capabilities that expand digital customer engagement. We're having great success bringing new customers onto the app and into the rewards program. We will build on this momentum in the fall when we introduce a new pay-as-you-go option for Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. and Canada. This significant new addition will open up an invitation to join Starbucks Rewards to a much wider audience. While nearly half of our sales now comes from Rewards members who are pre-loading their store value cards, we've heard from many more customers that they would like an option to earn rewards when paying directly with cash, credit, debit and select digital wallets. By adding this capability to Starbucks Rewards, we will give customers more ways to pay and earn rewards when using the Starbucks App. In China, since we began our China digital partnership with Alibaba two years ago, we've worked together to deliver innovative digital services to our customers and transform to coffee industry in China. As part of our ongoing partnership, we are expanding our reach to customers across the Chinese Mainland by introducing the Starbucks Now mobile order-and-pay feature to multiple platforms in the Alibaba Digital Economy, including Taobao, Digital Mapping, an information provider and map, local services app Qbay and Alipay, which serve a combined user base of nearly 1 billion customers. Through these apps, customers will be able to pre-order and pay for their favorite Starbucks beverage and food online and then pickup in-person at most Starbucks stores across the Chinese Mainland. Previously, this service was only available through our Starbucks China Mobile App. This is a significant step forward, and we value our partnership with Alibaba greatly. We are listening to our customers and continually seeking ways to make Starbucks more relevant, inviting and uplifting through personalized human connection, the seamless link between the customer experience we create in our stores and the power of the digital customer relationships. Finally, our recent announcements of plant-based beverage and food innovation through partnerships with Beyond Meat, Impossible and Oatly, reflect the fact that customers want more plant-based options. We believe that customers are embracing plant-based choices because they are good, good. Good for your health and good for the planet. We are shifting more beverage and food menu items to include plant-based options. Recent examples include Cold Brew with Cinnamon Almondmilk Foam in the U.S. And Oat Milk versions of two signature Starbucks beverages in China, Oat Milk Latte and Oat Milk Matcha Latte. Early results from these innovations are very encouraging. We are accelerating efforts to expand these offerings for our customers. And in the process, making meaningful progress against our planet positive goals. Let me close by reinforcing two key messages, I hope you take away from this call. First, our recovery strategy is working, as evidenced by the improving business results across all of our key segments. Second, we have future-proofed our business model and reinforced our balance sheet to enable us to play offense by accelerating key strategic initiatives that further differentiate Starbucks and reinforced the long-term sustainable growth opportunity ahead. Those two points reinforce an optimistic view of our future. Before we conclude this call, I want to thank you all for joining us today. The last several months have been quite unprecedented in regard to public health and commerce given the impacts of COVID-19. Simultaneously, there is a powerful awakening underway in America to address systemic racism and social inequality, issues that Starbucks has always embraced, believing that we have a role and responsibility to advance positive change. That has never been more true than it is today. The mission and values that unite Starbucks partners continue to help us navigate these complex times and inspire us to promote equity, create opportunities and build resilient communities. And building upon the deliberate actions we have taken to provide a warm, welcoming and safe environment for everyone, our work will not end. This is who we are at our core. And it is what our partners and customers expect of us. I again thank all Starbucks partners. Your commitment, dedication and caring for one another as well as our customers and the communities in which we operate through this pandemic is heartwarming. You are the heartbeat of Starbucks, and I am proud to work in service of you. As always, we look forward to bringing you along our journey to create opportunities and strengthen our communities. Thank you for your time and attention today and for your ongoing support. Now, over to Pat. Yes. Jeffrey, this is Kevin. I'll take your questions. First of all, I'll start with your second question, China. I think as we see a resurgence of cases, similar to what we've seen in Beijing, that causes a little bit of \u2013 that's what's caused a little bit of the delay by a quarter in China. Not significantly, it's about, I'd say, four or five weeks and now Beijing is back on a positive trajectory. But because it was such a large market, I think that's what's slowed it down. But it has nothing to do, in my opinion, with the \u2013 anything related to the economic. It was more \u2013 it's more just as a resurgence happens in a large market like that that we \u2013 when it happens like that, we're able to sort of turn the dial back slightly on the range of customers' experiences we serve through to the principles that we outlined and we help support government and local health officials as they contain the spread of the virus. They successfully have done that Beijing. And so then we start turning the dial backup and opening up those customer experiences. And I think that's a very positive thing because I think as a company, we've now taken this playbook that was developed in China and adapted for the U.S. and we basically have embedded it into our store protocols and our operating procedures. So that in 32 stores around the world, if there happens to be a flare-up in a certain city or a certain portion of a market, the stores in that market has the agility to basically turn the dial down if they need to or turn it back up if things are recovering. And that puts us in a position of confidence in how we can continue to navigate the global pandemic as it evolves. And so that was the contributing factor in China. In terms of recession, I'll leave the predictions of economic growth to the economists. But what we've seen is continued demand for Starbucks. In fact, you look at what we've outlined. The number one thing we can do to continue to grow our same-store comps and the recovery is basically increase the throughput in the channels that are safe, familiar and convenient. And that's why, for example, we're deploying these handheld point-of-sales. I don't know how many of you have seen a drive-thru, Starbucks drive-thru. There is typically cars lined up and often times out into the street. So where we deploy this handheld point-of-sale, we can now have a Starbucks partner out there taking orders walking through that line of cars, which is going to dramatically increase the throughput at drive-thru. Similar, enabling curbside will open up more customer occasions for us to continue to drive more transactions into our stores. And so I think based on what we're seeing in terms of the demand and by being able to increase throughput in those channels that are viewed as safe and convenient by our customers, that's going to help us on the recovery curve. In terms of should recession \u2013 recessionary period start to hit, I think we've differentiated ourselves. We've got lots of points of presence. We're serving customers. I think the brand is strong. Our digital reach is strong. And I think we're well positioned to navigate anything that might come our way. Thanks, Sara. Pat, do you want to take that one? Yes, David. Thanks for your question or your comments and for your question. Why don't I let Roz describe sort of the initiatives we have focused on that morning daypart, and then I'll sort of punctuate a couple of things. So Roz, let me hand it over to you. Thank you, Roz. I think you hit the right thing, the digital customer relationships. Just keep in mind, we just added 3 million new digital customers that registered for the rewards program and being able to communicate with them personally. And then as Roz said, the work they've done on increasing throughput at drive-thru and watching curbside, that just opens up new channels. So that's spot on. Thank you, Roz. Yes, John. Happy to answer your question. We do expect margins will improve gradually as we move through the fourth quarter and into next year. But in the next couple of quarters, we do expect margins will continue to lag prior year. And although the margin impacts of partner benefits and inventory reserves are expected to subside considerably in Q4, the leading driver of margin pressure will be continuing to deleverage a fixed costs, such as occupancy and depreciation expense as we work to restore sales. So it's largely a function of the speed with which we can recover sales and then how we manage some incremental cost to our business, because we do expect to see certain costs persist due to our new way of operating, that includes cleaning supplies and the associated labor. But it is premature to say whether those costs will drive a structural change to our operating margin as we continue to innovate our operating systems and technology to improve throughput and drive efficiencies. We also expect a margin tailwind from the transformation of our U.S. urban market strategy as that is rolled out and includes the repositioning of some existing assets, and that will help to offset any new incremental costs. And we also expect margin benefits from ongoing efforts to renegotiate operating leases. So we do expect to see a combination of margin headwinds and tailwinds, but far away the biggest driver of the margin recovery will be the sales recovery. We do expect that there will be a lag between sales recovery and margin recovery as we continue to refine our ability to operate differently in the new environment. Hi, Sharon. We can hear you. Great. Go ahead, Roz. Thanks, John. Roz, why don't you take part of John's question on what we're doing with operating hours and sort of efficiency in the store? And then, Pat, why don't you take the back half of this question on G&A and how that all comes together on the P&L. Roz? Roz, do you want to take that? Thank you, Matt. Roz, why don't you go ahead and take both of those questions if you could? Yes. Jon, let me comment then Roz I'll let you add anything, I think, look, we've always been really clear that the three things that we focus on that really drive our growth is; number one, the customer experience. That's the experience in our stores and these different channels we're talking about. Number two is extending that experience in our store to digital customer relations \u2013 relationships. And number three is primarily beverage innovation. We're beverage first company and then we attach food. And so I think that same formula works whether you work from home or you work from work. I do think what is the focus right now until there's a vaccine, we just realized that we've got to focus on those experiences that customers optimize around whether they're working from home or not, which are safe, familiar and convenient. And so our beverage innovation is going to continue to focus on all the great things we've been doing around our cold beverage lineup, with cold foam, coffee forward beverages, our refreshers, all of that is going to continue to move forward. And I don't necessarily see that as being a driver of the fact that people work from home or we have curbside. We're going to continue to innovate in ways that are relevant to our customers independent of the channel by which they buy from us. I do think, as Roz pointed out, we're seeing larger ticket. And I think part of that is a function of people work from home. They make a Starbucks run and they buy for the whole family or they're buying more group sort of orders. They're attaching more food. And I think that bodes well for the innovation that we've been driving and announcing around our plant-based offerings. Plant-based is becoming a very popular whether it's plant-based milks or the Impossible breakfast sandwich that we launched in the U.S., the Beyond Meat offerings that we put on the menu in Canada and China. And so our innovation agenda is going to continue to drive around the things that we know are relevant to our customers, things that inspire our partners and stay true to handcrafted beverages, that's what differentiates us. And I think we're going to maintain a focus on those things. Roz, I'll let \u2013 if there's anything else you want to add or \u2013 and then Pat who got some comments too. So let's go to Roz. Roz, why don't you take the first part and then Pat will comment. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start by saying, throughout this quarter, we have navigated the pandemic in a way that I consider very consistent with Starbucks mission and values. And in many ways, we navigated this by prioritizing the safety and the health and well being of our partners and the customers we serve. And unlike many, many others in the industry, in April, \u2013 yes, In April, we closed all our stores with the exception of drive-thrus. And that was clearly to provide a safe environment for our partners and as well as the contactless experience for us to handcraft beverages and food items for our customers. During that period, we had significant demand through the drive-thru. It was quite amazing. The lines and the amount of time the customer wait in line in drive-thru to get their Starbucks. And so that was the first indication that there is a very powerful customer affinity to Starbucks, even in a global pandemic. Now, as we started re-opening stores in May and customers \u2013 we began to \u2013 with mobile ordering and contactless entryway pickup, we continue to see customers coming back to us. Clearly, the priority or the customer behavior was around safe, familiar, convenient experiences. And so that's why I think we saw such a dramatic increase in the number of app downloads and customers that joined the rewards program because that is the safest way to order. You order on your phone and then you can pick it up contactless or you can get it for delivery. And so that was another indication. So we quickly figure out, if we launch curbside, we're going to get more customers. If we put handheld point-of-sale at the drive-thru lines, we get drive-thru. When we open our stores for to-go orders or even limited seating, we see customers come back. And yet at the same time, we stayed true to the principles that we outlined, which is prioritize the health and well being of our Starbucks partners, the customers we serve, to also support government, local health officials as they work to contain the spread of the virus, and third is to just show up in a positive and responsible way in every community we serve. Now when I look at the data, our customer connection scores are at an all-time high. And part of that is, I believe, the way that we've navigated this has built trust. It's built trust in our Starbucks partners that we're always going to do the right thing. We put people ahead of profit, whether it was providing economic certainty for our partners or ensuring that our customers had safe ways to interact with us. I think that deposit in the reservoir of trust is building and strengthening customer affinity. Obviously, the deployment of mobile reach is building more customers that become sticky. They build that relationship with Starbucks, we can communicate with them, we can serve their needs, we can personalize that experience for them. And then the investments we're making to make it easier for customers to have those experience is just is continuing to unfold. And we saw that certainly in the month of June where we saw a very good response from customers that helped us exceed expectations on what we would see in sales and then that's continued into July to progress. So when I look at the fact that our share in the month of June, we gained share in the month of June, and I'm confident that we're on a path to continue to gain share. So if there is any question that closing stores was going to create a longer term loss of market share is disproven because we saw clearly in the month of May, we did \u2013 we were even on share in the month of June, we gained share. And I suspect as we keep doing these things, we're going to continue to gain share. And in the process, customer connection scores are at an all-time high and our customer affinity that we measure on a regular basis is also very strong. So I think we have line of sight visibility to what our customers need and want. And as we deliver that, they respond. And I think the plan that we have in place in accelerating the strategic initiatives are right in the sweet spot of customer shift and customer behavior. So I think about this as the investments we made this quarter, we're playing the long game. This is about building trust with our customers and then positioning Starbucks for long-term sustainable growth. And I feel very good about the fact that we're now in a position where we've operationalize these store protocols and we know how to adapt very rapidly and we do that with distributed leadership. 32,000 stores around the world. There's 32,000 store managers, each one of them is paying attention to what's happening in their community. They have the playbook. They know how to adapt. And so we are in many ways we're back in March, April, people would describe this as we are navigating a crisis, this global pandemic. Well, today, we're not \u2013 this is not a crisis any longer in my opinion. We are navigating a global pandemic, but we know exactly how to do it. That's woven into the fabric of how we operate, and partners are rising to the occasion. So I feel very good about where we're at. I feel very good about the strategic initiatives. And the data that we see on customer response is spot on. So that's where we are from where we were 90 days ago when we spoke with you last on the earnings call. And it's all credit to our Starbucks partners. They've done a phenomenal job. Let me just thank all of you for joining us today. My hope is that through this discussion we've been able to give you a sense of the confidence we have in our ability to navigate this global pandemic. Our recovery strategy is working. And we're accelerating the strategic initiatives that further differentiate Starbucks for the future. We're doing this in a way that is true to our mission and our values, and we're on the front foot right now. But also acknowledging that like everyone else in this world, we've got to monitor and adapt and be agile. But I'm very proud of my Starbucks partners and how they've responded. And I just want to take an opportunity to thank all of you, our stakeholders, for your support and we look forward to the continued dialog. So thanks everybody."

I will now turn the call over to Kevin.\nKevin Johnson: Good afternoon and welcome. Around the world, people, frontline responders, governments and businesses are all navigating extraordinary times. On behalf of Starbucks, I want to extend our deepest compassion and empathy for all those impacted by loss of life, feelings of anxiety and isolation and fears of both health and economic uncertainty during this pandemic. It was just three weeks ago, in the spirit of continued transparency, when Pat and I shared with all stakeholders, our second intra-quarter update on how COVID-19 has impacted our business and how we are responding. Today, continued recovery in China strengthens our belief that these impacts are temporary and that we will emerge from this global pandemic with new insights and capabilities that will make our business even stronger and more relevant. The principles we developed to drive our decision-making since the pandemic started in January are serving us well, bringing focus to our response and recovery effort. The three simple principles are prioritizing the health and well-being of our partners and customers, playing a constructive role in supporting health and government officials as they work to mitigate the spread of this virus and showing up in a positive and responsible way to serve our communities. In our update to stakeholders on April 8, we shared that the positive business momentum that drove one of the strongest holiday seasons in the history of our company continued well into our second quarter in the United States. Our performance was obviously disrupted by the impacts of COVID-19, but we are confident that the Starbucks brand is well positioned and that our Growth at Scale agenda remains intact and will propel future growth when we emerge from this current crisis. I will share some notable highlights from Q2 and then offer some perspective on how we expect to recover our business over time. Q2 was shaping up to be an exceptional quarter for Starbucks, driven by strong performance in the U.S. and Channel Development, even while we were simultaneously navigating the impact of COVID-19 in China. However near the end of the quarter, the pandemic started to materially impact our business outside of China both significantly in the U.S. As a result, consolidated revenue in Q2 was $6 billion, reflecting a 5% decline compared to prior year, primarily due to a 10% contraction in comparable store sales globally, driven by temporary store closures, modified store operations and slower traffic, partially offset by strength in Channel Development. In China, where the pandemic impacted our business for most of Q2, revenue and comparable store sales declined year-over-year by $325 million and 50% respectively. Today, almost 100% of our stores in China are open, many with limited seating, reduced hours and other safety protocols in place. Starbucks stores that remain closed in China are primarily located in cinemas and enclosed entertainment venues along with international travel hubs and certain tourist zones where restrictions are still in effect. Since we started reopening stores in late February, we have seen meaningful improvements in China comparable store sales in commercial, residential and office locations. We are also seeing the mix of in-store sales continuing to rise. For the month of April, comparable store sales in China were down approximately 35%, marking strong improvement from a weekly low of minus 90% in mid-February. Importantly, even though new store development activities were suspended for most of the quarter, we opened 59 net new locations in China during Q2 and another seven locations added thus far in April. We are expecting to open at least 500 net new stores in fiscal 2020 with as many as 100 new stores originally planned for this year deferred to fiscal 2021. This represents a rapid reacceleration of our new store development and speaks to the amazing spirit and enormous capability of our team in China. Given this progress, we believe our recovery plan is working and we remain optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the long-term growth potential of the premium coffee market in China. We believe, barring any new disruptions, that our business in China is on a path to substantial recovery by the end of this fiscal year. Just last week, we launched the Starbucks GOOD GOOD marketing campaign, which features plant-based alternatives in products and packaging. With this program Starbucks in China introduced Oatly, a plant-based milk alternative. Also Starbucks is the first in China to offer national distribution of Beyond Meat's plant-based proteins with new Asian menu items served in packaging made from plant-based materials. This campaign is just one step in our larger aspiration to be planet positive, while introducing relevant menu choices for customers. Over the past 20 years in China, we've established an admired and trusted brand by investing in our partners and delivering a unique premium experience to our customers. We continue to play the long game in China as we invest in our future. The state-of-the-art Coffee Innovation Park that we will be opening outside Shanghai in 2022 will serve as a key component of Starbucks worldwide coffee roasting network for customers in China and is a testament to the growth opportunity we see for specialty coffee in the market. Starbucks' premium customer experience is highly differentiated in China and the brand is as strong as ever. We continue to thoughtfully invest in China a market that has significant long-term growth potential for Starbucks. I am proud of how Starbucks China continues to pave the way as one of our two lead growth markets. Now on to the other lead growth market for Starbucks, the U.S. Coming off one of the strongest holiday quarters in the history of Starbucks, U.S. momentum continued to build well into Q2. Prior to mid-March revenue growth in the U.S. was accelerating to the strongest level in over four years, driven by comparable store sales growth of 8%, including comparable transaction growth of 4%. Additionally two-year comps were tracking to 12% growth, the strongest in over three years. With growth across all dayparts and strong contributions from both our Starbucks Rewards members and occasional customers, it is very clear that our focus on the customer experience, beverage innovation and digital customer relationships is a powerful combination. Our performance was interrupted mid-March when a national emergency was declared to mitigate COVID-19. And we decided to close over 50% of our company-operated stores and limit service to drive-through and delivery for those that remained open. In that final three weeks of Q2 U.S. comp sales swiftly decelerated, ending the quarter down 3%, driven by a 7% contraction in traffic comp. Based on the experience we gained navigating COVID-19 in China, we have been as well prepared as anyone for this mitigate-and-contain phase in the U.S., particularly as our stores are well positioned to adopt operational safety protocols, while still meeting our customers' needs. In the U.S. almost 60% of our company-operated stores include drive-through and over 80% of our customer occasions before the crisis were on-the-go, with the majority of these orders being placed at the drive-through or by using the Starbucks app to mobile order for pickup or delivery. Of note, during the second quarter 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members, our highly routinized highly engaged and loyal customer base, with whom we can directly communicate digitally increased to 19.4 million in the U.S., up 15% from a year ago. Since the crisis started, we have seen an average ticket growth increased throughout the quarter, a result of group ordering as customers through this pandemic are making Starbucks runs for their homes, local essential businesses and for frontline response teams. Overall, Nitro Cold Brew and refreshment continue to lead for beverage. And our new alt milk beverages, Almondmilk Honey Flat White and Coconutmilk Latte are also resonating well with customers. Our innovation in food, notably our new breakfast wraps, have surpassed expectations to date. Similar to our experience in China, we are transitioning into a new phase of operations we call monitor and adapt. We are now leveraging digital tools that enable us to monitor the COVID-19 situation in every community across the U.S. and leverage a variety of service options from contactless service, entryway pickup, curbside delivery where parking is available and at home delivery, that allow us to thoughtfully reopen stores and scale up operations. We are finding new innovative ways to serve our communities, prioritizing the safety of our customers and partners, with a focus on exceeding public health standards and adjusting to new customer expectations. The strength of our digital reach, combined with a range of service options, is enabling us to reopen stores, community by community in a thoughtful way, using the three simple principles that have guided our response thus far. Our monitoring capability provides the input necessary for decisions that enable us to turn the dial up or down depending on the situation in a specific community, or a specific store. This is the beginning of the recovery as we reopen stores, beginning in early May and we expect to have approximately 90% of all company-operated U.S. Starbucks stores reopened by early June with enhanced safety protocols and modified schedules. We are also sharing our store safety protocols with our licensees across the U.S. who continue to responsibly operate their stores particularly in grocery locations across the country. My summary on our U.S. business is this. This monitor-and-adapt phase in the U.S. is the inflection point for reopening stores and begins a recovery process that requires ongoing monitoring community by community to rapidly adapt and drive the recovery. We are well positioned to leverage our digital assets and new operating formats like contactless pickup and curbside to expand service to customers. And our focus on the customer experience, beverage innovation and digital differentiates Starbucks and will enable us to regain the momentum we had prior to COVID-19. At Starbucks, the third place has always been about community connection and convenience. And we expect to strengthen this competitive advantage through continued improvements in our digital capabilities and innovative store formats enabling us to connect with customers and serve our communities safely and with even greater convenience. I am proud of how Starbucks partners in the U.S. have shown up through all of this. The fact that while serving their communities, they also served over 1 million free cups of coffee to the frontline responders, who have worked tirelessly to care for others which makes us all very proud. Leveraging the playbook that was developed in China and refined in the U.S., we are working closely with our international license partners to navigate the current environment and prepare for recovery guided by our mission and values and commitment to delivering the Starbucks Experience safely and responsibly. With Starbucks in 82 markets, we are committed to supporting our license partners around the world as they too navigate this challenge. And finally a few comments on our Channel Development business. The strategic value of our Channel Development segment has been clearly evident in the current environment. Selling Starbucks products through multiple channels amplifies the brand and extends our ability to meet customers where they are, even when they are unable to visit our retail stores. Through the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle and our ready-to-drink partners including Pepsi and Tingyi, we offer a wide range of Starbucks products down the aisle in grocery stores, at mass merchants, in convenience stores and online. In Q2 this segment's revenue grew by 16% which includes a 5% favorable impact, primarily related to the Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activity, boosting our share of the coffee market outside of specialty retail. This continues to be an important element of our Growth at Scale agenda. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle was established just 20 months ago. And since that time, we have now expanded the Starbucks brand to nearly 50 markets around the world. It is clear that our channel strategy is working extremely well. Before I hand over to Pat to walk you through the details of the quarter and balance-of-year perspective, I want to reinforce one key point. Starbucks is resilient. For over 49 years since our founding, we have overcome every challenge presented to us and are overcoming this challenge as well. Our China business is on a path to recovery. Our U.S. business is entering the phase of reopening stores, adapting to the new reality and restoring and rebuilding momentum. And our Channel Development business is posting very strong results and acting as a brand amplifier. Our Growth at Scale agenda provides the focus and discipline for us to successfully navigate this challenge. We remain confident in our approach. We understand there's much more to do and that we must be agile as the world navigates COVID-19 and works to create a vaccine. We have a very clear path going forward. We are optimistic about the future and we believe Starbucks will emerge from this experience even stronger, more determined and more focused than ever before. But the real credit goes to Starbucks partners. Together, we are emotionally connected to a mission grounded in humanity. And together we are making principled decisions true to our values. Partners are the key to our resilience. It is why we will do all we can to provide them with economic certainty and support them through this challenging period. After all partners are the heartbeat of Starbucks. Now, I'll turn it over to Pat for a deeper dive into our Q2 financial results, an update on our FY 2020 outlook, and an overview of our financial readiness to weather this crisis. Pat?\nPat Grismer: Thank you, Kevin and good afternoon everyone. I like to start by echoing Kevin's appreciation for all of our Starbucks partners who continue to demonstrate their dedication to Starbucks and their communities in spite of the hardships facing the global community right now. Unsurprisingly, business disruption attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted our financial results. Our belief is that these impacts are temporary as evidenced by our continued recovery in China as Kevin outlined, so I will highlight the financial impacts to provide investors with perspective on our normalized performance for the second quarter as well as insight into how future quarters' results may be affected by these conditions. In all cases we have estimated these impacts by comparing Q2 actual reported results to our internal forecasts specific to each operating segment and market. These forecasts were developed based on the most recent prevailing trends in revenue and profitability prior to the onset of material COVID-19-related business impacts specific to each operating segment and market. These impacts first started in China in late January and materialized in other markets later in the quarter. For the second quarter, Starbucks produced consolidated revenue of $6 billion, down 5% from the prior year. We estimate the COVID-19 impact to be approximately $915 million due to temporary store closures, restricted sales channels, shortened operating hours, and severely reduced customer traffic. As we shared earlier this month in an 8-K, Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.32, down 47% from the prior year. We estimate the COVID-19 impact to be approximately $0.45 including not only profit flow-through on the revenue impact that I noted earlier but also incremental costs that we incurred in response to the pandemic which I will outline later. I will first provide some highlights of segment operating results and consolidated margin performance for Q2 and we'll then share some perspective on balance of year results and liquidity. Revenue for our Americas segment was flat in Q2 relative to the prior year at $4.3 billion as incremental sales from net new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months was effectively offset by a 3% decline in comparable store sales. Through the first 10 weeks of the quarter, the U.S. delivered 8% comparable store sales growth building on strong momentum from the past few quarters. But this was more than offset by a sharp decline in the final three weeks of the quarter due to the COVID-19 impact that I mentioned earlier ultimately resulting in a 3% decline for the quarter. We estimate America's Q2 revenue decline attributable to COVID-19 to be approximately $450 million. Through the month of February, Americas' non-GAAP operating margin improved meaningfully versus the prior year reflecting strong sales leverage and continued supply chain efficiencies. However, due to the rapid sales decline and significant investments in response to the COVID-19 outbreak that started to materialize in the U.S. in mid-March, Americas Q2 non-GAAP operating margin landed at 14.4%, down from 20.3% in the prior year. We estimate that the COVID-19 impact to Americas non-GAAP operating income was approximately $420 million in Q2 consisting of flow through on lost sales as well as incremental investments notably catastrophe wages as well as enhanced pay and benefits programs in support of our retail store partners, inventory write-offs, and store safety supplies. Moving on to International, business disruption resulting from COVID-19 impacted the segment for the majority of Q2 starting with China in late January and extending to other markets in March including Japan. For the quarter, International's revenue declined by $395 million or 26% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by a 31% decrease in comparable store sales, partially offset by 11% net new store growth over the past 12 months. We estimate International's Q2 revenue decline attributable to COVID-19 to be approximately $465 million. International's Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 3.9% down from 19.3% in the prior year. We estimate that the COVID-19 impact to International non-GAAP operating income was approximately $280 million in Q2 with components similar to what I outlined for the Americas. Further contributing to the margin decline was a higher-than-normal sales mix of delivery transactions as customers shifted to off-premise consumption, resulting in higher commission and packaging costs. On to Channel Development. Revenue was $519 million in Q2 fiscal '20, an increase of 16% over the prior year. When normalizing for the 5% favorable impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related items, Channel Development's revenue grew 11% in Q2 over the prior year. Transition-related items include higher inventory sales as Nestle prepared to fulfill foodservice customer orders under the Global Coffee Alliance as well as a benefit related to the transfer of certain single-serve product activities to Nestle on a go-forward basis. The segment's non-GAAP operating margin was 37.8%, an improvement of 360 basis points over the prior year. Normalizing for the 330 basis point impact of the transition activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 30 basis points in Q2. Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin of 9.2% in Q2 contracted 660 basis points year-over-year. We estimate the COVID-19 impact to non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $700 million, inclusive of the amounts I cited for the Americas and International. In relation to the $915 million of consolidated revenue impact that I mentioned earlier, this equates to approximately 80% of flow-through on lost revenue which is materially higher than the 50% variable flow-through rate that we typically observe in our business, reflecting the significant investments we've made in the short term to support our partners and manage our brand for the long term. We believe that these investments will strengthen our competitive position and fuel our recovery as we emerge from the effects of the pandemic. Now moving on to our outlook for fiscal 2020. Given the global nature of our business, our ability to provide updated guidance for the remainder of the year is predicated on the current phase of COVID-19 response within each of our markets. As Kevin discussed, China, our second largest market is in the recovery phase, which enhances our ability to estimate balance of year results. However, the U.S., Japan and Canada, which round out our four largest markets are in earlier phases of COVID-19 impacted response, which limits our ability to provide enterprise-level guidance at this time. As a result, we are continuing to suspend formal guidance for fiscal 2020, while providing updated outlooks for selected businesses and financial metrics. I'll start with China. With the progress we have seen to date including having 98% of our stores open as of today and continued improvements in customer traffic as Kevin mentioned, we believe China's comparable store sales will continue to improve in the second half of fiscal 2020 relative to the 50% decline reported for Q2, declining 25% to 35% in Q3 and trending towards roughly flat by the end of Q4 relative to the prior year, yielding a decline of 15% to 25% in China's comparable sales for the full fiscal year. While we temporarily paused new store openings in China in Q2 given COVID-19, development activities resumed towards the end of the quarter and we are on track to open at least 500 net new stores this fiscal year or over 80% of our original target. This will position us well to continue to capture the growth opportunity we see in China in fiscal '21 and beyond. Combining the effects of comparable store sales declines and new store development deferrals, we estimate revenue in China to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 by approximately $750 million to $850 million with an estimated EPS impact of between $0.30 and $0.37 in fiscal 2020 barring any new disruptions. Moving to the U.S. Today approximately 50% of our company operated stores and 46% of our licensed stores in the U.S. are temporarily closed. But we expect to begin reopening many of them next week, initially with modified operations and shorter operating hours. We currently expect approximately 90% of company operated stores to be open by early June. Additionally, modifications to increase throughput in drive through delivery and MOP channels in our existing stores are already underway along with a new entryway handoff solution, which incorporates best-in-class safety protocols. And as Kevin mentioned, we are also exploring curbside service in locations where parking is available. We believe the focused actions we are taking to deliver a contactless customer experience coupled with continued beverage innovation and expanded digital capabilities will help to restore the upward momentum in our U.S. business that we\u2019re experiencing prior to the onset of COVID-19. To date in April, comparable sales growth for U.S. company operated stores that are open is averaging approximately minus 25% or indexing at 75% of prior year levels. However, as we have not yet entered the recovery phase in the U.S., it is premature to provide a balance-of-year estimate of U.S. revenue or earnings at this time. But given the late quarter onset of COVID-19 impacts in the U.S., as well as a materially higher flow-through rate on lost sales in the U.S., we do expect the negative financial impacts of COVID-19 to be significantly greater in Q3 compared to Q2 and to extend into Q4. So while the initial impacts in the U.S. are less severe than they were in China from a comparable store perspective owing to the prevalence of our drive-through model in the U.S., we do expect the impacts to persist for a longer period of time as we move through the monitor and adapt phase with the recovery phase extending into fiscal 2021. We expect the COVID-19 impacts in Canada and Japan, as well as in our international license businesses will follow a similar pattern as the U.S. very pronounced in the third quarter with some easing of these impacts expected in the fourth quarter as these businesses move into the recovery phase. In any event based on our substantial experience in China today, we continue to believe that these impacts are temporary that our brand is resilient and our business will fully recover over time. At the enterprise level, we expect the absolute flow-through impact of COVID-19 to be materially greater in Q3 compared to Q2 in particular due to the longer duration of U.S., Canada and Japan business disruption in Q3 compared to Q2. That said, we expect the rate of flow-through on lost sales in Q3 to be slightly lower than in Q2 and to ease further in Q4 as we take appropriate steps to restore the profitability of company operated stores as they reopen in the back half of the year. Consistent with the approach we have taken in our two interim update this quarter, we will provide transparent updates as to what we are seeing and how that shapes our perspective on the balance of year financial results as we execute our store reopening plan and have increased visibility into business performance trends in the U.S. and other markets. We expect to provide our next update in June after we've evaluated the performance of stores we opened in the U.S. and better understand the possible duration of temporary closures in Japan. From our perspective, the reopening of stores and actions we are taking to position ourselves when the crisis subsides do not fully define recovery. Recovery in our view is when a company operated market delivers positive comparable store sales growth and all existing stores are open with the exception of those undergoing renovation. Finally, on a reported basis, Channel Development revenue is expected to decline between 6% and 8% in fiscal 2020 relative to the prior year as we lap certain transition items related to the Global Coffee Alliance that benefited the segment's top line growth in fiscal 2019 with the impact being more pronounced in Q3 and far less pronounced in Q4. Additionally, the disruption resulting from COVID-19 is expected to adversely impact foodservice under the Global Coffee Alliance and our ready-to-drink business during the balance of fiscal 2020. The segment's operating margin is expected to improve modestly in fiscal 2020 relative to the prior year. The cash flow implications of these near-term operating results are very material. But the scale of our company combined with the strength of our balance sheet enables us to manage our business for long-term growth, while dealing with short-term business realities. In essence, we are investing in relationships with key constituents not only to preserve those relationships, but to strengthen them for the future. Let me provide several examples of how we are thinking about this. First, through salary and wage continuation and through premium pay for those working on the front lines of our business, both as communicated through the end of May we are investing in our partners who are critical to the Starbucks Experience and instrumental to our long-term success. Second, by extending more flexible development and financial terms in Q3, we are investing in our international licensees, who are our partners in driving long-term growth. Third, through certain accelerated payments, we are helping strategic suppliers weather this crisis so that they can sustain the supply of our proprietary products and support our ongoing product innovation. And fourth, by honoring our upcoming quarterly dividend declaration we are supporting our shareholders with a predictable return of capital in an uncertain investment environment. Our next dividend is payable on May 22 to shareholders of record on May 8. As disclosed in our most recent 8-K in addition to accessing additional capital to bridge near-term cash needs, which we expect to peak in Q3, we are creating additional room for investment in our partners and the business more broadly by suspending share repurchases, reducing discretionary expenses and deferring certain capital expenditures. Due primarily to the deferral of some new store openings and store refurbishments, we now expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to total approximately $1.5 billion or $300 million lower than our original plan prior to the onset of COVID-19. Importantly, we remain very much committed to our BBB+ credit rating and leverage cap of three times rent-adjusted EBITDA. That said, while the impacts of COVID-19 will cause us to exceed that leverage cap for a period of time, we view these impacts to be temporary. We expect our leverage to return to near three times rent-adjusted EBITDA in the latter part of fiscal 2021. In short, our leverage policy is unchanged. To summarize, the financial impacts of COVID-19 are very material and will weigh on our Q3 performance in particular. But the progress we are making in China and the deliberate approach we are taking in the U.S. to reopen stores, reinforce our belief that these headwinds are temporary. We are confident that our brand is resilient and that our customers are eager to resume their daily routines. We have the financial strength to make investments for the long-term as we navigate challenges in the short term. And we are inspired by the courageous partners, who serve our communities by serving our customers at a time when people are looking for the personal connection that defines the Starbucks brand. And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions joined by Roz Brewer and John Culver as Durga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks and good evening. In the U.S., could you talk about your store base in terms of the percentages that are in what \u2013 are not only closed today those walk-in locations, but also areas that you would anticipate being slower to rebuild sales? Perhaps you want to use China as analogy here, but what I'm thinking about is the mall locations those downtown areas or even drive-throughs that depend on commuting and highway travel. Any numbers against this that would be helpful as we think about your path to recovery. And relatedly, how much do you think social distancing in these walk-in stores will limit your capacity when they do reopen? Thanks very much.\nKevin Johnson: Thanks David. Roz, why don't I let you share a little bit of perspective on the U.S.?\nRoz Brewer: Thank you, Kevin. And thank you David for that question. Let me first start off talking about April. So to-date in April, we did have drive-through locations open. And as Pat mentioned, we had comparable sales growth in those U.S. company-operated stores averaging down by about 25% or indexing right at about 75% of prior levels. So as we reopened stores, we did a few things to really create the analysis, we created a decision modeling tool that helped us look at the customer frequency that we saw in those drive-through stores as well as looking at sources from local government guidance, the infection curves by county, customer sentiment and partner sentiment. So when we open starting next week, we're going to open with modifications. And those modifications will be drive-through stores. We will amplify delivery. We will have the Mobile Order & Pay channels open, and then the addition of a new concept, the entryway handoff. We will only have roughly 30 stores that will be cafe open and order. And in those 30 stores, there will be no seating. So we are making sure that we provide a safe environment for our customers and for our partners. And we will monitor what happens as shelter-in is lifted in certain regions and areas and then begin to reopen the cafe stores. You'll see later in the summer, we'll also add curbside access to our stores. So what we're doing David is managing what we're learning and then opening the stores accordingly and applying our partners and our labor against these new entryway model and also to amplify drive-through. We'll also be helping our customers use the app and make sure that they order ahead and pick up in store either through drive-through or those other channels that I described.\nKevin Johnson: Thanks Roz. I'll just add one other point that we shared David to reinforce what Roz just said. Pre-COVID, 80% of our customer occasions in stores in the U.S. were for to-go take-away. And so by augmenting the in-store experience with mobile ordering and contactless pickup, we can service significant volume of customers without having the cafe seating area actually opened. And so I think that's an important point. Areas that will be slower similar in China if it's office -- stores near office parks where office workers are not going back to work yet, they will be a little slower. And then I think we anticipate that the mall stores will also be slower. And that -- mall stores are less than eight -- fewer than 8% I think of the total store fleet in the U.S. But I think Roz captured it quite well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to follow-up on the China piece of the -- in terms of the percentage of occasions to-go that are within China. I mean, I think you've said a couple of times now 80% of the occasions are to-go in the U.S. I would expect that number to be much lower than that in China, but help me clarify that as Starbucks really does differentiate itself with the cafe experience and the third place experience. So can you kind of I guess triangulate the percentage of transactions that are to-go in China with the thought that you might actually get to somewhere near flat comps at the end of the fourth quarter, how you can do that without basically a full reduction of physical social distancing within that market specifically? And thank you and hope everyone is well.\nJohn Culver: Yes. John, this is -- okay. Thank you, John. I appreciate that. Just real quick on China. Traditionally we've seen 80% of our business be stay-in and enjoy their drinks in the cafes. As COVID hit, we hit a peak of nearly 80% of transactions being digital orders. And those digital orders were all set up with the contactless experience through walking in the stores and picking up your orders in Mobile Order & Pay. And then the rest of it was delivery. What we see today is that in the stores that we have open we have roughly 83% of those stores have seating in them with social distancing in place. And so we are seeing people come back into the cafes and sit there albeit not to the levels that we saw pre-COVID. What we're seeing is that there is a higher percentage of to-go orders taking place in China and we expect that trend to continue. And if there is a silver lining, I think it is forming a new habit in China, where you are seeing more people take to-go orders and get used to doing that. And so we're optimistic that the shift will continue to occur. We anticipate the 80% of where we were pre-COVID will come back maybe not as high but the overall sales levels that we'll see in China, we will get back to full recovery and on a path to full recovery by the end of this fiscal year.\nKevin Johnson: Thanks, John. Let me just add one other observation. When we look at consumer behavior on a global basis as it relates to COVID-19, after people have been sheltering at home in a lockdown situation for several weeks \u2013 in China, it was a little over three weeks. In the U.S. it's been about six weeks. What they look for \u2013 what consumer sentiment looks for is something that is safe - experiences that are safe, familiar and convenient. And that is consistent around the world. And so what we've done at Starbucks is we've built the operating protocols in our stores to be safe to follow every \u2013 and exceed every health standard we can exceed and ensure we can provide every customer a safe experience. Clearly, getting that Starbucks Experience is something that's familiar to them. And when you've had to be sheltering in place for several weeks just to get out for a nice uplifting experience at Starbucks it's familiar and it's rewarding. And so customers come back to our stores. But having this convenient ability and those three attributes safe, familiar and convenient that is something that works around the world, following these periods where people have been sheltering at home. We've seen that in China. And I think we're going to see that in even a more amplified way in the U.S. but it's something that we're seeing in every single market around the world when they come out of sort of the lockdown phase.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, good afternoon. Could you talk about how your digital trends have kind of ramped as you've gone through April? I know you gave the update on Rewards for the second quarter. It'd be helpful to know, what you're seeing with engagement as we've gone through this month. And then can you also give us an update on kind of any initiatives you have on communicating safety protocols, as you start to reopen more of the in-room dine-in?\nKevin Johnson: Roz, why don't I have you kind of respond, as it relates to digital and U.S. and safety protocols? And then maybe John can follow-up on the China digital. So why don't you go ahead first Roz?\nRoz Brewer: Sure. So as Kevin mentioned in \u2013 when we started off the call, we saw as we were entering the quarter and actually exiting last year, our Rewards members which are our highly routinized customers have really grown with us. We've increased to over 19 million of those customers in the U.S., up 15% a year ago. One of the things that we're seeing as we've been going through this COVID experience is our Starbucks Rewards members, they remain roughly 44% of our business, even as we progress through the quarter. And the majority, roughly about 70% of them are our frequent Starbucks Rewards customers. And they're still coming to our stores just less frequently. So \u2013 and also to think about what that looks like over a daytime, really we've not seen much change there. There's same frequency loss across all dayparts. It's a little bit more pronounced in the morning but that's to be expected because the routines have been disrupted. So we are encouraged by what we've seen so far in the U.S. We believe that these highly resilient customers will come back to us. The routines may look a little bit different but they will \u2013 people remain in a work from home position. But even as local mandates get relaxed, we feel like we can monitor and adapt accordingly.\nJohn Culver: And just real quick Sharon on China. We continue to see digital being a key element of our strategy in China and really the adoption of the digital transactions in our stores continues to accelerate. What we've been able to do is leverage our Starbucks Rewards membership to really maintain that connection and engagement during the COVID experience. We're seeing sequential improvements in overall weekly active members. So more and more people continue to adopt the digital app and interact with us digitally. And as I shared or was shared in one of the scripts, digital order mix is now 29% in Q2. We had a peak in early February of 80% early on. And really you're seeing a good split between Mobile Order & Pay making up about 16% of that 29% and delivery making up about 13%. So we're very encouraged with the opportunity in digital. And now just a couple of days ago we announced our partnership with Sequoia Capital, which we think will further accelerate our ability to leverage the digital flywheel and accelerate the pace of retail innovation as we look to partner with local tech companies and key start-ups in China.\nRoz Brewer: Sharon you have a second part of that question. I'd like to address the second part of Sharon's question. She also asked about the marketing piece around the U.S. business. And we do have a marketing plan schedule as we reopen next week. And actually, if you think about the shutdown that we had we delayed the introduction of our spring beverage lineup and Double-Star Days in addition to our Happy Hour. So you'll see those reignited with a lot more energy than in past. We will spend within our existing plans for this year just condense them and accelerate most of the work around our -- enabling our app and encouraging people to use the app and order ahead. And then in terms of delivery, we've been able to accelerate in delivery. We believe in some markets like New York where we will have a handful of delivery-only stores, we're seeing some significantly higher volumes than normal with delivery in places like New York. But it's still early for us for delivery overall. But it is one of the channels that we will accelerate as we go through the post-COVID and COVID recovery period. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. My question is on, how you think about the pace of the U.S. recovery. In addition, obviously to the pandemic, we're in a recession. So how do you think about incenting customers to come back differently? Or is that not in your calculus? You believe once stores are open consumers resume their normal pace of consumption. Have you thought about like the product lineup differently now because of the situation? And maybe if you're using China as a benchmark are there -- are consumer behaviors different? Are they purchasing different? Are they more price-sensitive in China? Or have you really seen no post pandemic or once you reopened price sensitivities in China?\nKevin Johnson: Yes. John, this is Kevin. Let me just comment. Pre-COVID, we had built a tremendous momentum in the business by focusing on three things: the customer experience, beverage innovation and digital customer relationships. And that remains the powerful combination for us to continue to engage and drive frequency of customer visits. But we recognize coming through the COVID experience that everyone around the world is sharing that really optimizing the initial store experience around these concepts of safe familiar and convenient is what gets customers now to start -- that's kind of the on-ramp to that engagement. Now certainly, we're going to know a lot more 30 days from now in the U.S. But I think as Roz highlighted, that in the drive-throughs, just the number of drive-throughs we've had open without even the cafe open, we were delivering 75 -- roughly 75% of prior year revenue in those individual stores. And so that's just an indication of the power of the brand and the strength of connection that we have with customers. Now I think over this next week when we open more stores and with the set of experiences that Roz has articulated, I think we're going to begin that path of engaging. And I think 30 days from now, we're going to have a much clearer view of how rapidly that goes. And we've got a great beverage lineup that Roz just talked about that's going to release. We're going to market and evangelize that. We've got -- we just grew digital customer relationships by 15% to 19.4 million in the U.S., we're going to leverage that to communicate with our customers. And we're going to be thoughtful and responsible with each step that we take and I think that's the formula.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSara Senatore: Hi, thank you. Just a follow-up on the U.S., I guess, I was surprised at how strong the ticket growth was. I apologize if you talked about this but does it -- is that sort of an offset to the impact on traffic from the COVID pandemic? We've heard from some other concepts that higher checks are happening because there's more group ordering. Or were there other drivers, I don't know when I think about menu innovation or sort of more sustainable drivers? And as you reopen stores in the U.S., do you have any sense of how much of those volumes in the stores that remained open might have represented sales transfer from closed stores? Just trying to figure out as you open stores what the sort of system-wide sales will look like. Should we just think about kind of doubling the number of stores that are open and doubling the sales volume? Or is there some transfer that's been happening? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: Roz, why don't you take those questions?\nRoz Brewer: Sure. Thank you, Sara for the questions. First of all let me start with -- so the plan we'll start reopening stores next week and then with the anticipation that we'll have just a little greater than 90% June 1, in the various formats. Sara when I think about the trend in both ticket and traffic, I think about the exit of fourth quarter into first quarter where we were seeing great pickup in terms of our beverage innovation, most predominantly in Nitro, Cold Brew and all cold coffee selling extremely well. It played well through our holiday beverage lineup and it continued to the point where we saw the 8% comp just into early March, the first 10 weeks of the quarter -- of the year. So first of all it starts with our beverage innovation. The second thing is the in-store experience. And so, we had done a significant amount of work to actually relieve the partner of a lot of their tactics they were doing in the stores and they were engaging with our customers in some of the most meaningful ways. Creating the best moments with our customers was really a real key change for us. Our customer sentiment and customer engagement numbers were at record levels in addition to our partner engagement was at record levels as well. We actually saw that partner engagement carry over to when we began to slow down stores due to COVID. We saw partners just volunteering to come work at stores very energetic. The response from customers has been great. We've seen great social media placements from our customers concerning how grateful they were and what they recognize our partners are doing to work in the stores. So I would just take it back to Sara the work that we've been working on for quite a while now and it's around the beverage innovation, the digital engagements that we've created and then the in-store experience. And those things continue to drive and that is exactly where we got to the 8 comp as we were coming into the COVID situation.\nKevin Johnson: Yes. I'll just add the increase in ticket was group orders. I mean, it was drive-throughs -- going through a drive-through it's typically someone making a family Starbucks run and buying for their entire family or somebody making let's say, a frontline responder run and buying -- getting food and beverage for frontline responders. We saw a lot of that. So it's really driven by the fact that it was just drive-through only. And if you're going to take the time to go through drive-through you're going to load up and buy for the entire family or the entire group. And that drove down transaction drove up ticket.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with R.W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Tarantino: Good afternoon. I hope everyone is doing well. Pat my question is about the level of potential cash burn you might have in the current quarter. I was wondering if you could maybe frame that up for us? And then just talk about your commitment to maintaining the dividend throughout this crisis, I think you mentioned that there's no plans to suspend it, but just wondering what your margin of safety is relative to that question. And then I guess, thirdly, at what point would you feel comfortable as the CFO ramping back up the capital spending with respect to growth and other discretionary CapEx? Thanks.\nPat Grismer: Thank you, David. I'll start-off by saying that, given the scale of our company combined with the strength of our balance sheet, we are confident that, we will be able to maintain appropriate liquidity as we manage the current crisis. Now, when you consider that today over 50% of our company-operated stores are closed in the U.S. and Canada, and those that are open are largely restricted to drive-through and delivery channels, and with store partner payroll protection temporarily in place, our cash burn rate has peaked. And it's at approximately $125 million per week after CapEx, but before dividends. We expect this burn rate to go down as we begin reopening large numbers of company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada in the month of May, and to reduce further in the month of June as we normalize our store partner pay practices and benefit from recapturing sales. We have already taken steps to enhance our financial flexibility and that includes issuing $1.75 billion of bonds in March, with the proceeds used to pay down outstanding commercial paper balances, temporarily suspending our share repurchase program, deferring certain capital expenditures and reducing discretionary spending. And so with the amount of cash currently available to us and that includes our existing credit facilities and additional borrowing capacity, if we need it. We're comfortable with our overall liquidity position and we're well prepared to manage current operating conditions from a cash flow perspective. And that includes the investments in interim partner wages and benefits, which we've extended through the end of May. That said, our near-term focus clearly is on reopening our stores and optimizing their profitability as we emerge from the crisis and learn more about underlying customer traffic patterns and trends. Now you asked about our dividend. As I said in my prepared remarks, one of the things that we're proud of is that, we're able to maintain our commitment to shareholders to provide some measure of certain return in an uncertain investment environment. So our intention today is to continue to pay our quarterly dividend. As to CapEx, we've already taken steps to trim CapEx this year. That includes the deferral of certain new store openings that were planned for this year, deferring those into next year. That includes for example China, where we had originally guided to 600 new stores this year. We've taken that down to at least 500. So there is some deferral of capital associated with that and we've taken the opportunity to trim some of our other capital spending programs including store refurbishments. But based on what we see today, including our expectation that sales will start to recover as we come out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter into next year, I would say, at this stage we would expect CapEx to normalize in fiscal 2021. But it's simply too early to give any specific guidance around CapEx. But I would say that, we're optimistic that given the shape of the recovery curve going into next year that our capital spending programs, which underpin so much of our growth we would expect to normalize next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Pat a question for you in terms of the outlook at least for the second half. I know, it's tough to offer global second half guidance, but you have given us some April color. So I believe U.S. down 25%; China down 35%. And we can obviously estimate the path to comp recovery. In fact, you were very specific on the China path. So with all of that said, what is \u2013 how do we think about it from a reasonable operating margin range in the U.S. and China based on these current comp trends? Or I don't know, if you're more comfortable to give kind of a sensitivity the annual benefit to earnings from points of comp or basis points of margin? Just trying to make sure there aren't any outliers in terms of rest of the year 2020 or 2021 modeling. I don't know any form of sensitivity or framework you can provide in terms of what the type of down comp you're talking about would imply for operating margins in those two big segments over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\nPat Grismer: Yeah. Thank you, Jeff. Well, current margin performance is obviously highly distorted by large levels of store closures and interim store partner pay practices, so talking about the value of incremental comp growth or incremental margin improvement is somewhat irrelevant I would say at this juncture. And our top priority and our near-term goal is to return to cash-positive store operations and to improve from there towards full recovery. And we will do that by reopening large numbers of stores and improving their profitability including normalizing store partner pay practices starting in May. And based on our current store reopening plans, we expect that our cash needs are going to peak on this quarter. Now, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do expect the absolute impact of the lower sales and increased investments to intensify in the third quarter. It will be much more significant than they were in the second quarter in large part given to the longer duration of impact, because when you think about it, and let's talk about the U.S. business. In the second quarter we had between two and three weeks impacted by COVID-19 outbreak. In the third quarter for all intents and purposes we're expecting 13 weeks of impact, most significant in the month of April but reduced in the months of May and June as we reopen our stores and normalize our pay practices. Now for International, it's slightly different in the sense that we expect continued improvements in China from both a sales and margin perspective but we do expect adverse impacts in Japan and other markets including EMEA to intensify compared to Q2. And that's again largely due to an extended duration of impact in the third quarter. On balance there are just too many unknowns and too many moving pieces to be able to provide more explicit guidance on Q3 results outside of China at this time other than to say that the impacts to revenue and operating income will be much more substantial in absolute terms in Q3 compared to Q2, but we do expect these impacts to moderate in the fourth quarter. And we will continue our practice of providing updates to the investment community when we have better visibility to them.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks for the question. Just wondering if you could talk a bit more about the competitive environment both in the U.S. and in China and how the Starbucks brand is positioned coming out of this certainly depending on the situation with smaller chains and the independents or even the larger chains in the case of China. Just what that might mean for customer demand for your traffic trends and also site selection and longer-term unit development potentially? Thank you.\nKevin Johnson: Yeah. Dennis this is Kevin. I would just start by commenting on the momentum that we had generated pre-COVID. And clearly the -- posting an 8% comp with four points of transaction growth in the U.S. in the first -- up until the last two weeks of March was clearly an indication that I think this combination of the in-store experience, beverage innovation and digital customer relationships was putting us in a position where we were I think growing share of the customer occasions at specialty coffee retail. And I believe if anything the way we've navigated the virus continues to put us in a very strong position competitively. That said there's -- the economic implications following this are yet to be determined. I think, we're very optimistic about our competitive position and we just have to -- we'll be a lot smarter 30 days from now after we get to see the reaction of the reopening in the United States. Similarly in China, I think we're also in a very strong competitive position. I'd say both in the U.S. and China we're in the strongest competitive position that we've been in, in the history of the company. And a lot of that comes through the focus and discipline that we had going into COVID, as well as the principled way we have decided every action we've taken to navigate the COVID virus responsibly and thoughtfully prioritizing the health and well-being of our partners and our customers, the engagement partnership we've had with governments and health officials to help contain and -- mitigate and contain the spread of the virus and the fact that we are showing up in a positive and responsible way in every community that we're part of. And so I think our competitive position is very strong. That said we rise. We've got to keep -- stay focused on the things that matter. We've got to do the right things for our partners and our customers. And if we do that, I think we emerge from this strengthening, the brand and strengthening the connection that we have with our customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKatherine Fogertey: Great. Thank you. If we look at the comp numbers in the U.S. business that you've discussed in March and then your guidance for April, overall it might suggest that there hasn't really been a big sequential or week-on-week improvement in the business. And with the rest of restaurant, most of them are showing kind of week-on-week improvement. So I'm wondering when you drill down a little bit on the weekly trends, are you starting to see improvements here with consumers? Or do you need to see these new initiatives like curbside or store reopenings before comps can reaccelerate? Thank you.\nKevin Johnson: Pat, why don't you take the numbers on the comp and then we'll hand off to Roz to talk about sort of the trends that she's watching in terms of customer behavior?\nPat Grismer: Certainly. Thank you, Katherine. So, since the third week of March when we initiated widespread closures of stores in the U.S. we've seen the comps which include the impact of closures based on how we've defined comps for this period of time, it's been fairly steady in the range of minus 60 to minus 70. As we have in recent weeks reopened some more of our drive-through stores, we've seen slight improvement within that range, so that we're closer to the minus 60 end of that range. But it really is not until we begin to reopen large numbers of stores starting the week of May 4 that we would anticipate seeing a material improvement in that number.\nKevin Johnson: Yes. More stores and more ways for customers to engage. And so Roz, why don't you talk a little bit about sort of the incremental ways that we're now engaging beyond just drive-through as we reopen these stores next week?\nRoz Brewer: Yes. So, Katherine thanks for the question. So first of all, Pat did allude to a range, so that 65% to 75%. So, as you drill down there's probably some of those stores that are doing better and we're seeing it migrate. It really depends on those local jurisdictions and where the sheltering-in has been lifted. And we're seeing that over the last week or so. So, in some instances, it's actually too early to tell. Also remember that we have really turned off any marketing in this time. And so our customers are used to us introducing spring beverage in addition to speaking to them on a one-to-one basis through our digital relationships. And we've not acknowledged our birthday presentations to our customers. We've not introduced Happy Hour, nor have we done our Double-Star Days. So, I would say that we're operating in an abnormal position in terms of how we communicate to our customers. Now, coming out of the gate, we're doing a lot of new things with marketing. We'll have digital media. We'll have TV. We'll have paid social owned earned media. That all begins early next week. We're also creating new e-mail contacts to each one of our members. So those 30 million that you're -- that we can reach we will do that in the next week. And the most important thing is to let them know that we are open. And it's surprising to us in some areas people are not aware if we're open or not and we've actually had different hours in different regions. So, it's too soon to tell in terms of where the pickup will be, but we're pretty positive about the work that we have ahead of us and reintroducing our summer beverage line. So, we're encouraged by that. I'll also mention too, we have extensive work going on with our delivery partner. And so you'll see some marketing in the delivery space as well. So, the acceleration of these new models that we opened, we're going to talk about them pretty broadly and loudly and we'll know more over the next 30 days.\nKatherine Fogertey: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks. Thanks for the question. In China, you're expecting same-store sales down 25% to 35% in your third quarter. And Yum China this afternoon said the same quarter their comps are down roughly 10% thus far. What do you think is driving the lag in your recovery versus a peer like this just based on your knowledge of the market? Is it about coffee in general? And just in general do you expect a similar lag in your recovery in the U.S.? As you reopen just given your dependency on employment levels and your dependency on habitual high-frequency levels should we expect a similar like lag in the recovery? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: John I'll let you comment on China.\nJohn Culver: Yes. Brian the biggest impact to us on the recovery is getting the rest of our stores open that aren't open. And those stores right now are in some of our highest volume channels those being the international travel hubs and the airports the tourist areas as tourism has subsided in China and then obviously, some of the entertainment areas in the downtown urban areas and in the neighborhood. So, once we get those stores reopened we feel that we can get back to a path where our comps will continue to accelerate beyond what we're already seeing. The good news is that we continue to see transactions gain momentum in the market number one. Number two we also see digital continuing to play a bigger role and in particular MOP and MOD and we're going to continue to leverage that. And then number three, obviously, we're excited about getting new stores reopened as well and start opening new stores. And we're on a path where we are going to hit the 500 stores by the end of this year and we are going to continue to accelerate. What we've seen thus far in the month of April we've opened seven new stores. They're performing well. We are also opening Starbucks Now which is a mobile order pickup and mobile order delivery store concept. We now have it down in Shenzhen as well as in Beijing. We're going to continue to accelerate that concept. And once schools go back into session which they start later this week and into next week we foresee that the mornings will continue to recover as people go back into offices and get more back into routinized behaviors which I think will help as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thanks very much for transparency and I hope you're all staying safe. I was looking to get an update on supply chain, particularly around coffee and to a lesser degree pork. I mean you guys are somewhat insulated from protein challenges and shortages that are starting to surface. But given the amount of coffee that is imported in Latin America, it's a little bit earlier stages with COVID-19 relative to the U.S. Can you talk about the visibility you have into securing the supply of coffee and to a lesser degree pork for breakfast sandwiches?\nKevin Johnson: John, maybe you take green coffee sourcing. And then Roz why don't you take rest of the supply chain, the roasting network as well as the food sources? But John since you manage the coffee piece on green coffee sourcing of green coffee, why don't you talk a little bit about that?\nJohn Culver: Yes, Andrew this is something that we're monitoring obviously each and every day. We feel very good with our positions on green coffee inventories and how we're positioned in the marketplace. What we've seen in terms of green coffee is that in Latin America, they're through the harvest and we were able to secure the adequate supply that we need. We're now moving into South America into Brazil and Colombia. And we're continuing to see those markets have good crops this year and we don't anticipate any supply disruption in that regard. So, we feel good about the green coffee. And then as we get it here to the states having the transportation set up to do so.\nRoz Brewer: Andrew -- thank you John. Andrew a couple of things on our roasting capacity. We've been able to keep our roasting facilities open and running. We have followed local mandates for closure. As you can imagine in Amsterdam and different areas we shut down for a period of time. But we had a network of coffee built into the system. We did go take a few units down to do cleaning procedures to make sure we have a safe environment. We've adjusted in our roasting facilities for social distancing and that's been very effective for us. It has not impacted our production capacity. So, we feel pretty confident in our roasting capacity right now. Even before stores are opening we are in good shape. In terms of food sourcing, there's a lot of activity happening in proteins. Our breakfast sandwich business is secure. I will talk a little bit about breakfast as a category that we are intentionally wanting to regain as we reopen. We feel confident that we've got the inventory there and it's been in close contact with all of our suppliers in that area. So right now, we feel pretty good about our position. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. Pat, my question is with respect to sort of the U.S. stores and the 50% or so that are closed. Obviously, that's a higher number than a lot of your peers and that would suggest that those stores or those locations are somewhat hamstrung during the COVID situation being locked down. I would presume that you're going to expect those not to open up at 75% indexing pre-COVID May 1, as those probably were closed for reasons and employment not being back. Is that correct sort of an assumption? But also is there some leverage you have potentially with renegotiating rents or leases on some of these stores that if the new normal looks a little bit as far as the recovery period where they might be permanently hamstrung, is there some level of renegotiating or leases where since you've closed these 50% that's given you a little bit of an entrance into that with the landlords?\nKevin Johnson: Matt, this is Kevin. Let me just comment on the part of your question then I'll hand it over to Pat. You'd suggested that 50% of the stores that we closed were hampered for some reason. That's not the case. We decided when we went into the shelter-at-home to only open drive-throughs and we did that for partner safety. We just decided rather than have any location that has a cafe opened during the period where the nation was sheltering at home and social distancing we thought that was the safest way for us to ensure both our partners' safety as well as out of our customers. So that's what drove the decision to close all those stores, whereas certainly others made different decisions and that's fine. But we prioritize the health and well-being of our Starbucks partners and the customers, which is why we were more aggressive perhaps than others in closing stores. And then, I'll hand over to Pat for comments on the rest of your question.\nPat Grismer: Thank you, Kevin. And thanks Matt for the question. So a couple of things I'll comment on. The first is that, as we reopen our stores that are currently closed, we will be applying our normal discipline to optimize store performance. We have a world-class operations team that is as focused on the bottom line as on the top line driving sales. And so once we have better visibility to the sales recovery curves for those stores, we will be taking appropriate steps to optimize their profitability. Specifically with respect to rent, what I'd like to say is that to date we're quite proud of the fact that we have remained current on all of our rent payments, which we believe reinforces our position as a developer of choice if you will. We are having ongoing conversations with our landlords in various markets regarding what may be commercially reasonable lease concessions in the current environment. So we've not yet confirmed those arrangements and it's really premature to indicate what that relief may look like, but it is something that we are pursuing.\nKevin Johnson: And I do think it is fair to believe that occupancy -- lease rates are going to go down post-COVID just given the situation. And I think that's a fair assumption.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris O'Cull: Thanks. Good afternoon. Could you describe the primary differences in maybe the approach to reopening in the U.S. compared to China? I'm just wondering if it will be easier to recover sales in one country more so than the other because of either the approach the country is taking to reopening or maybe because of just differences in consumer behavior.\nKevin Johnson : Yes. Let me just comment briefly and then I'll hand off to Roz to sort of share the path for U.S. and then John can close by a little bit of some of the differences in China. For me, I think the comment I would make was in China, it was decisions were made centrally by central government on a city-by-city basis and even certain office parks and things were actually coordinated when they opened. And so the opening of stores was over a longer period of time than I think we're going to see in the U.S., but it was orchestrated city-by-city and almost community-by-community centrally. Keep in mind in China, the period of shutdown or the period of sheltering-at-home was about three weeks whereas here in the U.S. it's been about six weeks. And so now as we reopen in the U.S., I think we anticipate that the stores are going to reopen across the nation at a faster rate. But the format we're going to use is going to be -- in each store is going to be dependent on sort of what's happening in that particular store. So I think there's a lot of similarities in terms of the safety protocol, the operating protocols in the stores the way we -- the priorities the principles we use to make these decisions. But I think there'll be a little bit of a difference in terms of in the U.S. deciding -- we'll open them faster, but we'll decide geography-by-geography what's the appropriate format. Roz, why don't you share a little bit more about the plans that you see unfolding over the next 30 days?\nRoz Brewer: Sure. So Chris, thank you for that question. So one of the things I'll highlight and John Culver alluded to it earlier is a different habit between China and the U.S. China is a sit-down market and the U.S. is a grab-and-go market. So for us to have access to a good percentage number more than 50% of our stores in the U.S. are drive-through. So that alone is going to create a difference. The second difference I will say and I think it's really obvious is that we have this decentralized decision-making. And so local municipalities can make a decision on openings and closings and shelter-ins and not and the mobility of the customer. So we'll learn those patterns through the month of May and be able to come back to you as Pat described in early June. But one of the things we're doing and it's primary to us is partner safety. And so as we reopen the stores, we're reopening in a safe environment, which is why these new modes of pick up and go we're really enforcing. We're enforcing to download the app and pick up and order ahead. We're also providing the safety for our partners things like a partner pre-check. And we instituted that last week where thermometers will be available in all stores. And then we will actually have every partner take their temperature and then validate if they're ready to work through a series of questions. That's something that we learned from China. It was very helpful for us. And so we are -- we learn from China and then just expanded that work and then looked at government and local health officials and what they were saying. And that's how we plan to open and we'll be in this safe position until we learn more. So we're going to learn as we go as -- Kevin calls it monitor and adapt. We're falling into line there and really going to open our stores. I'm encouraged that we'll have 90% of the stores open. The other thing I'll tell you is that, our partners are really wanting to -- they start from connection also. And so they're excited about rejoining the stores next week and we're having somewhat of a homecoming celebration for them as they reenter the stores next week and actually take them through new training around the cleaning protocols and then also how to keep themselves safe and healthy and how to keep customers safe and healthy. So we've got a pretty strong reopening plan that kicks off early next week.\nKevin Johnson: Thanks, Roz. And John last word on China?\nJohn Culver: Yes. Chris, just real quick on China. I think the big difference for us has been our ability to leverage the relationships that we've been able to build with the government officials both in the central government, the provincial government and then into the cities and really taking those relationships and being able to understand how they're thinking about the reopening and working closely with them on staging our reopening based on what their plans were. We also were very well connected into the local health officials as well. And we work very closely with them to put together the safety protocols in our stores and how we would operate our stores going forward. So really making sure that we created a safe environment and that we continue to build on the trust that our brand has with our customers and obviously with our partners. And so what we've seen as we've opened up, first off our partners similar to the U.S. were very excited to get back into stores. And as a matter of fact, since we've begun and gotten to the 98% of stores reopened, our customer experience scores has actually increased by over eight points pre-COVID levels. So the engagement level of our customers and more importantly, the engagement level of our partners is really amplifying the strength of our brand and the resilience of Starbucks in the market. So very proud of the work that they've done and just want to recognize the China team for what they've done to navigate this complex situation.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question today. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Johnson.\nKevin Johnson: Thank you. I want to thank you for joining us today and I hope you and your families are all safe and healthy. We continue to navigate through this unprecedented situation staying true to our mission and values and I'm pleased with where we are. China has demonstrated a clear path to recovery. The U.S. is prepared to reopen a large number of stores next week and throughout the month of May. Our channels business has demonstrated resilience through all of this and I am confident in our approach and optimistic about our ability to continue to drive Starbucks recovery in this monitor-and-adapt phase. We all understand the power of the Starbucks brand is strong. And through our principled actions we have strengthened the trust and confidence of both our partners and our customers have in Starbucks. That will serve us very well for the long term. I'm very proud of how Starbucks partners have shown up in every part of the world and we will continue to be focused, disciplined and transparent with all stakeholders, as we continue to navigate this situation. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's second quarter fiscal year 2020 conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Culver",
            "content": "Yes. John, this is -- okay. Thank you, John. I appreciate that. Just real quick on China. Traditionally we've seen 80% of our business be stay-in and enjoy their drinks in the cafes. As COVID hit, we hit a peak of nearly 80% of transactions being digital orders. And those digital orders were all set up with the contactless experience through walking in the stores and picking up your orders in Mobile Order & Pay. And then the rest of it was delivery. What we see today is that in the stores that we have open we have roughly 83% of those stores have seating in them with social distancing in place. And so we are seeing people come back into the cafes and sit there albeit not to the levels that we saw pre-COVID. What we're seeing is that there is a higher percentage of to-go orders taking place in China and we expect that trend to continue. And if there is a silver lining, I think it is forming a new habit in China, where you are seeing more people take to-go orders and get used to doing that. And so we're optimistic that the shift will continue to occur. We anticipate the 80% of where we were pre-COVID will come back maybe not as high but the overall sales levels that we'll see in China, we will get back to full recovery and on a path to full recovery by the end of this fiscal year. And just real quick Sharon on China. We continue to see digital being a key element of our strategy in China and really the adoption of the digital transactions in our stores continues to accelerate. What we've been able to do is leverage our Starbucks Rewards membership to really maintain that connection and engagement during the COVID experience. We're seeing sequential improvements in overall weekly active members. So more and more people continue to adopt the digital app and interact with us digitally. And as I shared or was shared in one of the scripts, digital order mix is now 29% in Q2. We had a peak in early February of 80% early on. And really you're seeing a good split between Mobile Order & Pay making up about 16% of that 29% and delivery making up about 13%. So we're very encouraged with the opportunity in digital. And now just a couple of days ago we announced our partnership with Sequoia Capital, which we think will further accelerate our ability to leverage the digital flywheel and accelerate the pace of retail innovation as we look to partner with local tech companies and key start-ups in China. Yes. Brian the biggest impact to us on the recovery is getting the rest of our stores open that aren't open.

            "name": "Pat Grismer",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin and good afternoon everyone. I like to start by echoing Kevin's appreciation for all of our Starbucks partners who continue to demonstrate their dedication to Starbucks and their communities in spite of the hardships facing the global community right now. Unsurprisingly, business disruption attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted our financial results. Our belief is that these impacts are temporary as evidenced by our continued recovery in China as Kevin outlined, so I will highlight the financial impacts to provide investors with perspective on our normalized performance for the second quarter as well as insight into how future quarters' results may be affected by these conditions. In all cases we have estimated these impacts by comparing Q2 actual reported results to our internal forecasts specific to each operating segment and market. These forecasts were developed based on the most recent prevailing trends in revenue and profitability prior to the onset of material COVID-19-related business impacts specific to each operating segment and market. These impacts first started in China in late January and materialized in other markets later in the quarter. For the second quarter, Starbucks produced consolidated revenue of $6 billion, down 5% from the prior year. We estimate the COVID-19 impact to be approximately $915 million due to temporary store closures, restricted sales channels, shortened operating hours, and severely reduced customer traffic. As we shared earlier this month in an 8-K, Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.32, down 47% from the prior year. We estimate the COVID-19 impact to be approximately $0.45 including not only profit flow-through on the revenue impact that I noted earlier but also incremental costs that we incurred in response to the pandemic which I will outline later. I will first provide some highlights of segment operating results and consolidated margin performance for Q2 and we'll then share some perspective on balance of year results and liquidity. Revenue for our Americas segment was flat in Q2 relative to the prior year at $4.3 billion as incremental sales from net new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months was effectively offset by a 3% decline in comparable store sales. Through the first 10 weeks of the quarter, the U.S. delivered 8% comparable store sales growth building on strong momentum from the past few quarters. But this was more than offset by a sharp decline in the final three weeks of the quarter due to the COVID-19 impact that I mentioned earlier ultimately resulting in a 3% decline for the quarter. We estimate America's Q2 revenue decline attributable to COVID-19 to be approximately $450 million. Through the month of February, Americas' non-GAAP operating margin improved meaningfully versus the prior year reflecting strong sales leverage and continued supply chain efficiencies. However, due to the rapid sales decline and significant investments in response to the COVID-19 outbreak that started to materialize in the U.S. in mid-March, Americas Q2 non-GAAP operating margin landed at 14.4%, down from 20.3% in the prior year. We estimate that the COVID-19 impact to Americas non-GAAP operating income was approximately $420 million in Q2 consisting of flow through on lost sales as well as incremental investments notably catastrophe wages as well as enhanced pay and benefits programs in support of our retail store partners, inventory write-offs, and store safety supplies. Moving on to International, business disruption resulting from COVID-19 impacted the segment for the majority of Q2 starting with China in late January and extending to other markets in March including Japan. For the quarter, International's revenue declined by $395 million or 26% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by a 31% decrease in comparable store sales, partially offset by 11% net new store growth over the past 12 months. We estimate International's Q2 revenue decline attributable to COVID-19 to be approximately $465 million. International's Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 3.9% down from 19.3% in the prior year. We estimate that the COVID-19 impact to International non-GAAP operating income was approximately $280 million in Q2 with components similar to what I outlined for the Americas. Further contributing to the margin decline was a higher-than-normal sales mix of delivery transactions as customers shifted to off-premise consumption, resulting in higher commission and packaging costs. On to Channel Development. Revenue was $519 million in Q2 fiscal '20, an increase of 16% over the prior year. When normalizing for the 5% favorable impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related items, Channel Development's revenue grew 11% in Q2 over the prior year. Transition-related items include higher inventory sales as Nestle prepared to fulfill foodservice customer orders under the Global Coffee Alliance as well as a benefit related to the transfer of certain single-serve product activities to Nestle on a go-forward basis. The segment's non-GAAP operating margin was 37.8%, an improvement of 360 basis points over the prior year. Normalizing for the 330 basis point impact of the transition activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 30 basis points in Q2. Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin of 9.2% in Q2 contracted 660 basis points year-over-year. We estimate the COVID-19 impact to non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $700 million, inclusive of the amounts I cited for the Americas and International. In relation to the $915 million of consolidated revenue impact that I mentioned earlier, this equates to approximately 80% of flow-through on lost revenue which is materially higher than the 50% variable flow-through rate that we typically observe in our business, reflecting the significant investments we've made in the short term to support our partners and manage our brand for the long term. We believe that these investments will strengthen our competitive position and fuel our recovery as we emerge from the effects of the pandemic. Now moving on to our outlook for fiscal 2020. Given the global nature of our business, our ability to provide updated guidance for the remainder of the year is predicated on the current phase of COVID-19 response within each of our markets. As Kevin discussed, China, our second largest market is in the recovery phase, which enhances our ability to estimate balance of year results. However, the U.S., Japan and Canada, which round out our four largest markets are in earlier phases of COVID-19 impacted response, which limits our ability to provide enterprise-level guidance at this time. As a result, we are continuing to suspend formal guidance for fiscal 2020, while providing updated outlooks for selected businesses and financial metrics. I'll start with China. With the progress we have seen to date including having 98% of our stores open as of today and continued improvements in customer traffic as Kevin mentioned, we believe China's comparable store sales will continue to improve in the second half of fiscal 2020 relative to the 50% decline reported for Q2, declining 25% to 35% in Q3 and trending towards roughly flat by the end of Q4 relative to the prior year, yielding a decline of 15% to 25% in China's comparable sales for the full fiscal year. While we temporarily paused new store openings in China in Q2 given COVID-19, development activities resumed towards the end of the quarter and we are on track to open at least 500 net new stores this fiscal year or over 80% of our original target. This will position us well to continue to capture the growth opportunity we see in China in fiscal '21 and beyond. Combining the effects of comparable store sales declines and new store development deferrals, we estimate revenue in China to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 by approximately $750 million to $850 million with an estimated EPS impact of between $0.30 and $0.37 in fiscal 2020 barring any new disruptions. Moving to the U.S. Today approximately 50% of our company operated stores and 46% of our licensed stores in the U.S. are temporarily closed. But we expect to begin reopening many of them next week, initially with modified operations and shorter operating hours. We currently expect approximately 90% of company operated stores to be open by early June. Additionally, modifications to increase throughput in drive through delivery and MOP channels in our existing stores are already underway along with a new entryway handoff solution, which incorporates best-in-class safety protocols. And as Kevin mentioned, we are also exploring curbside service in locations where parking is available. We believe the focused actions we are taking to deliver a contactless customer experience coupled with continued beverage innovation and expanded digital capabilities will help to restore the upward momentum in our U.S. business that we're experiencing prior to the onset of COVID-19. To date in April, comparable sales growth for U.S. company operated stores that are open is averaging approximately minus 25% or indexing at 75% of prior year levels. However, as we have not yet entered the recovery phase in the U.S., it is premature to provide a balance-of-year estimate of U.S. revenue or earnings at this time. But given the late quarter onset of COVID-19 impacts in the U.S., as well as a materially higher flow-through rate on lost sales in the U.S., we do expect the negative financial impacts of COVID-19 to be significantly greater in Q3 compared to Q2 and to extend into Q4. So while the initial impacts in the U.S. are less severe than they were in China from a comparable store perspective owing to the prevalence of our drive-through model in the U.S., we do expect the impacts to persist for a longer period of time as we move through the monitor and adapt phase with the recovery phase extending into fiscal 2021. We expect the COVID-19 impacts in Canada and Japan, as well as in our international license businesses will follow a similar pattern as the U.S. very pronounced in the third quarter with some easing of these impacts expected in the fourth quarter as these businesses move into the recovery phase. In any event based on our substantial experience in China today, we continue to believe that these impacts are temporary that our brand is resilient and our business will fully recover over time. At the enterprise level, we expect the absolute flow-through impact of COVID-19 to be materially greater in Q3 compared to Q2 in particular due to the longer duration of U.S., Canada and Japan business disruption in Q3 compared to Q2. That said, we expect the rate of flow-through on lost sales in Q3 to be slightly lower than in Q2 and to ease further in Q4 as we take appropriate steps to restore the profitability of company operated stores as they reopen in the back half of the year. Consistent with the approach we have taken in our two interim update this quarter, we will provide transparent updates as to what we are seeing and how that shapes our perspective on the balance of year financial results as we execute our store reopening plan and have increased visibility into business performance trends in the U.S. and other markets. We expect to provide our next update in June after we've evaluated the performance of stores we opened in the U.S. and better understand the possible duration of temporary closures in Japan. From our perspective, the reopening of stores and actions we are taking to position ourselves when the crisis subsides do not fully define recovery. Recovery in our view is when a company operated market delivers positive comparable store sales growth and all existing stores are open with the exception of those undergoing renovation. Finally, on a reported basis, Channel Development revenue is expected to decline between 6% and 8% in fiscal 2020 relative to the prior year as we lap certain transition items related to the Global Coffee Alliance that benefited the segment's top line growth in fiscal 2019 with the impact being more pronounced in Q3 and far less pronounced in Q4. Additionally, the disruption resulting from COVID-19 is expected to adversely impact foodservice under the Global Coffee Alliance and our ready-to-drink business during the balance of fiscal 2020. The segment's operating margin is expected to improve modestly in fiscal 2020 relative to the prior year. The cash flow implications of these near-term operating results are very material. But the scale of our company combined with the strength of our balance sheet enables us to manage our business for long-term growth, while dealing with short-term business realities. In essence, we are investing in relationships with key constituents not only to preserve those relationships, but to strengthen them for the future. Let me provide several examples of how we are thinking about this. First, through salary and wage continuation and through premium pay for those working on the front lines of our business, both as communicated through the end of May we are investing in our partners who are critical to the Starbucks Experience and instrumental to our long-term success. Second, by extending more flexible development and financial terms in Q3, we are investing in our international licensees, who are our partners in driving long-term growth. Third, through certain accelerated payments, we are helping strategic suppliers weather this crisis so that they can sustain the supply of our proprietary products and support our ongoing product innovation. And fourth, by honoring our upcoming quarterly dividend declaration we are supporting our shareholders with a predictable return of capital in an uncertain investment environment. Our next dividend is payable on May 22 to shareholders of record on May 8. As disclosed in our most recent 8-K in addition to accessing additional capital to bridge near-term cash needs, which we expect to peak in Q3, we are creating additional room for investment in our partners and the business more broadly by suspending share repurchases, reducing discretionary expenses and deferring certain capital expenditures. Due primarily to the deferral of some new store openings and store refurbishments, we now expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to total approximately $1.5 billion or $300 million lower than our original plan prior to the onset of COVID-19. Importantly, we remain very much committed to our BBB+ credit rating and leverage cap of three times rent-adjusted EBITDA. That said, while the impacts of COVID-19 will cause us to exceed that leverage cap for a period of time, we view these impacts to be temporary. We expect our leverage to return to near three times rent-adjusted EBITDA in the latter part of fiscal 2021. In short, our leverage policy is unchanged. To summarize, the financial impacts of COVID-19 are very material and will weigh on our Q3 performance in particular. But the progress we are making in China and the deliberate approach we are taking in the U.S. to reopen stores, reinforce our belief that these headwinds are temporary. We are confident that our brand is resilient and that our customers are eager to resume their daily routines. We have the financial strength to make investments for the long-term as we navigate challenges in the short term. And we are inspired by the courageous partners, who serve our communities by serving our customers at a time when people are looking for the personal connection that defines the Starbucks brand. And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions joined by Roz Brewer and John Culver as Durga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator? Thank you, David. I'll start-off by saying that, given the scale of our company combined with the strength of our balance sheet, we are confident that, we will be able to maintain appropriate liquidity as we manage the current crisis. Now, when you consider that today over 50% of our company-operated stores are closed in the U.S. and Canada, and those that are open are largely restricted to drive-through and delivery channels, and with store partner payroll protection temporarily in place, our cash burn rate has peaked. And it's at approximately $125 million per week after CapEx, but before dividends. We expect this burn rate to go down as we begin reopening large numbers of company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada in the month of May, and to reduce further in the month of June as we normalize our store partner pay practices and benefit from recapturing sales. We have already taken steps to enhance our financial flexibility and that includes issuing $1.75 billion of bonds in March, with the proceeds used to pay down outstanding commercial paper balances, temporarily suspending our share repurchase program, deferring certain capital expenditures and reducing discretionary spending. And so with the amount of cash currently available to us and that includes our existing credit facilities and additional borrowing capacity, if we need it. We're comfortable with our overall liquidity position and we're well prepared to manage current operating conditions from a cash flow perspective. And that includes the investments in interim partner wages and benefits, which we've extended through the end of May. That said, our near-term focus clearly is on reopening our stores and optimizing their profitability as we emerge from the crisis and learn more about underlying customer traffic patterns and trends. Now you asked about our dividend. As I said in my prepared remarks, one of the things that we're proud of is that, we're able to maintain our commitment to shareholders to provide some measure of certain return in an uncertain investment environment. So our intention today is to continue to pay our quarterly dividend. As to CapEx, we've already taken steps to trim CapEx this year. That includes the deferral of certain new store openings that were planned for this year, deferring those into next year. That includes for example China, where we had originally guided to 600 new stores this year. We've taken that down to at least 500. So there is some deferral of capital associated with that and we've taken the opportunity to trim some of our other capital spending programs including store refurbishments. But based on what we see today, including our expectation that sales will start to recover as we come out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter into next year, I would say, at this stage we would expect CapEx to normalize in fiscal 2021. But it's simply too early to give any specific guidance around CapEx. But I would say that, we're optimistic that given the shape of the recovery curve going into next year that our capital spending programs, which underpin so much of our growth we would expect to normalize next year. Yeah. Thank you, Jeff. Well, current margin performance is obviously highly distorted by large levels of store closures and interim store partner pay practices, so talking about the value of incremental comp growth or incremental margin improvement is somewhat irrelevant I would say at this juncture. And our top priority and our near-term goal is to return to cash-positive store operations and to improve from there towards full recovery. And we will do that by reopening large numbers of stores and improving their profitability including normalizing store partner pay practices starting in May. And based on our current store reopening plans, we expect that our cash needs are going to peak on this quarter. Now, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do expect the absolute impact of the lower sales and increased investments to intensify in the third quarter. It will be much more significant than they were in the second quarter in large part given to the longer duration of impact, because when you think about it, and let's talk about the U.S. business. In the second quarter we had between two and three weeks impacted by COVID-19 outbreak. In the third quarter for all intents and purposes we're expecting 13 weeks of impact, most significant in the month of April but reduced in the months of May and June as we reopen our stores and normalize our pay practices. Now for International, it's slightly different in the sense that we expect continued improvements in China from both a sales and margin perspective but we do expect adverse impacts in Japan and other markets including EMEA to intensify compared to Q2. And that's again largely due to an extended duration of impact in the third quarter. On balance there are just too many unknowns and too many moving pieces to be able to provide more explicit guidance on Q3 results outside of China at this time other than to say that the impacts to revenue and operating income will be much more substantial in absolute terms in Q3 compared to Q2, but we do expect these impacts to moderate in the fourth quarter. And we will continue our practice of providing updates to the investment community when we have better visibility to them. Certainly. Thank you, Katherine. So, since the third week of March when we initiated widespread closures of stores in the U.S. we've seen the comps which include the impact of closures based on how we've defined comps for this period of time, it's been fairly steady in the range of minus 60 to minus 70. As we have in recent weeks reopened some more of our drive-through stores, we've seen slight improvement within that range, so that we're closer to the minus 60 end of that range. But it really is not until we begin to reopen large numbers of stores starting the week of May 4 that we would anticipate seeing a material improvement in that number. Thank you, Kevin. And thanks Matt for the question. So a couple of things I'll comment on. The first is that, as we reopen our stores that are currently closed, we will be applying our normal discipline to optimize store performance. We have a world-class operations team that is as focused on the bottom line as on the top line driving sales. And so once we have better visibility to the sales recovery curves for those stores, we will be taking appropriate steps to optimize their profitability. Specifically with respect to rent, what I'd like to say is that to date we're quite proud of the fact that we have remained current on all of our rent payments, which we believe reinforces our position as a developer of choice if you will. We are having ongoing conversations with our landlords in various markets regarding what may be commercially reasonable lease concessions in the current environment. So we've not yet confirmed those arrangements and it's really premature to indicate what that relief may look like, but it is something that we are pursuing."

            "name": "Roz Brewer",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. And thank you David for that question. Let me first start off talking about April. So to-date in April, we did have drive-through locations open. And as Pat mentioned, we had comparable sales growth in those U.S. company-operated stores averaging down by about 25% or indexing right at about 75% of prior levels. So as we reopened stores, we did a few things to really create the analysis, we created a decision modeling tool that helped us look at the customer frequency that we saw in those drive-through stores as well as looking at sources from local government guidance, the infection curves by county, customer sentiment and partner sentiment. So when we open starting next week, we're going to open with modifications. And those modifications will be drive-through stores. We will amplify delivery. We will have the Mobile Order & Pay channels open, and then the addition of a new concept, the entryway handoff. We will only have roughly 30 stores that will be cafe open and order. And in those 30 stores, there will be no seating. So we are making sure that we provide a safe environment for our customers and for our partners. And we will monitor what happens as shelter-in is lifted in certain regions and areas and then begin to reopen the cafe stores. You'll see later in the summer, we'll also add curbside access to our stores. So what we're doing David is managing what we're learning and then opening the stores accordingly and applying our partners and our labor against these new entryway model and also to amplify drive-through. We'll also be helping our customers use the app and make sure that they order ahead and pick up in store either through drive-through or those other channels that I described. Sure. So as Kevin mentioned in \u2013 when we started off the call, we saw as we were entering the quarter and actually exiting last year, our Rewards members which are our highly routinized customers have really grown with us. We've increased to over 19 million of those customers in the U.S., up 15% a year ago. One of the things that we're seeing as we've been going through this COVID experience is our Starbucks Rewards members, they remain roughly 44% of our business, even as we progress through the quarter. And the majority, roughly about 70% of them are our frequent Starbucks Rewards customers. And they're still coming to our stores just less frequently. So \u2013 and also to think about what that looks like over a daytime, really we've not seen much change there. There's same frequency loss across all dayparts. It's a little bit more pronounced in the morning but that's to be expected because the routines have been disrupted. So we are encouraged by what we've seen so far in the U.S. We believe that these highly resilient customers will come back to us. The routines may look a little bit different but they will \u2013 people remain in a work from home position. But even as local mandates get relaxed, we feel like we can monitor and adapt accordingly. Sharon you have a second part of that question. I'd like to address the second part of Sharon's question. She also asked about the marketing piece around the U.S. business. And we do have a marketing plan schedule as we reopen next week. And actually, if you think about the shutdown that we had we delayed the introduction of our spring beverage lineup and Double-Star Days in addition to our Happy Hour. So you'll see those reignited with a lot more energy than in past. We will spend within our existing plans for this year just condense them and accelerate most of the work around our -- enabling our app and encouraging people to use the app and order ahead. And then in terms of delivery, we've been able to accelerate in delivery. We believe in some markets like New York where we will have a handful of delivery-only stores, we're seeing some significantly higher volumes than normal with delivery in places like New York. But it's still early for us for delivery overall. But it is one of the channels that we will accelerate as we go through the post-COVID and COVID recovery period. Thank you. Sure. Thank you, Sara for the questions. First of all let me start with -- so the plan we'll start reopening stores next week and then with the anticipation that we'll have just a little greater than 90% June 1, in the various formats. Sara when I think about the trend in both ticket and traffic, I think about the exit of fourth quarter into first quarter where we were seeing great pickup in terms of our beverage innovation, most predominantly in Nitro, Cold Brew and all cold coffee selling extremely well. It played well through our holiday beverage lineup and it continued to the point where we saw the 8% comp just into early March, the first 10 weeks of the quarter -- of the year. So first of all it starts with our beverage innovation. The second thing is the in-store experience. And so, we had done a significant amount of work to actually relieve the partner of a lot of their tactics they were doing in the stores and they were engaging with our customers in some of the most meaningful ways. Creating the best moments with our customers was really a real key change for us. Our customer sentiment and customer engagement numbers were at record levels in addition to our partner engagement was at record levels as well. We actually saw that partner engagement carry over to when we began to slow down stores due to COVID. We saw partners just volunteering to come work at stores very energetic. The response from customers has been great. We've seen great social media placements from our customers concerning how grateful they were and what they recognize our partners are doing to work in the stores. So I would just take it back to Sara the work that we've been working on for quite a while now and it's around the beverage innovation, the digital engagements that we've created and then the in-store experience. And those things continue to drive and that is exactly where we got to the 8 comp as we were coming into the COVID situation. Yes. So, Katherine thanks for the question. So first of all, Pat did allude to a range, so that 65% to 75%. So, as you drill down there's probably some of those stores that are doing better and we're seeing it migrate. It really depends on those local jurisdictions and where the sheltering-in has been lifted. And we're seeing that over the last week or so. So, in some instances, it's actually too early to tell. Also remember that we have really turned off any marketing in this time. And so our customers are used to us introducing spring beverage in addition to speaking to them on a one-to-one basis through our digital relationships. And we've not acknowledged our birthday presentations to our customers. We've not introduced Happy Hour, nor have we done our Double-Star Days. So, I would say that we're operating in an abnormal position in terms of how we communicate to our customers. Now, coming out of the gate, we're doing a lot of new things with marketing. We'll have digital media. We'll have TV. We'll have paid social owned earned media. That all begins early next week. We're also creating new e-mail contacts to each one of our members. So those 30 million that you're -- that we can reach we will do that in the next week. And the most important thing is to let them know that we are open. And it's surprising to us in some areas people are not aware if we're open or not and we've actually had different hours in different regions. So, it's too soon to tell in terms of where the pickup will be, but we're pretty positive about the work that we have ahead of us and reintroducing our summer beverage line. So, we're encouraged by that. I'll also mention too, we have extensive work going on with our delivery partner. And so you'll see some marketing in the delivery space as well. So, the acceleration of these new models that we opened, we're going to talk about them pretty broadly and loudly and we'll know more over the next 30 days. Andrew -- thank you John. Andrew a couple of things on our roasting capacity. We've been able to keep our roasting facilities open and running. We have followed local mandates for closure. As you can imagine in Amsterdam and different areas we shut down for a period of time. But we had a network of coffee built into the system. We did go take a few units down to do cleaning procedures to make sure we have a safe environment. We've adjusted in our roasting facilities for social distancing and that's been very effective for us. It has not impacted our production capacity. So, we feel pretty confident in our roasting capacity right now. Even before stores are opening we are in good shape. In terms of food sourcing, there's a lot of activity happening in proteins. Our breakfast sandwich business is secure. I will talk a little bit about breakfast as a category that we are intentionally wanting to regain as we reopen. We feel confident that we've got the inventory there and it's been in close contact with all of our suppliers in that area. So right now, we feel pretty good about our position. Thanks for the question. Sure. So Chris, thank you for that question. So one of the things I'll highlight and John Culver alluded to it earlier is a different habit between China and the U.S. China is a sit-down market and the U.S. is a grab-and-go market. So for us to have access to a good percentage number more than 50% of our stores in the U.S. are drive-through. So that alone is going to create a difference. The second difference I will say and I think it's really obvious is that we have this decentralized decision-making. And so local municipalities can make a decision on openings and closings and shelter-ins and not and the mobility of the customer. So we'll learn those patterns through the month of May and be able to come back to you as Pat described in early June. But one of the things we're doing and it's primary to us is partner safety. And so as we reopen the stores, we're reopening in a safe environment, which is why these new modes of pick up and go we're really enforcing. We're enforcing to download the app and pick up and order ahead. We're also providing the safety for our partners things like a partner pre-check. And we instituted that last week where thermometers will be available in all stores. And then we will actually have every partner take their temperature and then validate if they're ready to work through a series of questions. That's something that we learned from China. It was very helpful for us. And so we are -- we learn from China and then just expanded that work and then looked at government and local health officials and what they were saying. And that's how we plan to open and we'll be in this safe position until we learn more. So we're going to learn as we go as -- Kevin calls it monitor and adapt. We're falling into line there and really going to open our stores. I'm encouraged that we'll have 90% of the stores open. The other thing I'll tell you is that, our partners are really wanting to -- they start from connection also. And so they're excited about rejoining the stores next week and we're having somewhat of a homecoming celebration for them as they reenter the stores next week and actually take them through new training around the cleaning protocols and then also how to keep themselves safe and healthy and how to keep customers safe and healthy. So we've got a pretty strong reopening plan that kicks off early next week."

            "name": "Kevin Johnson",
            "content": "Good afternoon and welcome. Around the world, people, frontline responders, governments and businesses are all navigating extraordinary times. On behalf of Starbucks, I want to extend our deepest compassion and empathy for all those impacted by loss of life, feelings of anxiety and isolation and fears of both health and economic uncertainty during this pandemic. It was just three weeks ago, in the spirit of continued transparency, when Pat and I shared with all stakeholders, our second intra-quarter update on how COVID-19 has impacted our business and how we are responding. Today, continued recovery in China strengthens our belief that these impacts are temporary and that we will emerge from this global pandemic with new insights and capabilities that will make our business even stronger and more relevant. The principles we developed to drive our decision-making since the pandemic started in January are serving us well, bringing focus to our response and recovery effort. The three simple principles are prioritizing the health and well-being of our partners and customers, playing a constructive role in supporting health and government officials as they work to mitigate the spread of this virus and showing up in a positive and responsible way to serve our communities. In our update to stakeholders on April 8, we shared that the positive business momentum that drove one of the strongest holiday seasons in the history of our company continued well into our second quarter in the United States. Our performance was obviously disrupted by the impacts of COVID-19, but we are confident that the Starbucks brand is well positioned and that our Growth at Scale agenda remains intact and will propel future growth when we emerge from this current crisis. I will share some notable highlights from Q2 and then offer some perspective on how we expect to recover our business over time. Q2 was shaping up to be an exceptional quarter for Starbucks, driven by strong performance in the U.S. and Channel Development, even while we were simultaneously navigating the impact of COVID-19 in China. However near the end of the quarter, the pandemic started to materially impact our business outside of China both significantly in the U.S. As a result, consolidated revenue in Q2 was $6 billion, reflecting a 5% decline compared to prior year, primarily due to a 10% contraction in comparable store sales globally, driven by temporary store closures, modified store operations and slower traffic, partially offset by strength in Channel Development. In China, where the pandemic impacted our business for most of Q2, revenue and comparable store sales declined year-over-year by $325 million and 50% respectively. Today, almost 100% of our stores in China are open, many with limited seating, reduced hours and other safety protocols in place. Starbucks stores that remain closed in China are primarily located in cinemas and enclosed entertainment venues along with international travel hubs and certain tourist zones where restrictions are still in effect. Since we started reopening stores in late February, we have seen meaningful improvements in China comparable store sales in commercial, residential and office locations. We are also seeing the mix of in-store sales continuing to rise. For the month of April, comparable store sales in China were down approximately 35%, marking strong improvement from a weekly low of minus 90% in mid-February. Importantly, even though new store development activities were suspended for most of the quarter, we opened 59 net new locations in China during Q2 and another seven locations added thus far in April. We are expecting to open at least 500 net new stores in fiscal 2020 with as many as 100 new stores originally planned for this year deferred to fiscal 2021. This represents a rapid reacceleration of our new store development and speaks to the amazing spirit and enormous capability of our team in China. Given this progress, we believe our recovery plan is working and we remain optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the long-term growth potential of the premium coffee market in China. We believe, barring any new disruptions, that our business in China is on a path to substantial recovery by the end of this fiscal year. Just last week, we launched the Starbucks GOOD GOOD marketing campaign, which features plant-based alternatives in products and packaging. With this program Starbucks in China introduced Oatly, a plant-based milk alternative. Also Starbucks is the first in China to offer national distribution of Beyond Meat's plant-based proteins with new Asian menu items served in packaging made from plant-based materials. This campaign is just one step in our larger aspiration to be planet positive, while introducing relevant menu choices for customers. Over the past 20 years in China, we've established an admired and trusted brand by investing in our partners and delivering a unique premium experience to our customers. We continue to play the long game in China as we invest in our future. The state-of-the-art Coffee Innovation Park that we will be opening outside Shanghai in 2022 will serve as a key component of Starbucks worldwide coffee roasting network for customers in China and is a testament to the growth opportunity we see for specialty coffee in the market. Starbucks' premium customer experience is highly differentiated in China and the brand is as strong as ever. We continue to thoughtfully invest in China a market that has significant long-term growth potential for Starbucks. I am proud of how Starbucks China continues to pave the way as one of our two lead growth markets. Now on to the other lead growth market for Starbucks, the U.S. Coming off one of the strongest holiday quarters in the history of Starbucks, U.S. momentum continued to build well into Q2. Prior to mid-March revenue growth in the U.S. was accelerating to the strongest level in over four years, driven by comparable store sales growth of 8%, including comparable transaction growth of 4%. Additionally two-year comps were tracking to 12% growth, the strongest in over three years. With growth across all dayparts and strong contributions from both our Starbucks Rewards members and occasional customers, it is very clear that our focus on the customer experience, beverage innovation and digital customer relationships is a powerful combination. Our performance was interrupted mid-March when a national emergency was declared to mitigate COVID-19. And we decided to close over 50% of our company-operated stores and limit service to drive-through and delivery for those that remained open. In that final three weeks of Q2 U.S. comp sales swiftly decelerated, ending the quarter down 3%, driven by a 7% contraction in traffic comp. Based on the experience we gained navigating COVID-19 in China, we have been as well prepared as anyone for this mitigate-and-contain phase in the U.S., particularly as our stores are well positioned to adopt operational safety protocols, while still meeting our customers' needs. In the U.S. almost 60% of our company-operated stores include drive-through and over 80% of our customer occasions before the crisis were on-the-go, with the majority of these orders being placed at the drive-through or by using the Starbucks app to mobile order for pickup or delivery. Of note, during the second quarter 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members, our highly routinized highly engaged and loyal customer base, with whom we can directly communicate digitally increased to 19.4 million in the U.S., up 15% from a year ago. Since the crisis started, we have seen an average ticket growth increased throughout the quarter, a result of group ordering as customers through this pandemic are making Starbucks runs for their homes, local essential businesses and for frontline response teams. Overall, Nitro Cold Brew and refreshment continue to lead for beverage. And our new alt milk beverages, Almondmilk Honey Flat White and Coconutmilk Latte are also resonating well with customers. Our innovation in food, notably our new breakfast wraps, have surpassed expectations to date. Similar to our experience in China, we are transitioning into a new phase of operations we call monitor and adapt. We are now leveraging digital tools that enable us to monitor the COVID-19 situation in every community across the U.S. and leverage a variety of service options from contactless service, entryway pickup, curbside delivery where parking is available and at home delivery, that allow us to thoughtfully reopen stores and scale up operations. We are finding new innovative ways to serve our communities, prioritizing the safety of our customers and partners, with a focus on exceeding public health standards and adjusting to new customer expectations. The strength of our digital reach, combined with a range of service options, is enabling us to reopen stores, community by community in a thoughtful way, using the three simple principles that have guided our response thus far. Our monitoring capability provides the input necessary for decisions that enable us to turn the dial up or down depending on the situation in a specific community, or a specific store. This is the beginning of the recovery as we reopen stores, beginning in early May and we expect to have approximately 90% of all company-operated U.S. Starbucks stores reopened by early June with enhanced safety protocols and modified schedules. We are also sharing our store safety protocols with our licensees across the U.S. who continue to responsibly operate their stores particularly in grocery locations across the country. My summary on our U.S. business is this. This monitor-and-adapt phase in the U.S. is the inflection point for reopening stores and begins a recovery process that requires ongoing monitoring community by community to rapidly adapt and drive the recovery. We are well positioned to leverage our digital assets and new operating formats like contactless pickup and curbside to expand service to customers. And our focus on the customer experience, beverage innovation and digital differentiates Starbucks and will enable us to regain the momentum we had prior to COVID-19. At Starbucks, the third place has always been about community connection and convenience. And we expect to strengthen this competitive advantage through continued improvements in our digital capabilities and innovative store formats enabling us to connect with customers and serve our communities safely and with even greater convenience. I am proud of how Starbucks partners in the U.S. have shown up through all of this. The fact that while serving their communities, they also served over 1 million free cups of coffee to the frontline responders, who have worked tirelessly to care for others which makes us all very proud. Leveraging the playbook that was developed in China and refined in the U.S., we are working closely with our international license partners to navigate the current environment and prepare for recovery guided by our mission and values and commitment to delivering the Starbucks Experience safely and responsibly. With Starbucks in 82 markets, we are committed to supporting our license partners around the world as they too navigate this challenge. And finally a few comments on our Channel Development business. The strategic value of our Channel Development segment has been clearly evident in the current environment. Selling Starbucks products through multiple channels amplifies the brand and extends our ability to meet customers where they are, even when they are unable to visit our retail stores. Through the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle and our ready-to-drink partners including Pepsi and Tingyi, we offer a wide range of Starbucks products down the aisle in grocery stores, at mass merchants, in convenience stores and online. In Q2 this segment's revenue grew by 16% which includes a 5% favorable impact, primarily related to the Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activity, boosting our share of the coffee market outside of specialty retail. This continues to be an important element of our Growth at Scale agenda. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle was established just 20 months ago. And since that time, we have now expanded the Starbucks brand to nearly 50 markets around the world. It is clear that our channel strategy is working extremely well. Before I hand over to Pat to walk you through the details of the quarter and balance-of-year perspective, I want to reinforce one key point. Starbucks is resilient. For over 49 years since our founding, we have overcome every challenge presented to us and are overcoming this challenge as well. Our China business is on a path to recovery. Our U.S. business is entering the phase of reopening stores, adapting to the new reality and restoring and rebuilding momentum. And our Channel Development business is posting very strong results and acting as a brand amplifier. Our Growth at Scale agenda provides the focus and discipline for us to successfully navigate this challenge. We remain confident in our approach. We understand there's much more to do and that we must be agile as the world navigates COVID-19 and works to create a vaccine. We have a very clear path going forward. We are optimistic about the future and we believe Starbucks will emerge from this experience even stronger, more determined and more focused than ever before. But the real credit goes to Starbucks partners. Together, we are emotionally connected to a mission grounded in humanity. And together we are making principled decisions true to our values. Partners are the key to our resilience. It is why we will do all we can to provide them with economic certainty and support them through this challenging period. After all partners are the heartbeat of Starbucks. Now, I'll turn it over to Pat for a deeper dive into our Q2 financial results, an update on our FY 2020 outlook, and an overview of our financial readiness to weather this crisis. Pat? Thanks David. Roz, why don't I let you share a little bit of perspective on the U.S.? Thanks Roz. I'll just add one other point that we shared David to reinforce what Roz just said. Pre-COVID, 80% of our customer occasions in stores in the U.S. were for to-go take-away. And so by augmenting the in-store experience with mobile ordering and contactless pickup, we can service significant volume of customers without having the cafe seating area actually opened. And so I think that's an important point. Areas that will be slower similar in China if it's office -- stores near office parks where office workers are not going back to work yet, they will be a little slower. And then I think we anticipate that the mall stores will also be slower. And that -- mall stores are less than eight -- fewer than 8% I think of the total store fleet in the U.S. But I think Roz captured it quite well. Thanks, John. Let me just add one other observation. When we look at consumer behavior on a global basis as it relates to COVID-19, after people have been sheltering at home in a lockdown situation for several weeks \u2013 in China, it was a little over three weeks. In the U.S. it's been about six weeks. What they look for \u2013 what consumer sentiment looks for is something that is safe - experiences that are safe, familiar and convenient. And that is consistent around the world. And so what we've done at Starbucks is we've built the operating protocols in our stores to be safe to follow every \u2013 and exceed every health standard we can exceed and ensure we can provide every customer a safe experience. Clearly, getting that Starbucks Experience is something that's familiar to them. And when you've had to be sheltering in place for several weeks just to get out for a nice uplifting experience at Starbucks it's familiar and it's rewarding. And so customers come back to our stores. But having this convenient ability and those three attributes safe, familiar and convenient that is something that works around the world, following these periods where people have been sheltering at home. We've seen that in China. And I think we're going to see that in even a more amplified way in the U.S. but it's something that we're seeing in every single market around the world when they come out of sort of the lockdown phase. Roz, why don't I have you kind of respond, as it relates to digital and U.S. and safety protocols? And then maybe John can follow-up on the China digital. So why don't you go ahead first Roz? Yes. John, this is Kevin. Let me just comment. Pre-COVID, we had built a tremendous momentum in the business by focusing on three things: the customer experience, beverage innovation and digital customer relationships. And that remains the powerful combination for us to continue to engage and drive frequency of customer visits. But we recognize coming through the COVID experience that everyone around the world is sharing that really optimizing the initial store experience around these concepts of safe familiar and convenient is what gets customers now to start -- that's kind of the on-ramp to that engagement. Now certainly, we're going to know a lot more 30 days from now in the U.S. But I think as Roz highlighted, that in the drive-throughs, just the number of drive-throughs we've had open without even the cafe open, we were delivering 75 -- roughly 75% of prior year revenue in those individual stores. And so that's just an indication of the power of the brand and the strength of connection that we have with customers. Now I think over this next week when we open more stores and with the set of experiences that Roz has articulated, I think we're going to begin that path of engaging. And I think 30 days from now, we're going to have a much clearer view of how rapidly that goes. And we've got a great beverage lineup that Roz just talked about that's going to release. We're going to market and evangelize that. We've got -- we just grew digital customer relationships by 15% to 19.4 million in the U.S., we're going to leverage that to communicate with our customers. And we're going to be thoughtful and responsible with each step that we take and I think that's the formula. Roz, why don't you take those questions? Yes. I'll just add the increase in ticket was group orders. I mean, it was drive-throughs -- going through a drive-through it's typically someone making a family Starbucks run and buying for their entire family or somebody making let's say, a frontline responder run and buying -- getting food and beverage for frontline responders. We saw a lot of that. So it's really driven by the fact that it was just drive-through only. And if you're going to take the time to go through drive-through you're going to load up and buy for the entire family or the entire group. And that drove down transaction drove up ticket. Yeah. Dennis this is Kevin. I would just start by commenting on the momentum that we had generated pre-COVID. And clearly the -- posting an 8% comp with four points of transaction growth in the U.S. in the first -- up until the last two weeks of March was clearly an indication that I think this combination of the in-store experience, beverage innovation and digital customer relationships was putting us in a position where we were I think growing share of the customer occasions at specialty coffee retail. And I believe if anything the way we've navigated the virus continues to put us in a very strong position competitively. That said there's -- the economic implications following this are yet to be determined. I think, we're very optimistic about our competitive position and we just have to -- we'll be a lot smarter 30 days from now after we get to see the reaction of the reopening in the United States. Similarly in China, I think we're also in a very strong competitive position. I'd say both in the U.S. and China we're in the strongest competitive position that we've been in, in the history of the company. And a lot of that comes through the focus and discipline that we had going into COVID, as well as the principled way we have decided every action we've taken to navigate the COVID virus responsibly and thoughtfully prioritizing the health and well-being of our partners and our customers, the engagement partnership we've had with governments and health officials to help contain and -- mitigate and contain the spread of the virus and the fact that we are showing up in a positive and responsible way in every community that we're part of. And so I think our competitive position is very strong. That said we rise. We've got to keep -- stay focused on the things that matter. We've got to do the right things for our partners and our customers. And if we do that, I think we emerge from this strengthening, the brand and strengthening the connection that we have with our customers. Pat, why don't you take the numbers on the comp and then we'll hand off to Roz to talk about sort of the trends that she's watching in terms of customer behavior? Yes. More stores and more ways for customers to engage. And so Roz, why don't you talk a little bit about sort of the incremental ways that we're now engaging beyond just drive-through as we reopen these stores next week? John I'll let you comment on China. John, maybe you take green coffee sourcing. And then Roz why don't you take rest of the supply chain, the roasting network as well as the food sources? But John since you manage the coffee piece on green coffee sourcing of green coffee, why don't you talk a little bit about that? Matt, this is Kevin. Let me just comment on the part of your question then I'll hand it over to Pat. You'd suggested that 50% of the stores that we closed were hampered for some reason. That's not the case. We decided when we went into the shelter-at-home to only open drive-throughs and we did that for partner safety. We just decided rather than have any location that has a cafe opened during the period where the nation was sheltering at home and social distancing we thought that was the safest way for us to ensure both our partners' safety as well as out of our customers. So that's what drove the decision to close all those stores, whereas certainly others made different decisions and that's fine. But we prioritize the health and well-being of our Starbucks partners and the customers, which is why we were more aggressive perhaps than others in closing stores. And then, I'll hand over to Pat for comments on the rest of your question. And I do think it is fair to believe that occupancy -- lease rates are going to go down post-COVID just given the situation. And I think that's a fair assumption. Yes. Let me just comment briefly and then I'll hand off to Roz to sort of share the path for U.S. and then John can close by a little bit of some of the differences in China. For me, I think the comment I would make was in China, it was decisions were made centrally by central government on a city-by-city basis and even certain office parks and things were actually coordinated when they opened. And so the opening of stores was over a longer period of time than I think we're going to see in the U.S., but it was orchestrated city-by-city and almost community-by-community centrally. Keep in mind in China, the period of shutdown or the period of sheltering-at-home was about three weeks whereas here in the U.S. it's been about six weeks. And so now as we reopen in the U.S., I think we anticipate that the stores are going to reopen across the nation at a faster rate. But the format we're going to use is going to be -- in each store is going to be dependent on sort of what's happening in that particular store. So I think there's a lot of similarities in terms of the safety protocol, the operating protocols in the stores the way we -- the priorities the principles we use to make these decisions. But I think there'll be a little bit of a difference in terms of in the U.S. deciding -- we'll open them faster, but we'll decide geography-by-geography what's the appropriate format. Roz, why don't you share a little bit more about the plans that you see unfolding over the next 30 days? Thanks, Roz. And John last word on China? Thank you. I want to thank you for joining us today and I hope you and your families are all safe and healthy. We continue to navigate through this unprecedented situation staying true to our mission and values and I'm pleased with where we are. China has demonstrated a clear path to recovery. The U.S. is prepared to reopen a large number of stores next week and throughout the month of May. Our channels business has demonstrated resilience through all of this and I am confident in our approach and optimistic about our ability to continue to drive Starbucks recovery in this monitor-and-adapt phase. We all understand the power of the Starbucks brand is strong. And through our principled actions we have strengthened the trust and confidence of both our partners and our customers have in Starbucks. That will serve us very well for the long term. I'm very proud of how Starbucks partners have shown up in every part of the world and we will continue to be focused, disciplined and transparent with all stakeholders, as we continue to navigate this situation. Thank you."

I will now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?\nKevin Johnson: Well, good afternoon and welcome. Q1 was an exceptional quarter for Starbucks. The positive business momentum we've created over the past fiscal year continues with a strong start to fiscal 2020. These results were fueled by a healthy balance of comparable sales growth and new store development, as well as continued expansion of our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. I'm especially pleased that we delivered meaningful margin expansion in the quarter, even as we continued to invest in the key areas to support sustainable growth, first and foremost in our partners, as well as in beverage innovation and digital customer relationships. Given the strength of our Q1 results, we had intended to raise certain aspects of our full year financial outlook for fiscal 2020. However, due to the dynamic situation unfolding with the coronavirus, we are not revising guidance at this time. But as we get more clarity on the situation, we will transparently communicate with investors. Our immediate focus is on two key priorities in China: first, caring for the health and well-being of our partners and customers in our stores; second, playing a constructive role in supporting local health officials and government leaders as they work to contain the coronavirus. That said, we remain optimistic and committed to the long-term growth potential in China, a market we have been in for more than 20 years. Before I hand over to Pat, who will provide more detail on our Q1 financial performance, let me share some highlights for the quarter, which provide powerful evidence of the unique strength of our brand. I will also outline additional steps we are taking that continue to elevate Starbucks in ways that will inspire our partners and deepen our relationship with customers. In the first quarter, Starbucks delivered global revenue growth of 9%, excluding the 2% impact to streamline activities. This was led by strong comp sales growth of 5% and net new store growth of 6% over the last 12 months. At the forefront of these results were our two lead growth markets, the U.S. and China, along with Channel Development. The U.S. grew revenues by an impressive 9% in Q1, led by comp sales growth of 6%, including comp transaction growth of 3% for a third consecutive quarter. With a two-year sales comp of 10% for the past two consecutive quarters, it is clear that our focus on the customer experience, beverage innovation and digital customer relationship is working. At the center of this are our Starbucks partners and the investments we continue to make in them. It is no coincidence that following last September's leadership experience, where we hosted 12,000 Starbucks field leaders and outlined a series of partner-focused initiatives and investments, our partners delivered one of the most successful U.S. holiday seasons in the history of the company. Our partners in China also delivered a solid quarter, with revenues increasing by 15% in Q1, excluding a 2% impact of foreign exchange, fueled by a 16% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and a 3% increase in comp. And for the fourth consecutive quarter, we grew total transactions at a double-digit percentage pace in this strategically important market. On every market visit I make to China I experience firsthand the passion, innovation and commitment our partners demonstrate each and every day and I'm proud of them. Given the purposeful and highly differentiated partner investments, it is no surprise Starbucks was recently named China's best employer by Aon Hewitt for the fifth consecutive year. Finally, on the strength of our channel partnerships with Nestl\u00e9 and Pepsi, our Channel Development revenue grew 5% in Q1 when normalized for the 7% impact of the Tazo and Global Coffee Alliance transitions, boosting our share of the coffee market outside of specialty retail. This is another example of the strength of the Starbucks brand that continues to expand globally, reaching more customers through more channels. Collectively these results demonstrate that we are on the right track with our Growth at Scale agenda. I am especially grateful to all Starbucks partners around the world who celebrate coffee and human connection and whose passion and commitment to the Starbucks mission and our company values are creating long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders.  As we approach the 50th anniversary of Starbucks in 2021, I am optimistic about the future. Why? Well when I step back and look at the quarter, I see multiple proof points of the unique strength of our brand, strength that is derived from targeted investments that bolster our competitive position in a high-growth category enabling us to unlock the full potential of one of the world's most admired and trusted brands. In the U.S., customer connection scores reached another all-time high in Q1 as our dedicated store partners continue to elevate the Starbucks experience and deliver the very best moments with our customers each and every day. We realize this is a key differentiator for Starbucks and we continue to make investments in partner hours, benefits and training. There's no doubt that our partners and the investments we make in them are at the core of creating the unique Starbucks Experience that fueled our Q1 performance. Additionally our brand equity research in the first quarter confirmed that Starbucks continues to lead consumer perceptions of specialty coffee retail concepts in the U.S., well ahead of other brands including so-called third wave independent and local coffee concepts. This is aided in part by our proprietary beverage innovation and our unique ability to personalize handcrafted beverages at scale. We strengthened this competitive advantage in Q1 by extending our Cold Brew platform and Cold Foam options with two new seasonal beverages: Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew and Irish Cream Cold Brew which together contributed to our traffic growth for the quarter. Notably for five consecutive quarters our comp growth has outperformed the external indexes and benchmarks we track in the restaurant and QSR space. Our brand strength was also evident on the digital front in Q1. In the U.S., we added a record 1.4 million customers to our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards member base ending the quarter with 18.9 million active members a 16% increase over prior year. This is important because we know from experience that when customers join our rewards program their total spend with Starbucks increases meaningfully. We also know that Starbucks is increasingly valued for convenience as the mix of Mobile Order & Pay transactions in the U.S. grew to 17% in Q1. And our industry-leading digital platform will further differentiate us from the competition over time. Our digital progress in China was equally compelling and is resonating with the digitally savvy Chinese consumer. Proprietary research in Q1 showed that Starbucks remains the country's most beloved coffee brand and customers' first choice for away-from-home coffee. In the first quarter sales from China's mobile orders jumped to 15% of total revenue up from 10% the past quarter with 9% coming from delivery and 6% from mobile order and pickup. Underpinning these results was the continued growth of China's 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members reaching 10.2 million customers in Q1. That's 40% growth over the prior year when the program was relaunched. Our first quarter digital strength in China was further evidenced by record sales on Alibaba's Singles' Day shopping festival, the number 1 card position on Tmall and the leading brand on WeChat social gifting platform. Over our 20 years in China, we have established unparalleled brand stature by delivering a unique, premium experience to our customers. Outside of specialty coffee retail the power of our brand was demonstrated by the continued expansion of our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9, now in more than 40 markets including the additional five new markets we entered in Q1 with product sales significantly ahead of expectations. Every customer interaction in our stores establishes customer affinity and brand loyalty with the Global Coffee Alliance then acting as a brand amplifier bringing Starbucks coffee to new channels and new markets. Our Starbucks Reserve Roasteries are also important brand amplifiers. In November we opened our Roastery in Chicago our sixth Roastery globally to a phenomenal customer reception. Since the opening, the store continues to gain international attention attracting an average of 10,000 visitors a day with a peak of more than 21,000 visitors in a single day. I want to thank our Starbucks partners who work in the Chicago Roastery as well as the City of Chicago for the warm welcome and spectacular response to the opening of the world's largest Starbucks. These proof points provide clear evidence that the Starbucks brand is not only strong, but is getting stronger through the focus and discipline of our Growth at Scale agenda. In fact just last week Starbucks was named one of Fortune's Most Admired Companies for the 18th consecutive year. In summary I could not be more pleased with our Q1 results and how they reinforce the unique strength of Starbucks. But make no mistake, we do not take this for granted. We will continue to take clear and decisive steps to build our brand for the future, focusing on our competitive advantages, investing in our partners as they create those unique Starbucks experiences for our customers driving beverage innovation and enhancing digital relationships. And while we do this we are further amplifying our brand through the Global Coffee Alliance and committing to an even higher level of social responsibility with bolder aspirations for environmental sustainability. As many of you have seen last week we disclosed an ambitious multi-decade aspiration for Starbucks to become a resource-positive company which means we as a company want to give more than we take from the planet. We thought long and hard about this aspiration and are being deliberate in our approach. Over the past year, we conducted a rigorous environmental sustainability study in partnership with third-party advocacy groups. We embraced science-based targets and utilized industry experts to audit every aspect related to Starbucks' impact on climate, water and waste. We have shared the sustainability baseline report and our aspirations transparently on our website knowing that this will not be easy. The journey will not be linear. It will require innovation, many industry partnerships, alignment with other like-minded companies, public policy support and engagement of Starbucks partners and customers. This will challenge us in new and different ways and will require transformational change and measured risk-taking. We start this journey understanding our footprint, building upon our decade of experience in sustainability and committing to lead on something that is important to all of humanity: taking care of our planet. And we invite others to join us. As announced last week, we will be transparent in reporting short- and long-term progress against our goals and we will start with preliminary targets for 2030. That will be the focus of our research and operational plans going forward. Then on Starbucks' 50th anniversary in 2021 we will formalize our 2030 environmental goals and our strategies based on what we have learned between now and then. As we embark on this journey, we will prioritize, sequence and balance our investments as we do across every aspect of our business. We remain committed to our ongoing double-digit EPS growth model. We have momentum. Our brand is strong and we will continue to responsibly grow our business by staying true to our mission and values: doing the right things to care for and inspire our partners, creating great Starbucks experiences for our customers and pursuing a bold aspiration for the planet. In closing, I would again like to thank my fellow Starbucks partners around the world. I have the privilege of sharing all your good work on these calls and it is an honor to serve you and all of our stakeholders. I would also like to reiterate our support for the ongoing work as we respond to the coronavirus in a thoughtful and responsible way to protect our partners and support health officials and the government as they work to contain this public health risk. Starbucks has made a donation to the Red Cross to help support these efforts. We are making decisions real time to ensure the health and well-being of our partners and I am proud of how Starbucks, China is navigating a very dynamic situation. Now I'll turn it over to Pat for a deeper dive into our Q1 financial results and an update on our FY 2020 outlook. Pat?\nPat Grismer: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report non-GAAP EPS of $0.79 for our first quarter of fiscal 2020, exceeding our expectations and reflecting meaningful margin expansion in each of our operating segments. This represents a 16% increase year-over-year when excluding an $0.08 headwind related to a lower income tax rate in fiscal 2019. These results underscore the strength of our brand globally and the outstanding underlying momentum across our business as we continue to execute our \u201cGrowth at Scale\u201d agenda. I will first take you through our Q1 fiscal 2020 operating performance by segment followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. I will then share some perspective on our outlook for the full fiscal year. Our Americas segment delivered revenue growth of 9% in Q1, primarily driven by 6% comp sales growth and net new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months. Our U.S. business delivered an impressive 6% comp sales growth in Q1, driven equally by transactions and ticket. These results were driven by an improved partner-led in-store experience, a strong beverage lineup and increased digital customer engagement. Beverage led on comp growth for a sixth consecutive quarter driving approximately five points of comp sales growth with strength across all beverage categories with food contributing the remaining point. Our cold platform continues to resonate with customers during all seasons and was our primary growth engine for the quarter led by cold coffee. Importantly, the growth in cold beverages in Q1 occurred in all dayparts and all regions reflecting broad appeal across our customer base. Following the success of our fall seasonal offerings at the start of the quarter and building on the success of last year's season, our holiday platforms delivered strong performance that exceeded our expectations. Returning favorites such as Peppermint Mocha and the new innovations like Irish Cream Cold Brew created momentum throughout the holiday period. And as Kevin mentioned, our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program continued to gain momentum building on the launch of multi-tier redemption last April. Our reimagined Happy Hour resonated well with customers driving additional member growth. And Gift Card activations delivered their strongest year-over-year dollar growth in four years. Ticket growth of 3% for the quarter was led by pricing, beverage attach and food. We saw transaction growth in both the morning and afternoon dayparts for a third consecutive quarter and our highest quarterly peak transaction growth in three years. These improvements would not have been possible without the dedication of our Green Apron partners, who continue to accommodate higher volumes while elevating the customer experience. And finally, Americas non-GAAP operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 22.0% in Q1, driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by growth in wages and benefits and to a lesser degree investments in labor hours and inflation and occupancy costs. Moving on to International. The segment delivered revenue growth of 10% in Q1 excluding a 6% unfavorable impact of streamline-related activities. This was led by 11% net new store growth over the past 12 months. International's comp sales growth of 1% in Q1 was adversely impacted by two points due to a soft quarter in Japan, which was lapping 6% comp sales growth from last year. China our lead international growth market delivered solid comp sales growth of 3% in Q1 including 1% comp transaction growth. Continued expansion and strong performance of mobile ordering as well as the up-leveled Starbucks Rewards program were primary drivers of these results. At the end of the first quarter, mobile order and pickup have been rolled out to more than 100 cities, encompassing more than 90% of our store base just seven months following the launch of the program. And we expanded delivery to 130 cities, covering more than 80% of our portfolio. International's non-GAAP operating margin increased by 170 basis points to 21.4%. When excluding the 70 basis point impact of streamline related activities, non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 100 basis points driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by unfavorability in product mix and strategic investments notably in-store and digital initiatives. On to Channel Development. Revenue declined 2% in Q1 as we lapped two items that benefited fiscal 2019; the sale of Tazo branded products to Unilever and transition activities related to the Global Coffee Alliance. When excluding the 7% adverse impact of these items, as well as Global Coffee Alliance transition activities in fiscal 2020, revenue increased by 5% in Q1 led by strong underlying growth in the Global Coffee Alliance. This segment's non-GAAP operating margin improved by 70 basis points over the prior year. Normalizing for the 20 basis point impact of the transition activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 90 basis points in Q1 driven by favorable distribution efficiencies and business mix. Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin of 18.2% in Q1 increased by 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies. The favorability from these items was partially offset by growth in wages and benefits and to a lesser degree by rent inflation and investments in store labor hours. I am particularly pleased that we delivered meaningful margin expansion while also continuing to invest in our partners, our stores and our digital capabilities to keep the Starbucks brand strong and relevant. To a great extent, this reflects our ability to drive improvements in margin from sales leverage as well as supply chain and G&A efficiencies and to reinvest a meaningful portion of that upside in our key brand differentiators, which strengthen our competitive position and fuel long-term sustainable growth. Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2020. Given the strength of our first quarter results, we had intended to raise certain aspects of our guidance for the full fiscal year. However, as Kevin mentioned given the extraordinary circumstances that are rapidly developing in China, we are simply reaffirming our original guidance and we'll provide an update when we have better visibility to the impact of coronavirus. The magnitude of the impact will depend on the duration of store closures as we work with local authorities to manage the situation and protect our partners and customers. At present, we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact to the business. Notwithstanding, the fact that our China business represented only 10% of our global revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect these events to have a material impact on our international segment and consolidated results for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2020. In any event based on what we currently know, we expect the impact to our business will be temporary. Our brand is very strong in China and our confidence in the profitability and growth potential of this business is undiminished. To summarize, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and view these results as further validation of our strategy to grow Starbucks at scale with greater focus and discipline. We appreciate the hard work of our Starbucks partners who delivered these results in a manner that remains true to our company's mission and values, which is the core of our business. And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by Roz Brewer and John Culver as Durga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. Could you maybe just help us understand or dimensionalize the impact of China a little bit more, first just when the stores were closed? Those stores that aren't closed maybe a magnitude of what you think the sales declines are currently. And do you continue to pay employees? I assume you do, but just clarify that. And then finally is delivery and offset. Is there a delivery business that can offset some of the closures, or has that also been curtailed by this outbreak?\nKevin Johnson: Thanks John. We'll have John Culver, kind of, give you a little bit of color on the day-to-day in China and then Pat will follow up on the second part of your question related to the implications. John?\nJohn Culver: Yeah, John obviously Kevin reiterated the fact that we're focused on making sure we're taking care of our partners, their health and wellbeing as well as the customers. In terms of the closures what we've seen is that over the last few weeks, I would say that as the situation has accelerated, we've taken action to close stores both working with the local government and the direction that they've given us but then also proactively closing stores in the country. As we shared we currently have over half our stores closed in the market. We are assessing this each and every day. We do have delivery available to customers from stores that are remaining open. But again this is something that we continue to assess every day. And let me just reiterate this is a very complex situation. And I'm working very closely with Belinda and the team in China to navigate this changing environment. And as a company, we've navigated complex situations before. And in China, we feel there's no other company that's better positioned to navigate this, given our relationship that we -- and trust we've been able to build with our partners and the relationship and trust that they've been able to build with their customers. We will remain transparent as the events continue to unfold, but we do have complete confidence in the decisions that we're making and we will continue to provide complete support for our partners and for the people of China as they navigate this situation. We've been in the market for 20 years, and we have built an admired and trusted brand and we will continue to play the long game in China as we navigate in the coming weeks and months.\nPat Grismer: And John, this is Pat. Just to build on what John has said. It really is difficult to say at this juncture what the impact to our business will be and how it will show up in our financials given the fluidity of the situation. The business impact is largely a function of two things: the number of stores closed and the duration of closure. And with respect to the duration of closure, it's not entirely in our control. I would say to a lesser extent the financial impact is a function of how we manage wage costs during the period of closure. So we're simply not able to provide a reasonable estimate at this point in time. We will need to move beyond the extended Chinese New Year holiday season to assess how the situation may be stabilizing and what the implications are for store closures. We're probably looking at early March at the earliest to reasonably assess the implications for revenue, operating income, and EPS for our second quarter and for the full year. At the very latest, we'll provide an update in conjunction with our Q2 earnings release on April 28. Our commitment is to maintaining transparency with investors. And as and when we have a reasonable basis for estimating the financial impacts for the quarter and year, we will communicate that information. But importantly, we do expect the impacts to be temporary. Our long-term double-digit growth model is fully intact. And of course, we will gain the benefit of lapping these temporary impacts next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good afternoon and Pat, maybe just following up on some of those questions around the guidance. Would you be willing to share where your guidance would be without this China issue so that we can understand where the baseline of the underlying business is, especially if you want to assume that it's temporary?\nPat Grismer: Yeah. I'm not going to provide details as to the magnitude of the guidance raise that we had planned or the specific line items, but I'm happy to share that we would have raised guidance for operating margin and for EPS on the strength of our Q1 results and visibility to some balance of year benefits. But given the uncertainty of the coronavirus situation in China and its impact to our near term results which we expect to be temporary, we felt it was best to defer any change to our guidance until we had better visibility to full year results including the impact of coronavirus. And as I said before, we're committed to being responsibly transparent with our investors and we'll provide an update when we have reasonable confidence behind our numbers, because it would not be helpful to speculate at this time. But we could not be more pleased with our Q1 results across the board, the overall underlying momentum in our business and the confidence that that gives us behind our ability to deliver better than expected results setting aside this new issue that has emerged in China.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi. Good afternoon. I am not going to ask a China question. I actually wanted to talk about the Americas and the decline in G&A dollars year-over-year. I know it was modest, but if you could kind of talk about that whether that was just timing. And then on Channel Development, I think you had expected revenue to go down somewhere between 7% and 9% this year. It was obviously a lot less than the first quarter in terms of the degree of decline. Is there something that's changed there? Is it a timing dynamic, more weighted to the back half of the declines? Any commentary would be helpful.\nPat Grismer: Sharon, this is Pat. I'm happy to take both questions. First of all with respect to the G&A, we are very pleased with the progress that we are making across the company in delivering our G&A efficiency commitment. As a reminder, we had committed to reduce by 100 basis points G&A as a percentage of system sales. That is not something that we routinely report, because we don't report system sales. But a good proxy for that is non-GAAP G&A as a percentage of revenue and we do report that. We've added that to our supplementary schedules in our earnings release. And we have seen meaningful efficiencies emerge in the first quarter, and we expect that to continue balance of year. That's on the back of very significant work over the last 12 to 18 months to realize productivity in our G&A, not just in the Americas but really across all of our segments and certainly at corporate. And then with respect to the Global Coffee Alliance, we did see better than expected results in the first quarter. We did anticipate a decline for the first quarter and for the full year, but our better than expected results in the first quarter resulted from outperformance, specifically in the Global Coffee Alliance. So we could not be more pleased with how our products are performing as we continue to partner with Nestl\u00e9 and we anticipate -- that was going to be one of the aspects of our improved guidance for the year is better than expected revenue growth from our Channel Development segment.\nKevin Johnson: John, you might want to comment on the new markets and...\nJohn Culver: Yeah. And so Sharon, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of the Channel Development business, in particular the Global Coffee Alliance. Through the quarter, we saw acceleration into 40 markets around the world where we have our products available through grocery as well as foodservice. We also are on path by the end of this quarter that we're in to be in over 50 markets. Our product sales continue to be significantly ahead of expectations both in terms of packaged coffee, Nespresso capsules, as well as Dolce Gusto. When you look at our core business here in the U.S., Starbucks brand outgrew the total category for coffee. Roast and ground share grew 80 basis points, K-Cup share grew 40 basis points, and we've got some exciting new items that are coming up. Later this spring, we previously announced that we're launching premium soluble coffee which will -- we're excited about and the big opportunity internationally with that. And then the launch that we had with our Creamers of four flavors, we're now expanding to an additional two new flavors given the recent success. So, the Global Coffee Alliance itself is performing very well around the world and it's helping us continue to grow the Starbucks brand and amplify the brand as Kevin highlighted in his comments earlier.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. I was hoping to get an update on Deep Brew, especially as we come into April. And I think we'll have some changes around the change in the AI machine that delivered some customized loyalty to customers as well as the change in the My Starbucks Rewards program. Maybe as a slightly separate but related question, how much, I guess, confidence do you have as we do get in some of the strength that we saw in fiscal 2019 that we can lap some of those significant changes in the consumer offerings?\nKevin Johnson: John I'll let -- I'll have Roz give you a little perspective on Deep Brew and how it's influencing our performance.\nRoz Brewer: Thanks John for the question. So, first of all, I wanted to ground everybody in what's happening in some of our equipment innovation. And one of the strongest pieces of innovation that we're seeing is combining our Mastrena II machine which is our espresso machine which we installed about 1,900 units last year. We've got 4,000 of those coming this year and those machines are AI-enabled. And so that is where we'll see the most significant deliverable around how we will integrate AI into understanding how to deliver the best coffee experience and also reducing the amount of time it takes to deliver and then giving us a chance to provide a variety of coffee to our customers. So, you'll see that come through. There's also other innovation happening around Deep Brew, it will show up in various aspects of the business, but the equipment position is our strongest position right now. In addition to that when we talk about the things that have happened in our loyalty program, we did see some significant improvement in this quarter. Right now we finished this quarter at about 18.9 million growth and that's a 16% improvement versus last year in our active Starbucks Rewards members. It's the strongest growth rate we've seen in three years. So, the work that we've done in our multi-tier redemption is also allowing us to grow our member base. We've got an increase of annual member growth of 2.7 million members and we're also seeing all-time records in that area as well. It's enabling us to do really creative work with how we reimagine our Happy Hour performance making sure that we are understanding what the customer needs. There's a lot of customer insights that comes out of the work that we do as we grow our member base. We're also seeing the loyalty programs in the new membership behavior that we're seeing which contributed two points of the 6% comp for the quarter. So, we are learning from what's happening as we align AI to our equipment and then the work that comes out of our loyalty programs in getting us closer to customers' expectations and it's making a difference.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thanks very much. Just a broader question on China learnings putting aside the coronavirus. Clearly, there's lots of competition in the market I think oftentimes coming in on the lower end in terms of experience and perhaps customer affluence. So, I'm just wondering what learnings would you say you've taken from this competition to better your positioning. It seems like you had a slowdown a year ago and now it seems like trends are moving in the upward direction. Again I'm just wondering if you could provide some clarity in terms of which two or three initiatives would you say maybe you took some learnings from some of that competition to better yourself in the market. Thank you.\nKevin Johnson: John, why don't you take that one?\nJohn Culver: Well, Jeffrey I think there's a couple of things around what we're doing in China. First and foremost, focusing on the premium quality of the coffee and our ability to handcraft the beverages for customers to the way they want it we feel that there is no other competitor in China that is able to do it and replicate it at the level that we are as signified by the more than seven million customers we serve a week across the 4,300 stores. In addition you then have the opportunity of developing these relationships between our partners and our customers. And our partners are truly the differentiating factor in terms of bringing the Starbucks Experience to life for our customers. And when you go to China and you experience our people and their passion for coffee and their passion for service to customers that is a true differentiator that we have in the market. You then put all that together in the third place. And the beauty of our stores, the inviting environment, the way in which we show up in the third place, we have an environment that customers come to and want to be with their family and friends. Now, what we've done is we've also enhanced that with the digital experience. And we had a great quarter as it relates to digital. We now have 90-day actives grew 40% year-over-year to 10.2 million, that's nearly double from where it was a year ago. We've also gone through and built out Mobile Order & Pay capabilities as well as delivery. So, mobile orders in total reached more than 15% of sales mix in the quarter compared to 10% in Q4, so 9% being deliveries, 6% being Mobile Order & Pay, and we're continuing to build out these digital relationships with customers. Then you couple all that with the Global Coffee Alliance in our RTD business in China. There is no other company brand in China that has the distribution points that we have. We have over 100,000 points of distribution of the Starbucks brand in China and our partners are bringing it to life every day. And it's their passion and their commitment that is making us successful and will continue to make us successful.\nKevin Johnson: Yeah. I mean, just add to John's comments and share a perspective, Jeffrey. I think look over \u2013 throughout history, we've had many, many, competitors enter the market. Look coffee is a large and growing addressable market. And we stay focused on the premium experience and the unique differentiators that we believe create Starbucks. And if you look throughout history there's a consistent pattern. In most all cases, our competitors shift to focusing more on the value play. And you see that time and time again. And I think we can continue to see that trend. So the lesson for us is continue to amplify those unique differentiators that make us Starbucks. And that's why as you think about the Growth at Scale, we really as John said amplify the customer experience, we create in the store. We amplify the quality of our coffee and the beverage innovation that we provide, the fact those beverages are handcrafted and personalized for each and every customer. And then, we extended that in-store experience to a digital customer relationship. And those mix of ingredients are what differentiates us. And we feel confident that we understand them, we don't compromise those and we stay focused on playing our game. It's worked in the past, it's working today and it will work in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew DiFrisco: Thank you. I just had a couple of follow-ups. With respect to China \u2013 thank you for sharing that about the 10% of global revenue. Is it correct then I guess also to assume \u2013 in your past analyst days you've obviously shown how strong of a market and the opportunity on the returns there. That also would then by default have a higher contribution to the income I suspect. And then, if you could comment also is this \u2013 the travel restrictions are they having any sort of impact also on the ability to meet those growth targets? I know, you have 600 stores planned for that country. Is that something also that's sort of been halted during this time frame as well?\nPat Grismer: Yes. Matthew this is Pat. With respect to the first question China's operating income as a percentage of business unit operating income globally is slightly higher than the 10% that it represents of revenue and over to John for the second piece.\nJohn Culver: Yeah. Matthew on the store side of it, I think it's too early to tell. We're committed to the numbers that we previously communicated around store growth in China, and we'll continue to build beautiful stores and accelerate the growth of the brand. Suffice it to say new stores contribute 80% of our revenue growth in the market. And it's an important component and one that we'll continue to focus on with the team there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nDennis Geiger: Thank you. I just wanted to ask a bit more about the continued strength of U.S. traffic. Maybe Roz, could you talk a bit more about where that's coming from? How much of it is higher frequency from existing customers versus maybe some new customers and any other observations or insights that you can share? And then I think you've touched on the drivers, but if there's anything you can get into more on how much of it is experience versus digital versus the beverage innovation that you feel is driving that traffic piece if you can dive into that any more. Thank you.\nRoz Brewer: Sure. Thank you, Dennis. So a couple of things. So, you heard Kevin in Kevin's remarks that we achieved a 6% comp in this quarter. Five of those six points came from beverage growth. So beverage innovation is a large part of the work that we're doing. That also is impacted by the work we're doing in in-store innovation also and the efficiencies that we're building there and then the digital relationships. If I could go a little bit further into the efficiencies that we're seeing in the store, we are actually doing a large amount of work around creating and improving productivity in the stores. And in many cases, this is not productivity driving activity by taking hours out and really reducing our cost position in the stores, it's actually to allow our partners to spend more time with our customers. So we're seeing record scores at this time of customer connection scores in our stores. These are record numbers. We believe it's a multitude of things dealing with reducing the amount of task, the menial tasks that our store managers and our baristas have to do in our stores. In addition to the equipment improvements that we're seeing, we have Nitro Cold Brew across all of our stores right now. When we put in a Mastrena two machine we're seeing operational efficiencies. It's a lower-profile machine. It allows our partners to see over the bar and interact with the customers. We're actually seeing a significant amount of work coming out of the work we have learned through our digital relationships, so we know more about who's coming in the morning. Kevin's remarks also revealed that we are growing in every daypart. We're also seeing a significant growth pattern in our cold coffee. And so that includes all cold beverages meaning tea as well. And we're seeing cold beverages grow in the morning and the afternoon occasion. We're seeing also to the work \u2013 if you recall when we began to grow and change our program and loyalty around multi-tier redemption, we are seeing growth with the occasional customer. And there is some connection between cold coffee, afternoon occasion and the occasional customer. We are seeing growth after 11:00 in the afternoon with the occasional customer and with cold coffee. So we think that it's that combination that's really happening for us, Dennis in terms of the beverage innovation so right beverage for our customer base, improving the work that our partners have to do in our stores so that they can interact with the customers and improve customer engagement and then learning from our digital relationships and understanding how to market to our customer base and bring them in the store and a great example of that is our reimagined happy hour. And so we're doing -- we're combining these three initiatives together and we are convinced that this work and the discipline around it is really driving our comp performance and we can see this in future quarters ahead of us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSara Senatore: Hi. Thank you. I have a question and then a quick follow-up. Just on the margins you had said that that was a place where you would have probably raised guidance. I think in general Pat you said you wanted to be conservative on guidance. But could you just talk a little bit about whether the beat versus expectations was in fact just how you position the guidance, or were there some surprises in there? Supply chain obviously the comps were a bit better than you would have I think expected or the long-term algorithm would suggest. So if you could just talk about where the margin upside with maybe some specific initiatives or sources would be. And then just my follow-up is you had said that the wide-scale closures in China and the store closures to be the primary driver of the impact on the business. So does that suggest that for the stores that are remaining open you're not really seeing a change in trend in the China stores? I would have thought there'd be more of an impact on consumer confidence broadly.\nPat Grismer: Thank you, Sara. I'll take both questions and then pivot to John for additional color on China. First of all with respect to margin performance in the quarter, we were really delighted with our overall margin outcome in Q1. And what was better than expected was to your point higher-than-expected comp growth and with that strong sales leverage contributing positively to margin. We also had stronger-than-expected benefits from our supply chain. Part of that was a function of the fact that in the U.S. we had such strong sell-through for our food, beverages and merchandise in holiday that we did not incur the level of inventory reserves that we've seen in the past. So a number of initiatives came together to deliver really strong margin performance in Q1 and that was the overriding contributor to what we had planned by way of a margin guidance raise for the full year. With respect to China and the drivers of the business impact, I highlighted that the number of stores and duration of closure are the two primary drivers of the business impact. That's not to say that there aren't other drivers or other considerations here. And certainly the reduced retail footfall that we're seeing across the country in the wake of the efforts taken to contain the virus and how customers generally are a bit reticent to perhaps visit commercial centers versus previously is another factor. So it is a contributing factor but the big factor really is the duration of closure. And I'll really pivot to John for additional color on that.\nJohn Culver: Yes. So Sara obviously, we're tracking customers in transactions in our stores that we have opened. And we look at that each and every day. I would say that versus historical levels it definitely has slowed down from -- and Pat gave a little bit of color on that. We look at this each and every day. We've taken action in our open stores to adjust operating hours. We've also gone in and adjusted some of the product offerings based on supply chain availability. And then we've also taken a look at specific trade areas where we can consolidate the stores into one store that's meaningful and reaches customers. So a lot of different actions are being taken. But as Pat shared the majority of the impact will come from the closed stores. But this is something we assess every day. As you're aware Chinese New Year has been extended and we're continuing to watch this very closely with the team in China.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Just a follow-up on the U.S. and the beverage contribution of five points which is certainly much higher than it was a couple of years ago. If we look back that far it feels like the Frappuccino platform has stabilized and we've seen the benefit of some of the newer cold beverage platforms like Cold Brew and Nitro and perhaps with the help of Foam more recently. Could you talk about the biggest contributors to the improvement if we kind of look at this from a multi-year perspective? And if we're looking forward in a similar way could you talk about the biggest contributors to beverage growth going forward and how you feel about the pipeline of beverage news kind of keeping this energy going in the beverage side?\nRoz Brewer: Yes. David thanks for the question. So a few things, if you recall last year this time we were probably issuing a lot of LTOs limited time offers. Some of that was Frappuccino-based. We were not penetrated with enough Nitro equipment technology in the stores. And Nitro, we knew was a growing category. So what you're seeing right now is our execution of putting Nitro in every one of our buildings in the U.S. And so that's a big transition that we've made. In addition to that, playing into cold coffee and that process of creating and leaning into cold. And what you can see in the future from that is that we do have equipment improvements coming in our Cold Brew technology. Part of that is making sure that we are in stock at all times with this process and so we actually have equipment changes coming in the future for that. I also mentioned too that you've seen us add alternative milks to our beverage line, which gives us a chance to customize. We know that there is a portion of our customer base that wants more of a healthy-for-you concept. And so you have seen some of the work that we have done to add oat milk regionally across the country. And as that becomes more available in the industry, we will acquire more of that capacity. In addition to that, our whole -- our hot business is holding very nicely for us. Also from a holiday perspective, we introduced beverages that had high demand, if you think about the Irish Cream Cold Brew and then what we were able to do with the Pumpkin Spice category. What also gives us confidence as we go forward is the work that we're doing to make sure that we can deliver on what the customers are asking us for. So you'll see more coming in the alternative milk category for us and then playing into the cold category. Also in terms of what helps us sell beverages is our food attach. We will be introducing a breakfast sandwich this year with a plant-based patty both in U.S. and Canada and the combination of those pairing is significant for us in terms of how we think about what the customer is asking for us to develop. I'll also mention that we are seeing still growth in our morning daypart and with MOP. It's significant to also mention that in this quarter we opened our first convenience store, so we're seeing increased traffic when we create new formats. Our first introduction to this was -- is in Penn Plaza in New York. I had the chance to visit there in the last 10 days. Customer response is very favorable. It is showing just one more way that our brand is significant to our customer. Once you exit Penn Plaza station, you come right up to the store. Customers are responding that it feels like a walk-through. It has our latest technology in there from the digital boards that really announce when your drink is ready. It's those kinds of things combined with beverage innovation that give us the confidence that we're listening to our customers and providing them access to our stores, access to our brand, the way they want to acquire their coffee and also listening to them in terms of how we should grow our beverage innovation. So we are committed to this category of cold coffee and also making sure that we're staying close to what the customer would like to see in what's next in their beverage preference.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I just have one question on China and then maybe a follow-up. So it seems like you're pushing more aggressively into lower-tier cities where coffee consumption is a little bit lower than it might be in the higher-tier cities. So if you can maybe talk about how the returns equation works in those lower-tier cities and maybe how the product mix differs in those types of locations. And then as a follow-up to that with the delivery driving 9% sales mix this quarter, does that imply that the on-premise business is running negative if it's early days about this time last year in the delivery rollout? So can you maybe talk about why that might be the case? Is it competition potentially sales transfer, or is delivery itself cannibalizing your in-store business? Thanks.\nJohn Culver: Yes. Eric, this is John. Just to answer your question, in the quarter we opened 167 stores. 46% of those were either in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. We do see very strong performance in lower-tier cities and we continue to make investments in those cities playing the long game. Clearly, when we open our first few stores, there is a lot of demand for Starbucks coming into those cities. As we continue to build out the footprint, what we've seen historically is that the total transactions obviously continue to grow and volumes show up as very similar to some of our outer tier one cities. So we feel good about our growth in these Tier 4, Tier 5 cities overall. In terms of the delivery aspect of it at 9%, clearly we see a lot of benefit. It creates a whole new occasion for our existing customers and it's helping to drive transaction growth in our stores. We have over 3,500 stores in 130 cities, which is 80% of the store base having delivery available to them. We see it as an incremental for these existing customers as well as attracting new customers. In total, dollar profits continue to increase because of it. It's slightly margin-dilutive, but it does provide a higher ticket as well as a higher food attach. And we also see stronger demand in the mornings and during the lunch daypart.\nOperator: The next question comes from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKatherine Fogertey: Great. Thank you. I have a couple of questions here. So first of all on International stripping out the strength that you saw in China, it looks like the rest of International was pretty weak on the traffic side. So I was wondering if you could walk through dynamics you're seeing in select markets there. And then on the point that was made earlier about the supply chain and having some problem stocking stores in the region in China for the ones that are open, are you guys seeing difficulty transporting goods and services across the country at this point? And if that is the case, would there be any kind of ripple-through effect to maybe push out of new store opens and unit growth? Thank you.\nJohn Culver: Yes. Katherine just real quick on the International side. As Pat highlighted we had two points of impact given the Japan market and what we saw in Japan. And when you look at Japan overall we had two major factors that influenced the comp performance in Japan. First was, early on in the quarter we had a devastating typhoon that went through the country which impacted two full days of sales in the market. The second piece was the increase in consumption tax that took place in early October. The good news that we saw through the quarter is that comps accelerated through the quarter back to more normal levels. So we do feel good about the trends that we're currently seeing in Japan. When you look more broadly across the International segment and you look at in specifics EMEA and Asia Pacific, we saw strong growth in both of those regions through our licensed partnerships. U.K. in particular did very well. We had Middle East and EMEA that also performed well. And then when you go over to Asia Pacific, Korea had another strong quarter which was great to see. And then we have some smaller markets Philippines, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand doing well as well. Switching to your question on China on goods and services, we're monitoring each and every day the supply chain challenges. Clearly in Hubei province that area is impacted the most in terms of supply chain given the limited travel that's taking place in that city. We haven't seen that meaningful impact take hold in other cities. Although as I shared, we continue to adjust the menus in our stores and the offerings to accommodate any supply chain challenges we have.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nFred Wightman: It's actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. Just one quick follow-up. In your response to an earlier question as far as the changes to the full year outlook you had alluded to some additional visibility. I think it was on operating margins or earnings for the balance of the year. What exactly were you referring to there?\nPat Grismer: Yes. So this is Pat. We see further upside in our Channel Development business specifically. So we have a stronger outlook for full year revenue and flow-through associated with that in Channel Development. There were a couple of other line items where we were anticipating making some adjustments as well. But far and away the key driver of what we had planned by way of a guidance raise was the extraordinary strength of our Q1 results.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Charles: Thanks. Roz one of the more impressive drivers of U.S. same-store sales has been growth in loyalty program with the 1.4 million members added during 1Q the seasonally highest it's been on record since you guys have been disclosing this. And I was wondering with this growing base of users can you talk about changes in the tactics you're using to market more effectively to these customers to help increase the spend as well as the visitation?\nRoz Brewer: So yes Andrew just a few things there. One is we have a very effective media spend. And so if you go back a year or so ago, we were -- either had very small investments in our media spend or not very directed. And so now we are better at understanding almost a one-to-one relationship with that consumer. And so, if we have an e-mail address we can look at their past purchases and then suggest to them what they could enjoy in our stores and then also to alert them to Happy Hour and other events that are happening in the store. And we didn't have that in the past. And in addition to that is when we introduce new items. And so what we're seeing from a Cold Brew perspective is also just speaking to them about the new cold beverages. So it's having that one-to-one relationship and access to them and can personalize the offerings that we have to our customer base. In addition to that some of the other work that we're doing is to help our partners in the stores understand who's shopping in the stores. And so they know their customers just by the relationships that they've built over the years, but now they know a little bit more about who's shopping in their stores and who's visiting our caf\u00e9s. And so we share that information with our partners in the stores and it makes them very effective at the work that they do. And a lot of the insights that we're gathering we're using it to make our decisions, and also to what's fueling how we think about what innovation that we want to build and develop. And so we're using our insights effectively, learning from our new members that are growing and then watching the work that we need to do as we look at the multi-tier redemption program, which is still just approaching a year in terms of its full national rollout.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nGregory Francfort: Thank you very much for the question. Just looking back at the U.S. business on, I guess 18 to 24 months of a slowdown in store growth. With that perspective, have you seen maybe less cannibalization from new stores, or is that something that you guys have seen maybe flow back in the comps and that's part of the reason why they've picked up a few points? Any perspective on that? And then as we look forward, I think we're at the bottom of your 3% to 4% unit growth is this, kind of, how we should think about the longer term framework for what you envision store growth being in the U.S.? Thanks.\nRoz Brewer: So a few things there in terms of our store growth in the U.S. And so we're seeing pretty much the same amount of cannibalization in our business. There is no change there. For us the best investment we can make is our new store growth. We appreciate the return on invested capital that we're seeing with our new store investments so you'll see that continue. What we've been doing is really looking at our format and making sure that as we add delivery, add new stores, we're looking at coverage and how we cover our customer in the United States. One of the things I'll mention is the combination of delivery to our new store growth. We just added a total of 3,500 stores now across 49 markets in delivery. And so we have a broad amount of coverage in the U.S. combining with that. And we still have the estimated number of new stores coming in the U.S. and really advancing our format development anything from our new format in terms of the convenience stores, all the way to our Roastery plan. So we are still encouraged by our investments in new real estate and we're not seeing any shift in cannibalization in our business right now.\nPatrick Grismer: And Greg this is Pat. To build on what Roz has said, we would reaffirm our net store growth guidance for the U.S. of 3% to 4%.\nOperator: Your last question comes from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. You may ask your question.\nR.J. Hottovy: Thanks and thanks for let me get the question in here. Just one follow-up question for Roz. You, kind of, hinted on this at the last answer, but one area we haven't heard a lot about is that delivery program. And obviously you've been working with some new restaurant formats and developing that. But just wanted to see if you could provide us an update in terms of where that initiative stands and what takeaways you've had. Obviously you share some takeaways from China in terms of attach rates and new customer growth, but just any takeaways you've seen at the delivery program so far in the U.S.?\nRoz Brewer: Sure. So yes we are continuing to expand. Because we're now at 75% U.S. coverage of all Starbucks stores, we are now into a national marketing program, which if you remember this time last year we were roughly about 115 stores with no marketing against it. And so we are encouraged to continue to see what happens when we alert the customer that delivery is available at their favorite location. Our stores are equipped from a technology standpoint. The partners are well-trained in terms of how to handle the tradeoff between the transition of the beverage to the pickup delivery person. So operationally it's working extremely well. We'll continue to watch it. One thing I'll say about the U.S. business if you compare it to China in terms of delivery, the adoption rate is still pretty modest in the U.S. And so we're just moving right along with the customer and making it available to as much coffee coverage as we can in the U.S. but it's modestly being adopted in the U.S. if you compare it to China.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question today. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Johnson for closing remarks.\nKevin Johnson: Well, thank you all for joining us on today's call. I want to close by recognizing my Starbucks partners around the world for such a strong Q1 performance and the underlying business momentum that we are building as a company. I also want to recognize my Starbucks partners who are navigating the dynamic situation related to the coronavirus in China. As we deal with these extraordinary circumstances, we will remain focused on caring for the health and wellbeing of our partners, supporting health officials as they work to contain the coronavirus and doing all of this staying true to the mission and values that built this great company. To our investors, I appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through the temporary business impacts in China. We are as confident as ever in the strength and resilience of our double-digit earnings growth model for the long-term and we are committed to maintaining transparency as we gain a better understanding of the magnitude and duration of the near-term business impacts. I serve all stakeholders of this great company and I'm so optimistic about our future as we continue to build an enduring company. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's first quarter fiscal year 2020 conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Roz Brewer",
            "content": "Thanks John for the question. So, first of all, I wanted to ground everybody in what's happening in some of our equipment innovation. And one of the strongest pieces of innovation that we're seeing is combining our Mastrena II machine which is our espresso machine which we installed about 1,900 units last year. We've got 4,000 of those coming this year and those machines are AI-enabled. And so that is where we'll see the most significant deliverable around how we will integrate AI into understanding how to deliver the best coffee experience and also reducing the amount of time it takes to deliver and then giving us a chance to provide a variety of coffee to our customers. So, you'll see that come through. There's also other innovation happening around Deep Brew, it will show up in various aspects of the business, but the equipment position is our strongest position right now. In addition to that when we talk about the things that have happened in our loyalty program, we did see some significant improvement in this quarter. Right now we finished this quarter at about 18.9 million growth and that's a 16% improvement versus last year in our active Starbucks Rewards members. It's the strongest growth rate we've seen in three years. So, the work that we've done in our multi-tier redemption is also allowing us to grow our member base. We've got an increase of annual member growth of 2.7 million members and we're also seeing all-time records in that area as well. It's enabling us to do really creative work with how we reimagine our Happy Hour performance making sure that we are understanding what the customer needs. There's a lot of customer insights that comes out of the work that we do as we grow our member base. We're also seeing the loyalty programs in the new membership behavior that we're seeing which contributed two points of the 6% comp for the quarter. So, we are learning from what's happening as we align AI to our equipment and then the work that comes out of our loyalty programs in getting us closer to customers' expectations and it's making a difference. Sure. Thank you, Dennis. So a couple of things. So, you heard Kevin in Kevin's remarks that we achieved a 6% comp in this quarter. Five of those six points came from beverage growth. So beverage innovation is a large part of the work that we're doing. That also is impacted by the work we're doing in in-store innovation also and the efficiencies that we're building there and then the digital relationships. If I could go a little bit further into the efficiencies that we're seeing in the store, we are actually doing a large amount of work around creating and improving productivity in the stores. And in many cases, this is not productivity driving activity by taking hours out and really reducing our cost position in the stores, it's actually to allow our partners to spend more time with our customers. So we're seeing record scores at this time of customer connection scores in our stores. These are record numbers. We believe it's a multitude of things dealing with reducing the amount of task, the menial tasks that our store managers and our baristas have to do in our stores. In addition to the equipment improvements that we're seeing, we have Nitro Cold Brew across all of our stores right now. When we put in a Mastrena two machine we're seeing operational efficiencies. It's a lower-profile machine. It allows our partners to see over the bar and interact with the customers. We're actually seeing a significant amount of work coming out of the work we have learned through our digital relationships, so we know more about who's coming in the morning. Kevin's remarks also revealed that we are growing in every daypart. We're also seeing a significant growth pattern in our cold coffee. And so that includes all cold beverages meaning tea as well. And we're seeing cold beverages grow in the morning and the afternoon occasion. We're seeing also to the work \u2013 if you recall when we began to grow and change our program and loyalty around multi-tier redemption, we are seeing growth with the occasional customer. And there is some connection between cold coffee, afternoon occasion and the occasional customer. We are seeing growth after 11:00 in the afternoon with the occasional customer and with cold coffee. So we think that it's that combination that's really happening for us, Dennis in terms of the beverage innovation so right beverage for our customer base, improving the work that our partners have to do in our stores so that they can interact with the customers and improve customer engagement and then learning from our digital relationships and understanding how to market to our customer base and bring them in the store and a great example of that is our reimagined happy hour. And so we're doing -- we're combining these three initiatives together and we are convinced that this work and the discipline around it is really driving our comp performance and we can see this in future quarters ahead of us. Yes. David thanks for the question. So a few things, if you recall last year this time we were probably issuing a lot of LTOs limited time offers. Some of that was Frappuccino-based. We were not penetrated with enough Nitro equipment technology in the stores. And Nitro, we knew was a growing category. So what you're seeing right now is our execution of putting Nitro in every one of our buildings in the U.S. And so that's a big transition that we've made. In addition to that, playing into cold coffee and that process of creating and leaning into cold. And what you can see in the future from that is that we do have equipment improvements coming in our Cold Brew technology. Part of that is making sure that we are in stock at all times with this process and so we actually have equipment changes coming in the future for that. I also mentioned too that you've seen us add alternative milks to our beverage line, which gives us a chance to customize. We know that there is a portion of our customer base that wants more of a healthy-for-you concept. And so you have seen some of the work that we have done to add oat milk regionally across the country. And as that becomes more available in the industry, we will acquire more of that capacity. In addition to that, our whole -- our hot business is holding very nicely for us. Also from a holiday perspective, we introduced beverages that had high demand, if you think about the Irish Cream Cold Brew and then what we were able to do with the Pumpkin Spice category. What also gives us confidence as we go forward is the work that we're doing to make sure that we can deliver on what the customers are asking us for. So you'll see more coming in the alternative milk category for us and then playing into the cold category. Also in terms of what helps us sell beverages is our food attach. We will be introducing a breakfast sandwich this year with a plant-based patty both in U.S. and Canada and the combination of those pairing is significant for us in terms of how we think about what the customer is asking for us to develop. I'll also mention that we are seeing still growth in our morning daypart and with MOP. It's significant to also mention that in this quarter we opened our first convenience store, so we're seeing increased traffic when we create new formats. Our first introduction to this was -- is in Penn Plaza in New York. I had the chance to visit there in the last 10 days. Customer response is very favorable. It is showing just one more way that our brand is significant to our customer. Once you exit Penn Plaza station, you come right up to the store. Customers are responding that it feels like a walk-through. It has our latest technology in there from the digital boards that really announce when your drink is ready. It's those kinds of things combined with beverage innovation that give us the confidence that we're listening to our customers and providing them access to our stores, access to our brand, the way they want to acquire their coffee and also listening to them in terms of how we should grow our beverage innovation. So we are committed to this category of cold coffee and also making sure that we're staying close to what the customer would like to see in what's next in their beverage preference. So yes Andrew just a few things there. One is we have a very effective media spend. And so if you go back a year or so ago, we were -- either had very small investments in our media spend or not very directed. And so now we are better at understanding almost a one-to-one relationship with that consumer. And so, if we have an e-mail address we can look at their past purchases and then suggest to them what they could enjoy in our stores and then also to alert them to Happy Hour and other events that are happening in the store. And we didn't have that in the past. And in addition to that is when we introduce new items. And so what we're seeing from a Cold Brew perspective is also just speaking to them about the new cold beverages. So it's having that one-to-one relationship and access to them and can personalize the offerings that we have to our customer base. In addition to that some of the other work that we're doing is to help our partners in the stores understand who's shopping in the stores. And so they know their customers just by the relationships that they've built over the years, but now they know a little bit more about who's shopping in their stores and who's visiting our cafe\u0301s. And so we share that information with our partners in the stores and it makes them very effective at the work that they do. And a lot of the insights that we're gathering we're using it to make our decisions, and also to what's fueling how we think about what innovation that we want to build and develop. And so we're using our insights effectively, learning from our new members that are growing and then watching the work that we need to do as we look at the multi-tier redemption program, which is still just approaching a year in terms of its full national rollout. So a few things there in terms of our store growth in the U.S. And so we're seeing pretty much the same amount of cannibalization in our business. There is no change there. For us the best investment we can make is our new store growth. We appreciate the return on invested capital that we're seeing with our new store investments so you'll see that continue. What we've been doing is really looking at our format and making sure that as we add delivery, add new stores, we're looking at coverage and how we cover our customer in the United States. One of the things I'll mention is the combination of delivery to our new store growth. We just added a total of 3,500 stores now across 49 markets in delivery. And so we have a broad amount of coverage in the U.S. combining with that. And we still have the estimated number of new stores coming in the U.S. and really advancing our format development anything from our new format in terms of the convenience stores, all the way to our Roastery plan. So we are still encouraged by our investments in new real estate and we're not seeing any shift in cannibalization in our business right now. Sure. So yes we are continuing to expand. Because we're now at 75% U.S. coverage of all Starbucks stores, we are now into a national marketing program, which if you remember this time last year we were roughly about 115 stores with no marketing against it. And so we are encouraged to continue to see what happens when we alert the customer that delivery is available at their favorite location. Our stores are equipped from a technology standpoint.

            "name": "Kevin Johnson",
            "content": "Well, good afternoon and welcome. Q1 was an exceptional quarter for Starbucks. The positive business momentum we've created over the past fiscal year continues with a strong start to fiscal 2020. These results were fueled by a healthy balance of comparable sales growth and new store development, as well as continued expansion of our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle\u0301. I'm especially pleased that we delivered meaningful margin expansion in the quarter, even as we continued to invest in the key areas to support sustainable growth, first and foremost in our partners, as well as in beverage innovation and digital customer relationships. Given the strength of our Q1 results, we had intended to raise certain aspects of our full year financial outlook for fiscal 2020. However, due to the dynamic situation unfolding with the coronavirus, we are not revising guidance at this time. But as we get more clarity on the situation, we will transparently communicate with investors. Our immediate focus is on two key priorities in China: first, caring for the health and well-being of our partners and customers in our stores; second, playing a constructive role in supporting local health officials and government leaders as they work to contain the coronavirus. That said, we remain optimistic and committed to the long-term growth potential in China, a market we have been in for more than 20 years. Before I hand over to Pat, who will provide more detail on our Q1 financial performance, let me share some highlights for the quarter, which provide powerful evidence of the unique strength of our brand. I will also outline additional steps we are taking that continue to elevate Starbucks in ways that will inspire our partners and deepen our relationship with customers. In the first quarter, Starbucks delivered global revenue growth of 9%, excluding the 2% impact to streamline activities. This was led by strong comp sales growth of 5% and net new store growth of 6% over the last 12 months. At the forefront of these results were our two lead growth markets, the U.S. and China, along with Channel Development. The U.S. grew revenues by an impressive 9% in Q1, led by comp sales growth of 6%, including comp transaction growth of 3% for a third consecutive quarter. With a two-year sales comp of 10% for the past two consecutive quarters, it is clear that our focus on the customer experience, beverage innovation and digital customer relationship is working. At the center of this are our Starbucks partners and the investments we continue to make in them. It is no coincidence that following last September's leadership experience, where we hosted 12,000 Starbucks field leaders and outlined a series of partner-focused initiatives and investments, our partners delivered one of the most successful U.S. holiday seasons in the history of the company. Our partners in China also delivered a solid quarter, with revenues increasing by 15% in Q1, excluding a 2% impact of foreign exchange, fueled by a 16% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and a 3% increase in comp. And for the fourth consecutive quarter, we grew total transactions at a double-digit percentage pace in this strategically important market. On every market visit I make to China I experience firsthand the passion, innovation and commitment our partners demonstrate each and every day and I'm proud of them. Given the purposeful and highly differentiated partner investments, it is no surprise Starbucks was recently named China's best employer by Aon Hewitt for the fifth consecutive year. Finally, on the strength of our channel partnerships with Nestle\u0301 and Pepsi, our Channel Development revenue grew 5% in Q1 when normalized for the 7% impact of the Tazo and Global Coffee Alliance transitions, boosting our share of the coffee market outside of specialty retail. This is another example of the strength of the Starbucks brand that continues to expand globally, reaching more customers through more channels. Collectively these results demonstrate that we are on the right track with our Growth at Scale agenda. I am especially grateful to all Starbucks partners around the world who celebrate coffee and human connection and whose passion and commitment to the Starbucks mission and our company values are creating long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders.  As we approach the 50th anniversary of Starbucks in 2021, I am optimistic about the future. Why? Well when I step back and look at the quarter, I see multiple proof points of the unique strength of our brand, strength that is derived from targeted investments that bolster our competitive position in a high-growth category enabling us to unlock the full potential of one of the world's most admired and trusted brands. In the U.S., customer connection scores reached another all-time high in Q1 as our dedicated store partners continue to elevate the Starbucks experience and deliver the very best moments with our customers each and every day. We realize this is a key differentiator for Starbucks and we continue to make investments in partner hours, benefits and training. There's no doubt that our partners and the investments we make in them are at the core of creating the unique Starbucks Experience that fueled our Q1 performance. Additionally our brand equity research in the first quarter confirmed that Starbucks continues to lead consumer perceptions of specialty coffee retail concepts in the U.S., well ahead of other brands including so-called third wave independent and local coffee concepts. This is aided in part by our proprietary beverage innovation and our unique ability to personalize handcrafted beverages at scale. We strengthened this competitive advantage in Q1 by extending our Cold Brew platform and Cold Foam options with two new seasonal beverages: Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew and Irish Cream Cold Brew which together contributed to our traffic growth for the quarter. Notably for five consecutive quarters our comp growth has outperformed the external indexes and benchmarks we track in the restaurant and QSR space. Our brand strength was also evident on the digital front in Q1. In the U.S., we added a record 1.4 million customers to our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards member base ending the quarter with 18.9 million active members a 16% increase over prior year. This is important because we know from experience that when customers join our rewards program their total spend with Starbucks increases meaningfully. We also know that Starbucks is increasingly valued for convenience as the mix of Mobile Order & Pay transactions in the U.S. grew to 17% in Q1. And our industry-leading digital platform will further differentiate us from the competition over time. Our digital progress in China was equally compelling and is resonating with the digitally savvy Chinese consumer. Proprietary research in Q1 showed that Starbucks remains the country's most beloved coffee brand and customers' first choice for away-from-home coffee. In the first quarter sales from China's mobile orders jumped to 15% of total revenue up from 10% the past quarter with 9% coming from delivery and 6% from mobile order and pickup. Underpinning these results was the continued growth of China's 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members reaching 10.2 million customers in Q1. That's 40% growth over the prior year when the program was relaunched. Our first quarter digital strength in China was further evidenced by record sales on Alibaba's Singles' Day shopping festival, the number 1 card position on Tmall and the leading brand on WeChat social gifting platform. Over our 20 years in China, we have established unparalleled brand stature by delivering a unique, premium experience to our customers. Outside of specialty coffee retail the power of our brand was demonstrated by the continued expansion of our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle\u0301, now in more than 40 markets including the additional five new markets we entered in Q1 with product sales significantly ahead of expectations. Every customer interaction in our stores establishes customer affinity and brand loyalty with the Global Coffee Alliance then acting as a brand amplifier bringing Starbucks coffee to new channels and new markets. Our Starbucks Reserve Roasteries are also important brand amplifiers. In November we opened our Roastery in Chicago our sixth Roastery globally to a phenomenal customer reception. Since the opening, the store continues to gain international attention attracting an average of 10,000 visitors a day with a peak of more than 21,000 visitors in a single day. I want to thank our Starbucks partners who work in the Chicago Roastery as well as the City of Chicago for the warm welcome and spectacular response to the opening of the world's largest Starbucks. These proof points provide clear evidence that the Starbucks brand is not only strong, but is getting stronger through the focus and discipline of our Growth at Scale agenda. In fact just last week Starbucks was named one of Fortune's Most Admired Companies for the 18th consecutive year. In summary I could not be more pleased with our Q1 results and how they reinforce the unique strength of Starbucks. But make no mistake, we do not take this for granted. We will continue to take clear and decisive steps to build our brand for the future, focusing on our competitive advantages, investing in our partners as they create those unique Starbucks experiences for our customers driving beverage innovation and enhancing digital relationships. And while we do this we are further amplifying our brand through the Global Coffee Alliance and committing to an even higher level of social responsibility with bolder aspirations for environmental sustainability. As many of you have seen last week we disclosed an ambitious multi-decade aspiration for Starbucks to become a resource-positive company which means we as a company want to give more than we take from the planet. We thought long and hard about this aspiration and are being deliberate in our approach. Over the past year, we conducted a rigorous environmental sustainability study in partnership with third-party advocacy groups. We embraced science-based targets and utilized industry experts to audit every aspect related to Starbucks' impact on climate, water and waste. We have shared the sustainability baseline report and our aspirations transparently on our website knowing that this will not be easy. The journey will not be linear. It will require innovation, many industry partnerships, alignment with other like-minded companies, public policy support and engagement of Starbucks partners and customers. This will challenge us in new and different ways and will require transformational change and measured risk-taking. We start this journey understanding our footprint, building upon our decade of experience in sustainability and committing to lead on something that is important to all of humanity: taking care of our planet. And we invite others to join us. As announced last week, we will be transparent in reporting short- and long-term progress against our goals and we will start with preliminary targets for 2030. That will be the focus of our research and operational plans going forward. Then on Starbucks' 50th anniversary in 2021 we will formalize our 2030 environmental goals and our strategies based on what we have learned between now and then. As we embark on this journey, we will prioritize, sequence and balance our investments as we do across every aspect of our business. We remain committed to our ongoing double-digit EPS growth model. We have momentum. Our brand is strong and we will continue to responsibly grow our business by staying true to our mission and values: doing the right things to care for and inspire our partners, creating great Starbucks experiences for our customers and pursuing a bold aspiration for the planet. In closing, I would again like to thank my fellow Starbucks partners around the world. I have the privilege of sharing all your good work on these calls and it is an honor to serve you and all of our stakeholders. I would also like to reiterate our support for the ongoing work as we respond to the coronavirus in a thoughtful and responsible way to protect our partners and support health officials and the government as they work to contain this public health risk. Starbucks has made a donation to the Red Cross to help support these efforts. We are making decisions real time to ensure the health and well-being of our partners and I am proud of how Starbucks, China is navigating a very dynamic situation. Now I'll turn it over to Pat for a deeper dive into our Q1 financial results and an update on our FY 2020 outlook. Pat? Thanks John. We'll have John Culver, kind of, give you a little bit of color on the day-to-day in China and then Pat will follow up on the second part of your question related to the implications. John? John, you might want to comment on the new markets and... John I'll let -- I'll have Roz give you a little perspective on Deep Brew and how it's influencing our performance. John, why don't you take that one? Yeah. I mean, just add to John's comments and share a perspective, Jeffrey. I think look over \u2013 throughout history, we've had many, many, competitors enter the market. Look coffee is a large and growing addressable market. And we stay focused on the premium experience and the unique differentiators that we believe create Starbucks. And if you look throughout history there's a consistent pattern. In most all cases, our competitors shift to focusing more on the value play. And you see that time and time again. And I think we can continue to see that trend. So the lesson for us is continue to amplify those unique differentiators that make us Starbucks. And that's why as you think about the Growth at Scale, we really as John said amplify the customer experience, we create in the store. We amplify the quality of our coffee and the beverage innovation that we provide, the fact those beverages are handcrafted and personalized for each and every customer. And then, we extended that in-store experience to a digital customer relationship. And those mix of ingredients are what differentiates us. And we feel confident that we understand them, we don't compromise those and we stay focused on playing our game. It's worked in the past, it's working today and it will work in the future. Well, thank you all for joining us on today's call. I want to close by recognizing my Starbucks partners around the world for such a strong Q1 performance and the underlying business momentum that we are building as a company. I also want to recognize my Starbucks partners who are navigating the dynamic situation related to the coronavirus in China. As we deal with these extraordinary circumstances, we will remain focused on caring for the health and wellbeing of our partners, supporting health officials as they work to contain the coronavirus and doing all of this staying true to the mission and values that built this great company. To our investors, I appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through the temporary business impacts in China. We are as confident as ever in the strength and resilience of our double-digit earnings growth model for the long-term and we are committed to maintaining transparency as we gain a better understanding of the magnitude and duration of the near-term business impacts. I serve all stakeholders of this great company and I'm so optimistic about our future as we continue to build an enduring company. Thank you."

            "name": "Pat Grismer",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report non-GAAP EPS of $0.79 for our first quarter of fiscal 2020, exceeding our expectations and reflecting meaningful margin expansion in each of our operating segments. This represents a 16% increase year-over-year when excluding an $0.08 headwind related to a lower income tax rate in fiscal 2019. These results underscore the strength of our brand globally and the outstanding underlying momentum across our business as we continue to execute our \u201cGrowth at Scale\u201d agenda. I will first take you through our Q1 fiscal 2020 operating performance by segment followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. I will then share some perspective on our outlook for the full fiscal year. Our Americas segment delivered revenue growth of 9% in Q1, primarily driven by 6% comp sales growth and net new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months. Our U.S. business delivered an impressive 6% comp sales growth in Q1, driven equally by transactions and ticket. These results were driven by an improved partner-led in-store experience, a strong beverage lineup and increased digital customer engagement. Beverage led on comp growth for a sixth consecutive quarter driving approximately five points of comp sales growth with strength across all beverage categories with food contributing the remaining point. Our cold platform continues to resonate with customers during all seasons and was our primary growth engine for the quarter led by cold coffee. Importantly, the growth in cold beverages in Q1 occurred in all dayparts and all regions reflecting broad appeal across our customer base. Following the success of our fall seasonal offerings at the start of the quarter and building on the success of last year's season, our holiday platforms delivered strong performance that exceeded our expectations. Returning favorites such as Peppermint Mocha and the new innovations like Irish Cream Cold Brew created momentum throughout the holiday period. And as Kevin mentioned, our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program continued to gain momentum building on the launch of multi-tier redemption last April. Our reimagined Happy Hour resonated well with customers driving additional member growth. And Gift Card activations delivered their strongest year-over-year dollar growth in four years. Ticket growth of 3% for the quarter was led by pricing, beverage attach and food. We saw transaction growth in both the morning and afternoon dayparts for a third consecutive quarter and our highest quarterly peak transaction growth in three years. These improvements would not have been possible without the dedication of our Green Apron partners, who continue to accommodate higher volumes while elevating the customer experience. And finally, Americas non-GAAP operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 22.0% in Q1, driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by growth in wages and benefits and to a lesser degree investments in labor hours and inflation and occupancy costs. Moving on to International. The segment delivered revenue growth of 10% in Q1 excluding a 6% unfavorable impact of streamline-related activities. This was led by 11% net new store growth over the past 12 months. International's comp sales growth of 1% in Q1 was adversely impacted by two points due to a soft quarter in Japan, which was lapping 6% comp sales growth from last year. China our lead international growth market delivered solid comp sales growth of 3% in Q1 including 1% comp transaction growth. Continued expansion and strong performance of mobile ordering as well as the up-leveled Starbucks Rewards program were primary drivers of these results. At the end of the first quarter, mobile order and pickup have been rolled out to more than 100 cities, encompassing more than 90% of our store base just seven months following the launch of the program. And we expanded delivery to 130 cities, covering more than 80% of our portfolio. International's non-GAAP operating margin increased by 170 basis points to 21.4%. When excluding the 70 basis point impact of streamline related activities, non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 100 basis points driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by unfavorability in product mix and strategic investments notably in-store and digital initiatives. On to Channel Development. Revenue declined 2% in Q1 as we lapped two items that benefited fiscal 2019; the sale of Tazo branded products to Unilever and transition activities related to the Global Coffee Alliance. When excluding the 7% adverse impact of these items, as well as Global Coffee Alliance transition activities in fiscal 2020, revenue increased by 5% in Q1 led by strong underlying growth in the Global Coffee Alliance. This segment's non-GAAP operating margin improved by 70 basis points over the prior year. Normalizing for the 20 basis point impact of the transition activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 90 basis points in Q1 driven by favorable distribution efficiencies and business mix. Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin of 18.2% in Q1 increased by 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies. The favorability from these items was partially offset by growth in wages and benefits and to a lesser degree by rent inflation and investments in store labor hours. I am particularly pleased that we delivered meaningful margin expansion while also continuing to invest in our partners, our stores and our digital capabilities to keep the Starbucks brand strong and relevant. To a great extent, this reflects our ability to drive improvements in margin from sales leverage as well as supply chain and G&A efficiencies and to reinvest a meaningful portion of that upside in our key brand differentiators, which strengthen our competitive position and fuel long-term sustainable growth. Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2020. Given the strength of our first quarter results, we had intended to raise certain aspects of our guidance for the full fiscal year. However, as Kevin mentioned given the extraordinary circumstances that are rapidly developing in China, we are simply reaffirming our original guidance and we'll provide an update when we have better visibility to the impact of coronavirus. The magnitude of the impact will depend on the duration of store closures as we work with local authorities to manage the situation and protect our partners and customers. At present, we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact to the business. Notwithstanding, the fact that our China business represented only 10% of our global revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect these events to have a material impact on our international segment and consolidated results for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2020. In any event based on what we currently know, we expect the impact to our business will be temporary. Our brand is very strong in China and our confidence in the profitability and growth potential of this business is undiminished. To summarize, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and view these results as further validation of our strategy to grow Starbucks at scale with greater focus and discipline. We appreciate the hard work of our Starbucks partners who delivered these results in a manner that remains true to our company's mission and values, which is the core of our business. And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by Roz Brewer and John Culver as Durga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator? And John, this is Pat. Just to build on what John has said. It really is difficult to say at this juncture what the impact to our business will be and how it will show up in our financials given the fluidity of the situation. The business impact is largely a function of two things: the number of stores closed and the duration of closure. And with respect to the duration of closure, it's not entirely in our control. I would say to a lesser extent the financial impact is a function of how we manage wage costs during the period of closure. So we're simply not able to provide a reasonable estimate at this point in time. We will need to move beyond the extended Chinese New Year holiday season to assess how the situation may be stabilizing and what the implications are for store closures. We're probably looking at early March at the earliest to reasonably assess the implications for revenue, operating income, and EPS for our second quarter and for the full year. At the very latest, we'll provide an update in conjunction with our Q2 earnings release on April 28. Our commitment is to maintaining transparency with investors. And as and when we have a reasonable basis for estimating the financial impacts for the quarter and year, we will communicate that information. But importantly, we do expect the impacts to be temporary. Our long-term double-digit growth model is fully intact. And of course, we will gain the benefit of lapping these temporary impacts next year. Yeah. I'm not going to provide details as to the magnitude of the guidance raise that we had planned or the specific line items, but I'm happy to share that we would have raised guidance for operating margin and for EPS on the strength of our Q1 results and visibility to some balance of year benefits. But given the uncertainty of the coronavirus situation in China and its impact to our near term results which we expect to be temporary, we felt it was best to defer any change to our guidance until we had better visibility to full year results including the impact of coronavirus. And as I said before, we're committed to being responsibly transparent with our investors and we'll provide an update when we have reasonable confidence behind our numbers, because it would not be helpful to speculate at this time. But we could not be more pleased with our Q1 results across the board, the overall underlying momentum in our business and the confidence that that gives us behind our ability to deliver better than expected results setting aside this new issue that has emerged in China. Sharon, this is Pat. I'm happy to take both questions. First of all with respect to the G&A, we are very pleased with the progress that we are making across the company in delivering our G&A efficiency commitment. As a reminder, we had committed to reduce by 100 basis points G&A as a percentage of system sales. That is not something that we routinely report, because we don't report system sales. But a good proxy for that is non-GAAP G&A as a percentage of revenue and we do report that. We've added that to our supplementary schedules in our earnings release. And we have seen meaningful efficiencies emerge in the first quarter, and we expect that to continue balance of year. That's on the back of very significant work over the last 12 to 18 months to realize productivity in our G&A, not just in the Americas but really across all of our segments and certainly at corporate. And then with respect to the Global Coffee Alliance, we did see better than expected results in the first quarter. We did anticipate a decline for the first quarter and for the full year, but our better than expected results in the first quarter resulted from outperformance, specifically in the Global Coffee Alliance. So we could not be more pleased with how our products are performing as we continue to partner with Nestle\u0301 and we anticipate -- that was going to be one of the aspects of our improved guidance for the year is better than expected revenue growth from our Channel Development segment. Yes. Matthew this is Pat. With respect to the first question China's operating income as a percentage of business unit operating income globally is slightly higher than the 10% that it represents of revenue and over to John for the second piece. Thank you, Sara. I'll take both questions and then pivot to John for additional color on China. First of all with respect to margin performance in the quarter, we were really delighted with our overall margin outcome in Q1. And what was better than expected was to your point higher-than-expected comp growth and with that strong sales leverage contributing positively to margin. We also had stronger-than-expected benefits from our supply chain. Part of that was a function of the fact that in the U.S. we had such strong sell-through for our food, beverages and merchandise in holiday that we did not incur the level of inventory reserves that we've seen in the past. So a number of initiatives came together to deliver really strong margin performance in Q1 and that was the overriding contributor to what we had planned by way of a margin guidance raise for the full year. With respect to China and the drivers of the business impact, I highlighted that the number of stores and duration of closure are the two primary drivers of the business impact. That's not to say that there aren't other drivers or other considerations here. And certainly the reduced retail footfall that we're seeing across the country in the wake of the efforts taken to contain the virus and how customers generally are a bit reticent to perhaps visit commercial centers versus previously is another factor. So it is a contributing factor but the big factor really is the duration of closure. And I'll really pivot to John for additional color on that. Yes. So this is Pat. We see further upside in our Channel Development business specifically. So we have a stronger outlook for full year revenue and flow-through associated with that in Channel Development. There were a couple of other line items where we were anticipating making some adjustments as well. But far and away the key driver of what we had planned by way of a guidance raise was the extraordinary strength of our Q1 results."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "John Culver",
            "content": "Yeah, John obviously Kevin reiterated the fact that we're focused on making sure we're taking care of our partners, their health and wellbeing as well as the customers. In terms of the closures what we've seen is that over the last few weeks, I would say that as the situation has accelerated, we've taken action to close stores both working with the local government and the direction that they've given us but then also proactively closing stores in the country. As we shared we currently have over half our stores closed in the market. We are assessing this each and every day. We do have delivery available to customers from stores that are remaining open. But again this is something that we continue to assess every day. And let me just reiterate this is a very complex situation. And I'm working very closely with Belinda and the team in China to navigate this changing environment. And as a company, we've navigated complex situations before. And in China, we feel there's no other company that's better positioned to navigate this, given our relationship that we -- and trust we've been able to build with our partners and the relationship and trust that they've been able to build with their customers. We will remain transparent as the events continue to unfold, but we do have complete confidence in the decisions that we're making and we will continue to provide complete support for our partners and for the people of China as they navigate this situation. We've been in the market for 20 years, and we have built an admired and trusted brand and we will continue to play the long game in China as we navigate in the coming weeks and months. Yeah. And so Sharon, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of the Channel Development business, in particular the Global Coffee Alliance. Through the quarter, we saw acceleration into 40 markets around the world where we have our products available through grocery as well as foodservice. We also are on path by the end of this quarter that we're in to be in over 50 markets. Our product sales continue to be significantly ahead of expectations both in terms of packaged coffee, Nespresso capsules, as well as Dolce Gusto. When you look at our core business here in the U.S., Starbucks brand outgrew the total category for coffee. Roast and ground share grew 80 basis points, K-Cup share grew 40 basis points, and we've got some exciting new items that are coming up. Later this spring, we previously announced that we're launching premium soluble coffee which will -- we're excited about and the big opportunity internationally with that. And then the launch that we had with our Creamers of four flavors, we're now expanding to an additional two new flavors given the recent success. So, the Global Coffee Alliance itself is performing very well around the world and it's helping us continue to grow the Starbucks brand and amplify the brand as Kevin highlighted in his comments earlier. Well, Jeffrey I think there's a couple of things around what we're doing in China. First and foremost, focusing on the premium quality of the coffee and our ability to handcraft the beverages for customers to the way they want it we feel that there is no other competitor in China that is able to do it and replicate it at the level that we are as signified by the more than seven million customers we serve a week across the 4,300 stores. In addition you then have the opportunity of developing these relationships between our partners and our customers. And our partners are truly the differentiating factor in terms of bringing the Starbucks Experience to life for our customers. And when you go to China and you experience our people and their passion for coffee and their passion for service to customers that is a true differentiator that we have in the market. You then put all that together in the third place. And the beauty of our stores, the inviting environment, the way in which we show up in the third place, we have an environment that customers come to and want to be with their family and friends. Now, what we've done is we've also enhanced that with the digital experience. And we had a great quarter as it relates to digital. We now have 90-day actives grew 40% year-over-year to 10.2 million, that's nearly double from where it was a year ago. We've also gone through and built out Mobile Order & Pay capabilities as well as delivery. So, mobile orders in total reached more than 15% of sales mix in the quarter compared to 10% in Q4, so 9% being deliveries, 6% being Mobile Order & Pay, and we're continuing to build out these digital relationships with customers. Then you couple all that with the Global Coffee Alliance in our RTD business in China. There is no other company brand in China that has the distribution points that we have. We have over 100,000 points of distribution of the Starbucks brand in China and our partners are bringing it to life every day. And it's their passion and their commitment that is making us successful and will continue to make us successful. Yeah. Matthew on the store side of it, I think it's too early to tell. We're committed to the numbers that we previously communicated around store growth in China, and we'll continue to build beautiful stores and accelerate the growth of the brand. Suffice it to say new stores contribute 80% of our revenue growth in the market. And it's an important component and one that we'll continue to focus on with the team there. Yes. So Sara obviously, we're tracking customers in transactions in our stores that we have opened. And we look at that each and every day. I would say that versus historical levels it definitely has slowed down from -- and Pat gave a little bit of color on that. We look at this each and every day. We've taken action in our open stores to adjust operating hours. We've also gone in and adjusted some of the product offerings based on supply chain availability. And then we've also taken a look at specific trade areas where we can consolidate the stores into one store that's meaningful and reaches customers. So a lot of different actions are being taken. But as Pat shared the majority of the impact will come from the closed stores. But this is something we assess every day. As you're aware Chinese New Year has been extended and we're continuing to watch this very closely with the team in China. Yes. Eric, this is John. Just to answer your question, in the quarter we opened 167 stores. 46% of those were either in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. We do see very strong performance in lower-tier cities and we continue to make investments in those cities playing the long game. Clearly, when we open our first few stores, there is a lot of demand for Starbucks coming into those cities. As we continue to build out the footprint, what we've seen historically is that the total transactions obviously continue to grow and volumes show up as very similar to some of our outer tier one cities. So we feel good about our growth in these Tier 4, Tier 5 cities overall. In terms of the delivery aspect of it at 9%, clearly we see a lot of benefit. It creates a whole new occasion for our existing customers and it's helping to drive transaction growth in our stores. We have over 3,500 stores in 130 cities, which is 80% of the store base having delivery available to them. We see it as an incremental for these existing customers as well as attracting new customers. In total, dollar profits continue to increase because of it. It's slightly margin-dilutive, but it does provide a higher ticket as well as a higher food attach. And we also see stronger demand in the mornings and during the lunch daypart. Yes. Katherine just real quick on the International side. As Pat highlighted we had two points of impact given the Japan market and what we saw in Japan. And when you look at Japan overall we had two major factors that influenced the comp performance in Japan. First was, early on in the quarter we had a devastating typhoon that went through the country which impacted two full days of sales in the market. The second piece was the increase in consumption tax that took place in early October. The good news that we saw through the quarter is that comps accelerated through the quarter back to more normal levels. So we do feel good about the trends that we're currently seeing in Japan. When you look more broadly across the International segment and you look at in specifics EMEA and Asia Pacific, we saw strong growth in both of those regions through our licensed partnerships. U.K. in particular did very well. We had Middle East and EMEA that also performed well. And then when you go over to Asia Pacific, Korea had another strong quarter which was great to see. And then we have some smaller markets Philippines, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand doing well as well. Switching to your question on China on goods and services, we're monitoring each and every day the supply chain challenges. Clearly in Hubei province that area is impacted the most in terms of supply chain given the limited travel that's taking place in that city. We haven't seen that meaningful impact take hold in other cities. Although as I shared, we continue to adjust the menus in our stores and the offerings to accommodate any supply chain challenges we have."

I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year-end 2021 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Greg Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Smith, you may now begin your conference.\nGreg Smith: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Starbucks Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2021 results. Today's discussion will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; and Rachel Ruggeri, CFO. And for Q&A, we will be joined by John Colbert, Group President North America, and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Conway, Group President International and Channel Development, and Leo Tsoi, Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks China. This conference call will include Forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.  Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Starbucks assumes no obligation to the -- update these forward-looking statements or information. GAAP results in fiscal 2021 include several items related to strategic actions including restructuring and impairment charges, transaction and integration costs, and other items.  These items are excluded from our non-GAAP results. For non-GAAP financial measures mentioned in today's call, please refer to the earnings release in our website at investor. starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures. This conference call is being webcast, and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website through Friday November 26th, 2021.  For your calendar planning purposes, please note that our first quarter in fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call has been tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, February 1, 2022. Before we begin there are four reminders I'd like to make with respect to the numbers that will be discussed on today's call.  First, as noted in our earnings release, we have realigned our fully licensed Latin America and Caribbean markets to our international segment. As a result, we renamed the Americas segment to North America. All discussions and comparisons today are reflective of the resegmentation.  Second, a reminder that Starbucks fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year instead of the usual 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2021 results on today's call are on a 14-week basis for the quarter, and 53-week basis for the year, except the year-on-year comparative metrics, including revenue growth, comp growth, EPS growth, and margin expansion, which are based on a 13-week or 52-week basis to exclude the impact of an extra fiscal week. Third, all references on today's call are on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted.  And lastly, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, certain international integration-related expenses previously excluded from our non-GAAP results will be included, as they are expected to be representative of ongoing operations. Please refer to the reconciliation of these measures, and a schedule showing adjusted fiscal 2021 EPS to bridge year-on-year impact of this recast, as well as reconciliations of 53-week to 52-week metrics at the supplemental financial data section of our website at investor.starbucks.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.\nKevin Johnson: Well, thank you Greg, and welcome everyone to today's call. I'm very pleased to comment on the record Q4 and FY2021 results Starbucks reported today. I'm particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results in Starbucks\u2019 50th anniversary year, and in the face of increased costs and unprecedented operating challenges resulting from the global pandemic.  Today's results reflect very strong operating and financial performance across-the-board. With Q4 revenue growing 22%, and full-year non-GAAP EPS of 168% over prior year. This was a record Q4 that punctuates a very strong FY\u201921 performance with record highs in revenue, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP EPS.  Our performance accelerated throughout FY2021, fueling revenue growth of 21%, non-GAAP operating income grew 139%, and translated to a non-GAAP earnings of $3.24 per share, near the high end of our guidance for the year. Perhaps more persuasively than ever, the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and the power and opportunity afforded by the authentic connection and the deep trust and loyalty we have built with customers around the world is resonating.  Today's results demonstrate that despite the pandemic, Starbucks\u2019 long-term double-digit growth-at-scale model remains solidly intact. Today's results also underscore the passion and dedication of our over 400,000 Starbucks Green Apron partners, who serve nearly 100 million customer occasions around the world every week. And I'm humbled by our partners commitment to each other and to our customers as we continue to navigate through the pandemic.  Their resilience and service honors the Company and our history. And I could not be more appreciative of their efforts. Finally, today's results demonstrate the success of the investments we have made and will continue to make ahead of the growth curve in our people, digital, beverage and food innovation, and store experiences. These investments are driving and strengthening our global business and setting us up for even greater success in the future. Starbucks\u2019 long-standing view is that our partners guided this Company, and we applaud other like-minded companies who are following our lead.  Starbucks has been at the forefront of investing in our people since we opened our first store in the Pike Place Market in Seattle in 1971. We offered paid company healthcare 25 years before the Affordable Care Act, equity ownership in the form of Bean Stock to eligible part-time partners, free college tuition through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University, and mental health support through our partnership with Lyra. Investing in our people is the cornerstone of our storied 50-year history and tradition.  And these investments continued to deliver real, measurable value to our partners, our customers, and our shareholders. I'll be providing granularity around the incremental partner investments we made beginning last year, and the additional partner investments we will be making in fiscal '22 in a moment. On today's call. I will highlight Q4 performance in our key markets and provide detail around some of our actions and investments since the pandemic first surfaced in Q2 of 2020, that are contributing to our performance today and setting us up for accelerated growth in the future. I'll also open a window on our exciting holiday plans and several initiatives that will launch over the near term. Then, we will turn the call over to Rachel to provide a deep dive into our Q4 and fiscal year performance, and share our guidance for fiscal '22. We'll then move on to Q&A. Over the last 18 months, Starbucks, like most global retail operators, has been confronted with a seemingly never-ending wave of consumer and business headwinds. Many businesses in our space have not survived.  From day one of the pandemic, Starbucks leaders around the world were determined to use the Company's size and scale to navigate whatever challenges lie ahead with steadfast commitment to our people, our mission and values, a set of principles guided us through the pandemic. Every decision was rooted in our core purpose and reason for being. These decisions have made the Starbucks of today stronger and better positioned to profitably grow, extend our coffee leadership around the world, and create more value for our shareholders more than ever before in our history.  Last year, we made significant pandemic-driven strategic investments, including providing our partners with financial support and economic certainty, avoiding layoffs while most of our stores were temporary closed, and accelerating our U.S. store portfolio transformation by opportunistically repositioning 500 stores to better locations with more favorable economics.  To this last point, we expanded our portfolio of drive-thru 's, introduced new store formats to meet our customers where they are, and turbo-charged growth in our digital customer relationships in the U.S. and China. As a result of these successful investments, we are entering fiscal '22 with strong momentum around the world, and in the U.S., our largest global market, our key growth driver, this comparable sale.  We grew a strong two-year comp, to 11% in Q4 despite variance across the country that created a dynamic set of city-by-city COVID restrictions, which we had to navigate. We made significant progress addressing supply chain issues and experienced an overall improvement in inventory availability as we move through the quarter by increasing production at existing suppliers, on-boarding new suppliers, and strategically prioritizing key holiday and Q1 merchandise.  While we made significant progress addressing supply chain challenges as fiscal 2021 progressed, we remain cautious and vigilant as we enter fiscal '22 given the dynamic nature of the situation. The recovery in Q4 surged forward as evidenced by the sequential acceleration of 2-year comp growth. We exited Q4 with even stronger 14% 2-year comp growth in September and closed to a record average [Indiscernible] driven by the strength of our fall beverage lineup, a shift in customer behavior toward more premium beverages, and strong food attach. We have great confidence for the year ahead given the current momentum throughout the quarter, combined with holiday plans certain to excite and delight our customers, and increasing consumer demand around the world today for everything Starbucks.  Yesterday we made an important announcement to raise wages across the U.S. in fiscal '22, to ensure we continue to attract and retain talented partners, as consumer mobility continues to increase. We believe this investment, combined with our industry-leading benefits program, will enable us to remain an employer of choice. This builds on the historic partner investments and meaningful wage increases we made in fiscal year 21, and prioritizes significant additional investment to address inflation and wage compression that our 10-year partners have experienced, while also increasing our wage floor.  In December of 2020, I announced our intention to provide a starting wage of at least $15 an hour for our store partners across the country. And by the summer of '22, we will have delivered on that plan. Effective in January, partners with 2 or more years of service will get up to a 5% raise, and partners with 5 or more years will get up to a 10% raise, in keeping with our longstanding history of investing in our partners.  And next summer, hourly partners in the U.S. will make an average of nearly $17 an hour with barista rates ranging from 50 to $23 an hour across the country. In total, the FY21 and FY22 investments represent approximately $1 billion in incremental annual wages and benefits. We continue to build a great and enduring Company by investing ahead of the growth curve, not just in wages, but in training and technology and the overall Starbucks experience for both our partners and our customers.  And as we have seen in the past, we expect investment in the partner experience will be accretive to profits over time. We believe the U.S. market is at a unique inflection point. Stakeholder and companies whose leaders correctly identify emerging trends, thoughtfully shapes strategic action, and invest in the future will be big winners over the long term. In the quarters ahead, Starbucks will continue to target investment in high returning assets that we believe will accelerate our double-digit growth at scale model, driving long-term, sustainable, and profitable growth.  We continue to build and leverage our technology first, mobile and digital capabilities and accelerate growth in active Starbucks Rewards membership. We grew our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members, representing our most loyal, engaged customers by approximately 30% in fiscal year 21 to 24.8 million members. Noteworthy is that in Q4, 51% of U.S. tender for Company-operated stores was generated by this loyal customer base.  We continue to nurture and deepen our direct, personalized, digital relationship with our members, with enhancements to the program, like Stars for Everyone to expand reach, and through payment partnerships with PayPal and [Indiscernible] where a customer can now reload their Starbucks card with a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, by converting digital currencies to physical currency and reloading their Starbucks card.  Through Blockchain or other innovative technologies, we're exploring how to tokenize Starz, create the ability for other merchants to connect their rewards program to Starbucks Rewards. This will enable customers to exchange value across brands, engage in more personalized experiences, enhance digital services, and exchange other loyalty points for Starz at Starbucks. An example of this innovation is evident in the recent launch of our Canadian Loyalty Program with Air Canada.  Over the next year, you will see the first instance of this loyalty points exchange with other consumer brands. This approach will also serve as a foundation for a more aspirational concept for new, modern payment rails that align payment expenses with the value received by customers and merchants. We intend to be at the forefront of this disruptive innovation, which will unfold over the next few years.  Finally, a rich pipeline of innovation will elevate the Starbucks experience in our stores, and drive in-store productivity gains. Examples include our Mastrena 2 espresso machines that more efficiently pulls triple shots of high-quality espresso. Our Deep Brew artificial intelligence platform that has automated daily inventory management, and store staffing and training improvements designed to reduce complexity in our stores. Simplifying this workflow helps reduce the strain on our partners, resulting from the ever-increased demand in our stores.  It enables our partners to connect and engage with their customers, which is at the heart of the Starbucks experience. Starbucks is entering fiscal year '22 with strong customer demand and solid momentum in our U.S. business, and expanding and accelerating in-store channels and digital flywheel and green apron partners, eager to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to their customers. Having navigated through so many challenges over the past year, we are excited and optimistic about the year that has just begun, while remaining humble and mindful of unknown challenges. On to China.  Starbucks China extended our market leadership position in Q4 despite pandemic-driven disruptions, propelled by an accelerated pace of store development and significant growth in digital customer relationships, all while achieving record customer engagement scores in the quarter and in the year. Starbucks has built one of the most respected consumer brands in China, with one in two consumers preferring Starbucks to any other brands in a way from home coffee.  Our growth strategy in the market continues to differentiate us and position us well for the long game. We continue to invest meaningfully in all aspects of our China business, including accelerated investment in our partners, the creation of award-winning experiential store designs, unprecedented benefits like healthcare for partners and the parents, rents assistance and programs that offer career paths for young people from rural and remote provinces.  Together, these investments further elevate the Starbucks brand and partner experience. They instill pride in our China partners and deepen our customer engagement and connection. Starbucks continues to be in a strong market expansion cycle. And as such, much of our growth in China comes as we aggressively expand our store footprint, and introduce more customers to the Starbucks experience. We expanded the store footprint with 225 net new stores in Q4, and we are going deeper and broader.  Deeper into existing cities, and broader by opening in new cities. For the full fiscal year, we opened a record 654 net new stores, and ended the year with 5,360 stores in 208 cities throughout China. As we noted on our Q3 earnings call, our recovery in China will not be linear. In Q4, we experienced COVID -related restrictions that constrained customer mobility in 18 provincial level regions.  At its peak in mid-August, approximately 80% of our stores in China were impacted by the pandemic, with some stores fully closed or operating at different levels of elevated public health protocols, such as mobile ordering only, limited seating, or health stations. Our recovery momentum was below expectation and pushed our 2-year comps to a minus 10% in Q4. Cities with local COVID cases were impacted the most, with storage relying on transportation and tourism also materially impacted during the quarter.  Notably though, much like the U.S., China 2-year comp also accelerated in the month of September as we remain optimistic for the recovery. Despite these strong headwinds, China grew revenue 11% year-on-year. While our overall reported comp growth was minus 7% for Q4, if we exclude the lap of that subsidy we received in fiscal year '20, along with the stores in cities that experienced local COVID cases or were in transportation and tourism zones, our core fleet of stores, comp positive. positive.  Starbucks business and operating margins remain strong. Our commitment to China, and our confidence in our long-term growth strategy in China is unwavering. In addition to expanding our portfolio of stores in China, we also expanded our digital footprint of 90-days Starbucks Rewards active members, reaching an all-time high of 17.9 million in Q4. This represents a sequential increase of 5% over Q3, and an increase of 33% over prior year.  Frequency of purchases by our gold members remained at pre -pandemic levels, despite the mobility limitations in the quarter, demonstrating the effectiveness of our efforts in up-leveling member engagement. One example was our Star Dash, gift with purchase campaign that successfully lifted member frequency and spend, and evolved into a highly anticipated activity for members to earn limited availability to Starbucks 50th anniversary merchandise.  With operations heavily impacted by COVID related safety restrictions in the quarter, we are laser-focused on what we can control in China, while continuing to elevate our partner and customer experiences to further elevate the Starbucks brand, and build on the loyalty that will continue to drive our long-term growth. Including the U.S. and China, Starbucks presence in 84 markets around the world provides us with a unique perspective on the global recovery from this pandemic.  There is no doubt that we are seeing continued recovery in our markets. Latin America grew system sales by 113% in Q4, driven by a strong recovery in Mexico. EMEA posted system sales growth of 52% in the quarter. And Japan navigated through a challenging quarter, turning the corner towards renewed growth. We see positive signs in many other markets, as well as reinforcing our belief that pandemic-related headwinds are temporary.  In addition, our strategic channel partnerships with the North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo, and our global coffee alliance with Nestle, are on plan and have propelled Starbucks to number 1 share positions in the U.S. and throughout many other markets around the world, further underscoring the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and illuminating the decade-long runway of growth ahead.  As we enter fiscal year '22, we are fully prepared for a record-breaking holiday with strong growth plans around the world and a holiday campaign designed to build genuine human connection, as only Starbucks can, at a time when human connection is more important than ever. ever. In addition to new and iconic seasonal products, we are integrating brand-building and transaction-driving marketing programs to demonstrate our values and touch our customers' hearts.  We're prepared with inventory this holiday, and we're also anticipating that nearly $3 billion will be loaded on Starbucks cards this season, by leveraging our digital and out-of-store distribution channels and creating a promotional presence in drive-thru lanes, where we have seen significant channel shift during the pandemic.  We are ready for this holiday. In closing, Starbucks strong performance through the recovery is a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our partners, as well as the investments we made both before and during the pandemic. We remain confident in our future and steadfast in our commitment to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders.  This confidence supports the plan we announced today to return $20 billion to shareholders over the next three years through dividends and share repurchases. I'm particularly pleased that hundreds of thousands of Starbucks partners, who are also Starbucks shareholders through our Bean Stock program, will also benefit from this plan. 50 years ago, Starbucks was founded as a different kind of Company.  A Company that would balance profit with social conscious, embrace the ideal that doing good for one another and for society would actually be very good for business over the long term. Our performance in 2021 demonstrates the wisdom and correctness of that founding principle. As we enter our second 50 years, we continue to honor our history and heritage just as we boldly reimagine our future. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rachel. Rachel.\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Kevin. And good afternoon, everyone. It's my privilege to share with you Starbucks' strong finish to fiscal 2021, our 50th year in business, delivering the highest full-year revenue, operating income, and EPS in Company history, an accomplishment that is truly special considering the profound challenges we have navigated throughout the pandemic. Please note that as Greg discussed at the top of the call, fiscal '21 results that I will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless noted, and on a 14-week basis for the quarter, and a 53-week basis for the year, except year-on-year revenue comp, operating margin, and EPS growth metrics, which will be on a 13-week or 52-week basis to exclude the impact of an extra fiscal week for comparative purposes.  In Q4, Starbucks global revenue reached 8.1 billion, up 22% from the prior year, setting another quarterly record along with a fiscal year record of $29.1 billion primarily driven by the continued momentum in the U.S. and strong contributions from across the globe, despite the severe headwinds of the COVID Delta variant, our consolidated operating margin was 19.6% in Q4 up by 580 basis points from the prior year, the increase was primarily driven by sales leverage across the P&L as we [Indiscernible] the COVID -19 impacts and related costs, as well as pricing in North America, this were partially offset by rapid inflation related to logistics, commodities, and labor costs across our supply chain. Q4 GAAP EPS was a $1.49 inclusive over $0.56 divestiture gain from the Starbucks Coffee Korea transaction. which yielded pre -tax proceeds of almost 1.2 billion.  Q4 non-GAAP EPS was a $1 capping off the Company's most profitable year ever with non-GAAP EPS of $3.24. I will now provide some segment highlights for Q4, and then we'll provide guidance for fiscal 2022. The North America segment, delivered revenue of 5.8 million in Q4, 27% higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 22% increase in comparable Starz Sales, including 18% comp transaction growth and a 3% increase in average ticket.  In the U.S., comparable store sales reached 22% in Q4, driven by transaction comp of 19%, delivering another sequential improvement in 2-year transaction comp in the face of COVID Delta variant disruption. Simultaneously, we maintained our strength in average ticket, up 3% over the prior-year in Q4, remaining near record levels and posting 2-year ticket comp of over 20% for the 6th consecutive quarter.  Cold beverages reached 75% of total sales in Q4, contributing to our ticket strength along with outstanding results from our fall promotion and another record quarter alluded tax. North America's operating margin was 22.5% in Q4, expanding 510 basis points from the prior year, driven by sales leverage as we lap the impacts of COVID, as well as continued strength in ticket, including pricing.  The segment's operating margin exceeded the pre -pandemic level in Q4 fiscal 2019 by a 170 basis points, primarily due to the leadership conference and labor our investments in Q4 fiscal 2019. Strong ticket, and the benefit of Trade Area Transformation also offset the margin headwind of approximately 270 basis points over the past few years from sizable investments in wage and benefits, as well as supply chain inflationary pressures. Moving on to international.  The international segment delivered record revenue of $1.9 billion in Q4, great 18% over the prior year. The growth was driven by an 8% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months, strong sales growth from our international licensees, as well as a 3% increase in comparable store sale. Both Company operated and licensed markets across our international portfolio are contributing meaningfully with double-digit sales growth in key markets like Japan, the U.K., Korea, and Mexico.  Kevin noted that the COVID related volatility drove comp sales down 7% in China in Q4. However, our experienced team and 22 years history continue to serve us well as operating income was only down 1% versus last year. Our team in China and across the globe has done a tremendous job of managing through the volatility. In fact, operating margins for the international segment was 22.8% in Q4, expanding 650 basis points from the prior year, well above pre -pandemic level, mainly driven by sales leverage as the segment continue to recover from the pandemic.  Higher government subsidies, Laughing Store asset impairments in the prior year, as well as store and overhead labor efficiencies also contributed to the expansion. We expect margin to settle a bit in fiscal '22 versus the levels of the past two quarters, as government subsidies are not expected to repeat, we have pressures relating to the impacts of inflation. The opportunity ahead, coupled with tremendous experience and a strong diversified portfolio, has us very optimistic for the future growth of China and our other international markets.  Onto Channel Development. Revenue was $438 million in Q4, a decline of 10% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business. When excluding the approximately 20% adverse impact of this transition-related activity, Channel Development's revenue increased by 10% in Q4, primarily driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance, as well as another international ready-to-drink business.  As a reminder, Q4 was the last quarter we will be lapping this transition so we expect Channel Development to return to more normalized reported revenue growth levels in fiscal 2022. The segment's operating margin was 50.2% in Q4 up 960 basis points from the prior year. Normalizing for the 890-basis points impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned. Channel development's operating margin expanded 70 basis points in Q4 driven primarily by lower trade spend in our International ready-to-drink business.  Now I will turn to our fiscal '22 outlook. For fiscal 2022, we are expecting global comp sales growth to reach high single-digits as we lapped prior year impacts of COVID and continue to build on our Q4 momentum. This also reflects our thoughtful pricing actions, which are expected to further bolster our comp growth as we work to offset the impact of inflation across our supply chain. New stores will also contribute meaningfully to our growth in fiscal 2022.  We expect to add approximately 2,000 net new stores globally in fiscal 2022, up significantly from 1,173 in fiscal 2021, as we successfully complete the closures under our North America Trade Area Transformation program, and are now refocusing on expansion. We estimate that approximately 75% of our net new stores will come from outside the U.S., as we continue to diversify our global portfolio across highly profitable markets.  This represents global net new store growth of 6%, returning to our ongoing growth model. With this powerful combination of global comp and store growth, coupled with the continued strength in our Channel Development segment, we are expecting consolidated revenue to range between $32.5 billion and $33 billion in fiscal 2022, growing well above our long-term guidance of 8% to 10% growth, setting us up for another year of record performance.  As Kevin mentioned, fiscal 2022 will be a pivotal year of investment, marked by increase in wage investments to further support our store partners in this critical moment, helping to ensure we have, one, the very best talent to drive our business forward and, two, the ability to continue capturing and maintaining meaningful category share gains.  Accelerating our growth in share is fuel for future margin expansion as sales leverage is one of the most meaningful expansion opportunities we have. So, while we will see an impact to operating margin in fiscal 2022 resulting from these investments, increasing our share of customers now will drive long-term earnings and value for all Starbucks stakeholders.  The success of Starbucks starts with our partners, and we are committed to continuing to invest in them as a critical strategic differentiator for our business. With these investments, we expect fiscal 2022 operating margin to be approximately 17% below our long-term target, driven by approximately 400 basis points of impact related to the wage investments, coupled with an additional headwind of approximately 200 basis points from a combination of inflationary pressures, other growth investments, and discontinuation of government subsidies.  Further, our fiscal 2022 margin expectation reflects factors unrelated to our core performance, with an approximately 40 basis points deluded impact from a combination of the Starbucks Korea transition, as well as the change in non-GAAP reporting treatment, both representing as one-time step down in margin.  However, we will meaningfully offset these margin impacts in fiscal year 2022 with benefits from pricing, leverage on our expected strong sales, and productivity gains. Importantly, given our continued proactive actions to continue to drive margin expansion and leverage accelerated sales growth, we expect our operating margin to return to the ongoing target of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2023. While fiscal 2022 margin represents a departure from our long-term growth algorithm.  We believe the value these strategic investments will create for our partners, our business, and all of our stakeholders will endure for many years to come. We are pleased that as we had previously committed, we successfully managed our leverage ratio back within our target at the end of fiscal 2021. As a result, we plan to reinstitute our share repurchase program beginning this quarter and are committed to returning $20 billion to shareholders, or approximately 15% of our current market capitalization over the next 3 years.  With this commitment, Starbucks will return to over $45 billion to shareholders since fiscal 2018, or approximately 35% of our current market capitalization, while simultaneously delivering on our algorithm for double-digit EPS growth at scale. Approximately 2/3 of this $20 billion will come in the form of share repurchases with the proceeds from the Korea transaction pushing fiscal 2022, repurchases a bit higher than the following two years. The remaining 1/3 will come through a very competitive dividend targeting an approximate 50% payout. To support this plan, we plan on issuing a moderate amount of incremental debt while retaining leverage below our target of 3 times rent adjusted EBITDA, consistent with our existing BBB+ rating. As a result, we expect interest expense to be between $490 million and $500 million in fiscal 2022 versus $470 million in fiscal 2021. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 are expected to total approximately 2 billion, up from 1.5 billion in fiscal 2021 and back to pre-Covid Levels, reflecting increases in new store development and technology initiatives in our stores.  As always, we plan to focus on Capital spending in fiscal 2022 on opportunities that drive significant returns across our global retail portfolio. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. This range translates to an EPS headwind of roughly 4% year-on-year and is meaningfully higher than the non-GAAP tax rate of 21.3% in fiscal 2021, which benefited from certain discrete tax benefits that are not expected to repeat to the same degree in fiscal 2022.  When you add it all up, on a 52-week comparative basis, we expect fiscal 2022 GAAP EPS to decline by 4% or less. We expect our fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS growth to be at least 10% from the base of $3.10 in fiscal 2021 that excludes the extra week and is adjusted for the change in non-GAAP treatment of certain integration costs. With the phased roll-outs of wage investments in the ongoing global recovery from COVID throughout the year, we expect fiscal 2022, quarterly non-GAAP EPS to be the lowest in Q2, before peaking in Q3 to form a strong back half of the year.  We recognize that this earnings guidance is a temporary change from the outlook discussed at our Investor Day in December 2020, driven by wage investments, as well as faster than expected recovery in fiscal 2021. We continue, however, to stand by our commitment to the growth algorithm over the longer term. The strategic investments in our partners are the right thing to do for our business and all of our stakeholders.  And we are confident this is providing the foundation necessary to continue to grow our coffee leadership position for many years to come. To summarize, here are the 3 key takeaways from my discussion today. First, we are thrilled with what we accomplished in fiscal 2021, far surpassing the pre -pandemic performance levels, to deliver record high revenue, operating income, and EPS, even as global consumer mobility remains suppressed, and inflationary headwinds pressure our business.  Second, fiscal 2022 will be a year of outsized investments, prioritizing our store partners, and ensuring we have the very best talent to drive, capture, and maintain lasting category share gains, while still delivering double-digit EPS growth, and initiating a return of $20 billion to our shareholders over the next 3 years. And finally, we remain fully committed to our ongoing growth model, and expect to progress towards our algorithm with an operating margin of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2023, while continuing to balance returns and investments necessary to sustain this performance over the long term.  Of course, all of this is made possible because of the significant efforts of our Starbucks partners around the world, who proudly wear the green apron. It is their unwavering commitment to our -- serving our customers that drive the financial results and outlook that I have shared today. With that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Colbert, Michael Conway, and Leo Tsoi. Thank you, Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good afternoon. My question, Rachel, is on the margin outlook that you gave, 17% this year and then growing to 18% to 19% in 2023. And I'm just wondering if you could, sort of, paint the picture of how you get from this year's margin outlook to next year's margin outlook. Are there certain offsets that are going to develop throughout the year that will lead to better performance or is there something one-time in the cost structure this year? Anything you can do to help provide some visibility on that path would be great.\nRachel Ruggeri: Yes, thank you for the question. What I would say is, when we look at our margin that we're guiding for this year and we think about where we're headed to next year, as you know, there are over 640 basis points of dilution to our margin this year given the investments we're making, as well as some of the inflationary headwinds and changes as outlined in my prepared remarks.  We're going to work this year to offset the majority of that through pricing, through sales leverage, through productivity and other efficiency measures. As we move into FY\u201923, we'll continue those efforts, and that's going to allow us to return back to the 18% to 19% margin that we guided for the long term.  We feel confident in that given that our growth at scale agenda and our focus on pipeline of innovation, our ability to continue to grow our digital customer membership, and our ability to continue to accelerate the service experience through new stores and through the experience for creating in-stores, coupled with productivity and efficiency throughout our global network is really what allows us to continue on that path towards 18% to 19% margins in line with our long-term guidance.\nKevin Johnson: And David, this is Kevin. Let me just add to Rachel's comments. The strategic investment we're making in wage, here\u2019s how to think about it. First, our Q4 and FY21 revenue results demonstrate that we are growing faster than the coffee addressable market as estimated by Euromonitor. We are taking market share.  Then if you look at consumer mobility, it's going to continue to increase, and we want to recruit and retain the very best talent for our stores. The most important investment we can make is in our Green Apron partners. We know this to be true because it has been proven time and time again throughout our 50-year history that when we take care of our partners, they\u2019re always right to the occasion and create that unique Starbucks experience for our customers. Clearly, from my perspective, this investment in our partners is not only the right thing to do for them, it's also the right thing to do for all stakeholders, including our shareholders. We are on the front foot right now and we have this opportunity to accelerate by investing into the growth curve.  This means with this investment, we predict higher market share gains as consumers return to our stores, and these share gains will be permanent, and these share gains will create long-term shareholder value. If you think about it and you modeled it, those permanent gains, we know we get operating leverage as we get more customers. So, if you just take the share gains and you run the spreadsheets on operating leverage, that is what's going to create -- this is actually going to increase the terminal value calculation for Starbucks.  And we're so confident in this strategy in this investment, that's why we're committing this $20 billion return to shareholders over the next 3 years. So, this is all about leaning into the growth, taking market share that's going to be permanent, and the benefit that that market share is going to create significantly more shareholder value than we would have created without the investment, and we are so confident with $20 billion returned to shareholders in dividends and buybacks. That's how I think about it, and that's how I think every shareholder ought to think about this investment.\nDavid Tarantino: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thanks. I just have a two-part question. Kevin, what do you attribute to the U.S. acceleration in September? I think investors are trying to get a sense if this is something more enduring, like a post -- like a larger post-Labor Day return to office, or perhaps something more transitory like a successful PSL season.  And Rachel, just to clarify one piece of the guidance, does the non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.40 plus, does that incorporate share buybacks or is that excluded from the EPS guidance? And if you can just provide a share count that guidance is contingent on to help flush that out, it'd be very helpful. Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: Yeah, Andrew, I will take the first part of your question then I'll hand it to Rachel. Look, with COVID cases, in this case, the Delta variant, it creates this variability in consumer behavior. So, as you saw in the U.S., more government restrictions, and many of these were done state by state and city by city, that we had to respond to. That, I think was the impact in August, and as we responded to those and certainly as I think consumers start to see the Delta variant curve starting to slow, consumer mobility unfolds.  So, these are all transitory and they are unpredictable, it is all related to the pandemic. So, the acceleration that we saw in both the U.S. and China are the exact same reason. It is just the variable of dealing with a global pandemic, and when these Delta variants and these other things pop up, it does have some impact on consumer mobility, but the one thing we know for sure, absolutely we see it in every market around the world, that as the spread of COVID gets under control as market-by-market, customers return to our stores immediately.  That's why this investment in wage and ensuring we staff our stores with the very best, most talented Green Apron partners we can is so important. This is the right time to make that investment, and we're confident that that investment is going to return significant value to shareholders. Rachel, do you want to take the second part of the question.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. And to the second part, Andrew, what I would say is generally -- we're looking at about approximately 1% impact to EPS from the share repurchases, which is in line with our long-term guidance, slightly elevated this year just given that this year\u2019s repurchases will be a little bit higher than '23 and '24, given the impact of the proceeds from Korea but approximately 1% and that's provided in our guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. Just looking at the numbers, it seems like one of your biggest opportunities is bringing back the U.S. traffic counts, I guess to at least what they were in 2019, if not even above what they were in 2019. So, I wanted to get either your sense of the visibility of that happening, if there are any green sheets, for example, suburban drive - throughs, for example, that are seeing that increase in traffic and you do you think you have the staffing today in the stores that would allow that return to traffic or would it be necessary to add a step function change in some of the labor hours to reach that increase consumer demand. Thank you. Thanks John, I'll hit to A - John Culver to share his perspective on the question.\nJohn Culver: Yes, John, we're seeing -- obviously, a record number of customers coming back into our stores and that's signaled by the significant transaction growth we saw at quarter-over-quarter at plus 18%. What we're seeing from a behavior standpoint are very similar behaviors from customers as we've had in prior quarters and pre-Covid. So, routines are beginning to normalize.  I think it speaks to a little about around what Kevin said that as people become more mobile and particularly as we launched our fall campaign, normal routines entered with kids going back to school. Our peak hours have returned to pre - COVID behavior. They started in Q3 and it continued into Q4, morning daypart, very strong growth on a year-over-year basis, as well as midday, and then into the afternoon.  We're seeing a very high beverage and food attach, and really a shift to cold beverages that we talked about on the last earnings call. Cold beverages actually accountable for 75% of our beverage sales in the quarter, but food equally was strong, we're up 35%, espresso was up 34%, and we are seeing larger tickets come through as well.  So, when you look at it from a store standpoint, we're very pleased with what the performance has been, first in the rural and suburban areas where our drive - thus are most common and which helped carry us through the COVID period and over the last 18 months, were very strong and they continue to show strong performance. Our urban stores have reached recovered status, and we're very encouraged by that.  And then from a central business district, recovery has been slower, but it continues for the second quarter in a row. Central business district is returned to a positive comp performance as well. And then the last thing I would just leave you with is what we're seeing on the convenience aspect of Starbucks. And in particular, the growth of drive-thru and the growth of MOP. And we've done a lot of this during the Trade Area Transformation work we did around the stores.  Today, drive-thru and MOP accounted for 70% of transactions, which is up 15% versus pre -pandemic levels. So, we're very encouraged with the momentum that we've been able to build. And then obviously with the investments that we're making in our people, from a wage perspective, we expect to continue to increase staffing levels, continue to increase the training for our partners, and we are very, very well positioned for a very strong holiday season.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi. Just kind of building on John's question, could you kind of quantify where U.S. staffing is relative to pre -pandemic? And maybe even some metrics around where your hourly turnover and managerial turnover is relative to 2019 would be helpful.\nJohn Culver: What I'd say, Sharon, is a couple of things. Obviously, like all other retailers, we're navigating a very complex and unprecedented environment. And, yes, we have seen some staffing challenges in certain parts of the country but I think from the results we've been able to deliver. It demonstrates our ability to navigate through these challenges, whether it be staffing, whether it be any of the supply chain challenges, or any of the inflationary pressures.  When you look at it, one of the things that we've done during this time as we've looked at adjusting the staffing levels and how do we manage through this, is we've also acted to adjust store operating hours and when I say that we've really looked at the evening day-part and pull that back from an hour\u2019s perspective. And that has enabled us to redeploy staffing into other stores where we need it.  So, we're continuing to do that. In terms of your question around attrition. We are over the last year, we have approximately 70% of our hourly partners are new to Starbucks and we continue to make investments in them from a training standpoint, as we announced yesterday for all our partners. In addition, we've made investments now and we announced this yesterday around recruiting and adding recruiters -- more recruiters into the regions to really focus and find, and attract new talent.  And then also at the same time, we continue to work very closely with our partners to understand how we can continue to make them effective, as well as reduced complexity in the store. And complexity is a big thing for us, a big focus. And then that we're looking at two things. Number one is driving automation in the stores. We've driven automated ordering for food and merchandise that will be fully rolled out across all of our U.S. Company-owned stores by the middle of this quarter.  And then in addition, we continue to make investments in equipment. And from an equipment standpoint, whether it's a strainer, whether it's our warming ovens, or whether it's our cold brew system, all these equipment investments also make our partners more effective in free up time for them as they do their task.  So, a lot of work going on. I'm very proud of the way in which our partners have navigated over the course of the last year in particular, and as we've experienced some of these challenges, and we feel as though we are in a very good spot in managing through this, and we will continue to make investments in this area. It's an area we're watching very closely.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Sara, please proceed with your question.\nSara Senatore: Sorry. Can you hear me now?\nOperator: Yes.\nSara Senatore: Sorry about that. I have a question and then a follow-up. The first is on China. It sounds like you're seeing just the impact of the pandemic rather than, say, slower macro growth, or what others have alluded to, or competition. So, I guess just -- if you could just kind of talk about that in the context of what you're seeing there in terms of transaction, and ticket.  Giving back a little bit of the ticket, I didn't know if there\u2019s an underlying dynamic there outside of just the pandemic that might be playing out. And then my follow-up was on the investments you're making holistically. I certainly understand why, and to your point, the payout has been visible, but why not sort of approach it more ratably as opposed to a lot upfront in the coming year, just given the volatility in the operating environment and you're coming off of obviously depressed earnings growth from the pandemic. Can you just talk about the timing, and different molding of it? Thanks\nKevin Johnson: Yes. Thanks, Sara. For your first question on China, Leo's joining us on the call from Shanghai. So, Leo, why don't I hand the question over to you.\nLeo Tsoi: Certainly. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, Sarah. My pleasure to get this question. Actually, in Q4 last year, our last fiscal year, we were impacted by 3 weights of COVID decisions in the entire quarter, which picked 42 cities in total across the quarter. Now, what it means is that we saw elevated public health measures were implemented, which significantly reduced the customer mobility, and disrupted the consumption patterns.  As you know, the borders also remained closed. And when we see what these impacts to us, it means that over half of our stores were located in cities, hit by local cases. And around 80% of our stores we're operating under the [Indiscernible] safety protocols at the peak of the resurgence. So that's why weighted down by these headwinds, we in Q4 delivered a 11% revenue growth year-over-year as Kevin pointed out.  And that means in Q4, the converse of net minus 7% or minus 3% if we exclude the lapping over of FY'20 VAT reliefs. However, I must say that when we exclude the thoughts in the [Indiscernible] with local cases, as well as transportation than tourist stores. Our comp was actually positive, excluding the FI retention and VAP release. And more importantly as Rachel also pointed out, our operating income was -1% versus last year.  And if we actually exclude the one of [Indiscernible] FY20, we actually achieved this -- how we improved this -- our improvement on the operating income. So, this is really showing and demonstrating in our team's operational ability. So, I'll just say that there are -- we are seeing these pandemic dynamics are happening in the market, but I would -- I'm confidently saying that it is a short-term. And there are -- they are going to recover; we're going to recover.  And this is why our focus right now is focused on what we can control. The navigates, all these short-term volatility with our team's ability while capturing the key opportunity by for example, accelerating our future growth and elevating our fiscal engagements and our customer experience. I think this fall is going to power our future -- color our future growth, and feel sustainable competitive advantage of set of China. And over to you.\nKevin Johnson: Thank you. Thank you, Leo. Let me -- Sara, let me take the second half of your question, back half of your question regarding this investment. I just want to start by just sort of looking back at some of the strategic investments that we made through this pandemic, starting with the decision we took in March of 2020 to give our partners economic certainty and pay them with no laughs, no furloughs, pay them while we closed all of our stores in the U.S, and should have kept drive - throughs open.  That was a big strategic decision and we made that decision certainly staying true to our mission values and taking care of our partners, but we also knew that as this pandemic begin s to ease and the recovery came back, our partners would be there, and they were. And so why do you think we drove a faster recovery than people expected? Why did we drive a faster recovery than others in the industry? Answer, because we had the courage to make that strategic bet at that time in March of 2020. Then in June of 2020, we made the strategic decision to transform the trade area portfolio or the store portfolio in the U.S.  We basically repositioned nearly 600 stores to reposition them to better serve our customers and to give us better economics and to elevate the customer experience. That strategic decision, we had the courage to make that and that strategic decision today is giving us margin expansion, unelevated customer experience, and that too is contributing to our recovery. I think about this decision on this wage investment the very same way we have in the past.  We're going to stay true to our mission values and we know, we know for certain because we've seen it time and time again, that when we invest in our partners, they rise to the occasion. And we also know the pandemic is transitory. We know vaccines work. We know that when we see markets, as governments just reduce restrictions, customers are back into our stores.  So, this is an opportunity for us to move now. We can't wait. This is the time to take that market share that we know we can take, and that market share gain is permanent. That market share gain will build long-term customer engagement, long-term customer loyalty, and that market share gain will also drive operating leverage in our stores. In addition to that, we also know that we have a combination of in-store productivity innovation that's going to help offset that.  We also have pricing power, and we're very thoughtful about how we take price. But we're taking price, and we will continue to take price in an inflationary environment. So, we just believe this is the absolute right thing to do at this moment in time, and this investment, like the other two that I just described, will return value to shareholders. Because of that, that's why we re-enforce our confidence with this $20 billion return to shareholders in the form of repurchases and buybacks. Thanks for your question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. In addition to the wage pressure, you've called out the supply chain pressures, I'm wondering how transit you think those are, is that something that dissipates over the next couple of quarters, and maybe specifically what are those issues, what specific items, is it Coffee, is it food, is it supplies for stores. And how do you -- are you confident or you're certain you've got the supplies needed, I guess, to get through this holiday season given you're expecting such a large increase in sales? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: Okay. Let me have -- I'll have Rachel's comment is going to -- I want John Colbert to give you sort of perspective on where we're at the supply chain. Rachel.\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you. I will start with the perspective in terms of how we think about it within our guidance then I'll turn it over to John. He can speak more to the specifics. From a guidance stand point, as I talked about my prepared remarks, about 200 basis points of margin dilution related to a combination of the supply chain pressures, [Indiscernible] related to the supply chain pressures as well as our government subsidies from prior year investments. When we look at the past quarter Q4, we had about a 90-basis point impact from inflationary pressures across the globe.  And with the combination of logistics, labor, as well as commodities as we move into Q1 and Q2, we would expect that to increase, and then they'll start to settle in Q3 and Q4. But we've included it as part of our guidance throughout the year because you really don't know when these are going -- when these inflationary pressures will subside. In that point we've got some plans in this year. Of course, they could increase.  We don't know what's going to happen, but we feel confident we've got a reset-approach based on what we've seen in Q3 and Q4 this year, and we've accounted for that into next year. But it does impact us more meaningfully in Q1 and Q2 than what we would have originally thought. And then again settled in Q3 and Q4 from a margin perspective. And so, with that, I will turn it over to John for specifics.\nJohn Culver: Yeah, John, just really quick. On the inflationary impacts from a supply chain standpoint, we are seeing impacts, and that's evidenced by some of the inventory levels in our stores, but I feel very good about the way in which we've been able to navigate it.  Those supply impacts began in mid - fiscal '21 and we would expect that they will continue into this coming year. All right? And what we're seeing is headwinds on commodity pricing, challenges around transportation, and also the ability for our distributors and manufacturers to find labor to work in their factories and distribution centers.  A couple of things that we've done with the team is, number 1, we've worked very closely to add new manufacturing and supply partners across our critical categories. And that is a dividend for us and we're seeing inventory ease in those categories, i.e., old milk, breakfast sandwiches, egg bites et cetera. Whereas building throughput, and production capacity, we have suppliers adding new lines so that they can increase their safety stock. We've worked with suppliers to invest in wage for their workers, and many of them have done so.  And the last thing I would say that what we've done, is we've really focused our production effort on high volume items. In some of those lower volume items, we pull back on and deprioritize. So, all that work and the actions that we've taken, we started early on as we began to see these challenges, we've addressed some. We're not out of the woods yet, but we feel very good about the path that we're on. And as Kevin highlighted, we're very confident that as we head into holiday, our inventory position is very strong.  And we'll continue to watch this very closely and we'll continue to work with our supply network to ensure we've got an adequate supply of products in our stores. And then the last thing I would say is that clearly like other retailers, we're seeing customers come back into our stores at record levels. And the strength of our business is very strong. So, we're very encouraged around the progress that we're making and the growth opportunities that we see going forward.\nKevin Johnson: Since you raised coffee, John were 14 months price locked on coffee with several months of inventory in the warehouse. So, we're -- there's not a risk on top.\nJohn Glass: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just a follow-on to that return of cash discussion, which is obviously a bullish sign that $20 billion investment you're making. But with that said, Kevin just thinking bigger picture. I think you said in your press release that you're currently 50-50 Company-owned and licensed. Just wondering what the thoughts are around increasing that licensing mix over time, which would seemingly generate a higher margin annuity stream of royalty income, allow for greater Balance Sheet leverage, maybe return incremental cash.  I'm not sure whether that would require a change in the China ownership structure. But we've obviously seen that at your largest multinational QSR peers. So just essentially looking for an update to the thoughts on that 10-20-30 scenario from the 2020 Investor Day. Just to get your sense for the outlook on the ownership structure. Thank you.\nKevin Johnson: Yeah. And if you think the question, I think clearly our growth at scale agenda identified as U.S. and China is our two lead markets and we're very happy with that agenda. I think China still has a significantly long runway of growth and you see this continue to expand and accelerate the number of new stores we're building in market that we all highlighted.  And so, we're very bullish on the long-term in China. U.S. continues to -- the cost growth that we're seeing and the opportunities we see to continue to grow the U.S. in terms of new stores and comp growth. Still very, very bullish on that as well. As we said, in December 2020, we're always evaluating markets and you saw that the Korea joint venture, we did sell our 50% stake to a long-term licensed partner and they -- who's been operating that market and will continue to operate that market.  We're always evaluating that. We're happy with where we are today. And I guess that's how -- that's what we said. When I think about U.S. and China, our two lead growth markets, I think we're very happy with where we are today, and we see long-term growth ahead of both of those markets.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I know, Kevin, you've mentioned a couple of times on this call, pricing action and the idea that you have a good amount of pricing power, kind of pent-up in your business. So, I was wondering if you could give us some guide on what you're expecting for fiscal '22, given food away from home inflation is in that mid-single-digit range right now and obviously the inflationary pressures are going to remain.  And then just following up on the guidance piece, Rachel, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more clarity on the EPS that you had offered. I think you'd mentioned about 10% EPS growth off the non-GAAP, fiscal '21 at 310. And based on the metrics that you offered, I'm having a hard time getting to that 340 plus range in 2022, so maybe some more clarity on some of the line items will be great, please.\nKevin Johnson: All right, John, let me take the first part of your question and then I'll hand to Rachel on the second part. Look, when it comes to pricing, we continue to be very thoughtful and very strategic in how we look at pricing and we're actually using machine learning and some of the Deep Brew technologies that inform our pricing team on where and how to take that price.  I prefer not to say, hey, here's the amount of price we've built into this plan, but I think we certainly have more upside in prices that we needed. But it is a dynamic thing because we're watching inflation and we really want to do this in a way that stays true to the thoughtfulness that we've always had in the past and part of this is how do you take, the right amount of price, the right time and not have customer attrition.  We're the share we want to grow share of customer occasions right now. And so, that's the balance that we strike, and it's really a fairly dynamic thing. So, for, us to -- we just -- I prefer not to say, here's what we built because I think we actually have more if we need it, we could take less if we don't need it. All I will say is that I know we've got a world-class pricing team backed up by world-class analytics and insight. And we are -- we were very good at this in fiscal '21 and we're going to be very good at it going forward. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure, and Jon, what I would say is if you look at our non-GAAP EPS for FY21, the $3.24, from a baseline perspective, we're removing the additional week, so that's about $0.10. In addition to that, we have a change in our treatment of some non-GAAP reporting for purposes of integration costs related to acquisitions, that's another $0.04. So that combination of the $0.14 is what we're reducing this year's non-GAAP EPS of $3.24 down to an adjusted FY21 non-GAAP EPS of $3.10. And then we're encouraging a growth rate off of that baseline of at least 10%.  And again that 10% is, given the dynamic operating environment that we're in, this unprecedent level of investments that we're taking. as well as the pressures we still see related to the supply chain and the inflationary pressures, as well as the pressures we're seeing from the COVID vaccine -- from the COVID environment. We think the combination of that and the dynamic environment we're in and that at least 10% growth reflects a lot of confidence and optimism for where we're headed, even though it's quite a challenging environment ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to A - Kevin Johnson for closing remarks.\nKevin Johnson: Well, thank you. And now before we close, today's call, I want to take this opportunity to welcome Tiffany Willis to Starbucks as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. And I also want to congratulate Greg Smith on his new role, Leading Finance for our international channels business.  Tiffany brings great experience in Finance and IR for multiple industries including food and beverage, consumer products, and technology, and we look forward to introducing her to our investment community as she begins her journey to Starbucks with us. So, Tiffany, welcome. I also want to reiterate for all of you that consumer demand is strong. And this moment in time is an inflection point. It's an opportunity for Starbucks to invest ahead of the growth curve, and deliver long-term gains for all stakeholders.  I think with the strategic actions that we've made; we are well-positioned to grow share of customer occasions and dramatically strengthen engagement and loyalty for long-term sustainable growth. And with that, we look forward to walking all of you to our stores this holiday season, so that you can enjoy your seasonal favorites. And with that, have a great evening. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2021 conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes, John, we're seeing -- obviously, a record number of customers coming back into our stores and that's signaled by the significant transaction growth we saw at quarter-over-quarter at plus 18%. What we're seeing from a behavior standpoint are very similar behaviors from customers as we've had in prior quarters and pre-Covid. So, routines are beginning to normalize.  I think it speaks to a little about around what Kevin said that as people become more mobile and particularly as we launched our fall campaign, normal routines entered with kids going back to school. Our peak hours have returned to pre - COVID behavior. They started in Q3 and it continued into Q4, morning daypart, very strong growth on a year-over-year basis, as well as midday, and then into the afternoon.

            "content": "Well, thank you Greg, and welcome everyone to today's call. I'm very pleased to comment on the record Q4 and FY2021 results Starbucks reported today. I'm particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results in Starbucks' 50th anniversary year, and in the face of increased costs and unprecedented operating challenges resulting from the global pandemic.  Today's results reflect very strong operating and financial performance across-the-board. With Q4 revenue growing 22%, and full-year non-GAAP EPS of 168% over prior year. This was a record Q4 that punctuates a very strong FY'21 performance with record highs in revenue, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP EPS.  Our performance accelerated throughout FY2021, fueling revenue growth of 21%, non-GAAP operating income grew 139%, and translated to a non-GAAP earnings of $3.24 per share, near the high end of our guidance for the year. Perhaps more persuasively than ever, the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and the power and opportunity afforded by the authentic connection and the deep trust and loyalty we have built with customers around the world is resonating.  Today's results demonstrate that despite the pandemic, Starbucks' long-term double-digit growth-at-scale model remains solidly intact. Today's results also underscore the passion and dedication of our over 400,000 Starbucks Green Apron partners, who serve nearly 100 million customer occasions around the world every week. And I'm humbled by our partners commitment to each other and to our customers as we continue to navigate through the pandemic.  Their resilience and service honors the Company and our history. And I could not be more appreciative of their efforts. Finally, today's results demonstrate the success of the investments we have made and will continue to make ahead of the growth curve in our people, digital, beverage and food innovation, and store experiences. These investments are driving and strengthening our global business and setting us up for even greater success in the future. Starbucks' long-standing view is that our partners guided this Company, and we applaud other like-minded companies who are following our lead.  Starbucks has been at the forefront of investing in our people since we opened our first store in the Pike Place Market in Seattle in 1971. We offered paid company healthcare 25 years before the Affordable Care Act, equity ownership in the form of Bean Stock to eligible part-time partners, free college tuition through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University, and mental health support through our partnership with Lyra. Investing in our people is the cornerstone of our storied 50-year history and tradition.  And these investments continued to deliver real, measurable value to our partners, our customers, and our shareholders. I'll be providing granularity around the incremental partner investments we made beginning last year, and the additional partner investments we will be making in fiscal '22 in a moment. On today's call. I will highlight Q4 performance in our key markets and provide detail around some of our actions and investments since the pandemic first surfaced in Q2 of 2020, that are contributing to our performance today and setting us up for accelerated growth in the future. I'll also open a window on our exciting holiday plans and several initiatives that will launch over the near term. Then, we will turn the call over to Rachel to provide a deep dive into our Q4 and fiscal year performance, and share our guidance for fiscal '22. We'll then move on to Q&A. Over the last 18 months, Starbucks, like most global retail operators, has been confronted with a seemingly never-ending wave of consumer and business headwinds. Many businesses in our space have not survived.  From day one of the pandemic, Starbucks leaders around the world were determined to use the Company's size and scale to navigate whatever challenges lie ahead with steadfast commitment to our people, our mission and values, a set of principles guided us through the pandemic. Every decision was rooted in our core purpose and reason for being. These decisions have made the Starbucks of today stronger and better positioned to profitably grow, extend our coffee leadership around the world, and create more value for our shareholders more than ever before in our history.  Last year, we made significant pandemic-driven strategic investments, including providing our partners with financial support and economic certainty, avoiding layoffs while most of our stores were temporary closed, and accelerating our U.S. store portfolio transformation by opportunistically repositioning 500 stores to better locations with more favorable economics.  To this last point, we expanded our portfolio of drive-thru 's, introduced new store formats to meet our customers where they are, and turbo-charged growth in our digital customer relationships in the U.S. and China. As a result of these successful investments, we are entering fiscal '22 with strong momentum around the world, and in the U.S., our largest global market, our key growth driver, this comparable sale.  We grew a strong two-year comp, to 11% in Q4 despite variance across the country that created a dynamic set of city-by-city COVID restrictions, which we had to navigate. We made significant progress addressing supply chain issues and experienced an overall improvement in inventory availability as we move through the quarter by increasing production at existing suppliers, on-boarding new suppliers, and strategically prioritizing key holiday and Q1 merchandise.  While we made significant progress addressing supply chain challenges as fiscal 2021 progressed, we remain cautious and vigilant as we enter fiscal '22 given the dynamic nature of the situation. The recovery in Q4 surged forward as evidenced by the sequential acceleration of 2-year comp growth. We exited Q4 with even stronger 14% 2-year comp growth in September and closed to a record average [Indiscernible] driven by the strength of our fall beverage lineup, a shift in customer behavior toward more premium beverages, and strong food attach. We have great confidence for the year ahead given the current momentum throughout the quarter, combined with holiday plans certain to excite and delight our customers, and increasing consumer demand around the world today for everything Starbucks.  Yesterday we made an important announcement to raise wages across the U.S. in fiscal '22, to ensure we continue to attract and retain talented partners, as consumer mobility continues to increase. We believe this investment, combined with our industry-leading benefits program, will enable us to remain an employer of choice. This builds on the historic partner investments and meaningful wage increases we made in fiscal year 21, and prioritizes significant additional investment to address inflation and wage compression that our 10-year partners have experienced, while also increasing our wage floor.  In December of 2020, I announced our intention to provide a starting wage of at least $15 an hour for our store partners across the country. And by the summer of '22, we will have delivered on that plan. Effective in January, partners with 2 or more years of service will get up to a 5% raise, and partners with 5 or more years will get up to a 10% raise, in keeping with our longstanding history of investing in our partners.  And next summer, hourly partners in the U.S. will make an average of nearly $17 an hour with barista rates ranging from 50 to $23 an hour across the country. In total, the FY21 and FY22 investments represent approximately $1 billion in incremental annual wages and benefits. We continue to build a great and enduring Company by investing ahead of the growth curve, not just in wages, but in training and technology and the overall Starbucks experience for both our partners and our customers.  And as we have seen in the past, we expect investment in the partner experience will be accretive to profits over time. We believe the U.S. market is at a unique inflection point. Stakeholder and companies whose leaders correctly identify emerging trends, thoughtfully shapes strategic action, and invest in the future will be big winners over the long term. In the quarters ahead, Starbucks will continue to target investment in high returning assets that we believe will accelerate our double-digit growth at scale model, driving long-term, sustainable, and profitable growth.  We continue to build and leverage our technology first, mobile and digital capabilities and accelerate growth in active Starbucks Rewards membership. We grew our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members, representing our most loyal, engaged customers by approximately 30% in fiscal year 21 to 24.8 million members. Noteworthy is that in Q4, 51% of U.S. tender for Company-operated stores was generated by this loyal customer base.  We continue to nurture and deepen our direct, personalized, digital relationship with our members, with enhancements to the program, like Stars for Everyone to expand reach, and through payment partnerships with PayPal and [Indiscernible] where a customer can now reload their Starbucks card with a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, by converting digital currencies to physical currency and reloading their Starbucks card.  Through Blockchain or other innovative technologies, we're exploring how to tokenize Starz, create the ability for other merchants to connect their rewards program to Starbucks Rewards. This will enable customers to exchange value across brands, engage in more personalized experiences, enhance digital services, and exchange other loyalty points for Starz at Starbucks. An example of this innovation is evident in the recent launch of our Canadian Loyalty Program with Air Canada.  Over the next year, you will see the first instance of this loyalty points exchange with other consumer brands. This approach will also serve as a foundation for a more aspirational concept for new, modern payment rails that align payment expenses with the value received by customers and merchants. We intend to be at the forefront of this disruptive innovation, which will unfold over the next few years.  Finally, a rich pipeline of innovation will elevate the Starbucks experience in our stores, and drive in-store productivity gains. Examples include our Mastrena 2 espresso machines that more efficiently pulls triple shots of high-quality espresso. Our Deep Brew artificial intelligence platform that has automated daily inventory management, and store staffing and training improvements designed to reduce complexity in our stores. Simplifying this workflow helps reduce the strain on our partners, resulting from the ever-increased demand in our stores.  It enables our partners to connect and engage with their customers, which is at the heart of the Starbucks experience. Starbucks is entering fiscal year '22 with strong customer demand and solid momentum in our U.S. business, and expanding and accelerating in-store channels and digital flywheel and green apron partners, eager to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to their customers. Having navigated through so many challenges over the past year, we are excited and optimistic about the year that has just begun, while remaining humble and mindful of unknown challenges. On to China.  Starbucks China extended our market leadership position in Q4 despite pandemic-driven disruptions, propelled by an accelerated pace of store development and significant growth in digital customer relationships, all while achieving record customer engagement scores in the quarter and in the year. Starbucks has built one of the most respected consumer brands in China, with one in two consumers preferring Starbucks to any other brands in a way from home coffee.  Our growth strategy in the market continues to differentiate us and position us well for the long game. We continue to invest meaningfully in all aspects of our China business, including accelerated investment in our partners, the creation of award-winning experiential store designs, unprecedented benefits like healthcare for partners and the parents, rents assistance and programs that offer career paths for young people from rural and remote provinces.  Together, these investments further elevate the Starbucks brand and partner experience. They instill pride in our China partners and deepen our customer engagement and connection. Starbucks continues to be in a strong market expansion cycle. And as such, much of our growth in China comes as we aggressively expand our store footprint, and introduce more customers to the Starbucks experience. We expanded the store footprint with 225 net new stores in Q4, and we are going deeper and broader.  Deeper into existing cities, and broader by opening in new cities. For the full fiscal year, we opened a record 654 net new stores, and ended the year with 5,360 stores in 208 cities throughout China. As we noted on our Q3 earnings call, our recovery in China will not be linear. In Q4, we experienced COVID -related restrictions that constrained customer mobility in 18 provincial level regions.  At its peak in mid-August, approximately 80% of our stores in China were impacted by the pandemic, with some stores fully closed or operating at different levels of elevated public health protocols, such as mobile ordering only, limited seating, or health stations. Our recovery momentum was below expectation and pushed our 2-year comps to a minus 10% in Q4. Cities with local COVID cases were impacted the most, with storage relying on transportation and tourism also materially impacted during the quarter.  Notably though, much like the U.S., China 2-year comp also accelerated in the month of September as we remain optimistic for the recovery. Despite these strong headwinds, China grew revenue 11% year-on-year. While our overall reported comp growth was minus 7% for Q4, if we exclude the lap of that subsidy we received in fiscal year '20, along with the stores in cities that experienced local COVID cases or were in transportation and tourism zones, our core fleet of stores, comp positive. positive.  Starbucks business and operating margins remain strong. Our commitment to China, and our confidence in our long-term growth strategy in China is unwavering. In addition to expanding our portfolio of stores in China, we also expanded our digital footprint of 90-days Starbucks Rewards active members, reaching an all-time high of 17.9 million in Q4. This represents a sequential increase of 5% over Q3, and an increase of 33% over prior year.  Frequency of purchases by our gold members remained at pre -pandemic levels, despite the mobility limitations in the quarter, demonstrating the effectiveness of our efforts in up-leveling member engagement. One example was our Star Dash, gift with purchase campaign that successfully lifted member frequency and spend, and evolved into a highly anticipated activity for members to earn limited availability to Starbucks 50th anniversary merchandise.  With operations heavily impacted by COVID related safety restrictions in the quarter, we are laser-focused on what we can control in China, while continuing to elevate our partner and customer experiences to further elevate the Starbucks brand, and build on the loyalty that will continue to drive our long-term growth. Including the U.S. and China, Starbucks presence in 84 markets around the world provides us with a unique perspective on the global recovery from this pandemic.  There is no doubt that we are seeing continued recovery in our markets. Latin America grew system sales by 113% in Q4, driven by a strong recovery in Mexico. EMEA posted system sales growth of 52% in the quarter. And Japan navigated through a challenging quarter, turning the corner towards renewed growth. We see positive signs in many other markets, as well as reinforcing our belief that pandemic-related headwinds are temporary.  In addition, our strategic channel partnerships with the North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo, and our global coffee alliance with Nestle, are on plan and have propelled Starbucks to number 1 share positions in the U.S. and throughout many other markets around the world, further underscoring the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and illuminating the decade-long runway of growth ahead.  As we enter fiscal year '22, we are fully prepared for a record-breaking holiday with strong growth plans around the world and a holiday campaign designed to build genuine human connection, as only Starbucks can, at a time when human connection is more important than ever. ever. In addition to new and iconic seasonal products, we are integrating brand-building and transaction-driving marketing programs to demonstrate our values and touch our customers' hearts.  We're prepared with inventory this holiday, and we're also anticipating that nearly $3 billion will be loaded on Starbucks cards this season, by leveraging our digital and out-of-store distribution channels and creating a promotional presence in drive-thru lanes, where we have seen significant channel shift during the pandemic.  We are ready for this holiday. In closing, Starbucks strong performance through the recovery is a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our partners, as well as the investments we made both before and during the pandemic. We remain confident in our future and steadfast in our commitment to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders.  This confidence supports the plan we announced today to return $20 billion to shareholders over the next three years through dividends and share repurchases. I'm particularly pleased that hundreds of thousands of Starbucks partners, who are also Starbucks shareholders through our Bean Stock program, will also benefit from this plan. 50 years ago, Starbucks was founded as a different kind of Company.  A Company that would balance profit with social conscious, embrace the ideal that doing good for one another and for society would actually be very good for business over the long term. Our performance in 2021 demonstrates the wisdom and correctness of that founding principle. As we enter our second 50 years, we continue to honor our history and heritage just as we boldly reimagine our future. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rachel. Rachel. And David, this is Kevin. Let me just add to Rachel's comments. The strategic investment we're making in wage, here's how to think about it. First, our Q4 and FY21 revenue results demonstrate that we are growing faster than the coffee addressable market as estimated by Euromonitor. We are taking market share.  Then if you look at consumer mobility, it's going to continue to increase, and we want to recruit and retain the very best talent for our stores. The most important investment we can make is in our Green Apron partners. We know this to be true because it has been proven time and time again throughout our 50-year history that when we take care of our partners, they're always right to the occasion and create that unique Starbucks experience for our customers. Clearly, from my perspective, this investment in our partners is not only the right thing to do for them, it's also the right thing to do for all stakeholders, including our shareholders. We are on the front foot right now and we have this opportunity to accelerate by investing into the growth curve.  This means with this investment, we predict higher market share gains as consumers return to our stores, and these share gains will be permanent, and these share gains will create long-term shareholder value. If you think about it and you modeled it, those permanent gains, we know we get operating leverage as we get more customers. So, if you just take the share gains and you run the spreadsheets on operating leverage, that is what's going to create -- this is actually going to increase the terminal value calculation for Starbucks.  And we're so confident in this strategy in this investment, that's why we're committing this $20 billion return to shareholders over the next 3 years. So, this is all about leaning into the growth, taking market share that's going to be permanent, and the benefit that that market share is going to create significantly more shareholder value than we would have created without the investment, and we are so confident with $20 billion returned to shareholders in dividends and buybacks. That's how I think about it, and that's how I think every shareholder ought to think about this investment. Yeah, Andrew, I will take the first part of your question then I'll hand it to Rachel. Look, with COVID cases, in this case, the Delta variant, it creates this variability in consumer behavior. So, as you saw in the U.S., more government restrictions, and many of these were done state by state and city by city, that we had to respond to. That, I think was the impact in August, and as we responded to those and certainly as I think consumers start to see the Delta variant curve starting to slow, consumer mobility unfolds.  So, these are all transitory and they are unpredictable, it is all related to the pandemic. So, the acceleration that we saw in both the U.S. and China are the exact same reason. It is just the variable of dealing with a global pandemic, and when these Delta variants and these other things pop up, it does have some impact on consumer mobility, but the one thing we know for sure, absolutely we see it in every market around the world, that as the spread of COVID gets under control as market-by-market, customers return to our stores immediately.  That's why this investment in wage and ensuring we staff our stores with the very best, most talented Green Apron partners we can is so important. This is the right time to make that investment, and we're confident that that investment is going to return significant value to shareholders. Rachel, do you want to take the second part of the question. Yes. Thanks, Sara. For your first question on China, Leo's joining us on the call from Shanghai. So, Leo, why don't I hand the question over to you. Thank you. Thank you, Leo. Let me -- Sara, let me take the second half of your question, back half of your question regarding this investment. I just want to start by just sort of looking back at some of the strategic investments that we made through this pandemic, starting with the decision we took in March of 2020 to give our partners economic certainty and pay them with no laughs, no furloughs, pay them while we closed all of our stores in the U.S, and should have kept drive - throughs open.  That was a big strategic decision and we made that decision certainly staying true to our mission values and taking care of our partners, but we also knew that as this pandemic begin s to ease and the recovery came back, our partners would be there, and they were. And so why do you think we drove a faster recovery than people expected? Why did we drive a faster recovery than others in the industry? Answer, because we had the courage to make that strategic bet at that time in March of 2020. Then in June of 2020, we made the strategic decision to transform the trade area portfolio or the store portfolio in the U.S.  We basically repositioned nearly 600 stores to reposition them to better serve our customers and to give us better economics and to elevate the customer experience. That strategic decision, we had the courage to make that and that strategic decision today is giving us margin expansion, unelevated customer experience, and that too is contributing to our recovery. I think about this decision on this wage investment the very same way we have in the past.  We're going to stay true to our mission values and we know, we know for certain because we've seen it time and time again, that when we invest in our partners, they rise to the occasion. And we also know the pandemic is transitory. We know vaccines work. We know that when we see markets, as governments just reduce restrictions, customers are back into our stores.  So, this is an opportunity for us to move now. We can't wait. This is the time to take that market share that we know we can take, and that market share gain is permanent. That market share gain will build long-term customer engagement, long-term customer loyalty, and that market share gain will also drive operating leverage in our stores. In addition to that, we also know that we have a combination of in-store productivity innovation that's going to help offset that.  We also have pricing power, and we're very thoughtful about how we take price. But we're taking price, and we will continue to take price in an inflationary environment. So, we just believe this is the absolute right thing to do at this moment in time, and this investment, like the other two that I just described, will return value to shareholders. Because of that, that's why we re-enforce our confidence with this $20 billion return to shareholders in the form of repurchases and buybacks. Thanks for your question. Okay. Let me have -- I'll have Rachel's comment is going to -- I want John Colbert to give you sort of perspective on where we're at the supply chain. Rachel. Since you raised coffee, John were 14 months price locked on coffee with several months of inventory in the warehouse. So, we're -- there's not a risk on top. Yeah. And if you think the question, I think clearly our growth at scale agenda identified as U.S. and China is our two lead markets and we're very happy with that agenda. I think China still has a significantly long runway of growth and you see this continue to expand and accelerate the number of new stores we're building in market that we all highlighted.  And so, we're very bullish on the long-term in China. U.S. continues to -- the cost growth that we're seeing and the opportunities we see to continue to grow the U.S. in terms of new stores and comp growth. Still very, very bullish on that as well. As we said, in December 2020, we're always evaluating markets and you saw that the Korea joint venture, we did sell our 50% stake to a long-term licensed partner and they -- who's been operating that market and will continue to operate that market.  We're always evaluating that. We're happy with where we are today. And I guess that's how -- that's what we said. When I think about U.S. and China, our two lead growth markets, I think we're very happy with where we are today, and we see long-term growth ahead of both of those markets. All right, John, let me take the first part of your question and then I'll hand to Rachel on the second part. Look, when it comes to pricing, we continue to be very thoughtful and very strategic in how we look at pricing and we're actually using machine learning and some of the Deep Brew technologies that inform our pricing team on where and how to take that price.  I prefer not to say, hey, here's the amount of price we've built into this plan, but I think we certainly have more upside in prices that we needed. But it is a dynamic thing because we're watching inflation and we really want to do this in a way that stays true to the thoughtfulness that we've always had in the past and part of this is how do you take, the right amount of price, the right time and not have customer attrition.  We're the share we want to grow share of customer occasions right now. And so, that's the balance that we strike, and it's really a fairly dynamic thing. So, for, us to -- we just -- I prefer not to say, here's what we built because I think we actually have more if we need it, we could take less if we don't need it. All I will say is that I know we've got a world-class pricing team backed up by world-class analytics and insight. And we are -- we were very good at this in fiscal '21 and we're going to be very good at it going forward. Rachel? Well, thank you. And now before we close, today's call, I want to take this opportunity to welcome Tiffany Willis to Starbucks as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. And I also want to congratulate Greg Smith on his new role, Leading Finance for our international channels business.  Tiffany brings great experience in Finance and IR for multiple industries including food and beverage, consumer products, and technology, and we look forward to introducing her to our investment community as she begins her journey to Starbucks with us. So, Tiffany, welcome. I also want to reiterate for all of you that consumer demand is strong. And this moment in time is an inflection point. It's an opportunity for Starbucks to invest ahead of the growth curve, and deliver long-term gains for all stakeholders.  I think with the strategic actions that we've made; we are well-positioned to grow share of customer occasions and dramatically strengthen engagement and loyalty for long-term sustainable growth. And with that, we look forward to walking all of you to our stores this holiday season, so that you can enjoy your seasonal favorites. And with that, have a great evening. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. And good afternoon, everyone. It's my privilege to share with you Starbucks' strong finish to fiscal 2021, our 50th year in business, delivering the highest full-year revenue, operating income, and EPS in Company history, an accomplishment that is truly special considering the profound challenges we have navigated throughout the pandemic. Please note that as Greg discussed at the top of the call, fiscal '21 results that I will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless noted, and on a 14-week basis for the quarter, and a 53-week basis for the year, except year-on-year revenue comp, operating margin, and EPS growth metrics, which will be on a 13-week or 52-week basis to exclude the impact of an extra fiscal week for comparative purposes.  In Q4, Starbucks global revenue reached 8.1 billion, up 22% from the prior year, setting another quarterly record along with a fiscal year record of $29.1 billion primarily driven by the continued momentum in the U.S. and strong contributions from across the globe, despite the severe headwinds of the COVID Delta variant, our consolidated operating margin was 19.6% in Q4 up by 580 basis points from the prior year, the increase was primarily driven by sales leverage across the P&L as we [Indiscernible] the COVID -19 impacts and related costs, as well as pricing in North America, this were partially offset by rapid inflation related to logistics, commodities, and labor costs across our supply chain. Q4 GAAP EPS was a $1.49 inclusive over $0.56 divestiture gain from the Starbucks Coffee Korea transaction. which yielded pre -tax proceeds of almost 1.2 billion.  Q4 non-GAAP EPS was a $1 capping off the Company's most profitable year ever with non-GAAP EPS of $3.24. I will now provide some segment highlights for Q4, and then we'll provide guidance for fiscal 2022. The North America segment, delivered revenue of 5.8 million in Q4, 27% higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 22% increase in comparable Starz Sales, including 18% comp transaction growth and a 3% increase in average ticket.  In the U.S., comparable store sales reached 22% in Q4, driven by transaction comp of 19%, delivering another sequential improvement in 2-year transaction comp in the face of COVID Delta variant disruption. Simultaneously, we maintained our strength in average ticket, up 3% over the prior-year in Q4, remaining near record levels and posting 2-year ticket comp of over 20% for the 6th consecutive quarter.  Cold beverages reached 75% of total sales in Q4, contributing to our ticket strength along with outstanding results from our fall promotion and another record quarter alluded tax. North America's operating margin was 22.5% in Q4, expanding 510 basis points from the prior year, driven by sales leverage as we lap the impacts of COVID, as well as continued strength in ticket, including pricing.  The segment's operating margin exceeded the pre -pandemic level in Q4 fiscal 2019 by a 170 basis points, primarily due to the leadership conference and labor our investments in Q4 fiscal 2019. Strong ticket, and the benefit of Trade Area Transformation also offset the margin headwind of approximately 270 basis points over the past few years from sizable investments in wage and benefits, as well as supply chain inflationary pressures. Moving on to international.  The international segment delivered record revenue of $1.9 billion in Q4, great 18% over the prior year. The growth was driven by an 8% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months, strong sales growth from our international licensees, as well as a 3% increase in comparable store sale. Both Company operated and licensed markets across our international portfolio are contributing meaningfully with double-digit sales growth in key markets like Japan, the U.K., Korea, and Mexico.  Kevin noted that the COVID related volatility drove comp sales down 7% in China in Q4. However, our experienced team and 22 years history continue to serve us well as operating income was only down 1% versus last year. Our team in China and across the globe has done a tremendous job of managing through the volatility. In fact, operating margins for the international segment was 22.8% in Q4, expanding 650 basis points from the prior year, well above pre -pandemic level, mainly driven by sales leverage as the segment continue to recover from the pandemic.  Higher government subsidies, Laughing Store asset impairments in the prior year, as well as store and overhead labor efficiencies also contributed to the expansion. We expect margin to settle a bit in fiscal '22 versus the levels of the past two quarters, as government subsidies are not expected to repeat, we have pressures relating to the impacts of inflation. The opportunity ahead, coupled with tremendous experience and a strong diversified portfolio, has us very optimistic for the future growth of China and our other international markets.  Onto Channel Development. Revenue was $438 million in Q4, a decline of 10% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business. When excluding the approximately 20% adverse impact of this transition-related activity, Channel Development's revenue increased by 10% in Q4, primarily driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance, as well as another international ready-to-drink business.  As a reminder, Q4 was the last quarter we will be lapping this transition so we expect Channel Development to return to more normalized reported revenue growth levels in fiscal 2022. The segment's operating margin was 50.2% in Q4 up 960 basis points from the prior year. Normalizing for the 890-basis points impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned. Channel development's operating margin expanded 70 basis points in Q4 driven primarily by lower trade spend in our International ready-to-drink business.  Now I will turn to our fiscal '22 outlook. For fiscal 2022, we are expecting global comp sales growth to reach high single-digits as we lapped prior year impacts of COVID and continue to build on our Q4 momentum. This also reflects our thoughtful pricing actions, which are expected to further bolster our comp growth as we work to offset the impact of inflation across our supply chain. New stores will also contribute meaningfully to our growth in fiscal 2022.  We expect to add approximately 2,000 net new stores globally in fiscal 2022, up significantly from 1,173 in fiscal 2021, as we successfully complete the closures under our North America Trade Area Transformation program, and are now refocusing on expansion. We estimate that approximately 75% of our net new stores will come from outside the U.S., as we continue to diversify our global portfolio across highly profitable markets.  This represents global net new store growth of 6%, returning to our ongoing growth model. With this powerful combination of global comp and store growth, coupled with the continued strength in our Channel Development segment, we are expecting consolidated revenue to range between $32.5 billion and $33 billion in fiscal 2022, growing well above our long-term guidance of 8% to 10% growth, setting us up for another year of record performance.  As Kevin mentioned, fiscal 2022 will be a pivotal year of investment, marked by increase in wage investments to further support our store partners in this critical moment, helping to ensure we have, one, the very best talent to drive our business forward and, two, the ability to continue capturing and maintaining meaningful category share gains.  Accelerating our growth in share is fuel for future margin expansion as sales leverage is one of the most meaningful expansion opportunities we have. So, while we will see an impact to operating margin in fiscal 2022 resulting from these investments, increasing our share of customers now will drive long-term earnings and value for all Starbucks stakeholders.  The success of Starbucks starts with our partners, and we are committed to continuing to invest in them as a critical strategic differentiator for our business. With these investments, we expect fiscal 2022 operating margin to be approximately 17% below our long-term target, driven by approximately 400 basis points of impact related to the wage investments, coupled with an additional headwind of approximately 200 basis points from a combination of inflationary pressures, other growth investments, and discontinuation of government subsidies.  Further, our fiscal 2022 margin expectation reflects factors unrelated to our core performance, with an approximately 40 basis points deluded impact from a combination of the Starbucks Korea transition, as well as the change in non-GAAP reporting treatment, both representing as one-time step down in margin.  However, we will meaningfully offset these margin impacts in fiscal year 2022 with benefits from pricing, leverage on our expected strong sales, and productivity gains. Importantly, given our continued proactive actions to continue to drive margin expansion and leverage accelerated sales growth, we expect our operating margin to return to the ongoing target of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2023. While fiscal 2022 margin represents a departure from our long-term growth algorithm.  We believe the value these strategic investments will create for our partners, our business, and all of our stakeholders will endure for many years to come. We are pleased that as we had previously committed, we successfully managed our leverage ratio back within our target at the end of fiscal 2021. As a result, we plan to reinstitute our share repurchase program beginning this quarter and are committed to returning $20 billion to shareholders, or approximately 15% of our current market capitalization over the next 3 years.  With this commitment, Starbucks will return to over $45 billion to shareholders since fiscal 2018, or approximately 35% of our current market capitalization, while simultaneously delivering on our algorithm for double-digit EPS growth at scale. Approximately 2/3 of this $20 billion will come in the form of share repurchases with the proceeds from the Korea transaction pushing fiscal 2022, repurchases a bit higher than the following two years. The remaining 1/3 will come through a very competitive dividend targeting an approximate 50% payout. To support this plan, we plan on issuing a moderate amount of incremental debt while retaining leverage below our target of 3 times rent adjusted EBITDA, consistent with our existing BBB+ rating. As a result, we expect interest expense to be between $490 million and $500 million in fiscal 2022 versus $470 million in fiscal 2021. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 are expected to total approximately 2 billion, up from 1.5 billion in fiscal 2021 and back to pre-Covid Levels, reflecting increases in new store development and technology initiatives in our stores.  As always, we plan to focus on Capital spending in fiscal 2022 on opportunities that drive significant returns across our global retail portfolio. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. This range translates to an EPS headwind of roughly 4% year-on-year and is meaningfully higher than the non-GAAP tax rate of 21.3% in fiscal 2021, which benefited from certain discrete tax benefits that are not expected to repeat to the same degree in fiscal 2022.  When you add it all up, on a 52-week comparative basis, we expect fiscal 2022 GAAP EPS to decline by 4% or less. We expect our fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS growth to be at least 10% from the base of $3.10 in fiscal 2021 that excludes the extra week and is adjusted for the change in non-GAAP treatment of certain integration costs. With the phased roll-outs of wage investments in the ongoing global recovery from COVID throughout the year, we expect fiscal 2022, quarterly non-GAAP EPS to be the lowest in Q2, before peaking in Q3 to form a strong back half of the year.  We recognize that this earnings guidance is a temporary change from the outlook discussed at our Investor Day in December 2020, driven by wage investments, as well as faster than expected recovery in fiscal 2021. We continue, however, to stand by our commitment to the growth algorithm over the longer term. The strategic investments in our partners are the right thing to do for our business and all of our stakeholders.  And we are confident this is providing the foundation necessary to continue to grow our coffee leadership position for many years to come. To summarize, here are the 3 key takeaways from my discussion today. First, we are thrilled with what we accomplished in fiscal 2021, far surpassing the pre -pandemic performance levels, to deliver record high revenue, operating income, and EPS, even as global consumer mobility remains suppressed, and inflationary headwinds pressure our business.  Second, fiscal 2022 will be a year of outsized investments, prioritizing our store partners, and ensuring we have the very best talent to drive, capture, and maintain lasting category share gains, while still delivering double-digit EPS growth, and initiating a return of $20 billion to our shareholders over the next 3 years. And finally, we remain fully committed to our ongoing growth model, and expect to progress towards our algorithm with an operating margin of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2023, while continuing to balance returns and investments necessary to sustain this performance over the long term.  Of course, all of this is made possible because of the significant efforts of our Starbucks partners around the world, who proudly wear the green apron. It is their unwavering commitment to our -- serving our customers that drive the financial results and outlook that I have shared today. With that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Colbert, Michael Conway, and Leo Tsoi. Thank you, Operator. Yes, thank you for the question. What I would say is, when we look at our margin that we're guiding for this year and we think about where we're headed to next year, as you know, there are over 640 basis points of dilution to our margin this year given the investments we're making, as well as some of the inflationary headwinds and changes as outlined in my prepared remarks.  We're going to work this year to offset the majority of that through pricing, through sales leverage, through productivity and other efficiency measures. As we move into FY'23, we'll continue those efforts, and that's going to allow us to return back to the 18% to 19% margin that we guided for the long term.  We feel confident in that given that our growth at scale agenda and our focus on pipeline of innovation, our ability to continue to grow our digital customer membership, and our ability to continue to accelerate the service experience through new stores and through the experience for creating in-stores, coupled with productivity and efficiency throughout our global network is really what allows us to continue on that path towards 18% to 19% margins in line with our long-term guidance. Sure. And to the second part, Andrew, what I would say is generally -- we're looking at about approximately 1% impact to EPS from the share repurchases, which is in line with our long-term guidance, slightly elevated this year just given that this year's repurchases will be a little bit higher than '23 and '24, given the impact of the proceeds from Korea but approximately 1% and that's provided in our guidance. Thank you. I will start with the perspective in terms of how we think about it within our guidance then I'll turn it over to John. He can speak more to the specifics. From a guidance stand point, as I talked about my prepared remarks, about 200 basis points of margin dilution related to a combination of the supply chain pressures, [Indiscernible] related to the supply chain pressures as well as our government subsidies from prior year investments. When we look at the past quarter Q4, we had about a 90-basis point impact from inflationary pressures across the globe.  And with the combination of logistics, labor, as well as commodities as we move into Q1 and Q2, we would expect that to increase, and then they'll start to settle in Q3 and Q4. But we've included it as part of our guidance throughout the year because you really don't know when these are going -- when these inflationary pressures will subside. In that point we've got some plans in this year. Of course, they could increase.  We don't know what's going to happen, but we feel confident we've got a reset-approach based on what we've seen in Q3 and Q4 this year, and we've accounted for that into next year. But it does impact us more meaningfully in Q1 and Q2 than what we would have originally thought. And then again settled in Q3 and Q4 from a margin perspective. And so, with that, I will turn it over to John for specifics. Sure, and Jon, what I would say is if you look at our non-GAAP EPS for FY21, the $3.24, from a baseline perspective, we're removing the additional week, so that's about $0.10. In addition to that, we have a change in our treatment of some non-GAAP reporting for purposes of integration costs related to acquisitions, that's another $0.04. So that combination of the $0.14 is what we're reducing this year's non-GAAP EPS of $3.24 down to an adjusted FY21 non-GAAP EPS of $3.10. And then we're encouraging a growth rate off of that baseline of at least 10%.  And again that 10% is, given the dynamic operating environment that we're in, this unprecedent level of investments that we're taking. as well as the pressures we still see related to the supply chain and the inflationary pressures, as well as the pressures we're seeing from the COVID vaccine -- from the COVID environment. We think the combination of that and the dynamic environment we're in and that at least 10% growth reflects a lot of confidence and optimism for where we're headed, even though it's quite a challenging environment ahead."

Well, good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. As we celebrate Starbucks\u2019 50th anniversary, we are reminded of the increasing premium on genuine human connection, which has always been at the heart of Starbucks. If there is any lesson we can take from this past year, it is that our promise to uplift every day through authentic human connections over coffee is enduring. It has never been more valuable and sought after. As humans, we belong together and Starbucks was built for this moment.  Now, with customer mobility increasing, we are at the beginning of what we describe as the great human reconnection. The reopening of markets is translating to incredible increases in demand for Starbucks as people are again on the go reconnecting and socializing with one another. Human connection is the very foundation of the Starbucks experience.  The differentiated experience we create for our customers strengthened through the actions we\u2019ve accelerated over the past year enables us to meet our customers wherever they need us to be. That experience is core to who we are at Starbucks and it drove significant momentum through Q3. That experience is also a direct reflection of the 400,000 Green Apron partners who continue to make every moment right.  It is our partners who deliver the elevated and uplifting experiences for each of the millions of customers we serve every day. Our partners make the difference. They are the heartbeat of Starbucks and for that, I am incredibly proud.  Now, let me take you through Q3, which is highlighted by record-breaking results, fueled by the continued strength of the Starbucks brand around the world. The impressive momentum Starbucks saw in Q2 accelerated through Q3, in which we delivered record revenue of $7.5 billion, up 78% year-on-year, and a record non-GAAP EPS of $1.01.  Additionally, two year comparable store sales improved sequentially led by an incredible overall performance in the U.S., as well as significant net new store growth in China, where we reached over 5,100 stores during the quarter and the double-digit growth and continued share gains that our channels business delivered in the At Home market. Our performance globally reflects the strength of our diverse portfolio and the benefits of scale, as we once again exceeded higher expectations for the quarter, despite inflationary pressures and ongoing pandemic-related restrictions in certain global markets. Our focus, combined with our unwavering commitment to innovating and elevating the Starbucks experience as our key differentiator has proven successful time and time again.  All of this gives us confidence to raise guidance for the balance of the year, and further positions the company for solid long-term growth. In the U.S., our momentum accelerated in Q3, posting year-on-year revenue growth of 90% and two year revenue growth of 16%. Comparable same-store sales grew 83% and importantly two year comp grew 10%. This is at the high end of our long-term annual comp growth target of 4% to 5%. We posted these results even with mobility restrictions still impacting some U.S. geographies with industry-wide pressure in pockets of the supply chain and with our in-store cafe seating not yet fully reopened.  Not only have we posted incredible results as we emerge from the pandemic, our internal research also confirms Starbucks has gained meaningful market share in the U.S., and the momentum we have created is sustainable.  In fact, Starbucks competitive share is the highest this year that has ever been in the away from home coffee and tea category. Simply put, our Green Apron partners are delivering an experience that customers are craving and the growing opportunities to serve our customers with the unmatched experience Starbucks offers gives us resounding confidence in the strength of the brand and the growth potential ahead. One powerful example of innovation that is fueling our momentum is our Beverage portfolio, which when coupled with our unparalleled ability for customizing handcrafted beverages, separates Starbucks from the competition. The investments we have made over the past few years, innovating and expanding our coffee-forward cold beverage platform continue to boost sales and draw new customers to Starbucks.  We continue to see strong demand for Starbucks Cold Brew, Nitro Cold Brew and Starbucks Refresher beverages while ice shaken espresso alone contributed more than a third of the iced espresso growth in the quarter. The cold category represented 74% of beverage sales in Q3, growing 10 percentage points over the past two years.  With the wide range of beverage options both cold and hot, our customers love personalizing their drinks. Over the last two years, we\u2019ve seen a meaningful increase in customizations such as adding Cold Foam or Shot of Espresso.  Additionally alternative dairy offerings represent nearly 25% of milk-related beverage sales, up from prior year. These innovative offerings in cold and alternative dairy are particularly attractive to millennial and Gen Z customers and are aligned with our focus on the well-being of people and the planet. With premium customization of beverages, coupled with operational improvements, the growth of both hot and cold beverages in stores is enabling margin expansion despite some continued inflationary pressures which Rachel will discuss in more detail.  In addition to beverage platform innovation, extending the in-store experience with digital customer relationships continues to extend our reach, deepen engagement and enhance the customer experience, further differentiating Starbucks and offering customers ever-increasing choice as to how they engage with the brand.  We again added over 1 million new active Starbucks Rewards members in the quarter, with over 24 million active members now representing 51% of all spend in our U.S. stores and up 8 percentage points over pre-pandemic levels, our ability to engage has never been higher.  More and more of these customers are embracing experiences that effortlessly fit their lifestyle with drive-thru representing 47% of transactions and mobile ordering for in-store pickup delivery or curbside at 26% of transactions. We are leveraging all channels to better serve our customers. While it is very clear that our Rewards program has accelerated our recovery in a meaningful way, where Q3 really stands out and what adds to our confidence is the acceleration we saw in our non-rewards customers. While rewards spend grew at a rapid mid-teens rate quarter-over-quarter, for the first time in 11 quarters non-rewards spend growth outpaced SR spend.  This is further evidence of the great human reconnection. The rapid reengagement of non-rewards customers not only propelled our record results, but also underscores the strength of the brand and the growth potential ahead. And finally, we continue to make meaningful progress to reposition our U.S. store portfolio through trade area transformation, which is now nearly 80% complete. In the past twelve months, we\u2019ve opened 554 new stores combined with in-store seating and drive through service.  This portfolio repositioning and new store formats have increased drive-thru performance to 75% of our total U.S. sales. A number that continues to rise as we increase efficiency. The improvements and additions, we are making to our portfolio today will provide benefits for years to come.  With our focus on the customer experience, new beverage innovation and digital customer relationships, we continue to increase share of customer occasions, while also contributing to a rapidly growing market for all things coffee. Moving on to China where we posted a very positive result with year-on-year revenue growth of 45%. Remarkably, total revenue in China has grown 23% in just two years as we continue to play the long game and we are on track to open more than 600 net new stores this fiscal year. In Q3 alone, we opened 162 net new stores that continued to deliver best-in-class new store profitability and returns.  We ended the quarter with 5,135 stores and we are well on track to operate over 6,000 stores by the end of fiscal year 2022. In addition, we posted 19% same-store comp growth in Q3 and saw sequential acceleration of our two-year comp when excluding the impact of value-added tax.  Furthermore, we gained strong momentum with sequential improvement on every key metric on a two-year basis including total revenue growth, store traffic recovery and margin expansion. The health of our business in China is strong and we\u2019ve never been more confident in the long-term growth opportunity.  In addition to significant new store growth and sequential acceleration of two-year comps in China, we are expanding digital customer relationships and engagement by creating new occasions and experiences that make mobile ordering even more convenient and personalized. This has resonated strongly with our customers in China propelling mobile ordering to 34% of sales, significantly higher than the 23% in the prior year and more than double pre-COVID levels.  Starbucks Rewards continues to aggressively expand our digital ecosystem across major platforms, driving 90-day active members to an all-time high of $17 million, a 4% increase over previous quarter and a 71% increase versus prior year. Gold members, a very important cohort are engaging Starbucks at pre-pandemic levels. Our performance in China is a testimony to the unparalleled strength of the Starbucks brand and our enduring relationship with our Chinese customers. Our rapidly growing store footprint, market-leading digital ecosystem and customer engagement, robust innovation pipeline and the enduring love and loyalty for the Starbucks brand in China are all unmatched.  I have full confidence in the strength of the Starbucks brand in China and across all our international markets. There should be no misunderstanding of how big and robust our business China is and will be. These are still early days and our strategies are clearly working. Starbucks is uniquely positioned for success in China well into the future. With phenomenal strength and growing momentum in our retail business, let me now move on to our Channel Development segment that also continues to exceed expectations. Over the past three years, we have made significant progress expanding our reach and amplifying the Starbucks brand through CPG, single-serve coffee, ready-to-drink and foodservice.  I attribute our success to the power of the Starbucks brand, the bold innovation that attracts new coffee lovers into our categories and the caliber of our strategic business partners globally. In Q3, Starbucks retained our number one brand position in total U.S. At Home Coffee and further expanded our leadership position versus other brands.  The Starbucks brand continued to increase share in the total U.S. category, impressively adding 1 percentage point over the prior year, despite lapping a strong comp. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle is a powerhouse and we continue to see strong performance across all aspects of the key strategic relationship. Earlier this year, building on the success of the Starbucks by Nespresso platform, we expanded and introduced Starbucks by Nespresso on the virtual line, which is already exceeding six month distribution and velocity targets.  In addition, the combination of strong CPG performance combined with a steady recovery in foodservice gives us added confidence. In ready-to-drink, Starbucks is the number one premium brand globally with our North American coffee partnership with PepsiCo growing 19% in consumption and our International ready-to-drink business growing double-digits in EMEA and China, Asia Pacific.  These channels amplify our brand in more than 80 markets around the world offering millions of customers At Home and At Work options that complement their Starbucks in-store experience. And just yesterday, we announced plans to reach new markets and grow our Starbucks ready-to-drink portfolio with Nestle, who will now serve markets across Southeast Asia and Latin America.  Our channel development strategy to amplify the brand, while growing share of At Home occasions continues to attract new customers to Starbucks with unparalleled choice, while driving best-in-class returns. The key take-away from today\u2019s call is this: we look to the future with as much conviction as ever in our strategy. As this quarter represents the beginning of a multi-year tailwind for Starbucks, that is powered by three factors. First, the total coffee addressable market is large and growing rapidly. The market is expected to grow to well over $400 billion in size globally over the next three years.  That represents a compound annual growth rate of 8% to 9%, as the market rapidly recovers from the global pandemic. Second, within this large and growing market, consumer preferences continue to shift from mainstream Robusta coffee to premium Arabica coffee, where Starbucks is the leader.  Third, and perhaps most important, Starbucks has rapidly adapted to new consumer behaviors and strengthened key points of differentiation. Our focus on the customer experience, relevant new beverage platforms and expanded digital customer relationships are translating to increased consumer preference and deeper customer engagement.  The combination of a highly differentiated brand experience, a continued consumer shift to premium Arabica coffee and a large and growing addressable market is a powerful trifecta that provides our business with a multi-year tailwind. These factors reinforced by the results of this past quarter, give us confidence that this is just the beginning of what is about to unfold. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rachel, who will walk you through details of our Q3 results. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri : Thank you, Kevin and good afternoon everyone. I am thrilled to share with you the results of this milestone quarter, delivering record revenue and record non-GAAP EPS only four quarters after the depth of the pandemic.  Over the past year, we have proven our ability to differentiate ourselves to the unique and personalized experiences we create for Starbucks customers, whether in our stores, through our app, or down the grocery aisle, leading to this quarter\u2019s impressive results.  Starbucks global revenue reached $7.5 billion in Q3, up 78% from the prior year, far surpassing the pre-pandemic quarterly record set in Q1 fiscal 2020, driven largely by the incredible performance in the U.S., our largest market. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $1.01 up from the loss of $0.46 in the prior year driven by faster than expected margin recovery in the Americas due to sales leverage from lapping prior year COVID-19 impacts and the benefit from continued strength in average ticket.  Our Q3 EPS includes $0.09 of benefit related to discrete tax items, most of which was originally anticipated in Q4 as referenced on our previous earnings call. The investments we have made in our business have made Starbucks stronger, more resilient, and positions for long-term growth. This powerful momentum, gives us the confidence to meaningfully raise our EPS outlook for the full year as I will explain later. I will now take you through our Q3 fiscal 2021 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. Our Americas segment, which fueled our record quarter, delivered revenue of $5.4 billion in Q3, 92% higher than the prior year, primarily driven by an 84% increase in comparable store sales including 82% comp transaction growth.  As Kevin mentioned, U.S. comparable store sales growth reached 83% in Q3, driven by a material improvement in transaction comp of 88%. Average store transactions continued to grow and ended the quarter at nearly 90% of pre-pandemic levels presenting further opportunity to return to and grow beyond FY 2019 levels.  As transactions have grown, we\u2019ve maintained the strength in average ticket of 1% over the prior year, remaining significantly elevated as many key post-pandemic consumer trends have continued. Growth in cold beverages and customization, coupled with sustained strong beverage attach and record food attach in Q3, all contributed to the strong ticket and gives us confidence in our ability to maintain a meaningful portion of the ticket gains over the coming quarters. Americas\u2019 Q3 non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 24.7%, up more than 200 basis points from Q3 of fiscal 2019, largely driven by sales leverage on our product and distribution costs including waste favorability, the benefits of SKU rationalization over the prior two years and favorable sales mix shift.  Pricing and the benefits of trade area transformation also helped offset the sizable investments in wages and benefits, as well as higher supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures. While we are thrilled with our margin performance in Q3, we expect it to moderate slightly in Q4, primarily due to the growing impact of inflation, coupled with incremental investments critical to our continued growth, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Moving on to International. The International segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q3, excluding a 10% favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the segment\u2019s revenue grew 65% over the prior year, reflecting a 41% increase in comparable store sales inclusive of a 5% adverse impact from lapping the prior year VAT benefit.  Strong sales growth from our International licensees, as well as 8% net new store growth over the prior \u2013 over the past 12 months also contributed to this growth. Kevin spoke to our performance in China. In addition, the International segment performance was adversely impacted by virus resurgences in Japan with a state of emergency severely limiting consumer traffic during most of the quarter. It\u2019s important to remember that the vast majority of International markets in which we operate are behind the U.S. in terms of both vaccination and mobility.  So revenue recovery is predictably lagging in those markets. Still, our partners in every market remained focused on what they can control and what they do best, the moments of connection they are providing our customers during these challenging times will support growth as vaccination rates improve. International\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin rose to 22.5% from minus 2.7% in the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage from lapping the impacts of COVID-19, as well as store labor efficiencies across our company-operated markets and larger government subsidies.  On a two-year basis, these temporary subsidies provide an approximately 200 basis point benefit in the quarter, boosting the segment\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin close to its pre-pandemic level of 22.7% in Q3 fiscal 2019. On to Channel Development, revenue was $414 million in Q3, a decline of 7% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business.  When excluding the approximately 20% adverse impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development\u2019s revenue increased by 13% in Q3, mainly driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance product sales and our ready-to-drink business. This segment\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 46.7% in Q3 from 35.6% in the prior year.  Normalizing for the 700 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development\u2019s operating margin expanded 410 basis points in Q3, driven primarily by the strength of our ready-to-drink business. We expect the impacts from the transition to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2021. Finally, at the consolidated level, our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5% in Q3, up from minus 12.6% in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in our operating margin for Q3 was primarily driven by sales leverage across the P&L, as we lapped COVID-19 impacts and related costs, as well as pricing in the Americas.  These were partially offset by additional investments in retail store partner wages and benefits, which remain a strategic priority for us to support our world-class partners. Given the strength of our performance in Q3 and the optimism we have for the fourth quarter, we are pleased to update our guidance across a number of key areas. We expect the momentum we have seen in the U.S., underpinned by the ongoing great human reconnection to continue and as a result, we expect both Americas and U.S. comparable store sales growth in Q4 in the range of 22% to 25%.  This corresponds to a two-year comp range for Q4 of 11% to 13%, reflecting further sequential improvement from an already strong level of 9% in the Americas in Q3. As a reminder, the two-year comps we are monitoring are calculated on a multiplicative basis instead of an additive basis as described in today\u2019s earnings release. For the International segment, where sporadic virus resurgences continue to impair consumer mobility in some markets, we now expect comparable store sales to grow mid-to-high single-digits in Q4. For China, we expect comparable store sales to be roughly flat in Q4.  Similar to the Americas, these ranges for both International and China translate to a meaningful sequential improvement in two-year comp from Q3 to Q4, despite the challenging market dynamics expected to linger in Q4.  Based on the outlook for this segment, we now expect Q4 consolidated comp growth in the range of 18% to 21%. On a two-year basis, this equates to a range of 7% to 10%, a considerable sequential increase from the Q3 two-year comp of 4%. Moving on to retail store development, although we expect approximately 1,100 net new stores globally in fiscal 2021, we now anticipate a slight shift between our segments. For the Americas, we now expect the total store count in fiscal 2021 to remain roughly flat to prior year as the new store openings are virtually offset by higher than normal closures, reflecting the continued progress of our accelerated trade area transformation initiatives.  For International, net new stores for fiscal 2021 are expected to increase to approximately 1,100 from 1,050 in the original guidance. With the updated comp sales and the store growth outlook, we are also tightening our guidance for full year fiscal 2021 consolidated revenue to a new range of $29.1 billion to $29.3 billion from $28.5 billion to $29.3 billion.  This includes Channel Development\u2019s revenue, which is now expected in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for full year fiscal 2021, compared to the previous guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, reflecting this segment\u2019s strong performance to-date. As a reminder, our fiscal 2021 consolidated revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately $0.5 billion for the 53rd week. Additionally, given the faster than expected margin recovery to-date, we are raising our consolidated GAAP operating margin outlook for the full year to approximately 17%, up from the previous range of 15% to 16%. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to reach approximately 18% in fiscal 2021, up from the previous guidance of 16.5% to 17.5%, reflecting the momentum we saw in Q3 and expect in Q4.  Our operating margin is tempered a bit by two factors that we see growing in relevance in Q4 and into fiscal 2022. The first is our latest view on rising global inflation requiring continued incremental investments to support our growth.  The second is our strong commitment to increasing wages of our store partners, making deliberate investments towards an hourly wage for $15 in the U.S. in line with the announcement we made in November of last year.  As Kevin mentioned our Green Apron partners are fundamental to the Starbucks experience and are critical to our long-term of success. These important wage increases, coupled with continued investment in digital initiatives and operational efficiencies will further solidify the foundation for our next stage of growth. Given the accelerated timing of certain discrete tax benefits in Q3 I noted earlier, which were originally anticipated in Q4, we now forecast our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase to the low 20% from our previous outlook of high teens. For fiscal 2021, our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates are expected in the low 20% range, revised from the previous guidance of low-to-mid 20%. Summing this all up, driven by the tremendous momentum we\u2019ve seen as customers return to our stores propelling our record results in Q3, we are raising our full year fiscal 2021 EPS guidance. Our new fiscal 2021 GAAP EPS guidance range is $2.97 to $3.02, up from $2.65 to $2.75 previously. Our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.25, up from our prior range of $2.90 to $3.00.  This predominantly reflects our better-than expected performance to-date, as well as the improved outlook for Q4, barring any new significant and sustained waves of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. As a reminder, our fiscal 2021 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges include approximately $0.10 of benefit for the 53rd week. Consistent with our past practice, we will provide guidance for fiscal 2022 on our Q4 earnings call. However, I should note that the earlier than expected margin recovery we saw in Q3 and expect in Q4 was not contemplated when we provided our fiscal 2022 EPS growth outlook at our December Investor Day.  We are pleased with the strength of our business and we\u2019ll provide our FY 2022 outlook during our Q4 call. Importantly, our ongoing commitment to the double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth at scale remains strongly intact. To summarize, Q3 performance exceeded our expectations with record revenue and earnings,, underscoring the resilience and power of our brand, which remains as relevant as ever. While temporary marketplace dynamics will impact our business until the global pandemic is behind us, the enduring strength of the Starbucks experience, fueled by our incredible partners around the globe remains intact thriving in this moment of human reconnection and continuing to guide our long-term growth.  As always, the credit for our success this quarter and in the future belongs to our Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the Green Apron. They have our greatest respect and appreciation. And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver; Michael Conway and Belinda Wong. Thank you. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \nJeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. A question specifically on the China market. Kevin, I know you mentioned you are never been confident with that said I think everyone would agree it\u2019s a very volatile market, whether you think about it politically, or consumer-wise. Obviously, competition is intense and we know it is your highest growth market for Starbucks and clearly a 100% company operated.  So, a major market player. With that said, the third quarter comp shortfall and seemingly significant reduction in the fiscal 2021 guidance, I was wondering whether you are concerned at all by that. It sounds like from your commentary not so much. I was wondering maybe you can give some color or Belinda perhaps in terms of what you attribute to the slowdown?  What you expect to continue that whether maybe China sitting of uptake or whether I know some people are fearful that there is consumer pushback on certain U.S. brands. Just trying to get a sense for what\u2019s changed of late in the China market and yet still confidence is quite high longer term. Thank you. \nKevin Johnson: Yes. Jeffery, thanks for the question. Let me share some thoughts and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Belinda to comment a bit further. Jeffery, we\u2019ve been in China now for over twenty years. And every step of the way we have built Starbucks in China for China. And the brand resonates with our customers in China.  So, I think that\u2019s number one. Number two, we are in a market building mode right now. Most of our growth comes from the new stores that we open and the fact that the new stores that we have been opening are performing at some of the highest AUV levels prior generations gives us confidence that we are continuing to expand our reach and presence in China. I think those two things. Certainly, from a geopolitical standpoint, we\u2019ve got businesses in 84 markets around the world. So we constantly deal with geopolitical situations and I\u2019d say, there is not a geopolitical situation that has really impacted us in China over the last couple of years and I don\u2019t really foresee that happening as long as we continue to stay focused on what we do and what we do well, which has created great experience for our customers in China. Take care of our Starbucks partners who proudly wear the Green Apron in China.  And we are bullish. We continue to invest, whether it\u2019s the investment we are making in new stores, whether it\u2019s the coffee innovation park, the first sustainable roasting plant that we are building in China, the work we are doing with coffee farmers in Yunnan and I\u2019d sort of look at the \u2013 this navigating the \u2013 some of the implications of COVID as just being short-term.  And so, that\u2019s why I kind of look at it as a very \u2013 from a very bullish perspective long-term. So let me hand it over to Belinda. Belinda, I\u2019ll let you comment a bit further on Jeffery\u2019s question. \nBelinda Wong: Thank you, Kevin. We achieved 19% comp in Q3 with slight COVID resurgence in the south. Now, if you exclude the adverse impacts from lapping prior year VAT exemption benefit outcome grew actually 24% in the quarter.  Our previous comp guidance has assumed a shorter timeframe for the lifting of travel restrictions and also less of the uncertainties that we have faced in the markets. And hence, we are adjusting our comp guidance to reflect the uncertainties.  Now, make no mistakes that the short-term volatilities that we are facing today are only temporary. The recovery as we always said will continue to be non-linear. Now one point that you have to fully realize is that, we have fully regained our pre-COVID pace of store developments and Kevin talked about the achievements that we have achieved in Q3 and we are well on track to open more than 600 net new stores this fiscal year and operate 6,000 stores by the next fiscal year.  And on top of that, yes, we are delivering best-in-class store profitability and returns. We are meeting the year one new store performance guidance that we provided during last Investor Day and please note that our focus in the past decade has always been about total revenue growth and reaching new customers for them to trial the Starbucks experience and coffee in China markets.  A majority of our total revenue growth and close to 70% of that comes from new stores. This huge runway for growth in China due to growing coffee consumption and the addressable markets. Rising middle-class population and disposable income. So we are still in very early chapters of our growth story here in this market.  My personal on the ground experience and what I see here in the market gives me full confidence in the resiliency and the dynamism of the Chinese consumer economy. No other F&B retailer or specialty coffee brands present our speed, quality, coverage of our national footprint, our market-leading digital ecosystem and customer engagement, our robust innovation pipeline and the strength of our brand, these are all unmatched in China and we are well positioned than ever to continue to win in this market. We will focus on what we can control.  Our strategies are clearly working. So, we are playing the long game here and ready and excited to capture the efficient growth opportunities once the international travel restrictions are lifted and the pandemic is behind us. Thank you. \nKevin Johnson: Thank you, Belinda. I think, Rachel had one other comment, Jeffery to your question. \nRachel Ruggeri: Yes. Thank you. I just want to reiterate two quick points, one of which is, our double-digit EPS growth at scale that we\u2019ve committed to, as you know is one of the key building blocks to that is our unit growth, as well as our comp growth. And so, unit growth in China continues to be important not only for this year, but for our long-term equation.  The other thing that I would point out is the guidance that we gave for Q4 on comp for international and China, it implies a sequential improvement on a two year basis from Q3 to Q4. But I think it\u2019s important to show that we are continuing to be optimistic in showing continued momentum in the business for the remainder of this fiscal year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your question. \nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about margins and I think at the Analyst Day back in December, you laid out an outlook for long-term operating margins in the 18% to 19% range and now this quarter that you just reported very comfortably above that.  So, I wanted to ask, Rachel, if you had an updated view on what the right profile for the business should be as we think about looking forward and how you sort of factor in some of the investments that you talked about earlier? \nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. The way I\u2019d think about it is, let me preempt a little bit of context is, in Q3, our margin was incredible. I mean, from a standpoint of both \u2013 across all of our markets, we saw margin expansion versus prior year and even against FY 2019. And a big driver of that was our sales leverage, as well as comping over COVID impacts broadly, pricing.  But it did help to offset some accelerated investments we\u2019ve made in wage as well as inflationary pressures. We think about Q4, we would expect as we guided, we guided our margin to increase from 16.5% to 17.5% going to 18% for the balance of the year. So this shows our optimism and the continued momentum in the business.  But what caution us there is a slightly lower relative to the performance we saw in Q3 based on increasing cost that we see related to inflation as well as the continued investments that we need to make in our business. Those investments were critical to our recovery, but they are more important even foundationally for our growth.  And so, as we think about FY 2022, we are not going to provide guidance for FY 2022 today. That will be on our Q4 call. Give us time to complete our annual operating plan which we are in the process of right now. But if you think about that, some of what we guided at Investor Day from that growth in FY 2022 has been pulled forward into FY 2021.  But I want to be clear that we remain committed to double-digit EPS, non-GAAP EPS growth. So we are committed to that. When you think about that margin that we laid out at Investor Day, that 18% to 19%, that was up from 17% to 18% that we had guided previously. That accounted for the benefit that we are seeing from the investments we are making.  So just again reiterates the importance of those investments. And so, when we think about that guidance at Investor Day, what it allows us to do is modestly expand margin while continuing to invest. And again, we\u2019ll provide further guidance on FY 2022 at our Q4 call. But that\u2019s how I put it into perspective. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. \nJohn Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. It\u2019s actually an average ticket question both for the U.S. and for China. I mean, I think it probably would have been a rational expectation to think lapping a 27% ticket from the second quarter, excuse me, the third quarter of 2020 would have basically been a possible and yet you were able to do that for all the reasons that you pointed out.  Yet, I would have thought as people came back in the morning and migrated more toward single order transactions, just by definition that would have fallen. So, could you - you kind of give some more color around maintaining that average ticket.  I think there was a comment made in the prepared remarks about - excuse me - about maintaining a significant portion of that pricing. But whether in fact it can be 100% of the ticket lift that you got over the past five quarters or so. And secondly, China was the inverse of that, even if I adjust for the VAT benefit from the previous year the ticket was actually down in China, which isn\u2019t very common especially in an inflationary environment.  If you could talk about the China ticket as well and for both businesses just your attitude on overall menu pricing, given what is your inflationary cost pressures that\u2019s something that consumer may expect as well as higher pricing, whether that\u2019s something that may accelerate, as well on the menu for both businesses? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson : John, thanks for your question. We\u2019ll have John Culver take the U.S. and then Belinda can take China and Rachel, you can add any additional. So John?\nJohn Culver : John, appreciate the question. It\u2019s a great question. Let me give you a little context. We continue to see strong sales recovery in the rural and suburban areas of the business and in particular drive-thru where drive-thrus are most common. That is helping us to drive larger orders and a higher ticket. We saw record ticket in the quarter from an overall U.S. perspective.  Now we are also at the same time as the customers become more mobile and start coming back into the central business districts in the urban core, we did achieve a positive comp for the first time in that trade area since Q1 of FY 2020, which gives us even more optimism for the future recovery of the business.  Now, as that recovers in the central business district and urban and core, what we do expect is that the customers will begin frequenting those stores in those areas and as part of that, transactions will increase, but ticket will moderately decrease and it will balance itself out over time. We see great opportunity to continue to drive transactions in our stores right now, broadly across the U.S.\u2019s business.  We are operating at about 90% of pre-COVID transaction levels. So we\u2019ve got a lot of room to go to grow back to a more normalized rate pre-pandemic-wise as it relates to transactions. And as we do that, we do expect that ticket to moderately decline during that time.\nKevin Johnson : Belinda, do you want to take China?\nBelinda Wong : Hi, my turn right, Kevin?\nKevin Johnson : Yes?\nBelinda Wong : China. Okay, great. Q3, 9%, 80 drop, but majority of that 6% is really from what you just said, John, on the 6% VAT lapse. So, the 80 drop is really just a negative 3%. So, one thing that you have to note is that we are seeing the acceleration of our digital mobile ordering sales mix. The delivery portion of it. We\u2019re seeing great uplift on our 80 versus the store transaction.  So, that is a good thing. So - and in terms of your question on the inflationary pressure, it does exist, but to a much lesser extent comparing to the U.S. and in this fiscal year, we\u2019re able to net of any increases by our own operational inefficiencies or any savings that we were able to achieve due to our volume increase. So, thank you.\nRachel Ruggeri : I just want to add a little further clarification around that. I mean, both good points from Belinda and John. What I would say is, broadly in the U.S. part of the function of our comp and our ticket going to 1% is just our year-over-year lap.  Our actual ticket continues to be at one of our highest levels and it\u2019s our third consecutive quarter and we continue to see, as John mentioned, as we see more single beverage transactions, we expect our ticket to moderate, but we do believe that our ticket will remain elevated, slightly elevated compared to where \u2013 from a pre-pandemic level.  And drivers of that are the attach that John spoke about as well as the continued attach we see in food; our ability to continue to move customers to our cold beverages, which have a more premium price, in addition to our promotion offerings and our customization. Those are other ways that we are further evolving our ticket across the U.S. and Americas space. And what I want to just point out is that the margin that we are guiding to for the balance of the year increasing to 18%, again up from the 16.5% to 17% on a - 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis that we previously guided.  Part of that growth is really coming from an elevated ticket. It\u2019s not the only thing, but it\u2019s one of many and it continues to be one of many levers to help us support not only inflationary pressures and the headwinds that we have from that, but the continued investments that we need to make in our business. So it continues to be a critical part of our equation and it\u2019s reflected in the guidance that we\u2019ve provided.\nKevin Johnson : And let me just sort of close, I know there has been a lot on the \u2013 written in the press about the cold weather that\u2019s hit Brazil and the implications on the C price of coffee. And so, just to give you some context, on the increasing C price of coffee, you should know that over the years, we have created a very thoughtful approach to how we source, warehouse and use hedging techniques to ensure we always have supply of premium Arabica green coffee at an attractive cost basis.  In fact, we purchase green coffee 12 to 18 months in advance and we never stopped buying green coffee through the pandemic. So as a result, we currently have over 14 months of price-forward coverage, which means we have price locked on our coverage for the next 14 months, which gets us through the rest of fiscal year 2021 and most of fiscal year 2022.  And I think we may be the only large buyer of green coffee that uses this approach and that will serve us well, as it gives us a significant advantage relative to our competitors, who if they don\u2019t buy this far in advance will certainly not have that cost structure that we put in place. And so, I just want to comment on that since it\u2019s been in the press and kind of relates to your question, John, on inflation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Glass : Great. Thanks very much. My question, Rachel, and maybe others, it\u2019s just on what is the aggregate amount of inflation you are actually facing in your P&L. I know you talk about inflationary pressures, but some companies talk about the aggregate inflation, some you can talk about wages. Is there inflation coming in the supply chain? Is there a way to quantify that? And how do you think about pricing in that context?  Are you willing to take an unusual amount of pricing relative to history to offset that or do you find there is other places in the P&L I mean, that\u2019s notable that some of your peers are taking significant amounts of pricing now. They feel like they have that power. I always thought Starbucks had that power, maybe use it more judiciously, but is your frame up how you think about pricing changing because of this environment?\nRachel Ruggeri : Yes. I think I\u2019d start first with the inflationary pressures that we saw. So, in Q3, we had outstanding performance, but within that, we covered headwinds in the Americas business of about 70 basis points. And we expect headwinds related to rising cost and inflationary pressures to continue into Q4, which is reflected in the guidance that we\u2019ve given.  Now, some of the ways that we not only offset headwinds such as inflation, but also the investments we are making are price. And we\u2019ve always been very thoughtful and measured in the pricing actions we take, so that we don\u2019t inhibit growth. And I would say our spread \u2014 our pricing strategy hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed. We are very surgical in nature.  We look on a store-by-store basis and we leverage analytics and insights and importantly what our analytics and insights show is that we do have pricing power and we see that in the premiumization of our beverages, the gravitation towards our promotional offerings and this is our opportunity to be able to leverage price in those ways, which is one of the reasons why we talk about our ticket continuing to stay elevated, not at the rate that we have today, but a slightly elevated.  But pricing will be one as many levers that we use to offset these headwinds. For example, we will continue to drive customization with our customers, continue to drive our customers to our cold beverage offerings where we have a more premium nature, continue to drive a beverage and food attach when and where possible. Those are ways to continue have an elevated ticket.  So through pricing and elevated ticket we will also continue to look at efficiencies in our supply chain, as well as efficiencies in G&A. So this particular quarter, we saw our G&A returning to pre-pandemic levels and we\u2019ll continue to find efficiencies in G&A over time with our goal to be able to grow G&A less than our revenue growth as another way. In addition to that, we are seeing benefit from trade area transformation. Our trade area transformation in the Americas and more broadly in the segment delivered almost 80 basis points on margin. That\u2019s meaningful and so we continue as we\u2019ve optimized that portfolio that\u2019s yet another lever that we are using to help offset not only headwinds related to inflation, but also the investments that we know we need to make that are critical to our growth in the future.  And those are investments both in wages for our partners, as well as investments in our service experience and our throughput, as well as investments in digital initiatives. All those are critical for our growth in the future and really are fueling our - not only our recovery but will fuel the growth for years to come. So those are important investments for us broadly and those are the ways we think about how we\u2019ll offset those increasing costs while still modestly expanding margins.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nSharon Zackfia : Hi, good afternoon. Rachel, I appreciate you are not kind of re-doing the Analyst Day guidance. But I did want to ask a question about development, because I think at the Analyst Day, you had committed to kind of reaccelerate into 6% to 7% unit growth in fiscal 2022. I wondered if that still held? And what the pushes and pulls are there, particularly given the labor environment?\nRachel Ruggeri : We continue to see unit growth as a meaningful driver of our double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. So we\u2019ll remain committed to expanding stores both in our international markets, in our company-owned markets or licensed and company-owned. So that will be a continued driver of our growth even with the pressures that we are seeing in labor.  And today, we\u2019ve, as Belinda mentioned, we are on track to open more than 600 stores in China. We\u2019ve opened plus 500 stores in the Americas segment and broadly we\u2019re going to open a net - 1,100 net new stores this fiscal year. So, still continuing to have meaningful growth in our stores not only this year but into next year. Now the details of what that growth will look like, again, we\u2019ll have to come in Q4 when we provide in our Q4 earnings update when we provide more detailed guidance on FY 2022. But you can expect our unit growth continuing to be not only a driver of our earnings, but also as a critical part of our growth in the future.\nKevin Johnson : Yes, Sharon, this is Kevin. I\u2019ll just remind you. I commented in my remarks that we are 80% through the Americas Trade Area Transformation, which is - as we get into fiscal year 2022, that puts us back on the front foot for net new store growth in North America and certainly Belinda and her team in China have already gotten there. So, that\u2019s going to be very helpful as we go into FY 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Carril: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. So, Kevin, I wanted to follow-up on your comments around non-rewards spend outpacing reward spend. I think you noted for the first time in eleven quarters. Do you expect that to persist in the near-term? Or would you expect that relationship to shift back to where you had seen recently as mobility and routines further normalize?  And then, on the elevated non-reward spend, are you also seeing increasing conversion of those non-rewards of guests to rewards members? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson : Yes. Thanks, Chris. I mean, that\u2019s the key point. You look at the fact that we\u2019ve grown our active \u2013 90-day active Starbucks Rewards Members significantly to over $24 million and where are we getting those active rewards members, they are coming from the non-rewards customers that return into our stores. So, I actually think the increase in non-rewards customers is going to be very helpful to continue to fuel that base of active rewards members.  We know that customers when they join Starbucks Rewards they spend more. There is more frequency and more engagement from those customers and that\u2019s why you think over a multi-year period, we have this aspiration to double the number of active rewards members in North America. John, let me - I\u2019ll let you comment a bit further if you have anything else to add on the U.S.\nJohn Culver : Yes. Chris, the one thing I would add to what Kevin is saying is the success of The Stars for Everyone program that we launched little over three quarters ago. It makes it easier for people to join the Starbucks Rewards program. It enables customers to make purchases by adding alternative payment options in addition to utilizing store value.  And really what we\u2019re seeing there is that it helped to drive the 49% increase that we are seeing year-over-year in membership across broadly the Starbucks Reward program. To put that into context, we have added nearly 5 million, 90-day active members since the beginning of this fiscal year and what this has done is, driven a meaningful increase in the conversion rate for those who joined the Starbucks Rewards program.  And really while we are not seen a material shift from customers leaving the store value program to alternate payment methods, the vast majority of the customers who use these alternative payment methods are new or reengaged members that we\u2019re tracking back into the program. So, going forward, we are going to continue to double down on both our rewards members, as well as our non-rewards members. We see that is as being highly accretive to driving frequency, as well as spend and we see this as being one of the biggest opportunities we have for the long-term program growth in attracting those occasional customers into our stores.\nRachel Ruggeri : If I could add just one thing to that, what I would add is that, what we see is, we\u2019ve raised our Q4 guidance for - if you look at the guidance we\u2019ve given for Americas and U.S. in Q4, it implies that we are going to improve on a two-year basis on our comp from Q3 into Q4.  And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that\u2019s implying about 11% to a 13% two year comp growth, which is above the 9% we saw in Americas this quarter on a two-year basis and above the 10% we saw in U.S.  The driver of that is really the fact that, in this quarter we saw our customer accounts, overall customer accounts in line with pre-pandemic levels FY 2019, but where we have opportunity is frequency. And so, that frequency is really what helps support our optimism and aligns with the guidance that we\u2019ve provided in Q4.\nOperator: Your next question will be from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nDennis Geiger : Great. Thanks for the question. And I am wondering if you could talk a bit about how important throughput and operations have been most recently in driving sales? And I am curious sort of on some of the operational adjustments that you\u2019ve made within the U.S. in the new service channels that you\u2019ve launched in recent quarters.  Where do you stand right now from a sort of a drive-thru throughput perspective? What curbside is doing right now? And then, maybe just to kind of look ahead, how much more opportunity there is for these service channels and then the throughput opportunity from here? Thank you.\nKevin Johnson : John, you would take that?\nJohn Culver : Yes. Yes. Thanks for the question Dennis. Very excited to talk about this, because the U.S. team has done a remarkable job in terms of driving throughput and operational efficiencies overall. One of the big things to note is that we have returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of our overall operating efficiencies within our stores. So, that\u2019s very encouraging to see.  The other thing that we\u2019ve done to drive productivity and operational efficiencies in the store, a couple of things. First, we significantly upgraded our play builder program, which allows us to be more effective in how we deploy our labor. We\u2019ve also made good investments, strong investments in customer service training.  And if you look at it over the last 18 months or so, since COVID has hit, about 70%, roughly 70% of our partners have been hired in these last 18 months and they\u2019ve been operating in this COVID restricted environment. So we are reinvesting now in the customer service training for our partners, as customers become more mobile and frequent in our stores. Now, in addition to the ongoing operations in our stores and partners are operating, we\u2019ve also made equipment innovation investments as well that is driving throughput as well as efficiency. The strain in two espresso machines is a big investment that we are making. We have it deployed at 70% of our U.S. company-operated stores will complete the roll out in fiscal year 2022.  We\u2019ve introduced a new warming oven, the Merrychef warming oven, which is an upgrade to our current ovens. That\u2019s currently in 20% of our stores. It will be in 35% in the stores by the end of the fiscal year.  And then, with the success of cold beverages and in particular, Cold Brew, we\u2019ve developed a proprietary Cold Brew system, brewing system through our Tryer Center, that\u2019s currently in 2,000 U.S. stores and we\u2019ll have in 75% of our stores by the end of the year. It makes brewing of the product more efficient. It is also a more efficient use of partner time and it fits within the back of the house. The other big thing that we\u2019re rolling out which I am excited about and our supply chain team is worked with the operations team on is automated inventory ordering and this is a system that we have been testing. We just recently expanded the test.  We are now rolling it out at 1,500 stores this past week. It basically removes the inventory task from our store partners and allows them to focus on their customers and the customer experience. And we expect that this will be fully rolled out in all company-operated stores for food and merchandize items by the end of the calendar year.  And then, just one other thing that you asked about drive-thru. We are doing a lot of work on drive-thru and revolutionizing the drive-thru experience. So, really focusing on decreasing the out the window times for the drive-thru experience. We introduced new equipment and technology with handheld order points to target to improve the speed of service.  We\u2019ve also introduced tech improvements to make the orders more easily managed through consolidation and hand-offs and we are going through and renovating about 150 constrained drive-thru stores to design a new engine, removing pace your cases or repositioning it and really dedicating the POS system to that drive-thru location.  And then we are not stopping there, we are continuing to innovate around when is the next evolution of the drive-thru store for our customers. So, lot of great work by the teams, broadly across the operations, store development, supply chain, and the technology team. So hats off to all of them.\nOperator: The last question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer : Thanks. Just a follow-up to John Culver\u2019s earlier comment. He mentioned the urban areas getting going potentially with the dynamics around traffic and check. And I am wondering as you think about going back to school and people perhaps going back to work this fall, is that in any way tied to what Rachel\u2019s comment was about the two-year trend perhaps improving by 1 to 3 points as contemplated in the guidance?  And then, sort of relatedly looking back at this last quarter, anytime you\u2019ve done in the past the type of performance you\u2019ve done in Cold Beverage and Rewards user growth. I would expect a sequential acceleration. In March, you were doing 11%, two year and it was remarkably similar this quarter. Any insights about factors you saw that might have been headwinds that could help us think about how you are going to be doing after this quarter? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson : Rachel, do you want to take the question on the trend, David asked?\nRachel Ruggeri : Sure. Well, I think, David, just to clarify, we delivered a double - we delivered a 10% two year comp in the U.S. business, our largest market this quarter. That\u2019s we\u2019re incredibly proud of that performance. And even with that, we are guiding now to our two year comp from Q3 to Q4 showing sequential improvement.  So we are showing that we are expecting \u2013 we are implying that we\u2019ll have improvement above the 10% and we\u2019ve given a range of about 11% to 13% on a two-year basis. So that certainly reflects the momentum we\u2019ve seen in the business and the momentum we are expecting as we see more customers returning to the stores.  As I mentioned, we had a very similar customer count, overall count in terms of this quarter versus pre-pandemic. But our opportunity really continues to be - we certainly have the ability to bring more customers in, but our opportunity is the frequency of those customers. We ended the quarter at about 90% of where we\u2019ve been from a transaction standpoint prior to the pandemic, so in FY 2019 levels.  And that\u2019s really our opportunity and we reflected that in the guidance we\u2019ve given. But I\u2019ll give it to John to add some further commentary on that.\nJohn Culver : Yes. I think that we are very optimistic in terms of, number one, customers returning to our stores and our stores being ready with relevant innovation that resonates very strongly with our customers. And nowhere are we seeing that more than with cold, in cold beverages. As we shared record 74% of beverage sales in Q3 that\u2019s 13 percentage points higher than what it was in the previous quarter.  And it\u2019s important to note and Rachel mentioned this, but I just want to emphasize, cold beverages are generally ticket and margin accretive. So, how do we classify cold beverages? It\u2019s Cold Brew, it\u2019s Nitro Cold Brew, it\u2019s Ice shaken espresso and it\u2019s refreshers. And then, you couple those products with the ability to customize and personalize to the customers\u2019 desires.  We\u2019ve got a wide range of beverage options for customers that are both hot, as well as cold. And we are seeing meaningful growth in the customization of our beverages and the modifiers that people are adding to their products, such as espresso shots, Cold Foam, alternate dairy and really driving awareness of these personalized offerings and our customers are resonating with that.  So, we are very encouraged by what we are seeing. We are very optimistic. But we realize also at the same time that we\u2019ve got to earn our customers\u2019 trust, loyalty, and respect each and every day and our partners are doing yeoman\u2019s work in terms of creating that great experience that customers have come to expect. So, congratulations to them.\nRachel Ruggeri : That\u2019s right. And that\u2019s why I would add that the investments we continue to make are critical. They are critical for our growth and they are critical for us to be able to continue to make it easier for our partners to serve our customers, as well as making it better for our partners overall.\nOperator: I will now turn the call over to Kevin Johnson for closing remarks.\nKevin Johnson : Well, thank you all for joining us today. I think this quarter amplifies the fact that Starbucks is on the front foot and we are optimistic about the future. I think we are operating in a large and growing addressable market for coffee. And within that market is a shift to premium Arabica coffee and you combine that with the strength of the Starbucks brand, I think that creates the trifecta for a multi-year tailwind and this is just the beginning.  So, thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's third quarter fiscal year 2021 conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Culver",
            "content": "John, appreciate the question. It's a great question. Let me give you a little context. We continue to see strong sales recovery in the rural and suburban areas of the business and in particular drive-thru where drive-thrus are most common. That is helping us to drive larger orders and a higher ticket. We saw record ticket in the quarter from an overall U.S. perspective.  Now we are also at the same time as the customers become more mobile and start coming back into the central business districts in the urban core, we did achieve a positive comp for the first time in that trade area since Q1 of FY 2020, which gives us even more optimism for the future recovery of the business.  Now, as that recovers in the central business district and urban and core, what we do expect is that the customers will begin frequenting those stores in those areas and as part of that, transactions will increase, but ticket will moderately decrease and it will balance itself out over time. We see great opportunity to continue to drive transactions in our stores right now, broadly across the U.S.'s business.  We are operating at about 90% of pre-COVID transaction levels. So we've got a lot of room to go to grow back to a more normalized rate pre-pandemic-wise as it relates to transactions. And as we do that, we do expect that ticket to moderately decline during that time. Yes. Chris, the one thing I would add to what Kevin is saying is the success of The Stars for Everyone program that we launched little over three quarters ago. It makes it easier for people to join the Starbucks Rewards program. It enables customers to make purchases by adding alternative payment options in addition to utilizing store value.  And really what we're seeing there is that it helped to drive the 49% increase that we are seeing year-over-year in membership across broadly the Starbucks Reward program. To put that into context, we have added nearly 5 million, 90-day active members since the beginning of this fiscal year and what this has done is, driven a meaningful increase in the conversion rate for those who joined the Starbucks Rewards program.  And really while we are not seen a material shift from customers leaving the store value program to alternate payment methods, the vast majority of the customers who use these alternative payment methods are new or reengaged members that we're tracking back into the program. So, going forward, we are going to continue to double down on both our rewards members, as well as our non-rewards members. We see that is as being highly accretive to driving frequency, as well as spend and we see this as being one of the biggest opportunities we have for the long-term program growth in attracting those occasional customers into our stores. Yes. Yes. Thanks for the question Dennis. Very excited to talk about this, because the U.S. team has done a remarkable job in terms of driving throughput and operational efficiencies overall. One of the big things to note is that we have returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of our overall operating efficiencies within our stores. So, that's very encouraging to see.  The other thing that we've done to drive productivity and operational efficiencies in the store, a couple of things. First, we significantly upgraded our play builder program, which allows us to be more effective in how we deploy our labor. We've also made good investments, strong investments in customer service training.  And if you look at it over the last 18 months or so, since COVID has hit, about 70%, roughly 70% of our partners have been hired in these last 18 months and they've been operating in this COVID restricted environment. So we are reinvesting now in the customer service training for our partners, as customers become more mobile and frequent in our stores. Now, in addition to the ongoing operations in our stores and partners are operating, we've also made equipment innovation investments as well that is driving throughput as well as efficiency. The strain in two espresso machines is a big investment that we are making. We have it deployed at 70% of our U.S. company-operated stores will complete the roll out in fiscal year 2022.  We've introduced a new warming oven, the Merrychef warming oven, which is an upgrade to our current ovens. That's currently in 20% of our stores. It will be in 35% in the stores by the end of the fiscal year.  And then, with the success of cold beverages and in particular, Cold Brew, we've developed a proprietary Cold Brew system, brewing system through our Tryer Center, that's currently in 2,000 U.S. stores and we'll have in 75% of our stores by the end of the year. It makes brewing of the product more efficient. It is also a more efficient use of partner time and it fits within the back of the house. The other big thing that we're rolling out which I am excited about and our supply chain team is worked with the operations team on is automated inventory ordering and this is a system that we have been testing. We just recently expanded the test.  We are now rolling it out at 1,500 stores this past week. It basically removes the inventory task from our store partners and allows them to focus on their customers and the customer experience. And we expect that this will be fully rolled out in all company-operated stores for food and merchandize items by the end of the calendar year.

            "name": "Kevin Johnson",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Greg. I too want to wish Durga and her husband well as they begin a new adventure in London. Durga leaves the team and our investor community in great hands with you Greg and thank you for stepping in to lead Investor Relations while we search for a permanent replacement for this important role. Well, good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. As we celebrate Starbucks' 50th anniversary, we are reminded of the increasing premium on genuine human connection, which has always been at the heart of Starbucks. If there is any lesson we can take from this past year, it is that our promise to uplift every day through authentic human connections over coffee is enduring. It has never been more valuable and sought after. As humans, we belong together and Starbucks was built for this moment.  Now, with customer mobility increasing, we are at the beginning of what we describe as the great human reconnection. The reopening of markets is translating to incredible increases in demand for Starbucks as people are again on the go reconnecting and socializing with one another. Human connection is the very foundation of the Starbucks experience.  The differentiated experience we create for our customers strengthened through the actions we've accelerated over the past year enables us to meet our customers wherever they need us to be. That experience is core to who we are at Starbucks and it drove significant momentum through Q3. That experience is also a direct reflection of the 400,000 Green Apron partners who continue to make every moment right.  It is our partners who deliver the elevated and uplifting experiences for each of the millions of customers we serve every day. Our partners make the difference. They are the heartbeat of Starbucks and for that, I am incredibly proud.  Now, let me take you through Q3, which is highlighted by record-breaking results, fueled by the continued strength of the Starbucks brand around the world. The impressive momentum Starbucks saw in Q2 accelerated through Q3, in which we delivered record revenue of $7.5 billion, up 78% year-on-year, and a record non-GAAP EPS of $1.01.  Additionally, two year comparable store sales improved sequentially led by an incredible overall performance in the U.S., as well as significant net new store growth in China, where we reached over 5,100 stores during the quarter and the double-digit growth and continued share gains that our channels business delivered in the At Home market. Our performance globally reflects the strength of our diverse portfolio and the benefits of scale, as we once again exceeded higher expectations for the quarter, despite inflationary pressures and ongoing pandemic-related restrictions in certain global markets. Our focus, combined with our unwavering commitment to innovating and elevating the Starbucks experience as our key differentiator has proven successful time and time again.  All of this gives us confidence to raise guidance for the balance of the year, and further positions the company for solid long-term growth. In the U.S., our momentum accelerated in Q3, posting year-on-year revenue growth of 90% and two year revenue growth of 16%. Comparable same-store sales grew 83% and importantly two year comp grew 10%. This is at the high end of our long-term annual comp growth target of 4% to 5%. We posted these results even with mobility restrictions still impacting some U.S. geographies with industry-wide pressure in pockets of the supply chain and with our in-store cafe seating not yet fully reopened.  Not only have we posted incredible results as we emerge from the pandemic, our internal research also confirms Starbucks has gained meaningful market share in the U.S., and the momentum we have created is sustainable.  In fact, Starbucks competitive share is the highest this year that has ever been in the away from home coffee and tea category. Simply put, our Green Apron partners are delivering an experience that customers are craving and the growing opportunities to serve our customers with the unmatched experience Starbucks offers gives us resounding confidence in the strength of the brand and the growth potential ahead. One powerful example of innovation that is fueling our momentum is our Beverage portfolio, which when coupled with our unparalleled ability for customizing handcrafted beverages, separates Starbucks from the competition. The investments we have made over the past few years, innovating and expanding our coffee-forward cold beverage platform continue to boost sales and draw new customers to Starbucks.  We continue to see strong demand for Starbucks Cold Brew, Nitro Cold Brew and Starbucks Refresher beverages while ice shaken espresso alone contributed more than a third of the iced espresso growth in the quarter. The cold category represented 74% of beverage sales in Q3, growing 10 percentage points over the past two years.  With the wide range of beverage options both cold and hot, our customers love personalizing their drinks. Over the last two years, we've seen a meaningful increase in customizations such as adding Cold Foam or Shot of Espresso.  Additionally alternative dairy offerings represent nearly 25% of milk-related beverage sales, up from prior year. These innovative offerings in cold and alternative dairy are particularly attractive to millennial and Gen Z customers and are aligned with our focus on the well-being of people and the planet. With premium customization of beverages, coupled with operational improvements, the growth of both hot and cold beverages in stores is enabling margin expansion despite some continued inflationary pressures which Rachel will discuss in more detail.  In addition to beverage platform innovation, extending the in-store experience with digital customer relationships continues to extend our reach, deepen engagement and enhance the customer experience, further differentiating Starbucks and offering customers ever-increasing choice as to how they engage with the brand.  We again added over 1 million new active Starbucks Rewards members in the quarter, with over 24 million active members now representing 51% of all spend in our U.S. stores and up 8 percentage points over pre-pandemic levels, our ability to engage has never been higher.  More and more of these customers are embracing experiences that effortlessly fit their lifestyle with drive-thru representing 47% of transactions and mobile ordering for in-store pickup delivery or curbside at 26% of transactions. We are leveraging all channels to better serve our customers. While it is very clear that our Rewards program has accelerated our recovery in a meaningful way, where Q3 really stands out and what adds to our confidence is the acceleration we saw in our non-rewards customers. While rewards spend grew at a rapid mid-teens rate quarter-over-quarter, for the first time in 11 quarters non-rewards spend growth outpaced SR spend.  This is further evidence of the great human reconnection. The rapid reengagement of non-rewards customers not only propelled our record results, but also underscores the strength of the brand and the growth potential ahead. And finally, we continue to make meaningful progress to reposition our U.S. store portfolio through trade area transformation, which is now nearly 80% complete. In the past twelve months, we've opened 554 new stores combined with in-store seating and drive through service.  This portfolio repositioning and new store formats have increased drive-thru performance to 75% of our total U.S. sales. A number that continues to rise as we increase efficiency. The improvements and additions, we are making to our portfolio today will provide benefits for years to come.  With our focus on the customer experience, new beverage innovation and digital customer relationships, we continue to increase share of customer occasions, while also contributing to a rapidly growing market for all things coffee. Moving on to China where we posted a very positive result with year-on-year revenue growth of 45%. Remarkably, total revenue in China has grown 23% in just two years as we continue to play the long game and we are on track to open more than 600 net new stores this fiscal year. In Q3 alone, we opened 162 net new stores that continued to deliver best-in-class new store profitability and returns.  We ended the quarter with 5,135 stores and we are well on track to operate over 6,000 stores by the end of fiscal year 2022. In addition, we posted 19% same-store comp growth in Q3 and saw sequential acceleration of our two-year comp when excluding the impact of value-added tax.  Furthermore, we gained strong momentum with sequential improvement on every key metric on a two-year basis including total revenue growth, store traffic recovery and margin expansion. The health of our business in China is strong and we've never been more confident in the long-term growth opportunity.  In addition to significant new store growth and sequential acceleration of two-year comps in China, we are expanding digital customer relationships and engagement by creating new occasions and experiences that make mobile ordering even more convenient and personalized. This has resonated strongly with our customers in China propelling mobile ordering to 34% of sales, significantly higher than the 23% in the prior year and more than double pre-COVID levels.  Starbucks Rewards continues to aggressively expand our digital ecosystem across major platforms, driving 90-day active members to an all-time high of $17 million, a 4% increase over previous quarter and a 71% increase versus prior year. Gold members, a very important cohort are engaging Starbucks at pre-pandemic levels. Our performance in China is a testimony to the unparalleled strength of the Starbucks brand and our enduring relationship with our Chinese customers. Our rapidly growing store footprint, market-leading digital ecosystem and customer engagement, robust innovation pipeline and the enduring love and loyalty for the Starbucks brand in China are all unmatched.  I have full confidence in the strength of the Starbucks brand in China and across all our international markets. There should be no misunderstanding of how big and robust our business China is and will be. These are still early days and our strategies are clearly working. Starbucks is uniquely positioned for success in China well into the future. With phenomenal strength and growing momentum in our retail business, let me now move on to our Channel Development segment that also continues to exceed expectations. Over the past three years, we have made significant progress expanding our reach and amplifying the Starbucks brand through CPG, single-serve coffee, ready-to-drink and foodservice.  I attribute our success to the power of the Starbucks brand, the bold innovation that attracts new coffee lovers into our categories and the caliber of our strategic business partners globally. In Q3, Starbucks retained our number one brand position in total U.S. At Home Coffee and further expanded our leadership position versus other brands.  The Starbucks brand continued to increase share in the total U.S. category, impressively adding 1 percentage point over the prior year, despite lapping a strong comp. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle is a powerhouse and we continue to see strong performance across all aspects of the key strategic relationship. Earlier this year, building on the success of the Starbucks by Nespresso platform, we expanded and introduced Starbucks by Nespresso on the virtual line, which is already exceeding six month distribution and velocity targets.  In addition, the combination of strong CPG performance combined with a steady recovery in foodservice gives us added confidence. In ready-to-drink, Starbucks is the number one premium brand globally with our North American coffee partnership with PepsiCo growing 19% in consumption and our International ready-to-drink business growing double-digits in EMEA and China, Asia Pacific.  These channels amplify our brand in more than 80 markets around the world offering millions of customers At Home and At Work options that complement their Starbucks in-store experience. And just yesterday, we announced plans to reach new markets and grow our Starbucks ready-to-drink portfolio with Nestle, who will now serve markets across Southeast Asia and Latin America.  Our channel development strategy to amplify the brand, while growing share of At Home occasions continues to attract new customers to Starbucks with unparalleled choice, while driving best-in-class returns. The key take-away from today's call is this: we look to the future with as much conviction as ever in our strategy. As this quarter represents the beginning of a multi-year tailwind for Starbucks, that is powered by three factors. First, the total coffee addressable market is large and growing rapidly. The market is expected to grow to well over $400 billion in size globally over the next three years.  That represents a compound annual growth rate of 8% to 9%, as the market rapidly recovers from the global pandemic. Second, within this large and growing market, consumer preferences continue to shift from mainstream Robusta coffee to premium Arabica coffee, where Starbucks is the leader.  Third, and perhaps most important, Starbucks has rapidly adapted to new consumer behaviors and strengthened key points of differentiation. Our focus on the customer experience, relevant new beverage platforms and expanded digital customer relationships are translating to increased consumer preference and deeper customer engagement.  The combination of a highly differentiated brand experience, a continued consumer shift to premium Arabica coffee and a large and growing addressable market is a powerful trifecta that provides our business with a multi-year tailwind. These factors reinforced by the results of this past quarter, give us confidence that this is just the beginning of what is about to unfold. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rachel, who will walk you through details of our Q3 results. Rachel? Yes. Jeffery, thanks for the question. Let me share some thoughts and then I'll hand it over to Belinda to comment a bit further. Jeffery, we've been in China now for over twenty years. And every step of the way we have built Starbucks in China for China. And the brand resonates with our customers in China.  So, I think that's number one. Number two, we are in a market building mode right now. Most of our growth comes from the new stores that we open and the fact that the new stores that we have been opening are performing at some of the highest AUV levels prior generations gives us confidence that we are continuing to expand our reach and presence in China. I think those two things. Certainly, from a geopolitical standpoint, we've got businesses in 84 markets around the world. So we constantly deal with geopolitical situations and I'd say, there is not a geopolitical situation that has really impacted us in China over the last couple of years and I don't really foresee that happening as long as we continue to stay focused on what we do and what we do well, which has created great experience for our customers in China. Take care of our Starbucks partners who proudly wear the Green Apron in China.  And we are bullish. We continue to invest, whether it's the investment we are making in new stores, whether it's the coffee innovation park, the first sustainable roasting plant that we are building in China, the work we are doing with coffee farmers in Yunnan and I'd sort of look at the \u2013 this navigating the \u2013 some of the implications of COVID as just being short-term.  And so, that's why I kind of look at it as a very \u2013 from a very bullish perspective long-term. So let me hand it over to Belinda. Belinda, I'll let you comment a bit further on Jeffery's question. Thank you, Belinda. I think, Rachel had one other comment, Jeffery to your question. John, thanks for your question. We'll have John Culver take the U.S. and then Belinda can take China and Rachel, you can add any additional. So John? Belinda, do you want to take China? Yes? And let me just sort of close, I know there has been a lot on the \u2013 written in the press about the cold weather that's hit Brazil and the implications on the C price of coffee. And so, just to give you some context, on the increasing C price of coffee, you should know that over the years, we have created a very thoughtful approach to how we source, warehouse and use hedging techniques to ensure we always have supply of premium Arabica green coffee at an attractive cost basis.  In fact, we purchase green coffee 12 to 18 months in advance and we never stopped buying green coffee through the pandemic. So as a result, we currently have over 14 months of price-forward coverage, which means we have price locked on our coverage for the next 14 months, which gets us through the rest of fiscal year 2021 and most of fiscal year 2022.  And I think we may be the only large buyer of green coffee that uses this approach and that will serve us well, as it gives us a significant advantage relative to our competitors, who if they don't buy this far in advance will certainly not have that cost structure that we put in place. And so, I just want to comment on that since it's been in the press and kind of relates to your question, John, on inflation. Yes, Sharon, this is Kevin. I'll just remind you. I commented in my remarks that we are 80% through the Americas Trade Area Transformation, which is - as we get into fiscal year 2022, that puts us back on the front foot for net new store growth in North America and certainly Belinda and her team in China have already gotten there. So, that's going to be very helpful as we go into FY 2022. Yes. Thanks, Chris. I mean, that's the key point. You look at the fact that we've grown our active \u2013 90-day active Starbucks Rewards Members significantly to over $24 million and where are we getting those active rewards members, they are coming from the non-rewards customers that return into our stores. So, I actually think the increase in non-rewards customers is going to be very helpful to continue to fuel that base of active rewards members.  We know that customers when they join Starbucks Rewards they spend more. There is more frequency and more engagement from those customers and that's why you think over a multi-year period, we have this aspiration to double the number of active rewards members in North America. John, let me - I'll let you comment a bit further if you have anything else to add on the U.S. John, you would take that? Rachel, do you want to take the question on the trend, David asked? Well, thank you all for joining us today. I think this quarter amplifies the fact that Starbucks is on the front foot and we are optimistic about the future. I think we are operating in a large and growing addressable market for coffee. And within that market is a shift to premium Arabica coffee and you combine that with the strength of the Starbucks brand, I think that creates the trifecta for a multi-year tailwind and this is just the beginning.  So, thank you for joining us today."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin and good afternoon everyone. I am thrilled to share with you the results of this milestone quarter, delivering record revenue and record non-GAAP EPS only four quarters after the depth of the pandemic.  Over the past year, we have proven our ability to differentiate ourselves to the unique and personalized experiences we create for Starbucks customers, whether in our stores, through our app, or down the grocery aisle, leading to this quarter's impressive results.  Starbucks global revenue reached $7.5 billion in Q3, up 78% from the prior year, far surpassing the pre-pandemic quarterly record set in Q1 fiscal 2020, driven largely by the incredible performance in the U.S., our largest market. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $1.01 up from the loss of $0.46 in the prior year driven by faster than expected margin recovery in the Americas due to sales leverage from lapping prior year COVID-19 impacts and the benefit from continued strength in average ticket.  Our Q3 EPS includes $0.09 of benefit related to discrete tax items, most of which was originally anticipated in Q4 as referenced on our previous earnings call. The investments we have made in our business have made Starbucks stronger, more resilient, and positions for long-term growth. This powerful momentum, gives us the confidence to meaningfully raise our EPS outlook for the full year as I will explain later. I will now take you through our Q3 fiscal 2021 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. Our Americas segment, which fueled our record quarter, delivered revenue of $5.4 billion in Q3, 92% higher than the prior year, primarily driven by an 84% increase in comparable store sales including 82% comp transaction growth.  As Kevin mentioned, U.S. comparable store sales growth reached 83% in Q3, driven by a material improvement in transaction comp of 88%. Average store transactions continued to grow and ended the quarter at nearly 90% of pre-pandemic levels presenting further opportunity to return to and grow beyond FY 2019 levels.  As transactions have grown, we've maintained the strength in average ticket of 1% over the prior year, remaining significantly elevated as many key post-pandemic consumer trends have continued. Growth in cold beverages and customization, coupled with sustained strong beverage attach and record food attach in Q3, all contributed to the strong ticket and gives us confidence in our ability to maintain a meaningful portion of the ticket gains over the coming quarters. Americas' Q3 non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 24.7%, up more than 200 basis points from Q3 of fiscal 2019, largely driven by sales leverage on our product and distribution costs including waste favorability, the benefits of SKU rationalization over the prior two years and favorable sales mix shift.  Pricing and the benefits of trade area transformation also helped offset the sizable investments in wages and benefits, as well as higher supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures. While we are thrilled with our margin performance in Q3, we expect it to moderate slightly in Q4, primarily due to the growing impact of inflation, coupled with incremental investments critical to our continued growth, which I'll discuss in a moment. Moving on to International. The International segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q3, excluding a 10% favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue grew 65% over the prior year, reflecting a 41% increase in comparable store sales inclusive of a 5% adverse impact from lapping the prior year VAT benefit.  Strong sales growth from our International licensees, as well as 8% net new store growth over the prior \u2013 over the past 12 months also contributed to this growth. Kevin spoke to our performance in China. In addition, the International segment performance was adversely impacted by virus resurgences in Japan with a state of emergency severely limiting consumer traffic during most of the quarter. It's important to remember that the vast majority of International markets in which we operate are behind the U.S. in terms of both vaccination and mobility.  So revenue recovery is predictably lagging in those markets. Still, our partners in every market remained focused on what they can control and what they do best, the moments of connection they are providing our customers during these challenging times will support growth as vaccination rates improve. International's non-GAAP operating margin rose to 22.5% from minus 2.7% in the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage from lapping the impacts of COVID-19, as well as store labor efficiencies across our company-operated markets and larger government subsidies.  On a two-year basis, these temporary subsidies provide an approximately 200 basis point benefit in the quarter, boosting the segment's non-GAAP operating margin close to its pre-pandemic level of 22.7% in Q3 fiscal 2019. On to Channel Development, revenue was $414 million in Q3, a decline of 7% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business.  When excluding the approximately 20% adverse impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development's revenue increased by 13% in Q3, mainly driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance product sales and our ready-to-drink business. This segment's non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 46.7% in Q3 from 35.6% in the prior year.  Normalizing for the 700 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 410 basis points in Q3, driven primarily by the strength of our ready-to-drink business. We expect the impacts from the transition to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2021. Finally, at the consolidated level, our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5% in Q3, up from minus 12.6% in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in our operating margin for Q3 was primarily driven by sales leverage across the P&L, as we lapped COVID-19 impacts and related costs, as well as pricing in the Americas.  These were partially offset by additional investments in retail store partner wages and benefits, which remain a strategic priority for us to support our world-class partners. Given the strength of our performance in Q3 and the optimism we have for the fourth quarter, we are pleased to update our guidance across a number of key areas. We expect the momentum we have seen in the U.S., underpinned by the ongoing great human reconnection to continue and as a result, we expect both Americas and U.S. comparable store sales growth in Q4 in the range of 22% to 25%.  This corresponds to a two-year comp range for Q4 of 11% to 13%, reflecting further sequential improvement from an already strong level of 9% in the Americas in Q3. As a reminder, the two-year comps we are monitoring are calculated on a multiplicative basis instead of an additive basis as described in today's earnings release. For the International segment, where sporadic virus resurgences continue to impair consumer mobility in some markets, we now expect comparable store sales to grow mid-to-high single-digits in Q4. For China, we expect comparable store sales to be roughly flat in Q4.  Similar to the Americas, these ranges for both International and China translate to a meaningful sequential improvement in two-year comp from Q3 to Q4, despite the challenging market dynamics expected to linger in Q4.  Based on the outlook for this segment, we now expect Q4 consolidated comp growth in the range of 18% to 21%. On a two-year basis, this equates to a range of 7% to 10%, a considerable sequential increase from the Q3 two-year comp of 4%. Moving on to retail store development, although we expect approximately 1,100 net new stores globally in fiscal 2021, we now anticipate a slight shift between our segments. For the Americas, we now expect the total store count in fiscal 2021 to remain roughly flat to prior year as the new store openings are virtually offset by higher than normal closures, reflecting the continued progress of our accelerated trade area transformation initiatives.  For International, net new stores for fiscal 2021 are expected to increase to approximately 1,100 from 1,050 in the original guidance. With the updated comp sales and the store growth outlook, we are also tightening our guidance for full year fiscal 2021 consolidated revenue to a new range of $29.1 billion to $29.3 billion from $28.5 billion to $29.3 billion.  This includes Channel Development's revenue, which is now expected in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for full year fiscal 2021, compared to the previous guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, reflecting this segment's strong performance to-date. As a reminder, our fiscal 2021 consolidated revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately $0.5 billion for the 53rd week. Additionally, given the faster than expected margin recovery to-date, we are raising our consolidated GAAP operating margin outlook for the full year to approximately 17%, up from the previous range of 15% to 16%. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to reach approximately 18% in fiscal 2021, up from the previous guidance of 16.5% to 17.5%, reflecting the momentum we saw in Q3 and expect in Q4.  Our operating margin is tempered a bit by two factors that we see growing in relevance in Q4 and into fiscal 2022. The first is our latest view on rising global inflation requiring continued incremental investments to support our growth.  The second is our strong commitment to increasing wages of our store partners, making deliberate investments towards an hourly wage for $15 in the U.S. in line with the announcement we made in November of last year.  As Kevin mentioned our Green Apron partners are fundamental to the Starbucks experience and are critical to our long-term of success. These important wage increases, coupled with continued investment in digital initiatives and operational efficiencies will further solidify the foundation for our next stage of growth. Given the accelerated timing of certain discrete tax benefits in Q3 I noted earlier, which were originally anticipated in Q4, we now forecast our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase to the low 20% from our previous outlook of high teens. For fiscal 2021, our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates are expected in the low 20% range, revised from the previous guidance of low-to-mid 20%. Summing this all up, driven by the tremendous momentum we've seen as customers return to our stores propelling our record results in Q3, we are raising our full year fiscal 2021 EPS guidance. Our new fiscal 2021 GAAP EPS guidance range is $2.97 to $3.02, up from $2.65 to $2.75 previously. Our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.25, up from our prior range of $2.90 to $3.00.  This predominantly reflects our better-than expected performance to-date, as well as the improved outlook for Q4, barring any new significant and sustained waves of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. As a reminder, our fiscal 2021 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges include approximately $0.10 of benefit for the 53rd week. Consistent with our past practice, we will provide guidance for fiscal 2022 on our Q4 earnings call. However, I should note that the earlier than expected margin recovery we saw in Q3 and expect in Q4 was not contemplated when we provided our fiscal 2022 EPS growth outlook at our December Investor Day.  We are pleased with the strength of our business and we'll provide our FY 2022 outlook during our Q4 call. Importantly, our ongoing commitment to the double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth at scale remains strongly intact. To summarize, Q3 performance exceeded our expectations with record revenue and earnings,, underscoring the resilience and power of our brand, which remains as relevant as ever. While temporary marketplace dynamics will impact our business until the global pandemic is behind us, the enduring strength of the Starbucks experience, fueled by our incredible partners around the globe remains intact thriving in this moment of human reconnection and continuing to guide our long-term growth.  As always, the credit for our success this quarter and in the future belongs to our Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the Green Apron. They have our greatest respect and appreciation. And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver; Michael Conway and Belinda Wong. Thank you. Operator? Yes. Thank you. I just want to reiterate two quick points, one of which is, our double-digit EPS growth at scale that we've committed to, as you know is one of the key building blocks to that is our unit growth, as well as our comp growth. And so, unit growth in China continues to be important not only for this year, but for our long-term equation.  The other thing that I would point out is the guidance that we gave for Q4 on comp for international and China, it implies a sequential improvement on a two year basis from Q3 to Q4. But I think it's important to show that we are continuing to be optimistic in showing continued momentum in the business for the remainder of this fiscal year. Sure. The way I'd think about it is, let me preempt a little bit of context is, in Q3, our margin was incredible. I mean, from a standpoint of both \u2013 across all of our markets, we saw margin expansion versus prior year and even against FY 2019. And a big driver of that was our sales leverage, as well as comping over COVID impacts broadly, pricing.  But it did help to offset some accelerated investments we've made in wage as well as inflationary pressures. We think about Q4, we would expect as we guided, we guided our margin to increase from 16.5% to 17.5% going to 18% for the balance of the year. So this shows our optimism and the continued momentum in the business.  But what caution us there is a slightly lower relative to the performance we saw in Q3 based on increasing cost that we see related to inflation as well as the continued investments that we need to make in our business. Those investments were critical to our recovery, but they are more important even foundationally for our growth.  And so, as we think about FY 2022, we are not going to provide guidance for FY 2022 today. That will be on our Q4 call. Give us time to complete our annual operating plan which we are in the process of right now. But if you think about that, some of what we guided at Investor Day from that growth in FY 2022 has been pulled forward into FY 2021.  But I want to be clear that we remain committed to double-digit EPS, non-GAAP EPS growth. So we are committed to that. When you think about that margin that we laid out at Investor Day, that 18% to 19%, that was up from 17% to 18% that we had guided previously. That accounted for the benefit that we are seeing from the investments we are making.  So just again reiterates the importance of those investments. And so, when we think about that guidance at Investor Day, what it allows us to do is modestly expand margin while continuing to invest. And again, we'll provide further guidance on FY 2022 at our Q4 call. But that's how I put it into perspective. I just want to add a little further clarification around that. I mean, both good points from Belinda and John. What I would say is, broadly in the U.S. part of the function of our comp and our ticket going to 1% is just our year-over-year lap.  Our actual ticket continues to be at one of our highest levels and it's our third consecutive quarter and we continue to see, as John mentioned, as we see more single beverage transactions, we expect our ticket to moderate, but we do believe that our ticket will remain elevated, slightly elevated compared to where \u2013 from a pre-pandemic level.  And drivers of that are the attach that John spoke about as well as the continued attach we see in food; our ability to continue to move customers to our cold beverages, which have a more premium price, in addition to our promotion offerings and our customization. Those are other ways that we are further evolving our ticket across the U.S. and Americas space. And what I want to just point out is that the margin that we are guiding to for the balance of the year increasing to 18%, again up from the 16.5% to 17% on a - 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis that we previously guided.  Part of that growth is really coming from an elevated ticket. It's not the only thing, but it's one of many and it continues to be one of many levers to help us support not only inflationary pressures and the headwinds that we have from that, but the continued investments that we need to make in our business. So it continues to be a critical part of our equation and it's reflected in the guidance that we've provided. Yes. I think I'd start first with the inflationary pressures that we saw. So, in Q3, we had outstanding performance, but within that, we covered headwinds in the Americas business of about 70 basis points. And we expect headwinds related to rising cost and inflationary pressures to continue into Q4, which is reflected in the guidance that we've given.  Now, some of the ways that we not only offset headwinds such as inflation, but also the investments we are making are price. And we've always been very thoughtful and measured in the pricing actions we take, so that we don't inhibit growth. And I would say our spread \u2014 our pricing strategy hasn't fundamentally changed. We are very surgical in nature.  We look on a store-by-store basis and we leverage analytics and insights and importantly what our analytics and insights show is that we do have pricing power and we see that in the premiumization of our beverages, the gravitation towards our promotional offerings and this is our opportunity to be able to leverage price in those ways, which is one of the reasons why we talk about our ticket continuing to stay elevated, not at the rate that we have today, but a slightly elevated.  But pricing will be one as many levers that we use to offset these headwinds. For example, we will continue to drive customization with our customers, continue to drive our customers to our cold beverage offerings where we have a more premium nature, continue to drive a beverage and food attach when and where possible. Those are ways to continue have an elevated ticket.  So through pricing and elevated ticket we will also continue to look at efficiencies in our supply chain, as well as efficiencies in G&A. So this particular quarter, we saw our G&A returning to pre-pandemic levels and we'll continue to find efficiencies in G&A over time with our goal to be able to grow G&A less than our revenue growth as another way. In addition to that, we are seeing benefit from trade area transformation. Our trade area transformation in the Americas and more broadly in the segment delivered almost 80 basis points on margin. That's meaningful and so we continue as we've optimized that portfolio that's yet another lever that we are using to help offset not only headwinds related to inflation, but also the investments that we know we need to make that are critical to our growth in the future.  And those are investments both in wages for our partners, as well as investments in our service experience and our throughput, as well as investments in digital initiatives. All those are critical for our growth in the future and really are fueling our - not only our recovery but will fuel the growth for years to come. So those are important investments for us broadly and those are the ways we think about how we'll offset those increasing costs while still modestly expanding margins. We continue to see unit growth as a meaningful driver of our double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. So we'll remain committed to expanding stores both in our international markets, in our company-owned markets or licensed and company-owned. So that will be a continued driver of our growth even with the pressures that we are seeing in labor.  And today, we've, as Belinda mentioned, we are on track to open more than 600 stores in China. We've opened plus 500 stores in the Americas segment and broadly we're going to open a net - 1,100 net new stores this fiscal year. So, still continuing to have meaningful growth in our stores not only this year but into next year. Now the details of what that growth will look like, again, we'll have to come in Q4 when we provide in our Q4 earnings update when we provide more detailed guidance on FY 2022. But you can expect our unit growth continuing to be not only a driver of our earnings, but also as a critical part of our growth in the future. If I could add just one thing to that, what I would add is that, what we see is, we've raised our Q4 guidance for - if you look at the guidance we've given for Americas and U.S. in Q4, it implies that we are going to improve on a two-year basis on our comp from Q3 into Q4.  And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that's implying about 11% to a 13% two year comp growth, which is above the 9% we saw in Americas this quarter on a two-year basis and above the 10% we saw in U.S.  The driver of that is really the fact that, in this quarter we saw our customer accounts, overall customer accounts in line with pre-pandemic levels FY 2019, but where we have opportunity is frequency. And so, that frequency is really what helps support our optimism and aligns with the guidance that we've provided in Q4. Sure. Well, I think, David, just to clarify, we delivered a double - we delivered a 10% two year comp in the U.S. business, our largest market this quarter. That's we're incredibly proud of that performance. And even with that, we are guiding now to our two year comp from Q3 to Q4 showing sequential improvement.  So we are showing that we are expecting \u2013 we are implying that we'll have improvement above the 10% and we've given a range of about 11% to 13% on a two-year basis. So that certainly reflects the momentum we've seen in the business and the momentum we are expecting as we see more customers returning to the stores.  As I mentioned, we had a very similar customer count, overall count in terms of this quarter versus pre-pandemic. But our opportunity really continues to be - we certainly have the ability to bring more customers in, but our opportunity is the frequency of those customers. We ended the quarter at about 90% of where we've been from a transaction standpoint prior to the pandemic, so in FY 2019 levels.  And that's really our opportunity and we reflected that in the guidance we've given. But I'll give it to John to add some further commentary on that. That's right. And that's why I would add that the investments we continue to make are critical. They are critical for our growth and they are critical for us to be able to continue to make it easier for our partners to serve our customers, as well as making it better for our partners overall."

I will now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?\nKevin Johnson: Well, good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I want to begin this call by recognizing the impressive momentum in our business, evidenced over this past year and further amplified by the Q2 results we released today. While the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, this momentum is giving us confidence to raise our full year guidance as Rachel will outline later. Starbucks is as well positioned as it has ever been as global events have driven us to instill a new level of agility and speed into the business. With our Growth at Scale agenda in place well before the global pandemic emerged, we quickly set principles and established store protocols to guide us globally. We monitored events in real time and quickly adapted to changing conditions on a store-by-store basis around the world, working to provide safe, familiar and convenient experiences for our partners and customers. Many of us have lived this past year feeling isolated, protecting ourselves and our families from COVID-19. We now share a powerful craving for human connection, a desire to socialize and feel part of the community and the need to be with others and heal. And with vaccination programs underway and, in turn, consumer mobility, we have begun to see what we describe as the great human reconnection. This is evidenced by our Q2 sales in the U.S., which fully recovered in the quarter as we had previously communicated and the forward momentum across our business around the world as the COVID-19 vaccine distribution progresses at varying rates. It is no secret that consumer behaviors were disrupted as a result of the pandemic. We recognized shifts and behaviors early, and our understanding of those behaviors will guide our strategy well beyond the pandemic as we believe many of these behaviors are here to stay. Our ability to move with speed and agility and to be out in front of these shifts has helped further differentiate Starbucks, positioning us well for the future. I had previously outlined the five most notable consumer behaviors we are laser-focused on, which I will share with you again today. First, customers crave human connection. They've been longing to be together again face-to-face, feeling part of a community. This is human nature and has always been central to the Starbucks Experience. Second, they are looking for convenient, personalized experiences that effortlessly fit their lifestyle. Third, customers appreciate consistency, knowing what to expect at each visit. Fourth, customers seek out high-quality offerings that support the well-being of the planet and society. And finally, customers are increasingly looking to support brands with strong values, values that are demonstrated by actions. Not only have we been adapting to and benefiting from these consumer behaviors, but we also see a clear opportunity to further modernize and reinforce our leadership position, leveraging our strength in technology and predictive analytics as well as the continued transformation of our store portfolio, offering experiences that will drive greater customer loyalty in ways only Starbucks can do. When we spoke with you last quarter, markets were in the initial stages of gaining access to COVID-19 vaccines. And we were seeing very early signs of friends and families celebrating being together again to heal from a year filled with economic and social hardship that has challenged our overall well-being. Certainly, not all markets are moving at the same speed in terms of vaccine distribution, but we know that this is the key that enables all of us to once again be together as part of humanity. And there is no global brand better positioned than Starbucks. Founded 50 years ago, Starbucks was built for this moment. Now I want to share with you results from Q2 that reinforce my optimism for our long-term outlook. Let me begin in the U.S. Building on our very strong Q1 holiday results, our second quarter comparable store sales returned to strong positive growth and a meaningful improvement from last quarter's minus 5%. In Q2, comparable store sales rose to an impressive 9%, at the high end of our 5% to 10% guidance range for the quarter. Once again, the credit for this remarkable resilience and recovery goes to our phenomenal Green Apron partners who delivered another quarter of stellar performance in Q2, driving steady improvement, culminating in a new record for weekly sales and full U.S. comp recovery as we exited the quarter. Importantly, in Q2, we further advanced the three business-driving initiatives fundamental to our Growth at Scale agenda: elevating the customer experience, driving relevant beverage innovation and expanding digital customer engagement. Let me share notable highlights from Q2 and our traffic-driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021. Starting with the largest contributor for the quarter, expanding digital customer engagement. Digital continues to be a significant driver of our sales recovery in the U.S. Starbucks Rewards' contribution to the business continues to exceed pre-COVID levels and for the second consecutive quarter is displaying all-time highs across key metrics. Between continued growth in SR member spend, fueled by strength in ticket and frequency as well as new member acquisition, 52% of our U.S. company-operated sales in Q2 were driven by Starbucks Rewards members, reflecting strong member engagement and resilience. Total 90-day active members grew by over 1 million members in Q2 to a record 22.9 million. Relative to the launch of Stars for Everyone just six months ago, our 90-day active SR member base has expanded by 19%, a clear testament that the program is attracting customers as we had intended. The increase was underpinned by a meaningful uptick in conversions, with more app downloads advancing to member activations. With Stars for Everyone, customers can choose from a range of payment options, offering convenience, flexibility and choice. Our pioneering digital capabilities not only successfully transformed our digital relationships to drive mobile ordering but also amplify convenience and safety, which are both very much top of mind for our customers. We continue to leverage the advantages of our mobile app to elevate the personalization of the customer experience and deepen customer engagement. As a result, mobile orders represented 26% of U.S. company-operated transactions in Q2, up from 18% a year ago. As we have seen each quarter, our digital channel's convenience has proven successful in driving demand. A quick comment on digital that I think is important to highlight, the increasing role that artificial intelligence is playing in the growth and success of our company, an initiative we call Deep Brew. In October 2019, I published an article on LinkedIn entitled, Can Artificial Intelligence Help Nurture Humanity? This article outlined a vision for how Starbucks would leverage artificial intelligence in support of our mission. And that vision has come to life with Deep Brew, our AI engine that is now used today throughout the Company. Deep Brew personalizes the offers and suggestions we make to our customers. It is also at the center of trade area transformation, which I'll provide an update on in a moment. Deep Brew has now automated daily inventory, orders across hundreds of U.S. stores as we deploy it broadly. It is supporting partner scheduling and optimizing it in ways that improve both the customer and the partner experience. Deep Brew drives our pandemic dashboard used by our retail leaders across the U.S. And Deep Brew is now doing predictive analytics to model vaccination progress in key markets around the world. Our work in AI is providing Starbucks the underlying predictive models, enabling us to fuel the great human reconnection by freeing up partners to do what they do best, connect with customers and deliver a world-class customer experience. Elevating the customer experience is another fundamental business-driving initiative underlying the Growth at Scale agenda and perhaps the most important of all of our priorities. Starbucks has always excelled at meeting our customers where they are, even as transactions in the current environment have migrated from dense metro centers to suburbs and from cafes to drive-throughs. Company-operated sales in our U.S. suburban and rural locations, where drive-throughs are most predominant, continued to gain momentum, more than offsetting the impact from central business districts and metro centers, where the recovery continues to lag. The drive-through channel has improved quarter-over-quarter since the onset of the pandemic. We continued to invest in several initiatives to increase the throughput of our drive-throughs, including updated operational standards, handheld order devices, more efficient warming ovens and accelerated deployment of our more efficient Mastrena espresso machines. As a result, drive-through saw a slight improvement in out-the-window times versus the prior year. Out-the-window drove over 50% of net sales in Q2, increasing more than 10% from pre-pandemic levels, unlocking capacity and enhancing the customer experience by reducing wait times, ultimately fueling our business recovery. Last June, we wrote a letter to all stakeholders, outlining our plan to accelerate strategic initiatives focused on rapidly transforming our store portfolio and optimizing for shifting consumer behaviors. This plan, which we refer to as the Americas Trade Area Transformation, has positioned us extremely well for the future. We called this early. And in just nine months, we have already completed 70% of the strategic store closures, clearing the way for the development of new, innovative and more efficient retail store formats over time. The plan leverages new store formats like Starbucks Pickup in dense metro areas that complements our traditional Starbucks Cafe formats in suburban and rural areas and also enables us to balance continued growth in high-volume and high-margin locations, primarily cafes with drive-throughs. We are responding to customers' increased desire for convenience while also improving the overall profitability of every trade area. As the great human reconnection gains momentum and anticipation of behaviors and daily routines continuing to evolve, we are meeting our customers wherever they need us to be with the right store, in the right place and at the right time, yet another key differentiator of the Starbucks brand. As our sales fully recovered in the quarter, average ticket remains meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels. This is true even as transactions have improved significantly quarter-over-quarter, given the shift in sales mix toward drive-through, where average spend tends to be higher, partially due to a higher incident of group orders. U.S. ticket comp growth of approximately 21% in Q2 was driven by a combination of increased beverage attach, premium beverage mix, increased customization and upsizing and all-time high food attach. The popularity of our innovative menu offerings, which command a premium price, also benefited U.S. ticket growth. Customers have responded extremely well to the new beverage platforms we have introduced, with a focus on relevant new handcrafted beverages that deliver on wellness trends, offer customers choice and support our sustainability agenda. Our winter and spring menus resonated and drove momentum. Cold beverages delivered resounding year-over-year growth in Q2, led by Cold Espresso, Starbucks Refreshers and Cold Brew. Also driving our strength in cold beverages was our spring lineup, which launched in early March. We have seen an overwhelmingly positive response to oat milk, with the Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shake and Espresso far exceeding expectations to date. This has helped us push year-over-year growth of 53% in all dairy beverage sales, a testament to the relevance of our sustainability agenda. Plant-based is also resonating in food, with the impossible breakfast sandwich delivering record performance, which, alongside other breakfast sandwiches and cake pops, pushed food attach to record highs in Q2. Any way you look at it, our second quarter results were phenomenal in the U.S. and exceeded our expectations. Importantly, affinity for Starbucks has strengthened as measured by improvements in our customer connection scores and growth in customer loyalty, which further reinforces the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and healthy optimism for the future. I will now move on to China, our second lead growth market. The strong start to fiscal '21 continued as we entered Q2. And while a resurgence of COVID-19 restrictions impacted customer mobility as the quarter progressed, our China leadership team once again rapidly adapted to the changing conditions and successfully regained momentum as we exited the quarter. In Q2, we achieved 91% comp growth in China, including that favorability of approximately 9 percentage points, which came in slightly below our expectations as unanticipated pandemic-related restrictions were imposed across the market. Nonessential travel was discouraged in Q2, severely impacting our stores located in travel hubs, including during the entirety of the Chinese New Year holiday, the peak domestic travel season, which saw a significantly lower number of travelers relative to both pre-pandemic and prior year levels. Even as mobility impacted our comps, our ability to expand our digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program reinforces the long-term position of our brand in our fastest-growing market. As we lapped the first anniversary of the pandemic, I am particularly pleased with our ability to dramatically expand digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program. Our progress is evidenced by the number of 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members more than doubling versus prior year to 16.3 million, driving 72% of sales in China, up 5 percentage points from prior year. In addition, we expanded the Starbucks Now Mobile Order and Pay service to WeChat in Q2, making our mobile ordering services ubiquitously available to customers on both Alibaba and WeChat ecosystems as well as our Starbucks app. This enables us to acquire new customers in the WeChat ecosystem while enhancing the customer experience by allowing customers to place orders via the app of their choice. In Q2, we also launched our flagship store on JD.com, one of China's leading e-commerce platforms, offering merchandise, stored value cards and seasonal food offerings, among other products. Mobile order sales mix hit a record 34% of sales in China, up from 30% in Q1, with 15% driven by Starbucks Delivers and 19% from Starbucks Now. Starbucks Rewards customer engagement continues to grow as mobile order sales have more than doubled in China over this past year. As COVID-related restrictions subsided late in the quarter, momentum in customer mobility improved, particularly in residential, office and commercial trade developments. In addition, as much of our growth in China comes from our continued expansion of the store portfolio, we crossed the 4,900-store milestone with the opening of 110 net new stores in Q2. That equates to 14% growth in net new stores over the past 12 months, which is particularly impressive considering that we suspended new store development activities for a couple of months in China at the onset of the pandemic. This week, we announced our 5,000th store opening in China, underscoring our continued confidence in Starbucks' long-term growth opportunity in China. And finally, a few comments on the strength of our channel partnerships with Nestl\u00e9 and Pepsi. In the U.S., Starbucks' share of total packaged coffee outpaced the category, growing over 8% in dollar sales in Q2. This is a sharp contrast to the overall coffee category, which declined due to a surge in pantry stocking that occurred last year at the onset of the pandemic. I'm proud to say that Starbucks remained the number one brand in total coffee in the U.S. and was the top share gainer of the coffee category in Q2, gaining nearly 1.5 points over the prior year. Internationally, Starbucks' products on single-serve platforms, including Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, continued to exceed our expectations. And with the Q1 launch of Starbucks' products on the Nespresso virtual line, our outlook is optimistic as we continue to build distribution, amplify the brand and grow share. The Global Coffee Alliance is now in 71 markets around the world, up from 48 markets in Q2 fiscal year '20, bringing more customers the opportunity to enjoy Starbucks in many different ways. Similarly, consumption of our U.S. ready-to-drink coffee products through our North American coffee partnership with PepsiCo grew more than 23% in Q2, over a 5% jump from Q1. Q2 also marked the launch of new beverages, including the Cold and Crafted platform and new Nitro Cold beverages, leveraging last year's Starbucks' Nitro ready-to-drink platform launch, which became the number one innovation in the ready-to-drink category. In summary, as you can see, there are many reasons to be confident and optimistic about the future for Starbucks. Personally, I am optimistic about the back half of this fiscal year. But even more importantly, it is clear to me that the actions we are taking, the customer and partner response we are seeing and the focus and discipline we have brought to the business have clearly positioned Starbucks for the next several years of growth. The Growth at Scale algorithm we shared at our December Investor Day is solid. The Starbucks' brand is stronger and more resilient than ever. We have more opportunities to reach customers than ever before. And we are continuing to personalize and enhance those interactions by always delivering for our customers a unique and innovative food and beverage experience in a safe environment with a personal touch where and when they want. As we celebrate our 50th anniversary throughout this year, we do so knowing that Starbucks' third place experience is well established and core to the great human reconnection that has begun. We are a destination for human connection, a warm and welcoming place for all and a place that brings entire communities together, and that is exactly what the world needs, a place that inspires and nurtures the human spirit, one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time. And I want to thank our over 400,000 Green Apron partners in 83 markets around the world who have been navigating through this complex environment. Partners, it is you who exemplify what Starbucks has always stood for, a company with a purpose that goes beyond the pursuit of profit, a culture that demonstrates care for our partners, creates uplifting experiences for our customers and plays a positive role in our communities and throughout society. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rachel, who will walk you through our Q2 results. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Kevin shared, we are very pleased with the continued momentum in our business, with meaningful sequential improvements in quarterly financial results demonstrating the overall strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand as well as the effectiveness of our strategies, our innovation and our agility. Starbucks reported global revenue of $6.7 billion in Q2, up 11% from the prior year, inclusive of approximately 2% foreign currency favorability, with growth driven by our company-operated retail markets particularly in the U.S. And with these better-than-expected results, we are confidently raising our outlook for the full year as I will explain later. Q2 EPS exceeded our expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected margin recovery. Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.56 increased from $0.28 in the prior year and was $0.15 higher than the upper end of our guidance range inclusive of lower-than-expected restructuring and impairment costs of about $0.04, largely attributable to our more favorable lease exit costs. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.62, up from $0.32 in the prior year and $0.12 above the upper end of our guidance range, primarily driven by continued core business recovery fueled by strong U.S. performance. I will first take you through our Q2 fiscal '21 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. I will then share our improved outlook for the full fiscal year. Our Americas segment delivered revenue of $4.7 billion in Q2, 8% higher than the prior year, driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales, partially offset by lower product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees as a result of the pandemic. As Kevin mentioned, in the U.S., we saw continued sequential improvement in quarterly comparable store sales from minus 5% in the prior quarter to a very strong positive 9% in Q2. Transaction comp improved from minus 21% in Q1 to minus 10% in Q2, with continued strength in average ticket, which remains significantly above pre-pandemic levels. On a cumulative two-year basis, which measures our growth relative to pre-pandemic levels, U.S. comp sales in the month of March grew 11%, implying annual average growth above our long-term algorithm of 4% to 5% and a full sales recovery by the end of Q2, as we previously communicated. America's Q2 non-GAAP operating margin expanded 550 basis points from the prior year to 19.9%, primarily driven by lapping of COVID-19-related costs incurred in the prior year, sales leverage from business recovery, pricing, temporary government subsidies and the benefits of trade area transformation, partially offset by growth in investments in wages and benefits for our store partners. Notably, this represented a meaningful improvement from the prior quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 18.8%. Moving on to International. The International segment delivered revenue of $1.6 billion in Q2. Excluding an 8% favorable impact of warrants currency translation, the segment's revenue in the quarter was 34% higher than the prior year, reflecting a 35% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 4% VAT benefit and an 8% net new store growth over the past 12 months, partially offset by lower product sales to and revenues from our international licensees. In China, we lapped the first anniversary of widespread COVID-related store closures. And as Kevin mentioned, comparable store sales grew 91% in Q2, including VAT favorability of approximately 9 percentage points. The VAT benefit was reinstated for the entire quarter to mitigate the impact of government-mandated restrictions across the mainland, following flare-ups of COVID-19 in several key cities, significantly limiting customer mobility. On a cumulative two-year basis, China comp sales growth in March was minus 5%, including 4% of VAT benefit. International's non-GAAP operating margin rose to 19.6% from 3.9% in the prior year and surpassed Q2 FY '19 margin by 30 basis points, mainly driven by sales leverage, reflecting the lapping of severe impacts in the prior year attributable to the COVID-19 outbreak and favorability from temporary government subsidies in Japan. On to Channel Development. Revenue was $370 million in Q2, a decline of 29% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business and lapping additional product sales in the prior year to Nestl\u00e9 to transition foodservice order fulfillment. When excluding the approximately 30% adverse impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development's revenue grew by nearly 2% in Q2, mainly driven by growth in our ready-to-drink business. The segment's non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 46.7% in Q2 from 37.8% in the prior year. Normalizing for the 770 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 120 basis points in Q2, driven primarily by the strength of our ready-to-drink business. Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was 16.1% in Q2, up 690 basis points from 9.2% in the prior year, up 30 basis points from Q2 of fiscal 2019 and an improvement from 15.5% in Q1. The year-over-year increase in our operating margin for Q2 was primarily driven by lapping of COVID-19 impacts but also included stronger-than-expected sales leverage and favorability from temporary government subsidies. The margin expansion in Q2 was partially offset by both growth and investments in wages and benefits for store partners. Moving on to our guidance for fiscal '21. Now that we're at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we have better visibility to anticipated full year results, and therefore, we are raising our full year fiscal '21 EPS guidance as well as updating a few other metrics. The increase is predominantly driven by better-than-expected operating results in the first half of the year, an anticipated benefit attributable to certain discrete tax items in Q4 and a slight tailwind from foreign currency translation, barring, of course, any new significant and sustained ways of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. Our new fiscal '21 GAAP EPS guidance range is $2.65 to $2.75, up from $2.42 to $2.62 previously. Our fiscal '21 non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2.90 to $3, up from our prior range of $2.70 to $2.90. We continue to drive leverage in all areas of our business, giving us confidence in our full year earnings guidance. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges are inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the 53rd week. Given the momentum we've seen in the U.S. business to date, we are raising our guidance for full year fiscal '21 consolidated revenue to a new range of $28.5 billion to $29.3 billion, up from $28 billion to $29 billion. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 consolidated revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately $500 million for the 53rd week. Additionally, we are raising our consolidated operating margin to a range of 16.5% to 17.5%, up from our previous guidance of 16% to 17%, even as we continue to make meaningful investments in our key growth drivers. We continue to expect our operating margin recovery to lag sales recovery by two quarters, improving as the year progresses and approaching our ongoing target range of 18% to 19% at the consolidated level as we exit fiscal '21. As I mentioned earlier, we currently expect certain discrete tax items to favorably impact Q4's tax rate in fiscal '21. Based on current expectation, Q4's tax rate is forecasted to decline to the high teens level, but given the nature of discrete tax items, the timing and magnitude of the favorability are subject to change. In contrast, Q3 tax rate is expected to be slightly higher than our Q2 tax rate. As a result, we now expect our fiscal '21 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the low to mid-20% range. Moving on to comp sales growth. As sales in our two lead growth markets have returned to roughly pre-pandemic levels, albeit with different customer patterns than before the pandemic, we are reverting to our quarterly sales reporting convention at this time and do not anticipate providing monthly comps going forward. And while we continue to see strength in average ticket, we expect it to moderate as customer mobility improves, and we anticipate store visitation frequency will start to normalize in the latter half of fiscal '21. Therefore, we expect a corresponding shift between the mix of traffic and ticket comp as we lap the depth of fiscal '20's pandemic impacts in Q3. As a reminder, our usual one-year reported comps are expected to be outsized as we lap the significant negative comps from the effects of COVID-19 in fiscal '20, which began in late January in China, followed by the U.S. as we exited Q2. Consequently, until we lap fiscal '20's COVID-19-related impacts, we believe that our fiscal '21 comps should be assessed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, the two-year comp growth rate will be more indicative of our underlying performance. I want to underscore that the two-year comps we are monitoring are not calculated on an additive basis, which yield distorted results when lapping large negative comps as the second year comp base is not comparable to the first year. Instead, we are calculating our two-year comps on a multiplicative basis as described in today's earnings release. Finally, to be clear, except for the updates on revenue, EPS, margin and tax rates that I just provided, the remainder of our full year fiscal '21 guidance metrics are unchanged from what we communicated with our Q1 fiscal '21 quarterly earnings report. To summarize, we are delighted that our U.S. business has fully recovered sales as we expected. While we may experience pandemic-related volatility until global herd immunity is attained, we have the protocols in place to respond in real time to ensure the health and safety of our customers and partners while continuing to operate the business. Our performance in Q2 demonstrates the relevance and success of our strategies, with operating margins above the levels of two years ago. Our cash position remains strong and we have meaningfully deleveraged our balance sheet this year by paying off debt maturities totaling nearly $1.7 billion, keeping us on track to approach our 3x leverage target by the end of this fiscal year. Going forward, I want to underscore that we have a clear set of actions underway to continue to drive comp growth and profitability as we move through the year. Importantly though, we will continue to invest in our business strategically with a long game mentality, taking decisive action to ensure that we are continuing to drive shareholder value long into the future. Now more than ever, we remain confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of our growth model, giving us continued confidence in the model shared at our 2020 Investor Day of delivering long-term double-digit EPS growth at scale, with another year of outsized EPS growth expected in fiscal 2022 as we lap this year's recovery curve. Once again, the real credit for our success goes to our more than 400,000 Green Apron partners worldwide who continue to go above and beyond to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience. That experience, above all, fueled our growth this past quarter and will continue to be a competitive advantage in the future. Thank you. And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by Rossann Williams, Brady Brewer and John Culver, as Durga outlined at the top of the call. Thank you. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Glass: I hope you all are well. Could you just maybe just provide a little more color on the U.S. comps and the America's comps? I suspect it's a tale of two formats, right? The suburban drive-through is doing really well, the central business districts, lagging, as you indicated. Has that gap begun to close? Have you seen any changes? Maybe you can just help amplify or sort of be more specific about the two comps and the components of it. Have you seen any change in the morning daypart? I know people had shifted to later in the day? Are you starting to see that more traditional morning rush come back in the business?\nKevin Johnson: Yes, John, let me comment, and then I'll hand it over to Rachel for some more specifics on the numbers. But on your last part of the question, in terms of dayparts, we saw our two-year comp growth in all dayparts. So we've seen that morning ritual return, and we've seen positive two-year comps across those dayparts, which is a very, very positive sign. One of the things that I've been monitoring is when you look at when the FDA announced emergency approval for the Pfizer vaccine on December 11 and then followed with Moderna on December 18 and then J&J on February 27, sort of mapping the actions taken by the FDA to announce availability of vaccines and correlated that back to watch what's happening in our stores day-to-day, and that action alone created this wave of optimism of, I think, consumers, customers being more mobile. Now they're still being cautious. But then certainly, as we saw the rate of vaccinations start to hit 3 million to 4 million vaccinations a day, you really start to see how this great human reconnection unfolds. And so we saw it unfold in all dayparts. And we still see stores in our dense metropolitan areas recovering slower. But I'd tell you the cafes with drive-throughs that we have are comping to more than make up for that. We are seeing recovery though in those metropolitan areas. It's just -- I think that's going to take a little longer for businesses to bring employees back to work and sort of reshift those traffic patterns. But I think very, very positive progress on dayparts and continued progress in terms of both in dense metropolitan located stores. But I actually think the trade area transformation is unlocking a significantly positive upside for us. And so maybe Rachel, why don't you hit on the numbers? And then Rossann, I'll let you add other observations that you see from the U.S. perspective.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Thank you, Kevin. What I would say is when you look at the comp in the U.S. business in the quarter at 9%, to be able to achieve a 9% comp, it really took growth across our overall portfolio. So the overall portfolio grew. Certainly, our stores in the more metro urban areas are still slower to recover but they improved greatly quarter-over-quarter. And of course, the outperformance in our drive-through, so we saw that across the board and across all dayparts, which give us confidence. And to Kevin's point, what helped fuel that, particularly in our more metro areas and urban markets, was the trade area transformation where we're 71% -- about 70% complete with that effort today. As you might remember, we communicated we would close around 800 stores across Americas. And so as we've gone through that, we've been able to overall strengthen the portfolio as part of that effort. So that's playing into some of the recovery as well, as well as the overall mobility that's increased throughout the United States. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Rossann.\nRossann Williams: Thank you. The only thing I would add is the interruption of our customers' mobility really impacted our AM morning daypart. And that was daypart that we're most concerned about recovery. Given the morning daypart sales mix percent is largely recovered compared to pre-COVID levels, this means that as a percent of [indiscernible] by daypart, we are seeing the morning percent relatively in line with our pre-COVID trends. We expect this morning trend to sustain as things open back up and people return to the central business districts and the urban trade areas. Interestingly though, we have seen that the daypart is actually moved slightly later in the morning from pre-COVID time of 7:30 to 9:30 a.m. to current times of around 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nSharon Zackfia: I guess I'm curious about the reiteration of the comp ranges for both the Americas and International. It kind of seems like you're ahead in Americas year-to-date and maybe a little bit on the lower end of International. Are you seeing something in the International business that gives you comfort that, that full year comp range is achievable?\nKevin Johnson: Rachel, why don't you take that and then I'll add to it?\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure, Sharon. Thanks for the question. What I would say is China was having a good -- seeing good momentum before we entered into Q2. And then there was a resurgence of COVID that caused restrictions across travel, across actually our International markets impacting China, given this was an important period for a market in terms of holidays and the Chinese New Year. And so as a result, we saw that cause mobility issues in the quarter, which impacted performance and impacted comp. As we saw some of the restrictions start to lift at the end of the quarter, we started to see momentum build, particularly in our key trade zones and key trade areas. For those reasons, we believe in the overall momentum in the market. And the brand continues to be strong, and we're continuing to see great growth in our digital platforms. We're connecting with customers in new and different ways. We continue to open significant amount of new stores. So our confidence in the market continues. And because of that, we felt the comp range was appropriate. There's a lot of volatility in our comps overall. And so for that reason, we kept comp guidance in line with the ranges we had provided previously. That allows us to be able to keep that level of volatility uncertainty within that range as we find our customers continue to return to our business and until our customers have a more routine activity overall, and we see a more return to normal patterns, we think that range is appropriate.\nKevin Johnson: Yes. And I'll just add, Sharon, I think clearly, the key is vaccination progress in every country around the world. And one of the things that we've done is we saw vaccination progress, progress very well across the United States and the strong performance we had in the United States. We're now using our Deep Brew AI technology to start to monitor and look at the vaccination progress of every country around the world and use predictive analytics to give us a view and correlation to how that's going to pace the recovery and the acceleration of our growth in International business. Clearly, this quarter, we had some COVID-related restrictions in many countries in Europe, certainly in Japan and China, and so that had an impact there. But when you look at the products we're making on vaccinations, certainly in the U.S., that's a proxy for what's going to happen around the world. And with vaccine manufacturing ramping up and more vaccine available to international markets, I think we're going to see a good result. John Culver?\nJohn Culver: Yes. And Sharon, what I would just add is, first and foremost, the optimism that we have that as these restrictions are lifted and customers become more mobile, that our business quickly returns to normal operating levels. We saw that in China in the first quarter and early into the second quarter. We saw that in Japan as restrictions were lifted last year. We're seeing that now in Mexico as restrictions have been lifted and vaccinations have improved. We're also optimistic for the U.K. as openings occur in the U.K. and vaccination levels approach over 50%. So all indications are that we're very confident with the comp guidance that we've provided from an International perspective, and to add further to that, we continue to make major investments in our digital footprint and in new stores, so that when these markets open back up to full mobility, that we are in a position to accelerate our growth and move much faster.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: There's obviously a lot of discussion about the labor market in general in the United States. I mean, there seems to be increased mobility in 2021 in terms of the workforce and also paying higher prices for the workforce. Could you comment just in terms of anything on the partners? That would be insightful, anything that you're doing new over the next, I guess, 9 or 12 months in terms of attracting and retaining and just what your overall retention is at this point?\nKevin Johnson: Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me sort of summarize kind of my view at a high level and then I'll hand over to Rossann. First of all, it's important to ground ourselves in what we've done for our partners over this last year. Keep in mind, a year ago, the extreme lockdowns that we had in the U.S., we decided to give our partners economic certainty through that period. We did not do any involuntary layoffs or furloughs. We paid our partners whether they came to work or stayed home. We increased the benefits that we gave them for COVID-related health benefits, mental wellness benefits, parental care benefits, childcare benefits. We took care of our partners through this pandemic. And as a result, our partners have risen to the occasion. Certainly, as we came out of this pandemic, we made a significant investment, an increase of wage that went into effect in December. And partners have applauded that. And so we're in a position right now where I think our partners appreciate what we've done, and we have great respect and appreciation for our partners. So unlike what I've read about from other companies, we -- our retention numbers are good. Our partners' energy and spirit is high. And so I don't anticipate us having challenges when it comes to having our partners show up and be in a position to create a great customer experience in every store around the world. Now before I hand over to Rossann, I do want to comment though, in some areas in supply chain, let's take in distribution where store deliveries. Now some of our partners who run the store deliveries are from our customer distribution centers to stores, they've struggled a bit having -- being able to hire and staff to meet the demand that we have and to get enough people. So we are working with them. So I do anticipate we'll do a little bit more to invest and help our supply chain partners, whether it's staff that they need in manufacturing or staffing they need for distribution and transportation. But when it comes to Starbucks, I think we're in a very solid position. Rossann?\nRossann Williams: What I would add to that is currently, in certain markets at certain times, we are experiencing some labor shortages but it is not a widespread issue at this time. And as Kevin said, we've invested ahead of the curve with our industry-leading benefits and total pay approach, and I feel confident that we will continue to make the necessary investments required to remain a premium player of choice. Now we will obviously continue to watch this very closely over the next few months to ensure that we are continuing of operating stores in a way [indiscernible] customer demand.\nRachel Ruggeri: And I would just add to that, too, is as we've invested meaningfully in our partners, we've still been able to drive our margin. And as we look at the back half of the year, we've indicated that our margin will lag our sales recovery by about two quarters. And a key component of that is that we're going to continue to invest in our partners as well as equipment and other things to be able to unlock the demand that we have. And that's an important note to remind, it doesn't -- it means we're still going to see strengthening in our business will strengthen as we move throughout the quarters. But I just want to highlight that, that investment continues to be part of why we're guiding our margins the way we are. And it does include inflationary components as we open up the economy and as we move through some of these stages as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Tarantino: Rachel, I have a couple of questions about your guidance commentary. The first is, I think the first half performance overperformed your ranges by -- on the order of something like $0.20 in EPS, and that is the amount of the guidance raise. But it sounds like there's also some tax benefit towards the end of the year that's in there. So I was just wondering if you could clarify if there's any offsets we should consider on why the guidance range didn't go up by more than it did. I think that's my first question. And the second question is at the Investor Day in December, I think the Company laid out plans for 20% type EPS growth or 20%-plus off of the 2021 base. And I was wondering if that type of growth is still in play as you think about next year, given the overperformance that you're seeing this year.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Thank you, David. Thanks for the question. What I would say is we felt confident in being able to raise our guidance on EPS for the full year. And of course, a big driver of that is our overdelivery and our outperformance in the first two quarters. But as I've mentioned, we expect that our margin is going to lag our sales recovery over the next couple of quarters so we'll lag our sales recovery. And some drivers of that are, we won't see the onetime benefit that we had from the government subsidies that we had in Q2. So we won't have that. We'll start to see our ticket moderate. We still believe that we'll have a slightly elevated ticket as we continue to drive food attach and premiumization of our products as well as shifting customers into cold platforms, but we will see our ticket moderate, which will impact our margin. In addition to that, as I mentioned, we're going to continue to invest in our business. It's critically important as we think about how we unlock the back half of the year and we continue to grow and meet the demand. So we're going to have to continue to invest in partners, continue to invest in technology and equipment in our stores. And finally, there's an inflationary component in there as well. So when you put that together, that's what really drives our guidance. Now what I would say is we would expect to exit Q4, so we'll strengthen from a margin perspective throughout the quarters, but we would expect to exit Q4 approaching the 18% to 19% guidance range that we gave at Investor Day for the long term. So that will show you how the -- how our EPS will essentially strengthen with that margin. And what I can say in terms of next year, we don't provide guidance for next year but what we've already provided, but I would say you can still expect outside performance in line with that approximately 20% as we had previously guided.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. And Rachel, the government subsidy, forgive me if I missed this, but what was the magnitude of that and where does that fall in the P&L?\nRachel Ruggeri: What I would say is when you think about our overperformance in Q2, so if you think about versus guidance, the fact that we overperformed Q2, the two drivers of that is in the Americas segment and it's the government subsidies, so the onetime government subsidies as well as the better-than-expected recovery. And I would say, fairly equal in nature.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSara Senatore: Just, I guess, a question about the closures and the store, how you're shifting it. One is, do you have any sense of what the sales transfer might have been from closed stores to the ones that have remained open? I know there are lots of puts and takes now, but just trying to figure out if there was any benefit to the system in terms of same-store sales from closing some of these underperforming stores. And likewise, you've given a lot of color on investments in the business and that lag between top line and margin. But is there a -- my sense is that the restaurant-level margin at drive-throughs is actually higher than sort of some of the traditional stores. So I would have thought that might be a tailwind as well as you kind of the store-based transformation. So just those two kind of questions on the face of the store-based sales transfer and then margin differentials.\nKevin Johnson: Yes. Sara, thanks for the question. Let me comment then I'll hand it over to Rachel. As you recall, we sort of outlined the fact that we're going to reposition 800 stores in North America this year. We're about 70% through the closures of that. But it's also important to note that approximately 200 of those new stores have been built and reopened, so we're also in the process of fulfilling the repositioning aspect of that. I think that's boding very well for us because it's actually helping us improve the customer experience by having the right store in the right location with the right format for customers. And we're on track to complete that as we go through the fiscal year. And I think that's one of the things that's going to set us up and help us in fiscal year '22, kind of going back to David's question about the outsized EPS growth that we look for in fiscal '22. Rachel, do you want to add some more for Sara in terms of sales transfer, yes?\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you, Sara, for the question. What I would say is from a trade area transformation perspective, if you think about the Americas segment, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that Americas saw about a 550 basis point improvement on margin in the quarter. A driver of that was trade area transformation. And so what we've seen is what we, I think, outlined in Q2 -- or excuse me, in Q1 of this year is that on a full year basis, at the enterprise level, trade area transformation would be a benefit to margin of about 40 basis points. We saw significant improvement in Q2, and that will still align with approximately 40 basis points on the full year at the enterprise level. But that trade area transformation was a contributing factor to part of the success of the Americas segment in the quarter. And then in terms of the investments that I talked about, certainly, the investments that I've been talking about are across all stores. Largely, our drive-through as we're trying to -- as we're focusing on unlocking capacity and being able to accommodate the demand but it also relates to our cafes as well. But of course, more predominantly, drive-through concepts where we're seeing the majority of our demand currently. And as you might recall, at our Investor Day, we actually increased our comp guidance based on what we have seen from the investments we've been doing. So our comp guidance previously had been in the 3% to 4% range. We increased it to 4% to 5% based on these investments that we're making. And so the fact that these investments are starting to unlock productivity and we're seeing the margin benefit from those, we were able to show, on a long-term basis, that will increase comp and then subsequently increase our margin, allow us to continue to expand our margin and support our EPS growth for the longer term. So that's where you're seeing some of the tailwinds as we make these investments in the near term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. At this time, there is no response from Mr. Palmer. Their question has been withdrawn, and we'll proceed to the next question in queue. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Just one question on the My Starbucks Rewards program. I think you mentioned that it's right just over 50% of the U.S. company-operated sales from what I think are now 23 million members. And that 23 million number feels like it's, I think based on what you last commented on maybe a year or so ago, that you have 80 million or 90 million total addressable customers that you service. So it seems like 23 million number spending clearly outsized relative to the average. So I'm just wondering what are the initiatives at this point? It seems like you're still growing that program double digits from a percentage basis, but what are the biggest initiatives to further ramp up that 23 million member base over the next 12 to 24 months?\nKevin Johnson: Jeffrey, thanks for the question. I'm going to hand it over to Brady Brewer, our Chief Marketing Officer, who leads our program there. Brady?\nBrady Brewer: Great. Thanks for the question, Jeffrey. We see a lot of opportunity with our Rewards program. It is 52% of total sales in the U.S. And as you heard, we added 1 million new active members just in the last quarter alone. That was on top of the 1 million in the quarter before. And there are a few things that we're doing. One is we want to know as many customers as we possibly can. We want to personalize their experience and we want to make the experience effortless. And so effortless means things like mobile order, curbside, delivery. And we've looked at things like Stars for Everyone, which you've heard us launch about six months ago. Trying to lower the barrier to entry so that customers can get the benefits of the program and experience the incentives and the personalized experience they get through the program. And it's through those efforts that we are attracting more customers into the program. SFE specifically was a program that we launched to make it easier to join and to make purchases in the program with the pay-as-you-go option. So lowering those barriers to entry, reaching as many people with the program and then ensuring that the incentives and the services that are attached to that program to make the experience personalized and effortless. That's how we're growing the program. And we've seen just tremendous results, obviously, over the last six months with those programs, attracting new members and seeing them activate.\nKevin Johnson: Thanks, Brady. Jeffrey, I'll just add to Brady's comments. I think Brady and team have done a great job growing our -- keep in mind, these are 90-day active Rewards members so they are active members. When we were at about 20 million active -- 90-day active reward members, we had this conversation with the team that said, look, I believe we have an opportunity to double that number. I'm not going to give a time frame, it might take a couple of years, but double that number. And in doing that, we've now started to apply some very creative and very thoughtful ways to get under the data that we have about customers so that we can -- even if they're non-Rewards customers so that we can better serve them and start to personalize offers and personalize the experience for them. And so working with technology companies that have machine learning algorithms, companies like Amperity and Bridge, they've been able to help us continue to advance this. So I think we've got a great set of features and initiatives that enhance the customer experience and how they want to use that mobile app to personalize that customer experience in ways that are relevant to them and for us to find new ways to reach out to non-Rewards customers and start to personalize our engagement with them to bring them into becoming Rewards customers. And so we're going to think very broadly about this over the long term. And I'm optimistic that we're doing some things that are very creative, and it's just going to take some time.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Doubling that 20 million is an incredible goal so I look forward to progress on that.\nKevin Johnson: All right. Write that down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Charles: Just following up on the MSR program. I mean, it's just very encouraging that obviously, you had 3.5 million more active members today versus pre COVID-19. And just kind of two questions on the progress of this. First, who are these new members that you're finding? Are they skewing younger? Are they skewing to less penetrated areas in the country like the south? And then second, I know it's early days but can you observe that trajectory of their behavior such that they seem likely to visit and spend in line with that 3x average versus nonmembers that you've historically observed?\nKevin Johnson: Great questions. Brady?\nBrady Brewer: Yes. The program has been very strong at attracting our high-frequency customers, and so we have a large proportion of high-frequency customers in the program today. And given the incentives of the program, lowering those barriers to entry, we are seeing a significant number of more occasional or lower-frequency customers joining in the program these days. That's helping continue to support that two to three times average versus the non-SR customer in terms of frequency. We still see that high frequency overall for the program. But what's great about seeing those occasional customers join is that we also see that significant lift in frequency and spend from those members just as we do from the high-frequency members that join. So we see tremendous opportunity in bringing that occasional customer into the program, providing them with a great experience, great incentives and experiences that drive their frequency over time. So we see that as a continued opportunity. We see a lot of runway there, as Kevin said, and we'll continue to press on that for the months and years to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.\nNicole Miller: I know this is going to sound a little out of sequence and all this number stuff is super important, but obviously, the team and the transition, I think, is equally important. And Rachel, I wanted to ask you last time but we ran out of time. You're just in such a unique perspective in your role. I would -- I don't know if I'll get this right, but kind of growing up at Starbucks going away. So curious like what did you learn? You come back, the impression that you're going to make? And really, just curious like how have the first few months in this role been for you?\nRachel Ruggeri: Well, thank you, Nicole, for the question. I appreciate it. What I would say is Starbucks is such a powerful brand. I think you see that globally, but as a person who's worked at the Company, you feel it. And so that's, I think, what, for somebody who's been at the Company and left and come back, that is the -- that's the force is really what the brand means and it's less about the symbol but it's more about the people behind it. And there's just an incredible group of people that you work with partners. And it's hard to replicate that. And so from my perspective, that is the as a customer because I'm a customer, too, and I always have been is I feel that when I'm in my store, and I think that resonates when you're part of the Company and even in the corporate office. So I think that's a unique advantage of being part of a company like Starbucks. And what I can say is it's incredible to watch the growth from the Company over the years and to be in a position where I get to work with such an incredibly talented group of leaders to help shape the future of this growth. I think it's an enviable position but it's humbling at the same time. And so I feel grateful for the opportunity. But I appreciate the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Bittner: Kevin, I know that you are bullish on coffee demand trends in general in the U.S. and the ability for the market to grow at a favorable CAGR moving forward. Is there a way to possibly perhaps frame up this market share grab opportunity that could unfold in the U.S. as we storm out of COVID? I obviously realize you're laser-focused on your own idiosyncratic drivers, but do you have any data or insights to frame up how your market share is trending or insights into the competitive supply situation going on around you, particularly maybe in your urban trade areas?\nKevin Johnson: Yes. Brian, let me just start with kind of how I think about the share position that Starbucks has and how that's unfolding through this pandemic and as we emerge from it. I think a couple of thoughts. The thing that we have that's the most measurable is, on a quarterly basis, is looking at sales of the Starbucks coffee down the aisle at CPG and coffee, whether it's roasted ground coffee, single-serve or ready-to-drink beverages. And what we've seen is consistent share gains through this pandemic and even into this quarter. I mean, the ready-to-drink share that we gained both in the U.S. and China is significant. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9 has now taken us from fundamentally two markets to over how many markets?\nJohn Culver: 71.\nKevin Johnson: 71 markets around the world. And just take North America, a big market. North America, our growth -- revenue growth was 8%, where the category declined. John, why don't you comment on that? And then let me go back to specialty coffee and retail.\nJohn Culver: Yes. What I would say, Brian, is it's a holistic strategy on how we capture the consumer and attract them into the Starbucks brand, whether that's through our retail stores, through down the aisle, through foodservice, through ready-to-drink, it's a holistic strategy. And I would say that over the course of the last year, we are seeing that really come to fruition right now. We've talked about the resurgence of customers coming back to our stores and stores reopened. We've seen the growth of packaged coffee down the aisle during this time, not only in the U.S. but also internationally. The growth in single-serve internationally as well being on the Nespresso platform, Dolce Gusto platform, the Keurig platform. In addition, foodservice is going to continue to play a very important role. We just opened our 1,000th foodservice location in China this past month, and we're going to continue to expand in that way. So it's a holistic strategy. We've been able to, in the U.S., now be the number one brand down the aisle in terms of share, and we've actually grown that share and expanded that number one position in the quarter versus Q1. So we are seeing our customers who have loved Starbucks continue to consume our coffee and to continue to want to experience it in unique ways and we're very humbled by that.\nKevin Johnson: Yes. Thanks, John. So Brian, you can see that on our Channels business, every quarter, we get the number, we get the measurement. On our specialty coffee retail, we tend to look at Euromonitor and other longer-term data sources to give us a sense. But right now, the volume of customer occasions that have returned to our stores in the U.S. is phenomenal, and it's exceeded our forecast and our projections in the U.S. And Rossann and her team have adapted rapidly to that. But the thing we're most focused on is how we have rapidly adapted to shifting consumer behaviors that I outlined in sort of my opening comments, how in doing that, we extend and enhance the attributes that differentiate Starbucks from everyone else and how we then create a great experience for our customers in the stores. And the way we do that, the trade area transformation is one important initiative. But the work we do to elevate the customer experience, deliver relevant and exciting new beverages and to extend and enhance digital customer relationships are the three key things. And when you look at what's happening in each one of those areas, there's so much positive activity and initiatives and accomplishments and then customer response to those things that I just believe that we're hitting on the right notes. And at this point, I look and say, we're going to have a two- to three-year tailwind just simply by watching vaccinations progress around the world. This great human reconnection will happen probability 1.0. And so we are positioned for that, and we're trying to -- we're working to enhance and differentiate the brand in ways that are meaningful to us. We're going to take care of our partners. Our partners are the heartbeat of Starbucks. They have risen to the occasion. And so specialty coffee retail is where we set the brand. 100 million of customers a week come to see us, and that's where we establish the brand and then we amplify it through our channels. And I think in both specialty coffee retail and channels, it's happening. And so we'll give you more as though as we get more data on share gains. But I can just feel it and sense it as I look at our data, our numbers, and I'm in our stores and sort of watching what's happening.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Carril: So I just wanted to follow up on the commentary earlier around ticket and how moderation there will perhaps affect margins going forward. But are you seeing anything in the current trends that would suggest that some elements of the still strong ticket could remain sticky even as traffic continues to improve, such as increasing mix of premium beverages or higher food attach? Rachel, do you want to take that?\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, what I would say is we definitely -- I mean, as we start to comp the most severe part of the pandemic from last year, we'll definitely see the construct of our comp shift, and it will return to more of a pre-pandemic level where you see greater transaction and maybe a lower ticket. So we'll definitely see our ticket moderate from the high 20s where we've been. But we believe that some of that will sustain, now not to the degree that it's been, but if you look at some of the behaviors that have driven that, the behaviors that have driven it today are the fact that we have higher beverage attach from group orders, multiple orders. Some of that will probably moderate as people start to go back into the offices and we have more single visits and single-item purchases. But we've had an all-time food attach. This quarter was an all-time record attach on our food. And that's because we're putting forward products that our customers love and enjoy. And so they'll continue to -- if we continue to innovate in the areas that are relevant for them, we continue to see that, that will have -- that will drive food attach. In addition to that, we're seeing, across the board, growth in cold and some of that is from our promotional offerings as well as some of our core offerings. And I think that focus in that area, which is more premium for us in nature is where our customers are gravitating. And so that will also help us to sustain ticket. I just think the issue will be that it will moderate from where it is today, but we have belief that some of those levers that I just spoke about are indeed sticky.\nOperator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Johnson for closing remarks.\nKevin Johnson: Well, thank you. I got to say, Brian got me all like energized about what we're doing. And so as we close today's call, I think it's important to reinforce one key message. And that message is that Starbucks is meeting this moment, this moment of the great human reconnection and we anticipated the shifts in consumer behaviors. We accelerated our long-range plans, and we are well positioned to differentiate ourselves even further with the new level of resilience, speed and agility. I got to say, as Rachel was commenting, the strength of this brand and the increasing opportunities for us to offer convenient, elevated personalized experiences for our customers around the world makes me personally very optimistic for the future. Our long-term growth model is solid. And so thank you for your questions. Thanks for joining us today, and have a great evening.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's second quarter fiscal year 2021 conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Johnson",
            "content": "Well, good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I want to begin this call by recognizing the impressive momentum in our business, evidenced over this past year and further amplified by the Q2 results we released today. While the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, this momentum is giving us confidence to raise our full year guidance as Rachel will outline later. Starbucks is as well positioned as it has ever been as global events have driven us to instill a new level of agility and speed into the business. With our Growth at Scale agenda in place well before the global pandemic emerged, we quickly set principles and established store protocols to guide us globally. We monitored events in real time and quickly adapted to changing conditions on a store-by-store basis around the world, working to provide safe, familiar and convenient experiences for our partners and customers. Many of us have lived this past year feeling isolated, protecting ourselves and our families from COVID-19. We now share a powerful craving for human connection, a desire to socialize and feel part of the community and the need to be with others and heal. And with vaccination programs underway and, in turn, consumer mobility, we have begun to see what we describe as the great human reconnection. This is evidenced by our Q2 sales in the U.S., which fully recovered in the quarter as we had previously communicated and the forward momentum across our business around the world as the COVID-19 vaccine distribution progresses at varying rates. It is no secret that consumer behaviors were disrupted as a result of the pandemic. We recognized shifts and behaviors early, and our understanding of those behaviors will guide our strategy well beyond the pandemic as we believe many of these behaviors are here to stay. Our ability to move with speed and agility and to be out in front of these shifts has helped further differentiate Starbucks, positioning us well for the future. I had previously outlined the five most notable consumer behaviors we are laser-focused on, which I will share with you again today. First, customers crave human connection. They've been longing to be together again face-to-face, feeling part of a community. This is human nature and has always been central to the Starbucks Experience. Second, they are looking for convenient, personalized experiences that effortlessly fit their lifestyle. Third, customers appreciate consistency, knowing what to expect at each visit. Fourth, customers seek out high-quality offerings that support the well-being of the planet and society. And finally, customers are increasingly looking to support brands with strong values, values that are demonstrated by actions. Not only have we been adapting to and benefiting from these consumer behaviors, but we also see a clear opportunity to further modernize and reinforce our leadership position, leveraging our strength in technology and predictive analytics as well as the continued transformation of our store portfolio, offering experiences that will drive greater customer loyalty in ways only Starbucks can do. When we spoke with you last quarter, markets were in the initial stages of gaining access to COVID-19 vaccines. And we were seeing very early signs of friends and families celebrating being together again to heal from a year filled with economic and social hardship that has challenged our overall well-being. Certainly, not all markets are moving at the same speed in terms of vaccine distribution, but we know that this is the key that enables all of us to once again be together as part of humanity. And there is no global brand better positioned than Starbucks. Founded 50 years ago, Starbucks was built for this moment. Now I want to share with you results from Q2 that reinforce my optimism for our long-term outlook. Let me begin in the U.S. Building on our very strong Q1 holiday results, our second quarter comparable store sales returned to strong positive growth and a meaningful improvement from last quarter's minus 5%. In Q2, comparable store sales rose to an impressive 9%, at the high end of our 5% to 10% guidance range for the quarter. Once again, the credit for this remarkable resilience and recovery goes to our phenomenal Green Apron partners who delivered another quarter of stellar performance in Q2, driving steady improvement, culminating in a new record for weekly sales and full U.S. comp recovery as we exited the quarter. Importantly, in Q2, we further advanced the three business-driving initiatives fundamental to our Growth at Scale agenda: elevating the customer experience, driving relevant beverage innovation and expanding digital customer engagement. Let me share notable highlights from Q2 and our traffic-driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021. Starting with the largest contributor for the quarter, expanding digital customer engagement. Digital continues to be a significant driver of our sales recovery in the U.S. Starbucks Rewards' contribution to the business continues to exceed pre-COVID levels and for the second consecutive quarter is displaying all-time highs across key metrics. Between continued growth in SR member spend, fueled by strength in ticket and frequency as well as new member acquisition, 52% of our U.S. company-operated sales in Q2 were driven by Starbucks Rewards members, reflecting strong member engagement and resilience. Total 90-day active members grew by over 1 million members in Q2 to a record 22.9 million. Relative to the launch of Stars for Everyone just six months ago, our 90-day active SR member base has expanded by 19%, a clear testament that the program is attracting customers as we had intended. The increase was underpinned by a meaningful uptick in conversions, with more app downloads advancing to member activations. With Stars for Everyone, customers can choose from a range of payment options, offering convenience, flexibility and choice. Our pioneering digital capabilities not only successfully transformed our digital relationships to drive mobile ordering but also amplify convenience and safety, which are both very much top of mind for our customers. We continue to leverage the advantages of our mobile app to elevate the personalization of the customer experience and deepen customer engagement. As a result, mobile orders represented 26% of U.S. company-operated transactions in Q2, up from 18% a year ago. As we have seen each quarter, our digital channel's convenience has proven successful in driving demand. A quick comment on digital that I think is important to highlight, the increasing role that artificial intelligence is playing in the growth and success of our company, an initiative we call Deep Brew. In October 2019, I published an article on LinkedIn entitled, Can Artificial Intelligence Help Nurture Humanity? This article outlined a vision for how Starbucks would leverage artificial intelligence in support of our mission. And that vision has come to life with Deep Brew, our AI engine that is now used today throughout the Company. Deep Brew personalizes the offers and suggestions we make to our customers. It is also at the center of trade area transformation, which I'll provide an update on in a moment. Deep Brew has now automated daily inventory, orders across hundreds of U.S. stores as we deploy it broadly. It is supporting partner scheduling and optimizing it in ways that improve both the customer and the partner experience. Deep Brew drives our pandemic dashboard used by our retail leaders across the U.S. And Deep Brew is now doing predictive analytics to model vaccination progress in key markets around the world. Our work in AI is providing Starbucks the underlying predictive models, enabling us to fuel the great human reconnection by freeing up partners to do what they do best, connect with customers and deliver a world-class customer experience. Elevating the customer experience is another fundamental business-driving initiative underlying the Growth at Scale agenda and perhaps the most important of all of our priorities. Starbucks has always excelled at meeting our customers where they are, even as transactions in the current environment have migrated from dense metro centers to suburbs and from cafes to drive-throughs. Company-operated sales in our U.S. suburban and rural locations, where drive-throughs are most predominant, continued to gain momentum, more than offsetting the impact from central business districts and metro centers, where the recovery continues to lag. The drive-through channel has improved quarter-over-quarter since the onset of the pandemic. We continued to invest in several initiatives to increase the throughput of our drive-throughs, including updated operational standards, handheld order devices, more efficient warming ovens and accelerated deployment of our more efficient Mastrena espresso machines. As a result, drive-through saw a slight improvement in out-the-window times versus the prior year. Out-the-window drove over 50% of net sales in Q2, increasing more than 10% from pre-pandemic levels, unlocking capacity and enhancing the customer experience by reducing wait times, ultimately fueling our business recovery. Last June, we wrote a letter to all stakeholders, outlining our plan to accelerate strategic initiatives focused on rapidly transforming our store portfolio and optimizing for shifting consumer behaviors. This plan, which we refer to as the Americas Trade Area Transformation, has positioned us extremely well for the future. We called this early. And in just nine months, we have already completed 70% of the strategic store closures, clearing the way for the development of new, innovative and more efficient retail store formats over time. The plan leverages new store formats like Starbucks Pickup in dense metro areas that complements our traditional Starbucks Cafe formats in suburban and rural areas and also enables us to balance continued growth in high-volume and high-margin locations, primarily cafes with drive-throughs. We are responding to customers' increased desire for convenience while also improving the overall profitability of every trade area. As the great human reconnection gains momentum and anticipation of behaviors and daily routines continuing to evolve, we are meeting our customers wherever they need us to be with the right store, in the right place and at the right time, yet another key differentiator of the Starbucks brand. As our sales fully recovered in the quarter, average ticket remains meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels. This is true even as transactions have improved significantly quarter-over-quarter, given the shift in sales mix toward drive-through, where average spend tends to be higher, partially due to a higher incident of group orders. U.S. ticket comp growth of approximately 21% in Q2 was driven by a combination of increased beverage attach, premium beverage mix, increased customization and upsizing and all-time high food attach. The popularity of our innovative menu offerings, which command a premium price, also benefited U.S. ticket growth. Customers have responded extremely well to the new beverage platforms we have introduced, with a focus on relevant new handcrafted beverages that deliver on wellness trends, offer customers choice and support our sustainability agenda. Our winter and spring menus resonated and drove momentum. Cold beverages delivered resounding year-over-year growth in Q2, led by Cold Espresso, Starbucks Refreshers and Cold Brew. Also driving our strength in cold beverages was our spring lineup, which launched in early March. We have seen an overwhelmingly positive response to oat milk, with the Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shake and Espresso far exceeding expectations to date. This has helped us push year-over-year growth of 53% in all dairy beverage sales, a testament to the relevance of our sustainability agenda. Plant-based is also resonating in food, with the impossible breakfast sandwich delivering record performance, which, alongside other breakfast sandwiches and cake pops, pushed food attach to record highs in Q2. Any way you look at it, our second quarter results were phenomenal in the U.S. and exceeded our expectations. Importantly, affinity for Starbucks has strengthened as measured by improvements in our customer connection scores and growth in customer loyalty, which further reinforces the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and healthy optimism for the future. I will now move on to China, our second lead growth market. The strong start to fiscal '21 continued as we entered Q2. And while a resurgence of COVID-19 restrictions impacted customer mobility as the quarter progressed, our China leadership team once again rapidly adapted to the changing conditions and successfully regained momentum as we exited the quarter. In Q2, we achieved 91% comp growth in China, including that favorability of approximately 9 percentage points, which came in slightly below our expectations as unanticipated pandemic-related restrictions were imposed across the market. Nonessential travel was discouraged in Q2, severely impacting our stores located in travel hubs, including during the entirety of the Chinese New Year holiday, the peak domestic travel season, which saw a significantly lower number of travelers relative to both pre-pandemic and prior year levels. Even as mobility impacted our comps, our ability to expand our digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program reinforces the long-term position of our brand in our fastest-growing market. As we lapped the first anniversary of the pandemic, I am particularly pleased with our ability to dramatically expand digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program. Our progress is evidenced by the number of 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members more than doubling versus prior year to 16.3 million, driving 72% of sales in China, up 5 percentage points from prior year. In addition, we expanded the Starbucks Now Mobile Order and Pay service to WeChat in Q2, making our mobile ordering services ubiquitously available to customers on both Alibaba and WeChat ecosystems as well as our Starbucks app. This enables us to acquire new customers in the WeChat ecosystem while enhancing the customer experience by allowing customers to place orders via the app of their choice. In Q2, we also launched our flagship store on JD.com, one of China's leading e-commerce platforms, offering merchandise, stored value cards and seasonal food offerings, among other products. Mobile order sales mix hit a record 34% of sales in China, up from 30% in Q1, with 15% driven by Starbucks Delivers and 19% from Starbucks Now. Starbucks Rewards customer engagement continues to grow as mobile order sales have more than doubled in China over this past year. As COVID-related restrictions subsided late in the quarter, momentum in customer mobility improved, particularly in residential, office and commercial trade developments. In addition, as much of our growth in China comes from our continued expansion of the store portfolio, we crossed the 4,900-store milestone with the opening of 110 net new stores in Q2. That equates to 14% growth in net new stores over the past 12 months, which is particularly impressive considering that we suspended new store development activities for a couple of months in China at the onset of the pandemic. This week, we announced our 5,000th store opening in China, underscoring our continued confidence in Starbucks' long-term growth opportunity in China. And finally, a few comments on the strength of our channel partnerships with Nestle\u0301 and Pepsi. In the U.S., Starbucks' share of total packaged coffee outpaced the category, growing over 8% in dollar sales in Q2. This is a sharp contrast to the overall coffee category, which declined due to a surge in pantry stocking that occurred last year at the onset of the pandemic. I'm proud to say that Starbucks remained the number one brand in total coffee in the U.S. and was the top share gainer of the coffee category in Q2, gaining nearly 1.5 points over the prior year. Internationally, Starbucks' products on single-serve platforms, including Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, continued to exceed our expectations. And with the Q1 launch of Starbucks' products on the Nespresso virtual line, our outlook is optimistic as we continue to build distribution, amplify the brand and grow share. The Global Coffee Alliance is now in 71 markets around the world, up from 48 markets in Q2 fiscal year '20, bringing more customers the opportunity to enjoy Starbucks in many different ways. Similarly, consumption of our U.S. ready-to-drink coffee products through our North American coffee partnership with PepsiCo grew more than 23% in Q2, over a 5% jump from Q1. Q2 also marked the launch of new beverages, including the Cold and Crafted platform and new Nitro Cold beverages, leveraging last year's Starbucks' Nitro ready-to-drink platform launch, which became the number one innovation in the ready-to-drink category. In summary, as you can see, there are many reasons to be confident and optimistic about the future for Starbucks. Personally, I am optimistic about the back half of this fiscal year. But even more importantly, it is clear to me that the actions we are taking, the customer and partner response we are seeing and the focus and discipline we have brought to the business have clearly positioned Starbucks for the next several years of growth. The Growth at Scale algorithm we shared at our December Investor Day is solid. The Starbucks' brand is stronger and more resilient than ever. We have more opportunities to reach customers than ever before. And we are continuing to personalize and enhance those interactions by always delivering for our customers a unique and innovative food and beverage experience in a safe environment with a personal touch where and when they want. As we celebrate our 50th anniversary throughout this year, we do so knowing that Starbucks' third place experience is well established and core to the great human reconnection that has begun. We are a destination for human connection, a warm and welcoming place for all and a place that brings entire communities together, and that is exactly what the world needs, a place that inspires and nurtures the human spirit, one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time. And I want to thank our over 400,000 Green Apron partners in 83 markets around the world who have been navigating through this complex environment. Partners, it is you who exemplify what Starbucks has always stood for, a company with a purpose that goes beyond the pursuit of profit, a culture that demonstrates care for our partners, creates uplifting experiences for our customers and plays a positive role in our communities and throughout society. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rachel, who will walk you through our Q2 results. Rachel? Yes, John, let me comment, and then I'll hand it over to Rachel for some more specifics on the numbers. But on your last part of the question, in terms of dayparts, we saw our two-year comp growth in all dayparts. So we've seen that morning ritual return, and we've seen positive two-year comps across those dayparts, which is a very, very positive sign. One of the things that I've been monitoring is when you look at when the FDA announced emergency approval for the Pfizer vaccine on December 11 and then followed with Moderna on December 18 and then J&J on February 27, sort of mapping the actions taken by the FDA to announce availability of vaccines and correlated that back to watch what's happening in our stores day-to-day, and that action alone created this wave of optimism of, I think, consumers, customers being more mobile. Now they're still being cautious. But then certainly, as we saw the rate of vaccinations start to hit 3 million to 4 million vaccinations a day, you really start to see how this great human reconnection unfolds. And so we saw it unfold in all dayparts. And we still see stores in our dense metropolitan areas recovering slower. But I'd tell you the cafes with drive-throughs that we have are comping to more than make up for that. We are seeing recovery though in those metropolitan areas. It's just -- I think that's going to take a little longer for businesses to bring employees back to work and sort of reshift those traffic patterns. But I think very, very positive progress on dayparts and continued progress in terms of both in dense metropolitan located stores. But I actually think the trade area transformation is unlocking a significantly positive upside for us. And so maybe Rachel, why don't you hit on the numbers? And then Rossann, I'll let you add other observations that you see from the U.S. perspective. Rachel, why don't you take that and then I'll add to it? Yes. And I'll just add, Sharon, I think clearly, the key is vaccination progress in every country around the world. And one of the things that we've done is we saw vaccination progress, progress very well across the United States and the strong performance we had in the United States. We're now using our Deep Brew AI technology to start to monitor and look at the vaccination progress of every country around the world and use predictive analytics to give us a view and correlation to how that's going to pace the recovery and the acceleration of our growth in International business. Clearly, this quarter, we had some COVID-related restrictions in many countries in Europe, certainly in Japan and China, and so that had an impact there. But when you look at the products we're making on vaccinations, certainly in the U.S., that's a proxy for what's going to happen around the world. And with vaccine manufacturing ramping up and more vaccine available to international markets, I think we're going to see a good result. John Culver? Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me sort of summarize kind of my view at a high level and then I'll hand over to Rossann. First of all, it's important to ground ourselves in what we've done for our partners over this last year. Keep in mind, a year ago, the extreme lockdowns that we had in the U.S., we decided to give our partners economic certainty through that period. We did not do any involuntary layoffs or furloughs. We paid our partners whether they came to work or stayed home. We increased the benefits that we gave them for COVID-related health benefits, mental wellness benefits, parental care benefits, childcare benefits. We took care of our partners through this pandemic. And as a result, our partners have risen to the occasion. Certainly, as we came out of this pandemic, we made a significant investment, an increase of wage that went into effect in December. And partners have applauded that. And so we're in a position right now where I think our partners appreciate what we've done, and we have great respect and appreciation for our partners. So unlike what I've read about from other companies, we -- our retention numbers are good. Our partners' energy and spirit is high. And so I don't anticipate us having challenges when it comes to having our partners show up and be in a position to create a great customer experience in every store around the world. Now before I hand over to Rossann, I do want to comment though, in some areas in supply chain, let's take in distribution where store deliveries. Now some of our partners who run the store deliveries are from our customer distribution centers to stores, they've struggled a bit having -- being able to hire and staff to meet the demand that we have and to get enough people. So we are working with them. So I do anticipate we'll do a little bit more to invest and help our supply chain partners, whether it's staff that they need in manufacturing or staffing they need for distribution and transportation. But when it comes to Starbucks, I think we're in a very solid position. Rossann? Yes. Sara, thanks for the question. Let me comment then I'll hand it over to Rachel. As you recall, we sort of outlined the fact that we're going to reposition 800 stores in North America this year. We're about 70% through the closures of that. But it's also important to note that approximately 200 of those new stores have been built and reopened, so we're also in the process of fulfilling the repositioning aspect of that. I think that's boding very well for us because it's actually helping us improve the customer experience by having the right store in the right location with the right format for customers. And we're on track to complete that as we go through the fiscal year. And I think that's one of the things that's going to set us up and help us in fiscal year '22, kind of going back to David's question about the outsized EPS growth that we look for in fiscal '22. Rachel, do you want to add some more for Sara in terms of sales transfer, yes? Jeffrey, thanks for the question. I'm going to hand it over to Brady Brewer, our Chief Marketing Officer, who leads our program there. Brady? Thanks, Brady. Jeffrey, I'll just add to Brady's comments. I think Brady and team have done a great job growing our -- keep in mind, these are 90-day active Rewards members so they are active members. When we were at about 20 million active -- 90-day active reward members, we had this conversation with the team that said, look, I believe we have an opportunity to double that number. I'm not going to give a time frame, it might take a couple of years, but double that number. And in doing that, we've now started to apply some very creative and very thoughtful ways to get under the data that we have about customers so that we can -- even if they're non-Rewards customers so that we can better serve them and start to personalize offers and personalize the experience for them. And so working with technology companies that have machine learning algorithms, companies like Amperity and Bridge, they've been able to help us continue to advance this. So I think we've got a great set of features and initiatives that enhance the customer experience and how they want to use that mobile app to personalize that customer experience in ways that are relevant to them and for us to find new ways to reach out to non-Rewards customers and start to personalize our engagement with them to bring them into becoming Rewards customers. And so we're going to think very broadly about this over the long term. And I'm optimistic that we're doing some things that are very creative, and it's just going to take some time. All right. Write that down. Great questions. Brady? Yes. Brian, let me just start with kind of how I think about the share position that Starbucks has and how that's unfolding through this pandemic and as we emerge from it. I think a couple of thoughts. The thing that we have that's the most measurable is, on a quarterly basis, is looking at sales of the Starbucks coffee down the aisle at CPG and coffee, whether it's roasted ground coffee, single-serve or ready-to-drink beverages. And what we've seen is consistent share gains through this pandemic and even into this quarter. I mean, the ready-to-drink share that we gained both in the U.S. and China is significant. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle\u0301 has now taken us from fundamentally two markets to over how many markets? 71 markets around the world. And just take North America, a big market. North America, our growth -- revenue growth was 8%, where the category declined. John, why don't you comment on that? And then let me go back to specialty coffee and retail. Yes. Thanks, John. So Brian, you can see that on our Channels business, every quarter, we get the number, we get the measurement. On our specialty coffee retail, we tend to look at Euromonitor and other longer-term data sources to give us a sense. But right now, the volume of customer occasions that have returned to our stores in the U.S. is phenomenal, and it's exceeded our forecast and our projections in the U.S. And Rossann and her team have adapted rapidly to that. But the thing we're most focused on is how we have rapidly adapted to shifting consumer behaviors that I outlined in sort of my opening comments, how in doing that, we extend and enhance the attributes that differentiate Starbucks from everyone else and how we then create a great experience for our customers in the stores. And the way we do that, the trade area transformation is one important initiative. But the work we do to elevate the customer experience, deliver relevant and exciting new beverages and to extend and enhance digital customer relationships are the three key things. And when you look at what's happening in each one of those areas, there's so much positive activity and initiatives and accomplishments and then customer response to those things that I just believe that we're hitting on the right notes. And at this point, I look and say, we're going to have a two- to three-year tailwind just simply by watching vaccinations progress around the world. This great human reconnection will happen probability 1.0. And so we are positioned for that, and we're trying to -- we're working to enhance and differentiate the brand in ways that are meaningful to us. We're going to take care of our partners. Our partners are the heartbeat of Starbucks. They have risen to the occasion. And so specialty coffee retail is where we set the brand. 100 million of customers a week come to see us, and that's where we establish the brand and then we amplify it through our channels. And I think in both specialty coffee retail and channels, it's happening. And so we'll give you more as though as we get more data on share gains. But I can just feel it and sense it as I look at our data, our numbers, and I'm in our stores and sort of watching what's happening. Well, thank you. I got to say, Brian got me all like energized about what we're doing. And so as we close today's call, I think it's important to reinforce one key message. And that message is that Starbucks is meeting this moment, this moment of the great human reconnection and we anticipated the shifts in consumer behaviors. We accelerated our long-range plans, and we are well positioned to differentiate ourselves even further with the new level of resilience, speed and agility. I got to say, as Rachel was commenting, the strength of this brand and the increasing opportunities for us to offer convenient, elevated personalized experiences for our customers around the world makes me personally very optimistic for the future. Our long-term growth model is solid. And so thank you for your questions. Thanks for joining us today, and have a great evening."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Kevin shared, we are very pleased with the continued momentum in our business, with meaningful sequential improvements in quarterly financial results demonstrating the overall strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand as well as the effectiveness of our strategies, our innovation and our agility. Starbucks reported global revenue of $6.7 billion in Q2, up 11% from the prior year, inclusive of approximately 2% foreign currency favorability, with growth driven by our company-operated retail markets particularly in the U.S. And with these better-than-expected results, we are confidently raising our outlook for the full year as I will explain later. Q2 EPS exceeded our expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected margin recovery. Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.56 increased from $0.28 in the prior year and was $0.15 higher than the upper end of our guidance range inclusive of lower-than-expected restructuring and impairment costs of about $0.04, largely attributable to our more favorable lease exit costs. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.62, up from $0.32 in the prior year and $0.12 above the upper end of our guidance range, primarily driven by continued core business recovery fueled by strong U.S. performance. I will first take you through our Q2 fiscal '21 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. I will then share our improved outlook for the full fiscal year. Our Americas segment delivered revenue of $4.7 billion in Q2, 8% higher than the prior year, driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales, partially offset by lower product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees as a result of the pandemic. As Kevin mentioned, in the U.S., we saw continued sequential improvement in quarterly comparable store sales from minus 5% in the prior quarter to a very strong positive 9% in Q2. Transaction comp improved from minus 21% in Q1 to minus 10% in Q2, with continued strength in average ticket, which remains significantly above pre-pandemic levels. On a cumulative two-year basis, which measures our growth relative to pre-pandemic levels, U.S. comp sales in the month of March grew 11%, implying annual average growth above our long-term algorithm of 4% to 5% and a full sales recovery by the end of Q2, as we previously communicated. America's Q2 non-GAAP operating margin expanded 550 basis points from the prior year to 19.9%, primarily driven by lapping of COVID-19-related costs incurred in the prior year, sales leverage from business recovery, pricing, temporary government subsidies and the benefits of trade area transformation, partially offset by growth in investments in wages and benefits for our store partners. Notably, this represented a meaningful improvement from the prior quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 18.8%. Moving on to International. The International segment delivered revenue of $1.6 billion in Q2. Excluding an 8% favorable impact of warrants currency translation, the segment's revenue in the quarter was 34% higher than the prior year, reflecting a 35% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 4% VAT benefit and an 8% net new store growth over the past 12 months, partially offset by lower product sales to and revenues from our international licensees. In China, we lapped the first anniversary of widespread COVID-related store closures. And as Kevin mentioned, comparable store sales grew 91% in Q2, including VAT favorability of approximately 9 percentage points. The VAT benefit was reinstated for the entire quarter to mitigate the impact of government-mandated restrictions across the mainland, following flare-ups of COVID-19 in several key cities, significantly limiting customer mobility. On a cumulative two-year basis, China comp sales growth in March was minus 5%, including 4% of VAT benefit. International's non-GAAP operating margin rose to 19.6% from 3.9% in the prior year and surpassed Q2 FY '19 margin by 30 basis points, mainly driven by sales leverage, reflecting the lapping of severe impacts in the prior year attributable to the COVID-19 outbreak and favorability from temporary government subsidies in Japan. On to Channel Development. Revenue was $370 million in Q2, a decline of 29% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business and lapping additional product sales in the prior year to Nestle\u0301 to transition foodservice order fulfillment. When excluding the approximately 30% adverse impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development's revenue grew by nearly 2% in Q2, mainly driven by growth in our ready-to-drink business. The segment's non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 46.7% in Q2 from 37.8% in the prior year. Normalizing for the 770 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 120 basis points in Q2, driven primarily by the strength of our ready-to-drink business. Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was 16.1% in Q2, up 690 basis points from 9.2% in the prior year, up 30 basis points from Q2 of fiscal 2019 and an improvement from 15.5% in Q1. The year-over-year increase in our operating margin for Q2 was primarily driven by lapping of COVID-19 impacts but also included stronger-than-expected sales leverage and favorability from temporary government subsidies. The margin expansion in Q2 was partially offset by both growth and investments in wages and benefits for store partners. Moving on to our guidance for fiscal '21. Now that we're at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we have better visibility to anticipated full year results, and therefore, we are raising our full year fiscal '21 EPS guidance as well as updating a few other metrics. The increase is predominantly driven by better-than-expected operating results in the first half of the year, an anticipated benefit attributable to certain discrete tax items in Q4 and a slight tailwind from foreign currency translation, barring, of course, any new significant and sustained ways of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. Our new fiscal '21 GAAP EPS guidance range is $2.65 to $2.75, up from $2.42 to $2.62 previously. Our fiscal '21 non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2.90 to $3, up from our prior range of $2.70 to $2.90. We continue to drive leverage in all areas of our business, giving us confidence in our full year earnings guidance. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges are inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the 53rd week. Given the momentum we've seen in the U.S. business to date, we are raising our guidance for full year fiscal '21 consolidated revenue to a new range of $28.5 billion to $29.3 billion, up from $28 billion to $29 billion. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 consolidated revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately $500 million for the 53rd week. Additionally, we are raising our consolidated operating margin to a range of 16.5% to 17.5%, up from our previous guidance of 16% to 17%, even as we continue to make meaningful investments in our key growth drivers. We continue to expect our operating margin recovery to lag sales recovery by two quarters, improving as the year progresses and approaching our ongoing target range of 18% to 19% at the consolidated level as we exit fiscal '21. As I mentioned earlier, we currently expect certain discrete tax items to favorably impact Q4's tax rate in fiscal '21. Based on current expectation, Q4's tax rate is forecasted to decline to the high teens level, but given the nature of discrete tax items, the timing and magnitude of the favorability are subject to change. In contrast, Q3 tax rate is expected to be slightly higher than our Q2 tax rate. As a result, we now expect our fiscal '21 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the low to mid-20% range. Moving on to comp sales growth. As sales in our two lead growth markets have returned to roughly pre-pandemic levels, albeit with different customer patterns than before the pandemic, we are reverting to our quarterly sales reporting convention at this time and do not anticipate providing monthly comps going forward. And while we continue to see strength in average ticket, we expect it to moderate as customer mobility improves, and we anticipate store visitation frequency will start to normalize in the latter half of fiscal '21. Therefore, we expect a corresponding shift between the mix of traffic and ticket comp as we lap the depth of fiscal '20's pandemic impacts in Q3. As a reminder, our usual one-year reported comps are expected to be outsized as we lap the significant negative comps from the effects of COVID-19 in fiscal '20, which began in late January in China, followed by the U.S. as we exited Q2. Consequently, until we lap fiscal '20's COVID-19-related impacts, we believe that our fiscal '21 comps should be assessed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, the two-year comp growth rate will be more indicative of our underlying performance. I want to underscore that the two-year comps we are monitoring are not calculated on an additive basis, which yield distorted results when lapping large negative comps as the second year comp base is not comparable to the first year. Instead, we are calculating our two-year comps on a multiplicative basis as described in today's earnings release. Finally, to be clear, except for the updates on revenue, EPS, margin and tax rates that I just provided, the remainder of our full year fiscal '21 guidance metrics are unchanged from what we communicated with our Q1 fiscal '21 quarterly earnings report. To summarize, we are delighted that our U.S. business has fully recovered sales as we expected. While we may experience pandemic-related volatility until global herd immunity is attained, we have the protocols in place to respond in real time to ensure the health and safety of our customers and partners while continuing to operate the business. Our performance in Q2 demonstrates the relevance and success of our strategies, with operating margins above the levels of two years ago. Our cash position remains strong and we have meaningfully deleveraged our balance sheet this year by paying off debt maturities totaling nearly $1.7 billion, keeping us on track to approach our 3x leverage target by the end of this fiscal year. Going forward, I want to underscore that we have a clear set of actions underway to continue to drive comp growth and profitability as we move through the year. Importantly though, we will continue to invest in our business strategically with a long game mentality, taking decisive action to ensure that we are continuing to drive shareholder value long into the future. Now more than ever, we remain confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of our growth model, giving us continued confidence in the model shared at our 2020 Investor Day of delivering long-term double-digit EPS growth at scale, with another year of outsized EPS growth expected in fiscal 2022 as we lap this year's recovery curve. Once again, the real credit for our success goes to our more than 400,000 Green Apron partners worldwide who continue to go above and beyond to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience. That experience, above all, fueled our growth this past quarter and will continue to be a competitive advantage in the future. Thank you. And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by Rossann Williams, Brady Brewer and John Culver, as Durga outlined at the top of the call. Thank you. Operator? Sure. Thank you, Kevin. What I would say is when you look at the comp in the U.S. business in the quarter at 9%, to be able to achieve a 9% comp, it really took growth across our overall portfolio. So the overall portfolio grew. Certainly, our stores in the more metro urban areas are still slower to recover but they improved greatly quarter-over-quarter. And of course, the outperformance in our drive-through, so we saw that across the board and across all dayparts, which give us confidence. And to Kevin's point, what helped fuel that, particularly in our more metro areas and urban markets, was the trade area transformation where we're 71% -- about 70% complete with that effort today. As you might remember, we communicated we would close around 800 stores across Americas. And so as we've gone through that, we've been able to overall strengthen the portfolio as part of that effort. So that's playing into some of the recovery as well, as well as the overall mobility that's increased throughout the United States. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Rossann. Sure, Sharon. Thanks for the question. What I would say is China was having a good -- seeing good momentum before we entered into Q2. And then there was a resurgence of COVID that caused restrictions across travel, across actually our International markets impacting China, given this was an important period for a market in terms of holidays and the Chinese New Year. And so as a result, we saw that cause mobility issues in the quarter, which impacted performance and impacted comp. As we saw some of the restrictions start to lift at the end of the quarter, we started to see momentum build, particularly in our key trade zones and key trade areas. For those reasons, we believe in the overall momentum in the market. And the brand continues to be strong, and we're continuing to see great growth in our digital platforms. We're connecting with customers in new and different ways. We continue to open significant amount of new stores. So our confidence in the market continues. And because of that, we felt the comp range was appropriate. There's a lot of volatility in our comps overall. And so for that reason, we kept comp guidance in line with the ranges we had provided previously. That allows us to be able to keep that level of volatility uncertainty within that range as we find our customers continue to return to our business and until our customers have a more routine activity overall, and we see a more return to normal patterns, we think that range is appropriate. And I would just add to that, too, is as we've invested meaningfully in our partners, we've still been able to drive our margin. And as we look at the back half of the year, we've indicated that our margin will lag our sales recovery by about two quarters. And a key component of that is that we're going to continue to invest in our partners as well as equipment and other things to be able to unlock the demand that we have. And that's an important note to remind, it doesn't -- it means we're still going to see strengthening in our business will strengthen as we move throughout the quarters. But I just want to highlight that, that investment continues to be part of why we're guiding our margins the way we are. And it does include inflationary components as we open up the economy and as we move through some of these stages as well. Sure. Thank you, David. Thanks for the question. What I would say is we felt confident in being able to raise our guidance on EPS for the full year. And of course, a big driver of that is our overdelivery and our outperformance in the first two quarters. But as I've mentioned, we expect that our margin is going to lag our sales recovery over the next couple of quarters so we'll lag our sales recovery. And some drivers of that are, we won't see the onetime benefit that we had from the government subsidies that we had in Q2. So we won't have that. We'll start to see our ticket moderate. We still believe that we'll have a slightly elevated ticket as we continue to drive food attach and premiumization of our products as well as shifting customers into cold platforms, but we will see our ticket moderate, which will impact our margin. In addition to that, as I mentioned, we're going to continue to invest in our business. It's critically important as we think about how we unlock the back half of the year and we continue to grow and meet the demand. So we're going to have to continue to invest in partners, continue to invest in technology and equipment in our stores. And finally, there's an inflationary component in there as well. So when you put that together, that's what really drives our guidance. Now what I would say is we would expect to exit Q4, so we'll strengthen from a margin perspective throughout the quarters, but we would expect to exit Q4 approaching the 18% to 19% guidance range that we gave at Investor Day for the long term. So that will show you how the -- how our EPS will essentially strengthen with that margin. And what I can say in terms of next year, we don't provide guidance for next year but what we've already provided, but I would say you can still expect outside performance in line with that approximately 20% as we had previously guided. What I would say is when you think about our overperformance in Q2, so if you think about versus guidance, the fact that we overperformed Q2, the two drivers of that is in the Americas segment and it's the government subsidies, so the onetime government subsidies as well as the better-than-expected recovery. And I would say, fairly equal in nature. Thank you, Kevin, and thank you, Sara, for the question. What I would say is from a trade area transformation perspective, if you think about the Americas segment, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that Americas saw about a 550 basis point improvement on margin in the quarter. A driver of that was trade area transformation. And so what we've seen is what we, I think, outlined in Q2 -- or excuse me, in Q1 of this year is that on a full year basis, at the enterprise level, trade area transformation would be a benefit to margin of about 40 basis points. We saw significant improvement in Q2, and that will still align with approximately 40 basis points on the full year at the enterprise level. But that trade area transformation was a contributing factor to part of the success of the Americas segment in the quarter. And then in terms of the investments that I talked about, certainly, the investments that I've been talking about are across all stores. Largely, our drive-through as we're trying to -- as we're focusing on unlocking capacity and being able to accommodate the demand but it also relates to our cafes as well. But of course, more predominantly, drive-through concepts where we're seeing the majority of our demand currently. And as you might recall, at our Investor Day, we actually increased our comp guidance based on what we have seen from the investments we've been doing. So our comp guidance previously had been in the 3% to 4% range. We increased it to 4% to 5% based on these investments that we're making. And so the fact that these investments are starting to unlock productivity and we're seeing the margin benefit from those, we were able to show, on a long-term basis, that will increase comp and then subsequently increase our margin, allow us to continue to expand our margin and support our EPS growth for the longer term. So that's where you're seeing some of the tailwinds as we make these investments in the near term. Well, thank you, Nicole, for the question. I appreciate it. What I would say is Starbucks is such a powerful brand. I think you see that globally, but as a person who's worked at the Company, you feel it. And so that's, I think, what, for somebody who's been at the Company and left and come back, that is the -- that's the force is really what the brand means and it's less about the symbol but it's more about the people behind it. And there's just an incredible group of people that you work with partners. And it's hard to replicate that. And so from my perspective, that is the as a customer because I'm a customer, too, and I always have been is I feel that when I'm in my store, and I think that resonates when you're part of the Company and even in the corporate office. So I think that's a unique advantage of being part of a company like Starbucks. And what I can say is it's incredible to watch the growth from the Company over the years and to be in a position where I get to work with such an incredibly talented group of leaders to help shape the future of this growth. I think it's an enviable position but it's humbling at the same time. And so I feel grateful for the opportunity. But I appreciate the question. Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, what I would say is we definitely -- I mean, as we start to comp the most severe part of the pandemic from last year, we'll definitely see the construct of our comp shift, and it will return to more of a pre-pandemic level where you see greater transaction and maybe a lower ticket. So we'll definitely see our ticket moderate from the high 20s where we've been. But we believe that some of that will sustain, now not to the degree that it's been, but if you look at some of the behaviors that have driven that, the behaviors that have driven it today are the fact that we have higher beverage attach from group orders, multiple orders. Some of that will probably moderate as people start to go back into the offices and we have more single visits and single-item purchases. But we've had an all-time food attach. This quarter was an all-time record attach on our food. And that's because we're putting forward products that our customers love and enjoy. And so they'll continue to -- if we continue to innovate in the areas that are relevant for them, we continue to see that, that will have -- that will drive food attach. In addition to that, we're seeing, across the board, growth in cold and some of that is from our promotional offerings as well as some of our core offerings. And I think that focus in that area, which is more premium for us in nature is where our customers are gravitating. And so that will also help us to sustain ticket. I just think the issue will be that it will moderate from where it is today, but we have belief that some of those levers that I just spoke about are indeed sticky."

            "name": "John Culver",
            "content": "Yes. And Sharon, what I would just add is, first and foremost, the optimism that we have that as these restrictions are lifted and customers become more mobile, that our business quickly returns to normal operating levels. We saw that in China in the first quarter and early into the second quarter. We saw that in Japan as restrictions were lifted last year. We're seeing that now in Mexico as restrictions have been lifted and vaccinations have improved. We're also optimistic for the U.K. as openings occur in the U.K. and vaccination levels approach over 50%. So all indications are that we're very confident with the comp guidance that we've provided from an International perspective, and to add further to that, we continue to make major investments in our digital footprint and in new stores, so that when these markets open back up to full mobility, that we are in a position to accelerate our growth and move much faster. 71. Yes. What I would say, Brian, is it's a holistic strategy on how we capture the consumer and attract them into the Starbucks brand, whether that's through our retail stores, through down the aisle, through foodservice, through ready-to-drink, it's a holistic strategy. And I would say that over the course of the last year, we are seeing that really come to fruition right now. We've talked about the resurgence of customers coming back to our stores and stores reopened. We've seen the growth of packaged coffee down the aisle during this time, not only in the U.S. but also internationally. The growth in single-serve internationally as well being on the Nespresso platform, Dolce Gusto platform, the Keurig platform. In addition, foodservice is going to continue to play a very important role. We just opened our 1,000th foodservice location in China this past month, and we're going to continue to expand in that way. So it's a holistic strategy. We've been able to, in the U.S., now be the number one brand down the aisle in terms of share, and we've actually grown that share and expanded that number one position in the quarter versus Q1. So we are seeing our customers who have loved Starbucks continue to consume our coffee and to continue to want to experience it in unique ways and we're very humbled by that."

            "content": "Great. Thanks for the question, Jeffrey. We see a lot of opportunity with our Rewards program. It is 52% of total sales in the U.S. And as you heard, we added 1 million new active members just in the last quarter alone. That was on top of the 1 million in the quarter before. And there are a few things that we're doing. One is we want to know as many customers as we possibly can. We want to personalize their experience and we want to make the experience effortless. And so effortless means things like mobile order, curbside, delivery. And we've looked at things like Stars for Everyone, which you've heard us launch about six months ago. Trying to lower the barrier to entry so that customers can get the benefits of the program and experience the incentives and the personalized experience they get through the program. And it's through those efforts that we are attracting more customers into the program. SFE specifically was a program that we launched to make it easier to join and to make purchases in the program with the pay-as-you-go option. So lowering those barriers to entry, reaching as many people with the program and then ensuring that the incentives and the services that are attached to that program to make the experience personalized and effortless. That's how we're growing the program. And we've seen just tremendous results, obviously, over the last six months with those programs, attracting new members and seeing them activate. Yes. The program has been very strong at attracting our high-frequency customers, and so we have a large proportion of high-frequency customers in the program today. And given the incentives of the program, lowering those barriers to entry, we are seeing a significant number of more occasional or lower-frequency customers joining in the program these days. That's helping continue to support that two to three times average versus the non-SR customer in terms of frequency. We still see that high frequency overall for the program. But what's great about seeing those occasional customers join is that we also see that significant lift in frequency and spend from those members just as we do from the high-frequency members that join. So we see tremendous opportunity in bringing that occasional customer into the program, providing them with a great experience, great incentives and experiences that drive their frequency over time. So we see that as a continued opportunity. We see a lot of runway there, as Kevin said, and we'll continue to press on that for the months and years to come."

            "content": "Thank you. The only thing I would add is the interruption of our customers' mobility really impacted our AM morning daypart. And that was daypart that we're most concerned about recovery. Given the morning daypart sales mix percent is largely recovered compared to pre-COVID levels, this means that as a percent of [indiscernible] by daypart, we are seeing the morning percent relatively in line with our pre-COVID trends. We expect this morning trend to sustain as things open back up and people return to the central business districts and the urban trade areas. Interestingly though, we have seen that the daypart is actually moved slightly later in the morning from pre-COVID time of 7:30 to 9:30 a.m. to current times of around 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. What I would add to that is currently, in certain markets at certain times, we are experiencing some labor shortages but it is not a widespread issue at this time. And as Kevin said, we've invested ahead of the curve with our industry-leading benefits and total pay approach, and I feel confident that we will continue to make the necessary investments required to remain a premium player of choice. Now we will obviously continue to watch this very closely over the next few months to ensure that we are continuing of operating stores in a way [indiscernible] customer demand."

I will now turn the call over to Kevin.\nKevin Johnson: Well, good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As I reflect on this past year, clearly, we have all been through a lot, a lot of trying times and a lot of change. And at a time when society and all of humanity are a bit fragile, I am optimistic because this year holds tremendous promise for healing. I believe Starbucks can play an important role in that healing process, bringing people together to feel connected, supporting our communities in a positive and responsible way, and advancing a more equitable and inclusive world. It was just one year ago this week that we temporarily closed stores across China to protect our partners and customers from the coronavirus. We quickly realized the need to establish a set of principles for navigating this virus to operate safely in a global pandemic and then shared our principles and store protocols with every market around the world. That approach has served us well. And I'm proud to say today, our business in China recovered in Q1, in line with our expectations and we remain on track to achieve full sales recovery of our U.S. business by the end of Q2. This journey has not been linear. And because we have operationalized our ability to monitor events in real-time and adapt to the changing conditions store-by-store, our recovery continues to track slightly ahead of our expectations. Since the start of this pandemic, while being guided by our three fundamental principles, our 400,000 Starbucks partners around the world have been well equipped with tools, resources, and support to enable quick decision-making at the store level. The agility with which our partners navigated an unprecedentedly complex global situation, while caring for each other and for our customers, leaves me as confident as ever about Starbucks' long-term outlook. Last month, when we met for our Biennial Investor Conference, we talked about Starbucks' resilience. There were three takeaways from that discussion that I want to iterate as we share this quarter's results. First, our Growth at Scale agenda that we established almost three years ago has sharpened our focus, enabled disciplined execution, enhanced our ability to allocate capital to its highest and best uses, and unleashed a growth mindset throughout Starbucks. Second, our speed and agility has enabled us to rapidly adapt to changing consumer behaviors and strengthened our competitive position. And third, we have an innovation agenda for our customer experience and for store transformation that positions us well for future growth. Now, I want to share with you results from Q1 that reinforce our belief that Starbucks is stronger and more resilient than ever. Let me begin in the U.S. Our first quarter comparable store sales of minus 5% in the U.S., improved from the prior quarter's minus 9%. Even with pandemic-related business disruption in the latter half of the quarter that significantly reduced our ability to offer in-store seating, with over 60% of our U.S. company-operated stores offering limited seating as we entered our fiscal Q1, comparable store sales improved in October, building on the momentum we saw in the prior quarter. When COVID-19 cases began to surge mid-quarter, we adjusted our operations to grab and go in alignment with our principles and in support of regulatory requirements across a number of states. We rapidly adapted and ended the quarter with approximately 40% of our U.S. stores offering limited seating. Underpinned by our powerful innovation agenda, our phenomenal green apron partners delivered a very strong holiday performance in Q1, building positive momentum on our path to full U.S. comp recovery. Importantly in Q1, we laid a solid foundation for achieving our fiscal 2021 goals by further advancing the three business driving initiatives fundamental to our Growth at Scale agenda: elevating the customer experience, driving relevant beverage innovation, and expanding digital customer engagement. I will now share some notable highlights from Q1 and our traffic driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021, starting with elevating the customer experience. We believe that many of our customers have adapted to their work or study from home realities. Their Starbucks visit has evolved from the stop on the way to a destination to being the destination worth leaving home for, because it is safe, familiar, and convenient. The work we have done to increase throughput in drive-thru, expand our digital reach, enable curbside pickup, and expand delivery capabilities was evident in Q1. U.S. stores with drive-thrus saw a slight improvement in out-the-window times and delivered positive comps throughout Q1. They drove over half of net sales in Q1, increasing more than 10% from pre-pandemic levels. These results give us confidence that our targeted initiatives to unlock capacity and enhance the customer experience at our drive-thru locations are boosting our business recovery, while strengthening our foundation for future growth. Our industry-leading mobile app continues to be an important tool for us to elevate the customer experience as a safe, convenient, and personalized way to order Starbucks. This quarter, mobile orders represented 25% of U.S. company-operated transactions in Q1, up from 17% before the pandemic, providing clear evidence that our initiatives are resonating with customers. We continue to see average ticket meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels, driven by group order. A combination of increased beverage attach, premium beverage mix, increased customization and upsizing, and an all-time high food attachment, all drove U.S. ticket growth of approximately 19% in Q1. In addition, our seasonal holiday beverage lineup, combined with our creative holiday marketing, created excitement amongst our green apron partners and drew customers into our stores. This year, we kicked off holiday with familiar beverages such as Peppermint Mocha and, of course, Starbucks joyful holiday cups, a 23-year ritual. Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew's tremendous success in last quarter's lineup provided a strong prelude to the December return of the new holiday favorite, Irish Cream Cold Brew. Our cold beverages continued to resonate with customers led by Iced White Chocolate Mocha, Iced Chai Latte, and Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, with all three delivering positive year-on-year growth. Food outperformed our expectations in Q1, driven by strength in breakfast wraps, the Impossible Breakfast Sandwich and holiday bakery items such as the Snowman Cookie and, of course, my grandson's favorite cake pops. Finally, we saw accelerating growth of digital customer relationships and customer engagement, a key highlight of the quarter. Following our successful launch of Stars for Everyone in Q4, Starbucks Rewards achieved phenomenal results in Q1, providing a strong foundation for growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards member base, to whom we directly communicate and provide personalized offers, increased by 2.5 million members in Q1 to a record 21.8 million. Now, this result surpassed our pre-COVID member base, representing a 15% increase relative to the same quarter in prior year. I'm also happy to say that this holiday season, Starbucks Card activations, the cornerstone of our holiday gift program, exceeded our expectations. Starbucks Cards are a customer favorite for holiday gifting and are widely available through our stores and other distribution channels, including digitally. The success of Starbucks Cards illustrates the strong emotional bonds that we've created with customers and the relevance of the Starbucks experience even in the current environment. As the number of active Starbucks Rewards members grew during the quarter, so did their engagement. Rewards customers contributed 50% of U.S. company-operated sales in Q1, up from 43% last year before the onset of COVID-19, and up from 47% in the prior quarter, demonstrating our loyal customers' resilience and affinity for Starbucks. Any way you look at it, our first quarter results were quite strong in the U.S., particularly considering the headwind we faced from the current surge in COVID infections. I will now move on to China, our second lead growth market. Building on the positive momentum from the past two quarters, the China leadership team delivered another great quarter, which is a testament to our ability to rapidly adapt to changing conditions while focusing on the customer experience, new beverage innovation, and continued expansion of digital customer relationships just as we continue to do in the U.S. We delivered an impressive positive 5% comparable store sales growth in Q1, but what is most remarkable about our recovery in China is the rapid reacceleration of new store development, which is our number one driver of growth in that market. I'm pleased to share that in Q1; we opened almost 160 stores and crossed the 4,800 store milestone. That equates to 13% growth in net new stores over the last 12 months, which is particularly impressive considering that we suspended new store development activities for a couple of months at the onset of the pandemic in China. We entered 15 new cities in the quarter and stores in these cities are off to a strong start with customer traffic outperforming that of new stores in other cities in China. The performance of these new stores underscores our continued confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for Starbucks in China. We continue to dramatically expand digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program as evidenced by the number of 90-day active Rewards members growing to 15.4 million in Q1, a record increase of 51% versus the prior year and 14% over the previous quarter. In addition, we achieved record sales for this year's Double 11 campaign which grew by 86% versus last year and we also set a single-day retail sales record on our Starbucks Rewards members' night. Member engagement campaigns and additional functionalities launched through our Starbucks app and mini apps boosted member engagement and frequency throughout the quarter. In fact, with Starbucks Now Mobile Order & Pay services available across 99% of our store base and with Starbucks Delivers in 85% of our store base in China, Mobile Order sales mix hit a record 30% of the company's China sales, up from 26% in the last quarter with 14% driven by Starbucks Delivers and 16% from Starbucks Now. Rewards customer engagement continues to grow as mobile ordering has more than doubled in China over the past year. Starbucks remains Chinese consumers' first choice in the away-from-home coffee category and is the most talked about coffee brand on social media in China. The brand is stronger than ever in our fastest growing market. And finally, a few comments on our Channel Development business. The strategic value of our Channel Development segment in the current environment is clear. The availability of Starbucks' products through multiple channels has secured Starbucks leadership position in the category, acting as a brand amplifier for our specialty coffee retail business. The demand we saw last quarter in Starbucks At Home remained high, boosting our share of the coffee market outside of specialty retail. In the U.S., Starbucks share of total package coffee grew significantly in the quarter with dollar sales up nearly 14%, nearly twice the category average. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9 has been a powerful partnership and I'm proud to say that for the first time ever, we finished calendar year 2020 as the number one coffee brand across the entire coffee category. Think about it, Starbucks is now the number one coffee brand ahead of all premium and mainstream choices. In addition, consumption of our U.S. Ready-to-Drink coffee products in partnership with PepsiCo grew 18% in the quarter. The introduction of Ready-to-Drink Nitro Cold Brew which was the number one innovation in the category last year, exceeded sales expectations. Unsurprisingly, our food service business continues to be impacted in the current environment with softness in workplace coffee consumption as well as business and leisure travel, which was partially offset by overall strength in our At Home Coffee and Ready-to-Drink businesses. With Nestl\u00e9, we entered four new markets in the quarter bringing Starbucks At Home Coffee presence through the Global Coffee Alliance to 66 markets in just over two years. Overall, we are proud of our alliance with Nestl\u00e9 and pleased with the accelerated global expansion of the Starbucks brand through our Channels business. Now, before I hand the call over to Pat, I want to close by sharing a perspective and recognizing my Starbucks partners. Throughout this year, Starbucks will celebrate our 50th anniversary as a company and in that 50 years, since 1971, the most important ingredient that has created this iconic company are the Starbucks partners, who share a powerful connection to our mission, a mission grounded in human experience and brought to life through our values and company culture. It is those same Starbucks partners who are navigating the global pandemic, caring for one another, creating welcoming experiences for our customers, showing up in our communities, bringing new ideas and accelerating innovation, and rapidly adapt to our new reality every step of the way, showing the compassion and courage necessary to transform into this new version of Starbucks, a company that is more resilient, stronger than ever, and fully committed to a bright future full of adventure, growth, and positive impact on those we touch. And as markets around the world work tirelessly to vaccinate billions of people, we are prepared for what can only be described as the great human reconnection where people once again connect with others face-to-face to heal, to belong, to reflect, to share, and to celebrate, to celebrate what it means to be part of humanity. And as Starbucks partners, we are here for that great human reconnection where our third place environment once again brings people together if even for a brief moment, to uplift our customers with a smile, a personal connection, a handcrafted beverage, and a place where all are welcome. Starbucks was built for this moment. And to my Starbucks partners around the world, we all know that our purpose goes far beyond the pursuit of profit. This is our moment and I am proud to be your partner and grateful for everything you do for Starbucks, for each other, for our customers, and for the communities we are all a part of. I am optimistic about our shared future and I want to say thank you. Now, before he walks you through our Q1 results, I want to close by sharing my sincere gratitude for Pat Grismer. He has helped lead us through unprecedented change and transformative growth at an amazing pace in his time with Starbucks and he has played an instrumental role in unlocking considerable shareholder value over the past two years. I appreciate Pat's partnership with the entire leadership team at Starbucks and the lasting legacy he is leaving. Pat as you prepare to retire, I want to thank you and wish you the very best in your next chapter. You leave the company in the great hands of a 16-year partner, Rachel Ruggeri, who is incredibly well positioned to assume the mantle of Starbucks' Chief Financial Officer on February 1st. Having worked closely together for many years, I look forward to partnering with you, Rachel as you lead our finance function and contribute as a valuable partner on our executive leadership team. Further, as you all may have seen today, Roz has accepted an incredible opportunity as Chief Executive Officer at another publicly traded company. She will be leaving Starbucks at the end of February and her next role is expected to be disclosed in the days ahead. In the meantime, I want to share that we're very excited for her and are grateful for her many contributions over the years in leading our operations across the America. Roz, on behalf of the entire leadership team, I want to thank you for your leadership and wish you every success in your new role, congratulations. With these shifts, I am immensely proud to have a very strong bench of Starbucks veterans who represent the next generation of leadership for our company. Rachel Ruggeri succeeding Pat as CFO and as we flatten the organization, Rossann Williams, President of our North America Retail business and Brady Brewer, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, will now be reporting directly to me, taking on what have previously been responsibilities of our Chief Operating Officer. Combined, these three talented leaders have more than 45 years of Starbucks experience and we will not miss a beat. Rachel, Rossann, and Brady building on your passion, authenticity, and many years of success at Starbucks, I am excited about our next phase of Starbucks' growth together. I'd like to thank all of my partners for their support as we are well-positioned for the future. And now with that, I will turn the call over to Pat. Pat?\nPat Grismer: Thank you, Kevin and good afternoon everyone. As Kevin shared, we are very pleased with our start to fiscal 2021 with meaningful sequential improvements in quarterly financial results despite ongoing business disruption from the pandemic, again demonstrating the new level of resilience that we have introduced into the business during these unprecedented times. Starbucks reported global revenue of $6.7 billion in Q1, down 5% from the prior year. Q1 EPS was higher than the guidance range we provided on our last earnings call, primarily driven by better than expected margin recovery. Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.53, declined from $0.74 in the prior year, but outperformed our guidance range as it also benefited from lower than expected restructuring and impairment costs as I will discuss in greater detail later. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down from $0.79 in the prior year, primarily due to the lingering impact of the pandemic. I will first take you through our Q1 fiscal 2021 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. I will then share some perspective on our outlook for Q2 and the full fiscal year. Our Americas segment delivered revenue of $4.7 billion in Q1, 6% lower than the prior year, primarily due to a 6% decline in comparable store sales as well as lower product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees as a result of the pandemic. As Kevin mentioned, in the U.S., we saw continued sequential improvement in quarterly comparable store sales from minus 9% in the prior quarter to minus 5% in Q1. As we entered Q1, October improved modestly to minus 3% from minus 4% in September. Then, as the quarter progressed, U.S. comparable store sales were minus 4% and minus 8% in November and December respectively, primarily due to pandemic-related operating restrictions across several states, which impacted customer mobility. As Kevin also noted, approximately 40% of our U.S. company-operated store base was offering limited seating at the end of the quarter, down from more than 60% at the beginning of the quarter. So, we are quite pleased with our comparable store sales performance in Q1 in light of these increasing restrictions. Americas Q1 non-GAAP operating margin contracted 320 basis points from the prior year to 18.8%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 including sales deleverage and additional costs incurred as well as growth in retail partner wages and benefits. These impacts were partially offset by improved labor efficiency driven in part by order consolidation and sales mix shift as well as pricing. Notably, this represented a significant improvement from the previous quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 16.7%. Moving on to International, the International segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q1. Excluding a 5% favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue in the quarter was flat relative to the prior year, reflecting 8% net new store growth over the past 12 months offset by lower product sales to and royalties from our international licensees as a well as a 3% decline in comparable store sales, primarily due to COVID-19 inclusive of a 3% VAT benefit. In China, comparable store sales grew 5% in Q1, including VAT favorability of nearly five percentage points, were slightly positive when excluding the impact of VAT for the quarter. In line with our previous outlook, we substantially recovered our sales in China by the end of calendar 2020 even when excluding the temporary VAT benefit, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand in our fastest growing market. In December, China's comparable store sales were up 4% or only slightly negative when excluding the nearly five percentage point VAT exemption benefit for the month, an improvement from October and November when excluding each month's VAT exemption benefit and setting aside the mid-Autumn festival seasonal shift that benefited October. International's non-GAAP operating margin declined by 100 basis points to 20.4% mainly due to sales deleverage as a result of the pandemic, partially offset by improved labor efficiency. Much like the Americas, this represented a very significant improvement from the previous quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 16.3%. On to Channel Development, revenue was $371 million in Q1, a decline of 25% from the prior year, primarily due to a 22% unfavorable impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business. When excluding the impact of these transition related activities, Channel Development's revenue declined by 3% in Q1, mainly driven by the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the segment's foodservice business, partially offset by growth in our Ready-to-Drink business. The segment's non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 48.7% in Q1 from 36.6% in the prior year. Normalizing for the 840 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 370 basis points in Q1, driven primarily by the strength of our Ready-to-Drink business. Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was 15.5% in Q1, down from 18.2% year-over-year, but a substantial improvement from 13.2% in Q4. Unsurprisingly, much of the year-over-year reduction in our operating margin for Q1 was due to sales deleverage attributable to COVID-19 as well as growth in wages and benefits, partially offset by store labor efficiencies and pricing in the Americas. Moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2021 and starting with GAAP EPS. In Q1, GAAP EPS was $0.16 higher than the upper end of our guidance range, primarily reflecting lower than expected restructuring costs related to our trade area transformation initiative. This upside was attributable to two things. First, a shift in the timing of store closures to future quarters and second, a reduction in average restructuring cost per closed store. As we expect these lower restructuring costs to sustain, we are raising our full year fiscal 2021 GAAP EPS guidance by $0.08 from a range of $2.34 to $2.54 to a new range of $2.42 to $2.62, both inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the 53rd week. Now, moving to non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our strong start to the year combined with a tailwind from foreign currency translation as evidenced in our Q1 results provides optimism that we have the potential to exceed our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance barring of course, any new significant and sustained waves of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. However, given where we are at in our fiscal year with three quarters to go and considering that we're continuing to see volatility from the pandemic, we believe it is prudent to provide a comprehensive guidance update with our second quarter earnings report, by which time we'll have much better visibility to full year results. Therefore, setting aside the updated fiscal 2021 GAAP EPS guidance I just mentioned, we reaffirm all other full year fiscal 2021 guidance for now including non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.90, again, inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the extra week. We will however provide guidance for selected Q2 metrics given our better visibility to near-term trends which provide further evidence of recovery in line with our overall expectations. In the U.S., we expect to report a comparable store sales decline of approximately 2% for the month of January, representing a marked improvement from December's 8% decline. Then, as we lap material adverse COVID-19 impacts in the month of March, we expect U.S. comparable store sales growth of approximately 5% to 10% for the second quarter. This is consistent with our previous outlook that we would achieve full sales recovery in our U.S. business by the end of Q2 with a two-quarter lag beyond that before we expect to see full margin recovery. In China, we are seeing another wave of COVID-19 infections in selected provinces and a corresponding impact to customer mobility and store operating protocols. In addition, we started to lap material adverse COVID-19 impacts last week and this will continue through the remainder of Q2. Combining these two items, we expect to report a comparable store sales decline of approximately 7% for the month of January and comparable store sales growth of nearly 100% for the second quarter, reflecting very significant lapping effects in the months of February and March. On a two-year basis, that would equate to roughly flat compound growth in the second quarter as we move through the one-year anniversary of COVID-related store closures and return to our long-term growth algorithm in China. From an EPS perspective in Q2, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.36 to $0.41 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.45 to $0.50. These estimates reflect the comparable store sales growth estimates that I just provided as well as the normal margin seasonality we see in our business comparing Q2 to our holiday-driven Q1. To be clear, except for GAAP EPS, the rest of our full year fiscal 2021 guidance metrics are unchanged from what we communicated with our Q4 fiscal 2020 quarterly earnings report. This includes our expectation that our retail operating segments will deliver significant margin improvement on a non-GAAP basis as fiscal 2021 progresses, yielding meaningfully higher EPS in the third and fourth quarters than the first two quarters of the year. To summarize, we are delighted with the pace of business recovery in Q1 and the momentum that it provides for fiscal 2021, our China market has substantially recovered, although it is experiencing recent volatility and our U.S. business is on track to fully recover in the current quarter as we previously communicated. As a result, we remain confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of our growth model. I want to express my appreciation to our green apron partners for the critical role that they continue to play in our overall business recovery. Before I conclude, I'd like to thank Kevin and the Starbucks team. It has been an honor to be a Starbucks partner and I am proud of what we've accomplished as a team to unlock considerable shareholder value over the past two years. I am thrilled to pass the CFO baton to Rachel Ruggeri, a key member of our senior finance team. Rachel and I have been partnering to ensure a smooth transition and I would like to invite her to share a few words on this call. Thank you. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Pat. I'm honored and humbled to assume the role of Chief Financial Officer at Starbucks. In my 16 years with the company, Starbucks has never been better positioned for long-term growth and I look forward to working with Kevin, our executive leadership team, and of course the partners around the globe to unlock that growth with focus and discipline. And to our investors and financial analysts who have joined us today, I very much look forward to speaking with you soon. And with that, I will turn today's call over to the operator to begin our Q&A session. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much and congratulations to Pat and Roz on your new ventures. Good luck and we will miss you. Pat or Kevin or Roz or all three, how do we think about the dynamic between check growth and traffic growth in the coming quarters? I mean we've never seen this kind of dynamic where traffic has fallen so much, check has gone up. How do you think -- do you think it just sort of -- just normalizes? Or is it chance? Or is there programs to continue to get that check benefit even as traffic recovers or maybe there's an outperformance on comp on that basis? And Pat, how much benefit to margin has that decline in traffic and bundling of orders benefited? How we think about the margin impact as traffic comes back, but maybe those check averages come down over time?\nKevin Johnson: Yes, John, this is Kevin. Let me share a perspective on that. First of all, a big reason for the increase in ticket is group ordering. And certainly, as we have grab and go and customers are looking for safe, familiar convenient experiences, customers are coming in and they are purchasing multiple beverages, multiple food items for larger groups than in the past, which is why traffic is down and ticket is up. That said, I think, as we start reopening seating in our stores, as vaccinations continue to propagate around the world, we're going to see that normalize, but I do think there's going to be a long-term positive impact on ticket. I do think through this period, I think, customers have gotten very, very used to more premium beverages, more higher degree of food attach. And I think -- I don't -- I actually think ticket will come out of this higher than it was when we went into it while transactions recovered. Now, how long that takes? I think that's a function of how vaccinations unfold in different markets around the world and how quickly people get back to more normal foot traffic patterns and more normal work and school patterns. And let me just ask if \u2013 Roz, if you want to add any additional perspective on that as it relates to the U.S.?\nRoz Brewer: Yes, Kevin, I do. There's a couple of things here to think about in terms of the contributors. Kevin mentioned the higher beverage attach, the higher food attach. There's also the shift to cold beverages. And what we see in cold beverages is a couple of things. If you think about the decline in transactions that we've seen in our central business districts and our metro markets, those areas carry single beverages, and they were higher than average brewed coffee and those grew really at a lower range than our ticket options. So, what we're doing in beverage innovation is replacing that with cold beverages and replacing that with plant-based. And so that's why we're seeing this improved food attach. And so we feel confident that those kinds of innovations are going to keep that ticket higher than what we've seen in the past.\nKevin Johnson: Pat, you want to take a second part of John's question?\nPat Grismer: Yes. Thank you. In relation to the impact of the higher ticket on margin and how we expect that to normalize over time, to Kevin's point, we do anticipate that some of that ticket growth will sustain and with that some margin benefit will linger, but there will be as customer behavior normalizes, some reversal -- some of that margin benefit. But it's important to highlight some of the other ongoing initiatives underway in our store operations to build new levels of productivity, whether the deployment of handheld POS to improve throughput at the drive-thru and how we believe that will not only increase our capacity, but deliver some margin enhancements, or what we're doing to deploy new equipment, both new espresso machines as well as new ovens that help us to reduce transaction times out the window, or just ongoing operational engineering work to ensure that our operating routines -- we've adopted new protocols continue to achieve higher levels of efficiency in terms of how we deploy our labor. So, there are a number of other activities underway that will drive new levels of productivity and unlock further margin benefit even as some of the sales activity normalizes and with that reverses some of the margin benefits that we've seen here recently.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, good afternoon and congratulations, Roz, on the news, but we'll be sad to see you go. I guess I had a question on Stars for All, and it's probably best directed to Roz. As you rolled that out, clearly, you saw the membership jump in the U.S. I mean, how much of that is directly related to Stars for All, if you could kind of quantify that? And then any kind of quantitative elements on potentially how these Stars for All members differ from pre-existing cohorts of members and how you've kind of trended and potentially upselling them to the higher level of Starbucks Rewards?\nRoz Brewer: Great. Thank you, Sharon, for that note of congratulations. So, just a little bit on SFE. The story behind SFE is we provided for our customer base the option for payment removal. And we knew that was one of the most significant sections that we had in growing our Starbucks Rewards members. So, this strong member growth that we're seeing is not only surpassing our pre-COVID highs, but it's pushing well behind and you saw the numbers, 22 million active members, that's up 15% year-over-year. And it's helping us really fuel the all-time highs that we're seeing in Starbucks Rewards as they convert. And right now, our Starbucks Rewards percent of tenders is reaching nearly $0.50 -- 50%, as Kevin mentioned. So, we are seeing some significant improvement with Stars for Everyone. Also, too, quarter-over-quarter, our mobile app downloads grew by plus 5% and our acquisitions grew 13%. So, we're seeing some significant movement in there in terms of how the conversion rate. The everything you asked for if there's any qualitative difference between who we're seeing coming in, we're just seeing just an expansion of our customer and just more love for the brand as we apply SFE. And so really, we don't have the exact numbers in terms of qualitatively how they differ. We just know that we have addressed a significant concern with payment removal. So, we're pleased with what we see so far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks and congrats everybody on their new roles. All the best Pat and Roz. Question on capacity and throughput. I mean, look, going back to the mid-2000s, I can think of times when Starbucks talked about reaching near capacity levels. And, of course, some of those comments seem funny now, given the fact that you've come so much further in terms of your AUVs, especially after all you've done with mobile order and pay in terms of smoothing out the service for that and then the drive-thru expansion has also raised that. But I go by those drive-thrus and a lot of them look pretty full. And I wonder about the post-vaccine world and how much you think about capacity utilization or basically coming up on these bottlenecks, particularly in the drive-thru as we get to a post-vaccine reality. Could you talk about that? And what you might be working on to maximize your growth after the vaccine? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: Yes, Roz, why don't you take that and go through a little bit of the initiatives that we've done to increase throughput on the different channels? And then maybe I'll comment, but why I don't I let you take that question.\nRoz Brewer: Sure. So, we have quite a bit of work happening around our service experience and everything that we're seeing around the drive-thru as we have so many of our stores in the drive-thru position right now. First of all, let me speak about our future real estate. When we looked at our most productive model, it is the drive-thru. So, in our go forward position, you'll see an increased number of drive-thrus that we're building in the Central United States and across the Southeast and the Southwest. So, drive-thru in terms of the numbers will grow. Also, two, there are three main approaches that we have to enhance the drive-thru productivity. First of all, is to optimize the current state. And that's looking at our operation standards and that's the focus on driving our increased out the window times. And so that's reinforcing all of our processes in store making sure that our baristas can operate efficiently and that's the ongoing work that we will do. The second piece is we're developing and testing some drive-thru forward solutions and that includes our handheld POS, which right now we have about 300 drive-thru stores with handheld POS and we'll have 500 of those stores by the end of February. And so we're also adding to that the tech improvement to make orders more easily managed through our consolidation and handoff. We call that our bump bar replacement. And then in addition, we're also targeting the renovation of 150 drive-thru constraint stores that have either issues in terms of meeting the new productivity model from an engine design or removing the pastry case and getting things situated, single point of sales and other solutions. And then there's a final piece, the future drives for concepts and those are things like drive-thru-only stores that have no seating, very small units, the side-by-side drive-thru lanes that we are bringing on to the footprint. So, it's -- we've got considerable work in this area to unlock the full potential for drive-thru.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you very much. I would actually like to pivot from that question. In terms of opportunities for the 40% of stores that do not have drive-thru, that do have seating, that the maybe the possibility of a drive-thru even on relocation isn't even possible within the trade area, could you have like some of the things that you can do to increase throughput overall consumer usage, whether on a late-COVID basis, or even a post-COVID basis to make that cohort of stores more productive? That's the first question. And then secondly, if I can sneak it in considering that the transactions which are down all set, obviously, by via by ticket, you know, labor hours, presumably are down at the store. Do you have a sense of how variable labor should be? In other words, if transactions increased by 10%, is there a type of percent that you would think labor hours should increase this as we kind of think about rebuilding the models for the out years. Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: Thanks John. Roz, why don't you take the first question that John asked, and then Pat will follow-up on the second question that he asked.\nRoz Brewer: Yes, John. Thanks for the question. So, thinking of productivity and models that may not have a drive-thru, we're looking at everything to that we can do on the inside of the building. As Pat mentioned, we have our next generation espresso machine that actually allows us to have a much faster pool with multiple coffee offerings. And then also two, we have our new warming ovens and those have also an improved operational times and standard improvements. It's also important that we talk about the work that we're doing with deep brew and this -- and deep brew is our work that allows us to apply AI to our equipment and the processes in the store and that's improving productivity within the store. So, there's considerable work that's happening in our cafe seated stores. And you'll see those things roll out over the next several quarters here. Pat?\nPat Grismer: And John, as to your question regarding variable labor, what we focus on his flow through on variable sales and that's particularly important as we expect continued sales recovery and then back into growth in the back half of the year. And even as we continue to make significant new investments in the middle of P&L in order to unlock future growth opportunity, we fully expect very meaningful sales leverage that comes with what we target as an approximate 50% flow through on those variable sales. And that includes what we derive by way of leverage on fixed labor. So, there is a variable labor component that is embedded in that calculation. But importantly, it acknowledges that there is a fair portion of our total cost structure inclusive of labor that is fixed in terms of how we operate these stores. So, as we recover sales and further build from that point, we anticipate margin expansion as a consequence of sales leverage that helps to offset the impact of the additional investments we're making to unlock future growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\nSara Senatore: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about China, please. Obviously, that was a very strong 5% comp, I was wondering if you could just talk about in the past, in the context you've given for potentially slower China comps for competition, and also intentionally opening new stores and sort of own cannibalization, if you will? Year ago, if I look back, you had kind of 3% comp and 16% unit growth, and now you're 5% comp and 13% unit growth. Could you maybe talk about how much of this comp, which certainly again, very strong, especially considering even -- and flat, even ex that, how much of that -- my bet would be a function of less cannibalization versus less competition. And related to that I think new unit economics are still very good, but maybe down a little bit from where they were. So, just trying to understand what the sort of competitive and operational environment look like now?\nKevin Johnson: Sara, thanks for the question. Maybe, John, I'll have you talk a little bit about what's happening in China new store growth and how we continue to drive China. And then let's go to Pat, Pat can reinforce kind of our view on the long-term growth model for China that we outlined at the Investor Day in December.\nJohn Culver: Okay. Thanks for the question, Sara. And clearly, we're very proud of the work that team in China has done to navigate the COVID situation and the current surge that we're seeing in the market to basically substantially recover and in line with our expectations for the quarter and deliver a 5% comp, topline growth rate of 15% and an acceleration of new stores to 160 in the quarter is really remarkable given the current environment that we're operating. And we continue to be very optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity and the continued recovery that is going to take place throughout this fiscal year. Our new stores continue to perform very well. As I said, we opened 160 stores, 30% growth over the last 12 months and that includes a time period where we slow down or halted all store growth as we navigated the COVID crisis beginning last year at this time. We're seeing really strong performance and uptick with the Starbucks Now expansion. We're opening 24 cities -- I'm sorry, opened 24 stores in nine different cities in the quarter and we have a total of 40 stores and we'll continue to expand that concept. And then the last piece beyond the store piece is the acceleration of digital and the digital footprint. And Kevin hit on this a little bit in his comments, but this is also fueling the growth during the pandemic as we navigate. Our 90-day actives increased at 15.4 million members, that's 56% increase over the previous year and that's 14% increase over the previous quarter, which is great. And then clearly mobile order sales mix at 30% with MOP at 16% and deliver at 14% is strong growth. So, our total mobile order sales are now two times what they were last year at this time. So, clearly we have put in place a model that has been able to navigate the pandemic environment. And we feel very optimistic and delivering the delivering the guidance that path look forward of achieving the 100% comp for the second quarter and relative with flat growth on a two year basis for the market.\nPat Grismer: Thanks John and Sara to build on what John has said to put into perspective how we're thinking about comp growth in China long-term, you may recall at our December 2018 Investor Conference, we guided China comp growth of 1% to 3%. In recent quarters, we had delivered in the low single-digits. And we acknowledged at the time that as a consequence of a more tempered pace of growth in the broader economy, intensified competition and the sales transfer that comes from an aggressive pace of new unit development, that 1% to 3% was a reasonable expectation. Fast forward to our Investor Day, just a couple of months ago, where we updated that to a new range of 2% to 4%. I would say in relation to the factors I mentioned, no material change to the economy, competition, or sales transfer. But importantly, as John mentioned, significant improvements in our digital capability and how that has all resonated with our customers in China, which underpins our confidence in raising that long-term comp guidance range for China to this 2% to 4%, which we believe is quite powerful in the context of very aggressive unit development given the strong appeal of our brand and the outstanding unit level economics that delivers superior returns for us in China.\nJohn Culver: And Sara just one of the things that I would just add, as well, is -- and Kevin hit on this a little bit in terms of the strength of the Starbucks brand in the market. And clear -- we are the clear leader in terms of brand affinity and visitation across all coffee houses. We're the first choice in away-from-home handcrafted coffee beverages for customers. And as a matter of fact, one in two consumers prefer Starbucks versus anybody else's coffee in the marketplace. So, we feel we're in a very strong position from a consumer standpoint and a customer perspective to really emerge out of the challenges that we're facing in a very strong way and that gives us confidence for the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you. Pat, congrats on retirement and Rachel, congrats on your new role. And Roz, based on the headlines coming out now, I guess look forward to seeing you at Walgreens, hopefully selling lots of Starbucks coffee. My question is on the labor side of things, which seems to be very topical, and happy to hear you guys talk about ongoing efficiencies. But when people talk about labor lately, it seems like there's a lot of opposing forces, obviously, you have the national minimum wage potentially going up on one. But then you have the elevated unemployment, which historically implies ample labor and therefore managing your costs better. So, just wondering if you can provide any thoughts in terms of your labor cost, and maybe employee availability outlook? I know you guys are an employer of choice, but your ability to offset the pressure, whether it's request saves technology, menu pricing, how you kind of think about those offsetting forces from a labor cost perspective? Thank you.\nKevin Johnson: Yes, Jeffrey thanks for your questions. Let me kind of lead off with the perspective and then I'll hand over to Pat to put some numbers around it. But fundamentally look we believe in investing in our partners, it is our green apron partners who create that experience for our customers. And so we know when we invest in our partners and put them in the position to do the best job they can and serving our customers that our customer connection scores go up and our traffic goes up, and our sales go up. There's a direct correlation between investment in partners, customer connection scores, and traffic increase. And I think that's the first thing to note. So, that's why you saw us make a fairly significant increase in wage and benefits here in the U.S. as we went into this fiscal year. Second, then we find ways to help offset some of that in two ways. Number one is just productivity and throughput. We have a 20,000 square foot Tryer Center, we call it our Tryer Center, and think of it as a Silicon Valley incubation lab, right downstairs here in Seattle. And we have some of the world's best human-centered design engineers that work down there with our partners, to find ways to help them improve their productivity. Oftentimes, it has to do with the store layout, oftentimes it has to do with the equipment, what kinds of ovens, what's the -- how can we make things easier for partners to do their jobs. And so that helps offset some of that increase in wage. And then the other is automating administrative tasks. Things that whether it's -- we've had -- we've got deep brew helping automate inventory management stores, helping reduce the amount of time that partners have to count inventory and fill out forms and now technology is playing a role doing that. Other examples our Mastrena II machines that we're putting in our stores have -- are instrumented with Internet of Things sensors in them. And those sensors every shot of espresso, it sends telemetry data back to our data center. And through machine learning, we can predict when a when it is one of our Mastrena machines needs to be maintained, or needs to be cleaned or calibrated. And by doing that, we prevent the situation where perhaps the partner comes to open the store in the morning and one of the Mastrena machines is down. So, technology to automate administrative tasks that help provide the best environment for our partners to do what they do best, which is handcrafted beverages and connecting with our customers. And then the way that we get productivity by just thinking about the human-centered design experience we create for partners in the stores. That helps offset the increase. And Pat I'll hand to you to help add a little bit more numerics around that.\nPat Grismer: Thank you, Kevin. What I would add is that much -- the same way I talked about China, is how we're thinking about the U.S. in relation to improved comps on the back of investments we're making in the brand with investments in our store partners being a critically important investment. And to put that in numerical terms, a couple of years ago, when we guided at our Investor Day, at the time a 3% to 4% comp expectation for our U.S. business. More recently at our Investor Day, we raised that to a range of 4% to 5%. And that is entirely the result of our confidence in the returns that we will get on these investments led by investments in our partners, but also significant investments in our digital platforms. And what that does to unlock the full sales potential of a Starbucks brand, yielding significant sales leverage that not only pays for these investments, but enables what we continue to expect by way of modest annual margin expansion, which is a fundamental part of our ability to convert revenue growth long-term of 8% to 10% to operating income growth of 9% to 11%. So, as Kevin mentioned, all of these things work together, investment combined with productivity to combine further with sales leverage to land the ongoing margin expansion that forms a fundamental part of our overall earnings growth model.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Just echo everyone else Pat and Roz. Best wishes in your next chapter and Rachel, good luck in your new role as well. Kevin, a question for you following the announcements that Roz and Pat will be departing in the coming weeks, while the business will be in the very capable hands of partners that have been with Starbucks for over 15 years, where are you going to be leaning in in the near-term to help ensure continuity and recovery?\nKevin Johnson: Yes, Andrew, thanks for the question. Certainly, with -- on the CFO side, Rachel, -- Rachel's been a long-term Starbucks partner and our finance organization and supporting the America. She is fully up to speed on Starbucks and all things related to driving this business. And so great confidence there. And Roz's organization, as I flatten the organization, I'm going to take Rossann Williams and Brady Brewer direct to me. Rossann has been running our U.S. -- North American business now for over two years doing a great job on that and Brady's our Chief Marketing Officer. So, certainly I think that stability of leaders running North America and the stability of Rachel and her knowledge of the Americas and stepping into the global CFO role gives me great confidence. And I'll say this; we've got a very strong bench of talent in Starbucks. And what you're seeing is the next generation of leadership stepping into these roles and I've got great confidence in them. And so certainly, I'm going to continue to do what I do, which is we work as a leadership team, we work together as a team based on trust, transparency, and teamwork. And these leaders Rossann and Brady have been on the executive leadership team now for over a year. Rachel will join us on the leadership team, but we won't miss a beat and very grateful to both Pat and Roz for their contribution, because not only did they contribute, but they also built great successors in their roles. And I'm very grateful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good afternoon. My question is for Pat and its related to the upside in your Q1 earnings performance relative to the guidance. Pat, could you maybe unpack the factors that drove the upside relative to what you were thinking at the start of the quarter or whenever you gave the guidance? And then also, can you give us some perspective on whether that upside reflects maybe benefits that are coming in earlier than you anticipated or greater than you anticipated? And I guess the context of that second part is, how should we think about this flowing through to the 2022 outlook, for example?\nPat Grismer: Yes, thank you, David. So, we were very pleased with our A1 results with non-GAAP EPS exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by approximately $0.08. Picking that apart about $0.05 of that favorability was driven by our business segment performance, including better than expected margins in both the Americas and International and other $0.02 we'd attribute to favorable foreign currency translation, and the remaining $0.01 attributable to a lower than expected tax rate, which is driven by unplanned discrete tax benefits. As to the business performance, we do expect that momentum to sustain balance of year. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that it is possible that we could deliver full year results ahead of the guidance we've given. However, when you consider where we're at in our fiscal year with three quarters to go and when you also consider the continued volatility and the operating environment. It's prudent to hold at this stage. And that's what we've chosen to do. We've decided to hold our full year non-GAAP guidance, until we close Q2 and have half the year under our belt, we will then have much better visibility to the back half of the year and can make a more considered call on what guidance update may be appropriate at that point in time. But we are very encouraged by what we've seen thus far. Even with the recent volatility we've seen in China, we could not be more delighted with the accelerated recovery we've seen in our U.S. business going from a minus 8% comp in December to a minus 2% comp in January, well on our way to achieving the full sales recovery that we outlook for the U.S. business by the end of our second quarter, fully expecting the quarter to come in that 5% to 10% sales growth, that's comparable sales growth for us business. So, when you add it all up, there's every reason to be optimistic. It's just a matter of prudence. Again, given where we're at in our year and the fact that the pandemic is still impacting our business in different ways, but we're really pleased with the resilience we've built into our business and that's reflected in our results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks for the question and congrats to all on new opportunities and your new roles. For Kevin and Roz, I think you talked about the strength in food and the higher food attached. I think generally food's been a pretty strong contributor to sales and comp for the last several years now. But it's felt like maybe food has been a little bit deemphasized over the last couple of years given the increased focus on beverage. Wondering if you could -- based on what you've seen recently in the last few quarters -- specifically this last quarter, does it change -- and maybe how you're thinking about customer behavior is changing going forward, does it change at all how you're thinking about the food opportunity going forward from here? Whether it's anything different on innovation, potential partnerships, or just leaning in a bit more on that opportunity?\nKevin Johnson: Yes, Dennis, thanks for your question. Let me let me share our perspective. And then Roz, I'll hand to you to add a bit more from the U.S. perspective. But Dennis, strategically, we are a beverage-first company; we are in the business of handcrafted beverages, personalized for each and every customer around coffee and tea. And it's that experience we create around handcrafted beverages. And that's why we amplify -- we talk about our innovation, it's around customer experience, it's around relevant new beverage innovation, and it's around digital customer relationships. And by focusing and understanding that we are a beverage-first company, that what we do is create that experience around those handcrafted beverages has been very important in the growth that we've been driving. And so we talk about that a lot, we focus on that a lot, because that is, at the end of the day, what is it a significant differentiator for Starbucks. Now, we then attach food and so nothing -- food's not important, but we're very clear, strategically, the most important thing is to be on the front foot and innovate and drive those relevant beverage platforms and then and then differentiate through the fact that our Starbucks partners in our stores, handcraft those beverages personally, for each and every customer, and then we attach food. Now, when we attach food, we -- our R&D teams have been very thoughtful about how to have the food menu, be relevant to the day parts and to the beverages that we sell. And they've done a phenomenal job with that over the years and if I were to say what is the probably the most dominant shift in consumer behavior is this whole shift to plant-based. And that is a shift both in beverage and in food. On the beverage side, this is why we've introduced all the alternative milks, whether it's almond milk, soy milk, oat milk, all of that's important. And then on the food side, you see what we've done with things like the Impossible Sausage Breakfast Sandwich and you're seeing more and more plant-based proteins in our food menu. And in fact, we have one Starbucks store here in the Seattle area that we've gone to 100% plant-based food menu. We use that as sort of a test area when we innovate and create things here in our Support Centre -- in the Tryer Center, we test in that store. So, if I think about both beverage and food, and the number one trend that I would highlight there is just a consumer shift in consumer preferences around plant-based. And Roz let me hand to you, you might have some additional numbers and color to add to that, but I think at a macro level, those are the two most important points, I think, Dennis.\nRoz Brewer: Yes. So, Kevin, I think you hit a pretty strong there in terms of us really aligning with customer preference. I will say that the work that our team has been doing around our digital platform and getting to know our customers better than we've ever known them before, we're understanding how their preferences are trending. What this is also allowing us to do is to make great coffee as well, because now we're learning how to match and pair coffee with great food and beverage items so that we bring together both a food and beverage combination. So, the work ahead of us, by no means minimizes food, actually, we see it as a golden opportunity for us to just further expand our presence and create quality, food attach items to go along with great coffee.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Tower: Awesome. Great, thanks. Just quickly clarification and then a question. First, a clarification, on the slower pace of store closures that I think you'd mentioned earlier in the transcript, is there an expected revenue impact in 2021? And does the 40 basis point margin benefits still stand from those closures? And then my question is on the China loyalty members and the platform. Obviously, very impressive growth here and I was hoping maybe you could offer some insights into how customers in that market are using the brand now versus in the past perhaps differently you're seeing either day-part changes or ticket growth and I know obviously COVID might be muddying the visibility here and exactly understanding what the trends are, but if you could offer some insights into day-part usage, ticket growth, obviously frequency changes around the platform that would be great.\nKevin Johnson: Jon, thanks for your questions. We'll have Pat take the first clarification that you asked for and then John Culver will comment on China loyalty member of behaviors.\nPat Grismer: Yes. Thank you, Kevin. So, Jon, with respect to trade area transformation progress, as of the end of Q1, we had completed approximately one-third of the store closures included in our trade area transformation initiative and expect to complete the majority of remaining closures by the end of this fiscal year as originally planned. So, there has been a bit of a delay relative to what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year and that's entirely a function of how thoughtfully the team is continuing to refine the store closure plans based on how we read the impacts we're seeing from stores as they are closed in terms of both sales transfer and margin with a view to continue to optimize as we go. But we're as committed to that program now as we were at the start of the year and even back to June when we first announced it and then subsequently expanded the program. As to the margin impact, we continue to expect about a 40 basis point improvement to our consolidated margin or enterprise margin on a full year basis. So, even with a slight delay to some of the closure activity, we continue to expect meaningful margin expansion as a result of this initiative.\nJohn Culver: And Jon to your question on China and the digital and what we're seeing a little bit deeper dive on it. First off, the day-part impact we've really seen an uptick in the morning day-part, but pretty much the recovery is taking place across all day-parts consistently. But from a digital mobile order and pay perspective, we are seeing an uptick on the morning side. In terms of the ticket, as it relates to digital, we are seeing ticket consistent with what we've seen previously. Generally, in China, our ticket runs a bit higher than the U.S. under normal circumstances that is because of group ordering and I would say our ticket is living up to that historical performance. The other aspect that we're seeing is social gifting and social gifting is a big piece of digital in China. We've introduced that as part of the Rewards program and we're seeing a nice uptick of that as well. So, very pleased with the progress the team is making there and we're going to continue to invest and double down on our digital footprint in China.\nOperator: The last question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris O'Cull: Thanks. And thanks for getting me in. Pat, my question is related to the plant-based beverages, is the shift to plant-based beverage is a positive for margin on the beverage side or does it compress the profitability relative to milk-based drinks all else equal? And how does continued optimization of the supply chain impact that dynamic over time?\nPat Grismer: Thank you for the question, Chris. I would say that from a margin perspective, currently, the impact is a little bit of a push because while there is incremental cost associated with those alternative milks, we do charge a premium and so that helps to mute the impact to margin. I would say much longer term, it remains to be seen. A lot of it will depend on how consumers increasingly migrate to those alternative milks, not just in our business, but broadly in a way that supports increased production, which should over time reduce the cost and then we have the opportunity to reevaluate whether at some stage it makes sense to change our pricing practices. I would say generally speaking, our goal is to maintain, if not expand our margins over time.\nOperator: And that was our last question today. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Johnson for his closing remarks.\nKevin Johnson: Well, I want to thank you all for joining us today and I also wanted to invite you to join us on March 17th for our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. It will be a virtual meeting where we will celebrate Starbucks and reflect on our journey over the last 50 years since the founding of the company in 1971, while at the same time looking forward to a very bright future and we hope that you join us for that virtual meeting and we'll look forward to seeing you or participating with you on March 17th. Thank you everybody.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Roz Brewer",
            "content": "Yes, Kevin, I do. There's a couple of things here to think about in terms of the contributors. Kevin mentioned the higher beverage attach, the higher food attach. There's also the shift to cold beverages. And what we see in cold beverages is a couple of things. If you think about the decline in transactions that we've seen in our central business districts and our metro markets, those areas carry single beverages, and they were higher than average brewed coffee and those grew really at a lower range than our ticket options. So, what we're doing in beverage innovation is replacing that with cold beverages and replacing that with plant-based. And so that's why we're seeing this improved food attach. And so we feel confident that those kinds of innovations are going to keep that ticket higher than what we've seen in the past. Great. Thank you, Sharon, for that note of congratulations. So, just a little bit on SFE. The story behind SFE is we provided for our customer base the option for payment removal. And we knew that was one of the most significant sections that we had in growing our Starbucks Rewards members. So, this strong member growth that we're seeing is not only surpassing our pre-COVID highs, but it's pushing well behind and you saw the numbers, 22 million active members, that's up 15% year-over-year. And it's helping us really fuel the all-time highs that we're seeing in Starbucks Rewards as they convert. And right now, our Starbucks Rewards percent of tenders is reaching nearly $0.50 -- 50%, as Kevin mentioned. So, we are seeing some significant improvement with Stars for Everyone. Also, too, quarter-over-quarter, our mobile app downloads grew by plus 5% and our acquisitions grew 13%. So, we're seeing some significant movement in there in terms of how the conversion rate. The everything you asked for if there's any qualitative difference between who we're seeing coming in, we're just seeing just an expansion of our customer and just more love for the brand as we apply SFE. And so really, we don't have the exact numbers in terms of qualitatively how they differ. We just know that we have addressed a significant concern with payment removal. So, we're pleased with what we see so far. Sure. So, we have quite a bit of work happening around our service experience and everything that we're seeing around the drive-thru as we have so many of our stores in the drive-thru position right now. First of all, let me speak about our future real estate. When we looked at our most productive model, it is the drive-thru. So, in our go forward position, you'll see an increased number of drive-thrus that we're building in the Central United States and across the Southeast and the Southwest. So, drive-thru in terms of the numbers will grow. Also, two, there are three main approaches that we have to enhance the drive-thru productivity. First of all, is to optimize the current state. And that's looking at our operation standards and that's the focus on driving our increased out the window times. And so that's reinforcing all of our processes in store making sure that our baristas can operate efficiently and that's the ongoing work that we will do. The second piece is we're developing and testing some drive-thru forward solutions and that includes our handheld POS, which right now we have about 300 drive-thru stores with handheld POS and we'll have 500 of those stores by the end of February. And so we're also adding to that the tech improvement to make orders more easily managed through our consolidation and handoff. We call that our bump bar replacement. And then in addition, we're also targeting the renovation of 150 drive-thru constraint stores that have either issues in terms of meeting the new productivity model from an engine design or removing the pastry case and getting things situated, single point of sales and other solutions. And then there's a final piece, the future drives for concepts and those are things like drive-thru-only stores that have no seating, very small units, the side-by-side drive-thru lanes that we are bringing on to the footprint. So, it's -- we've got considerable work in this area to unlock the full potential for drive-thru. Yes, John. Thanks for the question. So, thinking of productivity and models that may not have a drive-thru, we're looking at everything to that we can do on the inside of the building. As Pat mentioned, we have our next generation espresso machine that actually allows us to have a much faster pool with multiple coffee offerings. And then also two, we have our new warming ovens and those have also an improved operational times and standard improvements. It's also important that we talk about the work that we're doing with deep brew and this -- and deep brew is our work that allows us to apply AI to our equipment and the processes in the store and that's improving productivity within the store. So, there's considerable work that's happening in our cafe seated stores. And you'll see those things roll out over the next several quarters here. Pat? Yes. So, Kevin, I think you hit a pretty strong there in terms of us really aligning with customer preference. I will say that the work that our team has been doing around our digital platform and getting to know our customers better than we've ever known them before, we're understanding how their preferences are trending. What this is also allowing us to do is to make great coffee as well, because now we're learning how to match and pair coffee with great food and beverage items so that we bring together both a food and beverage combination. So, the work ahead of us, by no means minimizes food, actually, we see it as a golden opportunity for us to just further expand our presence and create quality, food attach items to go along with great coffee."

            "name": "Kevin Johnson",
            "content": "Well, good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As I reflect on this past year, clearly, we have all been through a lot, a lot of trying times and a lot of change. And at a time when society and all of humanity are a bit fragile, I am optimistic because this year holds tremendous promise for healing. I believe Starbucks can play an important role in that healing process, bringing people together to feel connected, supporting our communities in a positive and responsible way, and advancing a more equitable and inclusive world. It was just one year ago this week that we temporarily closed stores across China to protect our partners and customers from the coronavirus. We quickly realized the need to establish a set of principles for navigating this virus to operate safely in a global pandemic and then shared our principles and store protocols with every market around the world. That approach has served us well. And I'm proud to say today, our business in China recovered in Q1, in line with our expectations and we remain on track to achieve full sales recovery of our U.S. business by the end of Q2. This journey has not been linear. And because we have operationalized our ability to monitor events in real-time and adapt to the changing conditions store-by-store, our recovery continues to track slightly ahead of our expectations. Since the start of this pandemic, while being guided by our three fundamental principles, our 400,000 Starbucks partners around the world have been well equipped with tools, resources, and support to enable quick decision-making at the store level. The agility with which our partners navigated an unprecedentedly complex global situation, while caring for each other and for our customers, leaves me as confident as ever about Starbucks' long-term outlook. Last month, when we met for our Biennial Investor Conference, we talked about Starbucks' resilience. There were three takeaways from that discussion that I want to iterate as we share this quarter's results. First, our Growth at Scale agenda that we established almost three years ago has sharpened our focus, enabled disciplined execution, enhanced our ability to allocate capital to its highest and best uses, and unleashed a growth mindset throughout Starbucks. Second, our speed and agility has enabled us to rapidly adapt to changing consumer behaviors and strengthened our competitive position. And third, we have an innovation agenda for our customer experience and for store transformation that positions us well for future growth. Now, I want to share with you results from Q1 that reinforce our belief that Starbucks is stronger and more resilient than ever. Let me begin in the U.S. Our first quarter comparable store sales of minus 5% in the U.S., improved from the prior quarter's minus 9%. Even with pandemic-related business disruption in the latter half of the quarter that significantly reduced our ability to offer in-store seating, with over 60% of our U.S. company-operated stores offering limited seating as we entered our fiscal Q1, comparable store sales improved in October, building on the momentum we saw in the prior quarter. When COVID-19 cases began to surge mid-quarter, we adjusted our operations to grab and go in alignment with our principles and in support of regulatory requirements across a number of states. We rapidly adapted and ended the quarter with approximately 40% of our U.S. stores offering limited seating. Underpinned by our powerful innovation agenda, our phenomenal green apron partners delivered a very strong holiday performance in Q1, building positive momentum on our path to full U.S. comp recovery. Importantly in Q1, we laid a solid foundation for achieving our fiscal 2021 goals by further advancing the three business driving initiatives fundamental to our Growth at Scale agenda: elevating the customer experience, driving relevant beverage innovation, and expanding digital customer engagement. I will now share some notable highlights from Q1 and our traffic driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021, starting with elevating the customer experience. We believe that many of our customers have adapted to their work or study from home realities. Their Starbucks visit has evolved from the stop on the way to a destination to being the destination worth leaving home for, because it is safe, familiar, and convenient. The work we have done to increase throughput in drive-thru, expand our digital reach, enable curbside pickup, and expand delivery capabilities was evident in Q1. U.S. stores with drive-thrus saw a slight improvement in out-the-window times and delivered positive comps throughout Q1. They drove over half of net sales in Q1, increasing more than 10% from pre-pandemic levels. These results give us confidence that our targeted initiatives to unlock capacity and enhance the customer experience at our drive-thru locations are boosting our business recovery, while strengthening our foundation for future growth. Our industry-leading mobile app continues to be an important tool for us to elevate the customer experience as a safe, convenient, and personalized way to order Starbucks. This quarter, mobile orders represented 25% of U.S. company-operated transactions in Q1, up from 17% before the pandemic, providing clear evidence that our initiatives are resonating with customers. We continue to see average ticket meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels, driven by group order. A combination of increased beverage attach, premium beverage mix, increased customization and upsizing, and an all-time high food attachment, all drove U.S. ticket growth of approximately 19% in Q1. In addition, our seasonal holiday beverage lineup, combined with our creative holiday marketing, created excitement amongst our green apron partners and drew customers into our stores. This year, we kicked off holiday with familiar beverages such as Peppermint Mocha and, of course, Starbucks joyful holiday cups, a 23-year ritual. Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew's tremendous success in last quarter's lineup provided a strong prelude to the December return of the new holiday favorite, Irish Cream Cold Brew. Our cold beverages continued to resonate with customers led by Iced White Chocolate Mocha, Iced Chai Latte, and Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, with all three delivering positive year-on-year growth. Food outperformed our expectations in Q1, driven by strength in breakfast wraps, the Impossible Breakfast Sandwich and holiday bakery items such as the Snowman Cookie and, of course, my grandson's favorite cake pops. Finally, we saw accelerating growth of digital customer relationships and customer engagement, a key highlight of the quarter. Following our successful launch of Stars for Everyone in Q4, Starbucks Rewards achieved phenomenal results in Q1, providing a strong foundation for growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards member base, to whom we directly communicate and provide personalized offers, increased by 2.5 million members in Q1 to a record 21.8 million. Now, this result surpassed our pre-COVID member base, representing a 15% increase relative to the same quarter in prior year. I'm also happy to say that this holiday season, Starbucks Card activations, the cornerstone of our holiday gift program, exceeded our expectations. Starbucks Cards are a customer favorite for holiday gifting and are widely available through our stores and other distribution channels, including digitally. The success of Starbucks Cards illustrates the strong emotional bonds that we've created with customers and the relevance of the Starbucks experience even in the current environment. As the number of active Starbucks Rewards members grew during the quarter, so did their engagement. Rewards customers contributed 50% of U.S. company-operated sales in Q1, up from 43% last year before the onset of COVID-19, and up from 47% in the prior quarter, demonstrating our loyal customers' resilience and affinity for Starbucks. Any way you look at it, our first quarter results were quite strong in the U.S., particularly considering the headwind we faced from the current surge in COVID infections. I will now move on to China, our second lead growth market. Building on the positive momentum from the past two quarters, the China leadership team delivered another great quarter, which is a testament to our ability to rapidly adapt to changing conditions while focusing on the customer experience, new beverage innovation, and continued expansion of digital customer relationships just as we continue to do in the U.S. We delivered an impressive positive 5% comparable store sales growth in Q1, but what is most remarkable about our recovery in China is the rapid reacceleration of new store development, which is our number one driver of growth in that market. I'm pleased to share that in Q1; we opened almost 160 stores and crossed the 4,800 store milestone. That equates to 13% growth in net new stores over the last 12 months, which is particularly impressive considering that we suspended new store development activities for a couple of months at the onset of the pandemic in China. We entered 15 new cities in the quarter and stores in these cities are off to a strong start with customer traffic outperforming that of new stores in other cities in China. The performance of these new stores underscores our continued confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for Starbucks in China. We continue to dramatically expand digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program as evidenced by the number of 90-day active Rewards members growing to 15.4 million in Q1, a record increase of 51% versus the prior year and 14% over the previous quarter. In addition, we achieved record sales for this year's Double 11 campaign which grew by 86% versus last year and we also set a single-day retail sales record on our Starbucks Rewards members' night. Member engagement campaigns and additional functionalities launched through our Starbucks app and mini apps boosted member engagement and frequency throughout the quarter. In fact, with Starbucks Now Mobile Order & Pay services available across 99% of our store base and with Starbucks Delivers in 85% of our store base in China, Mobile Order sales mix hit a record 30% of the company's China sales, up from 26% in the last quarter with 14% driven by Starbucks Delivers and 16% from Starbucks Now. Rewards customer engagement continues to grow as mobile ordering has more than doubled in China over the past year. Starbucks remains Chinese consumers' first choice in the away-from-home coffee category and is the most talked about coffee brand on social media in China. The brand is stronger than ever in our fastest growing market. And finally, a few comments on our Channel Development business. The strategic value of our Channel Development segment in the current environment is clear. The availability of Starbucks' products through multiple channels has secured Starbucks leadership position in the category, acting as a brand amplifier for our specialty coffee retail business. The demand we saw last quarter in Starbucks At Home remained high, boosting our share of the coffee market outside of specialty retail. In the U.S., Starbucks share of total package coffee grew significantly in the quarter with dollar sales up nearly 14%, nearly twice the category average. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle\u0301 has been a powerful partnership and I'm proud to say that for the first time ever, we finished calendar year 2020 as the number one coffee brand across the entire coffee category. Think about it, Starbucks is now the number one coffee brand ahead of all premium and mainstream choices. In addition, consumption of our U.S. Ready-to-Drink coffee products in partnership with PepsiCo grew 18% in the quarter. The introduction of Ready-to-Drink Nitro Cold Brew which was the number one innovation in the category last year, exceeded sales expectations. Unsurprisingly, our food service business continues to be impacted in the current environment with softness in workplace coffee consumption as well as business and leisure travel, which was partially offset by overall strength in our At Home Coffee and Ready-to-Drink businesses. With Nestle\u0301, we entered four new markets in the quarter bringing Starbucks At Home Coffee presence through the Global Coffee Alliance to 66 markets in just over two years. Overall, we are proud of our alliance with Nestle\u0301 and pleased with the accelerated global expansion of the Starbucks brand through our Channels business. Now, before I hand the call over to Pat, I want to close by sharing a perspective and recognizing my Starbucks partners. Throughout this year, Starbucks will celebrate our 50th anniversary as a company and in that 50 years, since 1971, the most important ingredient that has created this iconic company are the Starbucks partners, who share a powerful connection to our mission, a mission grounded in human experience and brought to life through our values and company culture. It is those same Starbucks partners who are navigating the global pandemic, caring for one another, creating welcoming experiences for our customers, showing up in our communities, bringing new ideas and accelerating innovation, and rapidly adapt to our new reality every step of the way, showing the compassion and courage necessary to transform into this new version of Starbucks, a company that is more resilient, stronger than ever, and fully committed to a bright future full of adventure, growth, and positive impact on those we touch. And as markets around the world work tirelessly to vaccinate billions of people, we are prepared for what can only be described as the great human reconnection where people once again connect with others face-to-face to heal, to belong, to reflect, to share, and to celebrate, to celebrate what it means to be part of humanity. And as Starbucks partners, we are here for that great human reconnection where our third place environment once again brings people together if even for a brief moment, to uplift our customers with a smile, a personal connection, a handcrafted beverage, and a place where all are welcome. Starbucks was built for this moment. And to my Starbucks partners around the world, we all know that our purpose goes far beyond the pursuit of profit. This is our moment and I am proud to be your partner and grateful for everything you do for Starbucks, for each other, for our customers, and for the communities we are all a part of. I am optimistic about our shared future and I want to say thank you. Now, before he walks you through our Q1 results, I want to close by sharing my sincere gratitude for Pat Grismer. He has helped lead us through unprecedented change and transformative growth at an amazing pace in his time with Starbucks and he has played an instrumental role in unlocking considerable shareholder value over the past two years. I appreciate Pat's partnership with the entire leadership team at Starbucks and the lasting legacy he is leaving. Pat as you prepare to retire, I want to thank you and wish you the very best in your next chapter. You leave the company in the great hands of a 16-year partner, Rachel Ruggeri, who is incredibly well positioned to assume the mantle of Starbucks' Chief Financial Officer on February 1st. Having worked closely together for many years, I look forward to partnering with you, Rachel as you lead our finance function and contribute as a valuable partner on our executive leadership team. Further, as you all may have seen today, Roz has accepted an incredible opportunity as Chief Executive Officer at another publicly traded company. She will be leaving Starbucks at the end of February and her next role is expected to be disclosed in the days ahead. In the meantime, I want to share that we're very excited for her and are grateful for her many contributions over the years in leading our operations across the America. Roz, on behalf of the entire leadership team, I want to thank you for your leadership and wish you every success in your new role, congratulations. With these shifts, I am immensely proud to have a very strong bench of Starbucks veterans who represent the next generation of leadership for our company. Rachel Ruggeri succeeding Pat as CFO and as we flatten the organization, Rossann Williams, President of our North America Retail business and Brady Brewer, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, will now be reporting directly to me, taking on what have previously been responsibilities of our Chief Operating Officer. Combined, these three talented leaders have more than 45 years of Starbucks experience and we will not miss a beat. Rachel, Rossann, and Brady building on your passion, authenticity, and many years of success at Starbucks, I am excited about our next phase of Starbucks' growth together. I'd like to thank all of my partners for their support as we are well-positioned for the future. And now with that, I will turn the call over to Pat. Pat? Yes, John, this is Kevin. Let me share a perspective on that. First of all, a big reason for the increase in ticket is group ordering. And certainly, as we have grab and go and customers are looking for safe, familiar convenient experiences, customers are coming in and they are purchasing multiple beverages, multiple food items for larger groups than in the past, which is why traffic is down and ticket is up. That said, I think, as we start reopening seating in our stores, as vaccinations continue to propagate around the world, we're going to see that normalize, but I do think there's going to be a long-term positive impact on ticket. I do think through this period, I think, customers have gotten very, very used to more premium beverages, more higher degree of food attach. And I think -- I don't -- I actually think ticket will come out of this higher than it was when we went into it while transactions recovered. Now, how long that takes? I think that's a function of how vaccinations unfold in different markets around the world and how quickly people get back to more normal foot traffic patterns and more normal work and school patterns. And let me just ask if \u2013 Roz, if you want to add any additional perspective on that as it relates to the U.S.? Pat, you want to take a second part of John's question? Yes, Roz, why don't you take that and go through a little bit of the initiatives that we've done to increase throughput on the different channels? And then maybe I'll comment, but why I don't I let you take that question. Thanks John. Roz, why don't you take the first question that John asked, and then Pat will follow-up on the second question that he asked. Sara, thanks for the question. Maybe, John, I'll have you talk a little bit about what's happening in China new store growth and how we continue to drive China. And then let's go to Pat, Pat can reinforce kind of our view on the long-term growth model for China that we outlined at the Investor Day in December. Yes, Jeffrey thanks for your questions. Let me kind of lead off with the perspective and then I'll hand over to Pat to put some numbers around it. But fundamentally look we believe in investing in our partners, it is our green apron partners who create that experience for our customers. And so we know when we invest in our partners and put them in the position to do the best job they can and serving our customers that our customer connection scores go up and our traffic goes up, and our sales go up. There's a direct correlation between investment in partners, customer connection scores, and traffic increase. And I think that's the first thing to note. So, that's why you saw us make a fairly significant increase in wage and benefits here in the U.S. as we went into this fiscal year. Second, then we find ways to help offset some of that in two ways. Number one is just productivity and throughput. We have a 20,000 square foot Tryer Center, we call it our Tryer Center, and think of it as a Silicon Valley incubation lab, right downstairs here in Seattle. And we have some of the world's best human-centered design engineers that work down there with our partners, to find ways to help them improve their productivity. Oftentimes, it has to do with the store layout, oftentimes it has to do with the equipment, what kinds of ovens, what's the -- how can we make things easier for partners to do their jobs. And so that helps offset some of that increase in wage. And then the other is automating administrative tasks. Things that whether it's -- we've had -- we've got deep brew helping automate inventory management stores, helping reduce the amount of time that partners have to count inventory and fill out forms and now technology is playing a role doing that. Other examples our Mastrena II machines that we're putting in our stores have -- are instrumented with Internet of Things sensors in them. And those sensors every shot of espresso, it sends telemetry data back to our data center. And through machine learning, we can predict when a when it is one of our Mastrena machines needs to be maintained, or needs to be cleaned or calibrated. And by doing that, we prevent the situation where perhaps the partner comes to open the store in the morning and one of the Mastrena machines is down. So, technology to automate administrative tasks that help provide the best environment for our partners to do what they do best, which is handcrafted beverages and connecting with our customers. And then the way that we get productivity by just thinking about the human-centered design experience we create for partners in the stores. That helps offset the increase. And Pat I'll hand to you to help add a little bit more numerics around that. Yes, Andrew, thanks for the question. Certainly, with -- on the CFO side, Rachel, -- Rachel's been a long-term Starbucks partner and our finance organization and supporting the America. She is fully up to speed on Starbucks and all things related to driving this business. And so great confidence there. And Roz's organization, as I flatten the organization, I'm going to take Rossann Williams and Brady Brewer direct to me. Rossann has been running our U.S. -- North American business now for over two years doing a great job on that and Brady's our Chief Marketing Officer. So, certainly I think that stability of leaders running North America and the stability of Rachel and her knowledge of the Americas and stepping into the global CFO role gives me great confidence. And I'll say this; we've got a very strong bench of talent in Starbucks. And what you're seeing is the next generation of leadership stepping into these roles and I've got great confidence in them. And so certainly, I'm going to continue to do what I do, which is we work as a leadership team, we work together as a team based on trust, transparency, and teamwork. And these leaders Rossann and Brady have been on the executive leadership team now for over a year. Rachel will join us on the leadership team, but we won't miss a beat and very grateful to both Pat and Roz for their contribution, because not only did they contribute, but they also built great successors in their roles. And I'm very grateful. Yes, Dennis, thanks for your question. Let me let me share our perspective. And then Roz, I'll hand to you to add a bit more from the U.S. perspective. But Dennis, strategically, we are a beverage-first company; we are in the business of handcrafted beverages, personalized for each and every customer around coffee and tea. And it's that experience we create around handcrafted beverages. And that's why we amplify -- we talk about our innovation, it's around customer experience, it's around relevant new beverage innovation, and it's around digital customer relationships. And by focusing and understanding that we are a beverage-first company, that what we do is create that experience around those handcrafted beverages has been very important in the growth that we've been driving. And so we talk about that a lot, we focus on that a lot, because that is, at the end of the day, what is it a significant differentiator for Starbucks. Now, we then attach food and so nothing -- food's not important, but we're very clear, strategically, the most important thing is to be on the front foot and innovate and drive those relevant beverage platforms and then and then differentiate through the fact that our Starbucks partners in our stores, handcraft those beverages personally, for each and every customer, and then we attach food. Now, when we attach food, we -- our R&D teams have been very thoughtful about how to have the food menu, be relevant to the day parts and to the beverages that we sell. And they've done a phenomenal job with that over the years and if I were to say what is the probably the most dominant shift in consumer behavior is this whole shift to plant-based. And that is a shift both in beverage and in food. On the beverage side, this is why we've introduced all the alternative milks, whether it's almond milk, soy milk, oat milk, all of that's important. And then on the food side, you see what we've done with things like the Impossible Sausage Breakfast Sandwich and you're seeing more and more plant-based proteins in our food menu. And in fact, we have one Starbucks store here in the Seattle area that we've gone to 100% plant-based food menu. We use that as sort of a test area when we innovate and create things here in our Support Centre -- in the Tryer Center, we test in that store. So, if I think about both beverage and food, and the number one trend that I would highlight there is just a consumer shift in consumer preferences around plant-based. And Roz let me hand to you, you might have some additional numbers and color to add to that, but I think at a macro level, those are the two most important points, I think, Dennis. Jon, thanks for your questions. We'll have Pat take the first clarification that you asked for and then John Culver will comment on China loyalty member of behaviors. Well, I want to thank you all for joining us today and I also wanted to invite you to join us on March 17th for our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. It will be a virtual meeting where we will celebrate Starbucks and reflect on our journey over the last 50 years since the founding of the company in 1971, while at the same time looking forward to a very bright future and we hope that you join us for that virtual meeting and we'll look forward to seeing you or participating with you on March 17th. Thank you everybody."

            "name": "Pat Grismer",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin and good afternoon everyone. As Kevin shared, we are very pleased with our start to fiscal 2021 with meaningful sequential improvements in quarterly financial results despite ongoing business disruption from the pandemic, again demonstrating the new level of resilience that we have introduced into the business during these unprecedented times. Starbucks reported global revenue of $6.7 billion in Q1, down 5% from the prior year. Q1 EPS was higher than the guidance range we provided on our last earnings call, primarily driven by better than expected margin recovery. Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.53, declined from $0.74 in the prior year, but outperformed our guidance range as it also benefited from lower than expected restructuring and impairment costs as I will discuss in greater detail later. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down from $0.79 in the prior year, primarily due to the lingering impact of the pandemic. I will first take you through our Q1 fiscal 2021 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. I will then share some perspective on our outlook for Q2 and the full fiscal year. Our Americas segment delivered revenue of $4.7 billion in Q1, 6% lower than the prior year, primarily due to a 6% decline in comparable store sales as well as lower product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees as a result of the pandemic. As Kevin mentioned, in the U.S., we saw continued sequential improvement in quarterly comparable store sales from minus 9% in the prior quarter to minus 5% in Q1. As we entered Q1, October improved modestly to minus 3% from minus 4% in September. Then, as the quarter progressed, U.S. comparable store sales were minus 4% and minus 8% in November and December respectively, primarily due to pandemic-related operating restrictions across several states, which impacted customer mobility. As Kevin also noted, approximately 40% of our U.S. company-operated store base was offering limited seating at the end of the quarter, down from more than 60% at the beginning of the quarter. So, we are quite pleased with our comparable store sales performance in Q1 in light of these increasing restrictions. Americas Q1 non-GAAP operating margin contracted 320 basis points from the prior year to 18.8%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 including sales deleverage and additional costs incurred as well as growth in retail partner wages and benefits. These impacts were partially offset by improved labor efficiency driven in part by order consolidation and sales mix shift as well as pricing. Notably, this represented a significant improvement from the previous quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 16.7%. Moving on to International, the International segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q1. Excluding a 5% favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue in the quarter was flat relative to the prior year, reflecting 8% net new store growth over the past 12 months offset by lower product sales to and royalties from our international licensees as a well as a 3% decline in comparable store sales, primarily due to COVID-19 inclusive of a 3% VAT benefit. In China, comparable store sales grew 5% in Q1, including VAT favorability of nearly five percentage points, were slightly positive when excluding the impact of VAT for the quarter. In line with our previous outlook, we substantially recovered our sales in China by the end of calendar 2020 even when excluding the temporary VAT benefit, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand in our fastest growing market. In December, China's comparable store sales were up 4% or only slightly negative when excluding the nearly five percentage point VAT exemption benefit for the month, an improvement from October and November when excluding each month's VAT exemption benefit and setting aside the mid-Autumn festival seasonal shift that benefited October. International's non-GAAP operating margin declined by 100 basis points to 20.4% mainly due to sales deleverage as a result of the pandemic, partially offset by improved labor efficiency. Much like the Americas, this represented a very significant improvement from the previous quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 16.3%. On to Channel Development, revenue was $371 million in Q1, a decline of 25% from the prior year, primarily due to a 22% unfavorable impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business. When excluding the impact of these transition related activities, Channel Development's revenue declined by 3% in Q1, mainly driven by the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the segment's foodservice business, partially offset by growth in our Ready-to-Drink business. The segment's non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 48.7% in Q1 from 36.6% in the prior year. Normalizing for the 840 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 370 basis points in Q1, driven primarily by the strength of our Ready-to-Drink business. Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was 15.5% in Q1, down from 18.2% year-over-year, but a substantial improvement from 13.2% in Q4. Unsurprisingly, much of the year-over-year reduction in our operating margin for Q1 was due to sales deleverage attributable to COVID-19 as well as growth in wages and benefits, partially offset by store labor efficiencies and pricing in the Americas. Moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2021 and starting with GAAP EPS. In Q1, GAAP EPS was $0.16 higher than the upper end of our guidance range, primarily reflecting lower than expected restructuring costs related to our trade area transformation initiative. This upside was attributable to two things. First, a shift in the timing of store closures to future quarters and second, a reduction in average restructuring cost per closed store. As we expect these lower restructuring costs to sustain, we are raising our full year fiscal 2021 GAAP EPS guidance by $0.08 from a range of $2.34 to $2.54 to a new range of $2.42 to $2.62, both inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the 53rd week. Now, moving to non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our strong start to the year combined with a tailwind from foreign currency translation as evidenced in our Q1 results provides optimism that we have the potential to exceed our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance barring of course, any new significant and sustained waves of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. However, given where we are at in our fiscal year with three quarters to go and considering that we're continuing to see volatility from the pandemic, we believe it is prudent to provide a comprehensive guidance update with our second quarter earnings report, by which time we'll have much better visibility to full year results. Therefore, setting aside the updated fiscal 2021 GAAP EPS guidance I just mentioned, we reaffirm all other full year fiscal 2021 guidance for now including non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.90, again, inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the extra week. We will however provide guidance for selected Q2 metrics given our better visibility to near-term trends which provide further evidence of recovery in line with our overall expectations. In the U.S., we expect to report a comparable store sales decline of approximately 2% for the month of January, representing a marked improvement from December's 8% decline. Then, as we lap material adverse COVID-19 impacts in the month of March, we expect U.S. comparable store sales growth of approximately 5% to 10% for the second quarter. This is consistent with our previous outlook that we would achieve full sales recovery in our U.S. business by the end of Q2 with a two-quarter lag beyond that before we expect to see full margin recovery. In China, we are seeing another wave of COVID-19 infections in selected provinces and a corresponding impact to customer mobility and store operating protocols. In addition, we started to lap material adverse COVID-19 impacts last week and this will continue through the remainder of Q2. Combining these two items, we expect to report a comparable store sales decline of approximately 7% for the month of January and comparable store sales growth of nearly 100% for the second quarter, reflecting very significant lapping effects in the months of February and March. On a two-year basis, that would equate to roughly flat compound growth in the second quarter as we move through the one-year anniversary of COVID-related store closures and return to our long-term growth algorithm in China. From an EPS perspective in Q2, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.36 to $0.41 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.45 to $0.50. These estimates reflect the comparable store sales growth estimates that I just provided as well as the normal margin seasonality we see in our business comparing Q2 to our holiday-driven Q1. To be clear, except for GAAP EPS, the rest of our full year fiscal 2021 guidance metrics are unchanged from what we communicated with our Q4 fiscal 2020 quarterly earnings report. This includes our expectation that our retail operating segments will deliver significant margin improvement on a non-GAAP basis as fiscal 2021 progresses, yielding meaningfully higher EPS in the third and fourth quarters than the first two quarters of the year. To summarize, we are delighted with the pace of business recovery in Q1 and the momentum that it provides for fiscal 2021, our China market has substantially recovered, although it is experiencing recent volatility and our U.S. business is on track to fully recover in the current quarter as we previously communicated. As a result, we remain confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of our growth model. I want to express my appreciation to our green apron partners for the critical role that they continue to play in our overall business recovery. Before I conclude, I'd like to thank Kevin and the Starbucks team. It has been an honor to be a Starbucks partner and I am proud of what we've accomplished as a team to unlock considerable shareholder value over the past two years. I am thrilled to pass the CFO baton to Rachel Ruggeri, a key member of our senior finance team. Rachel and I have been partnering to ensure a smooth transition and I would like to invite her to share a few words on this call. Thank you. Rachel? Yes. Thank you. In relation to the impact of the higher ticket on margin and how we expect that to normalize over time, to Kevin's point, we do anticipate that some of that ticket growth will sustain and with that some margin benefit will linger, but there will be as customer behavior normalizes, some reversal -- some of that margin benefit. But it's important to highlight some of the other ongoing initiatives underway in our store operations to build new levels of productivity, whether the deployment of handheld POS to improve throughput at the drive-thru and how we believe that will not only increase our capacity, but deliver some margin enhancements, or what we're doing to deploy new equipment, both new espresso machines as well as new ovens that help us to reduce transaction times out the window, or just ongoing operational engineering work to ensure that our operating routines -- we've adopted new protocols continue to achieve higher levels of efficiency in terms of how we deploy our labor. So, there are a number of other activities underway that will drive new levels of productivity and unlock further margin benefit even as some of the sales activity normalizes and with that reverses some of the margin benefits that we've seen here recently. And John, as to your question regarding variable labor, what we focus on his flow through on variable sales and that's particularly important as we expect continued sales recovery and then back into growth in the back half of the year. And even as we continue to make significant new investments in the middle of P&L in order to unlock future growth opportunity, we fully expect very meaningful sales leverage that comes with what we target as an approximate 50% flow through on those variable sales. And that includes what we derive by way of leverage on fixed labor. So, there is a variable labor component that is embedded in that calculation. But importantly, it acknowledges that there is a fair portion of our total cost structure inclusive of labor that is fixed in terms of how we operate these stores. So, as we recover sales and further build from that point, we anticipate margin expansion as a consequence of sales leverage that helps to offset the impact of the additional investments we're making to unlock future growth. Thanks John and Sara to build on what John has said to put into perspective how we're thinking about comp growth in China long-term, you may recall at our December 2018 Investor Conference, we guided China comp growth of 1% to 3%. In recent quarters, we had delivered in the low single-digits. And we acknowledged at the time that as a consequence of a more tempered pace of growth in the broader economy, intensified competition and the sales transfer that comes from an aggressive pace of new unit development, that 1% to 3% was a reasonable expectation. Fast forward to our Investor Day, just a couple of months ago, where we updated that to a new range of 2% to 4%. I would say in relation to the factors I mentioned, no material change to the economy, competition, or sales transfer. But importantly, as John mentioned, significant improvements in our digital capability and how that has all resonated with our customers in China, which underpins our confidence in raising that long-term comp guidance range for China to this 2% to 4%, which we believe is quite powerful in the context of very aggressive unit development given the strong appeal of our brand and the outstanding unit level economics that delivers superior returns for us in China. Thank you, Kevin. What I would add is that much -- the same way I talked about China, is how we're thinking about the U.S. in relation to improved comps on the back of investments we're making in the brand with investments in our store partners being a critically important investment. And to put that in numerical terms, a couple of years ago, when we guided at our Investor Day, at the time a 3% to 4% comp expectation for our U.S. business. More recently at our Investor Day, we raised that to a range of 4% to 5%. And that is entirely the result of our confidence in the returns that we will get on these investments led by investments in our partners, but also significant investments in our digital platforms. And what that does to unlock the full sales potential of a Starbucks brand, yielding significant sales leverage that not only pays for these investments, but enables what we continue to expect by way of modest annual margin expansion, which is a fundamental part of our ability to convert revenue growth long-term of 8% to 10% to operating income growth of 9% to 11%. So, as Kevin mentioned, all of these things work together, investment combined with productivity to combine further with sales leverage to land the ongoing margin expansion that forms a fundamental part of our overall earnings growth model. Yes, thank you, David. So, we were very pleased with our A1 results with non-GAAP EPS exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by approximately $0.08. Picking that apart about $0.05 of that favorability was driven by our business segment performance, including better than expected margins in both the Americas and International and other $0.02 we'd attribute to favorable foreign currency translation, and the remaining $0.01 attributable to a lower than expected tax rate, which is driven by unplanned discrete tax benefits. As to the business performance, we do expect that momentum to sustain balance of year. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that it is possible that we could deliver full year results ahead of the guidance we've given. However, when you consider where we're at in our fiscal year with three quarters to go and when you also consider the continued volatility and the operating environment. It's prudent to hold at this stage. And that's what we've chosen to do. We've decided to hold our full year non-GAAP guidance, until we close Q2 and have half the year under our belt, we will then have much better visibility to the back half of the year and can make a more considered call on what guidance update may be appropriate at that point in time. But we are very encouraged by what we've seen thus far. Even with the recent volatility we've seen in China, we could not be more delighted with the accelerated recovery we've seen in our U.S. business going from a minus 8% comp in December to a minus 2% comp in January, well on our way to achieving the full sales recovery that we outlook for the U.S. business by the end of our second quarter, fully expecting the quarter to come in that 5% to 10% sales growth, that's comparable sales growth for us business. So, when you add it all up, there's every reason to be optimistic. It's just a matter of prudence. Again, given where we're at in our year and the fact that the pandemic is still impacting our business in different ways, but we're really pleased with the resilience we've built into our business and that's reflected in our results. Yes. Thank you, Kevin. So, Jon, with respect to trade area transformation progress, as of the end of Q1, we had completed approximately one-third of the store closures included in our trade area transformation initiative and expect to complete the majority of remaining closures by the end of this fiscal year as originally planned. So, there has been a bit of a delay relative to what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year and that's entirely a function of how thoughtfully the team is continuing to refine the store closure plans based on how we read the impacts we're seeing from stores as they are closed in terms of both sales transfer and margin with a view to continue to optimize as we go. But we're as committed to that program now as we were at the start of the year and even back to June when we first announced it and then subsequently expanded the program. As to the margin impact, we continue to expect about a 40 basis point improvement to our consolidated margin or enterprise margin on a full year basis. So, even with a slight delay to some of the closure activity, we continue to expect meaningful margin expansion as a result of this initiative. Thank you for the question, Chris. I would say that from a margin perspective, currently, the impact is a little bit of a push because while there is incremental cost associated with those alternative milks, we do charge a premium and so that helps to mute the impact to margin. I would say much longer term, it remains to be seen. A lot of it will depend on how consumers increasingly migrate to those alternative milks, not just in our business, but broadly in a way that supports increased production, which should over time reduce the cost and then we have the opportunity to reevaluate whether at some stage it makes sense to change our pricing practices. I would say generally speaking, our goal is to maintain, if not expand our margins over time."

            "content": "Okay. Thanks for the question, Sara. And clearly, we're very proud of the work that team in China has done to navigate the COVID situation and the current surge that we're seeing in the market to basically substantially recover and in line with our expectations for the quarter and deliver a 5% comp, topline growth rate of 15% and an acceleration of new stores to 160 in the quarter is really remarkable given the current environment that we're operating. And we continue to be very optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity and the continued recovery that is going to take place throughout this fiscal year. Our new stores continue to perform very well. As I said, we opened 160 stores, 30% growth over the last 12 months and that includes a time period where we slow down or halted all store growth as we navigated the COVID crisis beginning last year at this time. We're seeing really strong performance and uptick with the Starbucks Now expansion. We're opening 24 cities -- I'm sorry, opened 24 stores in nine different cities in the quarter and we have a total of 40 stores and we'll continue to expand that concept. And then the last piece beyond the store piece is the acceleration of digital and the digital footprint. And Kevin hit on this a little bit in his comments, but this is also fueling the growth during the pandemic as we navigate. Our 90-day actives increased at 15.4 million members, that's 56% increase over the previous year and that's 14% increase over the previous quarter, which is great. And then clearly mobile order sales mix at 30% with MOP at 16% and deliver at 14% is strong growth. So, our total mobile order sales are now two times what they were last year at this time. So, clearly we have put in place a model that has been able to navigate the pandemic environment. And we feel very optimistic and delivering the delivering the guidance that path look forward of achieving the 100% comp for the second quarter and relative with flat growth on a two year basis for the market. And Sara just one of the things that I would just add, as well, is -- and Kevin hit on this a little bit in terms of the strength of the Starbucks brand in the market. And clear -- we are the clear leader in terms of brand affinity and visitation across all coffee houses. We're the first choice in away-from-home handcrafted coffee beverages for customers. And as a matter of fact, one in two consumers prefer Starbucks versus anybody else's coffee in the marketplace. So, we feel we're in a very strong position from a consumer standpoint and a customer perspective to really emerge out of the challenges that we're facing in a very strong way and that gives us confidence for the future. And Jon to your question on China and the digital and what we're seeing a little bit deeper dive on it. First off, the day-part impact we've really seen an uptick in the morning day-part, but pretty much the recovery is taking place across all day-parts consistently. But from a digital mobile order and pay perspective, we are seeing an uptick on the morning side. In terms of the ticket, as it relates to digital, we are seeing ticket consistent with what we've seen previously. Generally, in China, our ticket runs a bit higher than the U.S. under normal circumstances that is because of group ordering and I would say our ticket is living up to that historical performance. The other aspect that we're seeing is social gifting and social gifting is a big piece of digital in China. We've introduced that as part of the Rewards program and we're seeing a nice uptick of that as well. So, very pleased with the progress the team is making there and we're going to continue to invest and double down on our digital footprint in China."

And with that, allow me to turn the call over to Howard.\nHoward Schultz: Thank you, Tiffany. Well, hello from Milan. Today has been a very special day for me and a powerful emotional reminder of the intersection of my life and years with Starbucks. It was 40 years ago, walking the beautiful streets of Milan, that the inspiration for the possibilities of what Starbucks could one day be and mean around the world first struck me. And here I am, back in Milan, celebrating the early days of our beautiful, thriving business in Italy, a country in which no one expected Starbucks to succeed, on the very day of our global launch of holiday, an event that has become a phenomenon all over the world. So much of Starbucks' inspiration has come from Italy. And in Italy, our partner's dedication to the art of coffee, to the elegance and passion of coffee craft and to the delivery of a premium coffee experience to our customers, is being executed at the highest level. Italians have embraced Starbucks. Our top-selling beverage is actually a solo espresso, validating the quality of our coffee and the relevance of Starbucks customer experience that has defined us since Starbucks' founding in 1971. We recently opened our 20th store in Verona to record crowds, with Rome and Naples fast following in 2023. Milan and Italy are reflections of the premium coffee experience Starbucks is delivering to customers in cities and countries everywhere as demonstrated by the very strong Q4 and fiscal 2022 financial and operating performance Starbucks reported this afternoon. In Q4, Starbucks grew global revenues 11% over prior year to a quarterly record of $8.4 billion driven by 7% comp growth globally and 11% comp growth in North America. For the fiscal year, we grew global revenues 13% over prior year to a record $32.3 billion driven by 8% comp growth globally and 12% comp growth in North America. We also grew our global store base 6% in fiscal '22 and ended the year with roughly 36,000 stores in 83 countries. Today, Starbucks serves over 100 million customer occasions from our retail stores around the world and across all channels, delivers over 400 million customer coffee occasions globally every week. We continue to manage the business through today's challenging operating environment, more mindful than ever of the unprecedented global economic uncertainties and challenges confronting our customers. Our strong performance in the quarter and year is particularly gratifying, in that it underscores the relevance of the Starbucks brand and the strength of our relationships with our customers around the world in the face of these unprecedented challenges. We saw strong demand for Starbucks coffee in Q4 and throughout the year in every market and channel in which we operate. We are encouraged by the early signs of recovery we saw in China in Q4, where innovation, increased customer physical and digital engagement with the Starbucks brand and the relaxing of COVID restrictions, drove solid positive sales momentum and sequential quarterly improvement. The speed with which our business in China accelerated in Q4 and the strong positive correlation between Starbucks revenue growth and the relaxing of COVID mobility restriction reinforces our confidence in Starbucks' long-term growth opportunity in China. However, as you know, over the past few weeks, there has been a significant resurgence of COVID in China. With the resurgence has come renewed lockdowns and mobility restrictions pursuant to China's strict zero-COVID policy, including in many cities in which we operate, meaningfully reducing traffic in our stores. We anticipate the current COVID-related uncertainty to continue and repeat the view we shared on our Q3 call and our Investor Day, that while our long-term aspirations for China remain undiminished, we expect the recovery of our business in the country to be nonlinear. I'll spend more time on China in a few minutes. In fiscal 2022, we drove meaningful growth in our global customer base. In the U.S. alone, we grew our unique customers 9% year-over-year, and our U.S. customers are engaging more deeply with the Starbucks brand as evidenced by a 16% increase in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership year-over-year to nearly 29 million members, up 5% over Q3. Today, Starbucks is connecting to more customers more deeply, both in the U.S. and around the world, than ever before, ideally positioning us to drive further acceleration in revenues and comps in the quarters and years ahead. Our performance supports our confidence in the ambitious growth agenda we announced in September, in which we will be adding roughly eight new stores per day, delivering best-in-class returns around the world every day for the next three years, bringing us to nearly 45,000 stores globally by the end of fiscal 2025. Our Q4 results also demonstrate evidence of early but highly encouraging benefits from reinvention plan investments we detailed at Investor Day in September. And as you will hear from Frank Britt, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer, we have clear line of sight to a full array of benefits reinvention will deliver in the quarters and years ahead. Following Frank, Sara Trilling, a 20-year Starbucks partner, who recently took over leadership of our North American business after having successfully led Asia Pacific for the last four years, she will provide insights into our business in North America today and what to expect in the quarters ahead. Then Rachel will highlight our financial and operating performance in Q4 and for the year and provide guidance for the year ahead. And finally, we will end the call with Q&A. When fully rolled out, Starbucks' reinvention, co-created in partnership with our partners across the country, will touch and elevate every aspect of our Starbucks partner, customer and store experiences. Last week, 2,000 Starbucks leaders from across U.S. and Canada converged in Seattle to coalesce around reinvention and take it back to their local markets. I don't think I've ever seen greater engagement in over 40 years of a more positive response to any Starbucks gathering in our history. Reinvention investments will make it easier for our partners to do their jobs, better enable partners to satisfy growing demand in our stores and provide greater opportunity for our partners to engage with our customers. Reinvention investments are already having a measurable positive impact on our business and operations, most notably in terms of improved partner retention, increased speed of service and an elevated customer experience. And I'm particularly pleased that reinvention investments are bringing coffee excellence, coffee craft and joy and a little bit of love back into being a Starbucks Barista. Key to Starbucks' success and the foundation of our long-term growth strategy is Starbucks' continued global leadership around all things coffee and espresso, hot and cold, Starbucks' core. In Q4, we continued to grow from our core, innovate, introduce new levels of customization and premiumization and extend our global coffee leadership in both the hot and cold beverage categories, with an emphasis on cold coffee, a category we single-handedly created and are growing around the world. Customer demand for customized, handcrafted Starbucks cold beverages is so strong that, today, cold coffee beverages account for 76% of total beverage sales in our U.S. company-operated stores. And customers are increasingly further customizing their cold coffee beverages by adding high-margin beverage flavor modifiers to create unique beverages tailored to their own particular taste preferences. We also continue to introduce innovative new core hot coffee and espresso beverages and innovate around iconic platforms, like pumpkin spice, up 17% over last year driven by increased customization, including cold foams. As part of reinvention, we are rolling out a new, completely proprietary, handheld cold foamer that enhances beverage quality and increases speed of service while reducing complexity for our partners. The response from our partners has been overwhelming. Our growing base of new U.S. customers and Starbucks Rewards members, combined with very strong customer response to our innovative hot and cold beverage lineup to deliver the highest net sales week in our history in September. Let me just repeat that. In our history, we had the biggest sales week in September. The strength of our business as we exited September, coupled with a fantastic holiday lineup kicking off today, with our stores turning red, holiday favorites on the menu and the return of our iconic red cups, gives us tremendous confidence heading into holiday in 2023. In North America overall, the combination of customer shifts towards premium hot and cold beverages, increased customization, strategic decisions around beverage, food and modifier pricing and an 18% increase in food sales drove net revenues up 15% year-over-year to a record $6.1 billion. Once again, our convenience channels, drive-through, Mobile Order & Pay and delivery drove 72% of our total sales volume. Starbucks Rewards members drove a record 55% of tender in our U.S. company-operated stores in Q4. Starbucks Rewards continues to deliver value to our customers, enable customer connection and drive our business. And despite its global scale and growth, we have significant untapped opportunities to grow our Rewards program in a very unique way. We recently launched our Reward Together program, enabling a select group of leading brands to partner with us by linking their loyalty program to Starbucks Rewards. Through Reward Together, we will engage and reward members of both brands with new benefits and experiences that will make our Rewards program even more valuable, drive membership and increase customer lifetime value. Our first U.S. partnership with Delta Airlines launched last month to an extraordinary customer response. Both Delta and Starbucks were overwhelmed with what took place. And in September, we announced Starbucks Odyssey, our next-generation loyalty model that integrates NFTs with Rewards. Starbucks Odyssey will enable us to connect even more deeply with customers and give our customers the opportunity to earn and purchase digital collectible assets that will unlock access to new benefits, a digital community and immersive coffee experiences that they cannot get in any other place. Customer response to Starbucks Odyssey has been overwhelming. You will hear more about the Starbucks Odyssey in a few weeks when our first wave of customers have an opportunity to explore this new exciting way to experience and connect with Starbucks. The numbers that we will release in terms of the response will surprise many of you. Our fast-growing 6,600 North American-licensed store business posted very strong results in Q4, with revenues up 25% in Q4 and 29% for the year. We are proceeding with the rollout of [Starbucks Connect] across the U.S. licensed store portfolio. Starbucks Connect enables licensed stores for the first time to offer the full array of Starbucks' Mobile Order & Pay and Rewards benefits. And as you will hear from Sara, the 1,600 licensed stores that have adopted Starbucks Connect are seeing a significant lift in business since adoption. Starbucks Connect enables us to capture demand across our broader portfolio and will be highly accretive to our business. The momentum we saw in our International segment coming out of Q3 continued in Q4, with revenues for the quarter up 12% to $1.8 billion on a constant currency basis. For the year, revenues grew 9% year-over-year to $6.9 billion, also on a constant currency basis. We added 518 stores during the year and now operate nearly 18,500 stores around the world. We are sensitive to the challenges that the rapid increase in the value of our dollar is posing to our International licensees and remain in close contact as we work together to navigate the dynamic environment that we are all operating in. Turning to our Channels business. Starbucks is the number one share in U.S. at-home coffee. Starbucks is the number one share in global ready-to-drink coffee, and continued growth in our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle combined to deliver strong performance in Q4, with revenues increasing 18% on a constant currency basis to $484 million. For the year, revenues also increased 18% to $1.8 billion on a constant currency basis. Now let me begin the discussion around China by saying that Starbucks has been in China for 20 years and that our aspirations for our business in China has never been greater. We have over 6,000 stores in China today. And as Belinda shared at Investor Day, we have close to 9,000 stores -- we will have close to 9,000 stores by 2025. We will be opening our Starbucks China Coffee Innovation Park, including our largest coffee roasting and packaging plant outside the U.S. in summer 2023. Starbucks employs over 60,000 passionate, dedicated partners in China. Our partners are deeply engaged with their customers and demonstrated by today's record high customer connection scores. We continue to be an employer of choice and lead the way in partner investments, recently introducing a 14th month bonus for all full-time partners. And we continue to invest in China to create career and opportunity paths for our partners and to support the communities we serve. We also continue to expand our customer base in China and deepen our digital connection to customers. Active Starbucks Rewards membership grew 29% sequentially in Q4 over Q3 to over 17 million members, just below historic levels, coinciding with the lifting of restrictions and reflecting the relevance and underlying strength of the Starbucks brand in China. Mobile ordering sales mix, nonexistent prior to 2019, drove 44% of mix in Q4. Delivery, up 35% year-over-year, now representing over 24% of sales. We expect mobile, digital, loyalty and delivery to continue to grow and drive our business. However, we are ultrasensitive to the evolving macro challenges that have surfaced regarding China, particularly in connection with the impact of the zero-COVID policy. But our strong belief in China is based on our success in the country and our commitment to playing the long game. We are confident that when COVID disruptions affecting the country abate, Starbucks will emerge not only as the undisputed leader in our category, but likely the number one Western consumer brand in the country for having continued to meaningfully invest in our partners and in our business throughout the pandemic and despite the disruptions. Laxman's immersion is going spectacularly well. He's visited and worked in stores in the U.S. and U.K., quickly connecting and winning the hearts of Starbucks partners wherever he goes, just this week earning his Barista certification in record time and store Green Apron. Laxman's commitment to becoming intimate with store operations and our partner and customer experiences reflects our mutual understanding of what is most important in these early days of his joining Starbucks. He and I engage daily as he absorbs more and more about the company and our business. And the Board, leadership team and I are all deeply invested in his success. I cannot be more confident that Laxman is the right CEO at the right time for Starbucks. Today, Laxman has a front-row seat as we launch our all-important holiday season. Soon, along with our leadership team, he will be leading the company, bringing reinvention to life and guiding Starbucks to the next chapters of our storied history. In closing, Starbucks has never been financially stronger, better positioned or more confident in our future as we enter Q1 and holiday and embark on the exciting new era of growth ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank?\nFrank Britt: Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. It was just 50 days ago that we laid out our reinvention agenda that involve five major strategic shifts. First, creating a truly unified global company; second, radically improving our in-store partner experience; thirdly, reimagining our store operating model; fourth, reinvention around what customer connection means; and perhaps, most importantly, redesign the construct of what it means to be a partner at Starbucks. While still early days, we are seeing progress with several key proxy measures. For example, retention has increased with turnover scores at the hourly Barista level, lower by 1 point versus prior year and 4 points versus prior quarter. Additionally, customer connection scores show a 5-points improvement to pre-pandemic levels. All of these are early but encouraging signs. We fully embrace that our partners are the most critical component to our longer-term performance, and we need to be even better at addressing their needs. Partners who proudly wear the Green Apron have bravely shared their stories and their ideas in our co-creation sessions, and we have concentrated our efforts to jointly create solutions with our partners and for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we continue to improve our already industry-leading benefits to a deeper position of strength with several new programs for partners. Representative examples of improvements include: a new incentivized savings program in partnership with Fidelity, designed to help partners in case of unplanned financial challenges; a new student loan debt program to empower partners looking to find the best ways to address their college debt management obligations; an increase in sick time accrual ratios for our partners; an updated family expansion reimbursement program, aimed to assist partners with the cost of growing their families through adoption and the like. We have remained committed to the critical development opportunities of our people. And as a complement to doubling our partner training hours, as Howard noted, we've reintroduced our iconic Black Apron credentialing program, and nearly 5,000 partners have already earned their apron and continue in the program. We've also launched the pilot of a new partner app designed to create one digital community for our 270,000 U.S. and Canada company-owned operated store partners. And over time, this new digital platform will allow partners to stay connected on what matters to them most, including their schedules, their benefits and continuing to use their voice to drive the co-creation of Starbucks. More than 1,000 partners have participated in our testing and are providing feedback for our launch planned for Q2. Obtaining the right mix and number of hours is essential to a thriving partner experience at Starbucks, and we aim to provide desired hours with flexibility and predictability. We are highly focused on honing our staffing models and operating processes to ensure we can allocate the right amount of talent to each store in every daypart and advancing our capabilities to fine-tune our hours of operations by store to reflect unique demand patterns. As part of the reinvention agenda, all of these efforts share in common a primary focus to grow the lifetime value per partner and are connected to the ongoing reinvention initiatives, including in-store waste reduction and further acceleration of equipment rollout to enable an improved partner experience and higher productivity. We will also continue to focus on accelerating our trade area transformation, modernizing the way technology elevates the store experience and continuing supply chain innovation. Longer-term, powered by our partners' insights, we have a very robust agenda and improvement plan powered by a new architecture and vision of the partner experience. And over time, this will translate into an even more partner-centric system in the stores, affirm our reputation as a frontline talent career launchpad and improve retention rates. Finally, as part of this new phase of reinvention, we continue to lean into our centralized project management office to drive better integration among our initiatives and more fully capture the synergies across our store and customer innovations. Together, these initiatives are designed to strengthen our business through top line growth and margin expansion and improve the partner experience. I look forward to sharing more of the progress in the quarters ahead. Let me now turn it over to my partner, Sara.\nSara Trilling: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm Sara Trilling. I'm pleased to join you today for my first earnings call in my new role, leading the North America business. While I'm relatively new to this particular role, I'm a 20-year partner and most recently served as Senior Vice President of Asia Pacific. Over my Starbucks career, I've touched nearly every aspect of the business and have served many leadership positions across a variety of functions, including store development, retail operations, product and marketing. And I'm looking forward to applying the relevant breadth and depth of my experiences to this next phase of growth in North America. To build on some of the comments from Frank and Howard, we continue to see very healthy growth in our North America business. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we saw the highest net sales week of all time with the launch of our fall promo. And I'm pleased to share this subsequently led to an incredibly strong September, with the three high sales weeks in our history. Our strong quarter, comparable sales of 11% and revenue growth of 15% were largely driven by a record-breaking fall launch, coupled with continued strategic pricing actions and increased food attach as well as the shift to more premium beverages and a growing demand for personalization in both company-operated as well as licensed businesses. Elevated from pre-pandemic levels, we maintained ticket comp strength in our U.S. company-operated business at 10%, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of increased ticket comp. These results reflect the continued strength in demand for Starbucks as our customers fell into their new normal routine and behaviors. We fully expect the momentum from our record fall launch to continue as our highly anticipated holiday at Starbucks launched just today and include some great seasonal offerings. What gives us further confidence in the holiday season is the strength of the Starbucks brand with younger, more diverse customer groups. More than half our U.S. customer base is Gen Z and Millennials, reflecting relevancy and brand love across generational cohorts, trends we see with diverse customer cohorts as well. We are incredibly pleased with our momentum in the business and the reinforcement of our strategy in the following key areas. First, we've established sustained relevancy of the Starbucks brand in customer loyalty. In fact, Starbucks is consistently, quarter-over-quarter, the leader in market share, first choice and past 30-day visitation when it comes to an away-from-home coffee occasion as measured by our brand equity tracker. We're also pleased to share that customer connection scores have increased 5 points versus pre-pandemic levels. The strength of the brand is further illustrated by the success of our iconic pumpkin spice platform, which grew 17% year-over-year and continues to resonate with customers who love the classic Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as newer additions, such as the Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam modifier. Second, our cold customized beverage strategy is working. We're seeing growth in both hot and cold and increasing customization. In Q4, more than 60% of beverage units sold in the U.S. company-operated business were customized, contributing to the $1 billion and growing annual net sales for modifiers, representing growth of 2x since the first fiscal 2019. Finally, we reinforced our unique position in providing experiential convenience as evidenced by all-time highs in Starbucks Rewards engagement amid Mobile Order & Pay orders. The Starbucks Rewards program in the U.S. grew 90-day active members, ending FY '22 with nearly 29 million members. This represents growth of 16% year-over-year and 55% of our U.S. company-operated revenue in the quarter, up nearly 4% from prior year, representing the highest-ever percent of tender. Mobile Order & Pay surpassed 26% in Q4 for the first time in a quarter, finishing fiscal year '22 at 25% of total transactions. We're incredibly optimistic about our continued momentum in digital, following the unprecedented interest in Starbucks Odyssey, the integration of NFTs with our industry-leading loyalty program to create an accessible Web3 community that brings unique aspects of our brand to life in a new way. We also experienced a wildly successful launch of Reward Together with Delta. With this partnership, our Rewards members are able to earn miles faster through their everyday purchase at Starbucks and earn even more Stars on days when they travel with Delta. The initial response from customers has been extraordinary and beyond our expectation, and this is just the start. Importantly, we finished the year with nearly 25% of our U.S. license portfolio live with Starbucks Connect, allowing us to create a seamless digital experience across our stores, giving customers more ways to connect with our brands, furthering the value of the rewards experience. As part of our reinvention and as we shared at our September Investor Day, we're investing in equipment to innovate for an improved partner and customer experience. We have completed the deployment of Starbucks Cold Brewer and have rolled out the Mastrena 2 espresso machine and new warming ovens to nearly 95% and 72%, respectively, of our stores across the U.S. This equipment collectively supports improvement in our throughput during both peak and full day, while providing the foundation to support elevated partner and customer experiences as we further reinvention plan investments and productivity. The rollouts for these three items will be completed by fiscal year '23 for our company-operated stores. Additionally, we rolled out nearly 60% of our handheld point-of-sale investments to nearly 75% of our cold beverage labelers. Handheld POS is already helping us capture new and latent demand in support of our ambitious revenue expectations. And we expect to see further benefit as we extend the rollout for handheld POS into fiscal year '24. While still in the early days of development, partner and customer reception of the new Siren System innovation we shared at Investor Day is overwhelmingly positive, including the Clover Vertica brewer and the new proprietary on-demand cold-pressed Cold Brew technology. We expect to begin rolling out Clover Vertica brewer later in this fiscal year, with our broader Siren System innovations fast following in fiscal year 2024. Through our investments, we're giving our partners more time to focus on coffee craft and connect with customers, enabling them to continue delivering experiential convenience in a way that only Starbucks can. The powerful unlock is our reinvention positions us for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. In fact, just this last week, we welcomed nearly 2,000 retail leaders from U.S. and Canada to Seattle for our District Manager Leadership Experience. This powerful three day event is designed with great intention to provide a renewed understanding of the critical role each leader plays in our business and with our people and equip them fully to lead their stores and store partners through our reinvention and into our future as we all breathe life into this reinvention plan. To close, what I would leave you with -- is with this. This is an incredibly exciting time to lead our North America business. While the macro environment may have uncertainty, our performance is once again demonstrating the strength and resilience of our brand and our business. We are well positioned in this environment, which will only further strengthen as our reinvention comes to life. I'll now turn it over to Rachel.\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Sara, and welcome to your first Starbucks earnings call. And good afternoon, everyone. As you heard throughout this call, starting with Howard, we had record-breaking performance this quarter, and I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved together. We finished fiscal year 2022 with consistently strong demand in the U.S. and in nearly all major markets across the globe, with that demand sustaining as we exited the year. Our Q4 consolidated revenue reached another historical high, $8.4 billion, up 11% from the prior year or 14% when excluding a 3% impact of foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was primarily driven by 7% comparable store sales growth and 6% net-new store growth over the past 12 months, further strengthened by the remarkable momentum in our global licensed store businesses. In addition, this outstanding performance reflects double-digit revenue growth in all three of our reporting segments in constant currencies, showcasing the resiliency of our brand, power of customer loyalty and depth of our diverse portfolio. Q4 consolidated operating margin contracted 380 basis points from the prior year to 15.1%, primarily driven by investments in growth in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training, part of which were investments under our reinvention plan. In addition, operating margin was impacted by inflationary headwinds and deleverage related to COVID restrictions in China. The overall contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets outside of China. Q4 EPS was $0.81, declining 9% from the prior year, but better than expectations, including $0.05 of nonrecurring benefits primarily related to discrete tax benefits. For full year fiscal 2022, our consolidated revenue reached a record $32.3 billion, up 13% from the prior year or 15% when excluding a 2% impact of foreign currency translation driven by 8% comparable store growth, 6% net-new store growth and strength in our global licensed store businesses. Full year consolidated operating margin and EPS were 15.1% and $2.96, respectively. I will now provide segment highlights for Q4. North America delivered revenue of $6.1 billion in Q4, up 15% from the prior year and another all-time record, primarily driven by an 11% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 10% increase in average ticket as well as net-new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months. Impressive momentum in our U.S. licensed store business also contributed to the segment's record revenue performance. My colleagues spoke in detail about our incredible U.S. performance in Q4, posting 11% comparable store sales growth. Average ticket once again broke a record, primarily driven by pricing and food attach. Despite elevated pricing actions taken throughout the year, daily store traffic in the U.S. reached approximately 95% pre-pandemic levels in September, fueled by the wildly successful fall promotion. Importantly, the volume of beverage and food items sold per store has well-exceeded pre-pandemic levels, and the number of unique customers, again, reached an all-time high in Q4, up 9% over the prior year and up more than 1% versus prior quarter, underscoring our brand's expanding reach and relevance and customer loyalty. North America's operating margin was 19% in Q4, contracting 270 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to investments in growth in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training as well as inflationary headwinds, partially offset by pricing and sales leverage. Our disciplined actions to closely manage labor hours, reduce waste and prioritize discretionary spend also contributed to the segment's margin performance as we build a strong foundation for progressive margin expansion in years to come. Moving on to International. The segment delivered third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, down 1% from the prior year or up nearly 12% when excluding a 12% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. This double-digit revenue growth in constant currencies was driven by sustained strength in all major markets outside of China as well as an 8% increase in total store count over the past 12 months. The growth was partially offset by a 5% decline in comparable store sales as the impacts of COVID continued in China. As Howard discussed, our China market continued its recovery in Q4, navigating through reoccurring COVID outbreaks and turbulent consumer mobility. The market posted a comp decline of 16% in Q4, a meaningful sequential improvement from a 44% decline in Q3. Despite this depressed traffic, the China team's outstanding leadership and strength of our brand were markedly evident in the quarter as reflected in record levels of store development, growth in delivery and the highest-ever customer connection scores. Outside of China and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our diverse international markets across the globe sustained incredible momentum in Q4. Collectively, the market's revenue growth exceeded 30% in the quarter when excluding a 19% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. International segment's net-new stores reached a quarterly record at 518, climbing to more than 18,000 stores in total, setting the stage for a new era of growth, with a rapidly expanding footprint around the world. Operating margin for the International segment was 14.5% in Q4, down 750 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by deleverage related to COVID restrictions in China, lower government subsidies as well as partner investments. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and strong sales leverage across markets outside of China. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 16% to $484 million in Q4 or up 18% when excluding a 2% impact from foreign currency translation driven by growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our global ready-to-drink businesses. Channel Development continued to play a vital role in differentiating, diversifying and amplifying our brand by creating customer occasions outside our stores. As a result, Starbucks remains the market leader in both the total U.S. at-home coffee and ready-to-drink categories. Building on the success of our newer platforms, the segment's robust innovations continued in the quarter, including the introductions of ready-to-drink Starbucks Pumpkin Cream Nitro Cold Brew in the U.S. and bottled Frappuccino Smoothie in China, to name a few. The segment's operating margin was 50.6% in Q4, down 170 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by business mix shift. Let's now move on to our fiscal 2023 outlook, which reflects the beginning of a new era of growth. Our guidance remains consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in September. So today, I will reaffirm and refine the guidance specific to fiscal year 2023. And we'll also introduce an outlook on a few below-the-line metrics that were not part of our Investor Day guidance. Starting with the first building block of our growth, comparable store sales growth. We expect fiscal 2023 U.S. comparable sales growth to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. For China, we're expecting outsized comp in fiscal year 2023 as we lap the severity of the lockdowns in the market. Given the quarterly shape of the fiscal 2022 baseline, we expect China comp to be negative in the first quarter, followed by outsized comp in the balance of the year. Our fiscal 2023 global comp growth is expected to be near the high end of our long-term target range of 7% to 9%, consistent with what I shared at Investor Day. And global comp in Q1, reflecting negative comp in China, is expected to be at the low end of the annual guidance range, then expanding in subsequent quarters. Moving on to the second building block, new store growth. We expect our U.S. store count to grow by approximately 3% in fiscal year 2023. In China, we will continue to rapidly expand our store footprint, with approximately 13% growth expected in fiscal year 2023. We expect our global store growth to reach approximately 7%, with over 75% of the growth coming from outside of the U.S. as we continue to diversify our portfolio globally. With this powerful combination of global comp and store growth, coupled with our Channel Development performance, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to reach the range of 10% to 12% in fiscal year 2023 despite an approximately three percentage point unfavorable impact expected from foreign currency translation. Within fiscal 2023, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation is expected to reach approximately four percentage points in the first half of the fiscal year, tempering to approximately one to two percentage points in the back half of the year. Despite the considerable pressure we now expect from foreign currency translation, which could abate, we remain confident in our revenue guidance range for the full year. We have a solid path to capture strong demand, maximize opportunities unlocked from our reinvention plan and deliver attractive revenue results. Our third building block is operating margin. Globally, we expect solid margin expansion in fiscal year 2023. In terms of a quarterly shape, we expect operating margin to be tempered in Q1 and Q2, with meaningfully higher margins in Q3 and Q4 as margin benefits accumulate from the continued unlocking of the reinvention plan, coupled with the expected recovery in China. In addition to the quarterly shape of operating margin, here are a few points to consider. We expect over $1 billion incremental investments in fiscal year 2023, half of which will reflect the annualization of the fiscal 2022 investments. We expect headwinds related to supply chain and commodity inflationary pressures to continue in fiscal 2023, albeit to a lesser extent relative to fiscal 2022. Headwinds will be managed through sales leverage, pricing and productivity from the reinvention, resulting in positive margin expansion as the year progresses, as I previously mentioned. The fourth building block is capital allocation. We expect our CapEx in fiscal 2023 to be approximately $2.5 billion. As we shared during our Investor Day, we also expect to return approximately $20 billion to shareholders in the next three years between dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to targeting an approximately 50% dividend payout ratio as reflected in the recently announced dividend increase, and we'll also resume our buyback program in fiscal 2023. We expect the buyback benefit on EPS to be initially limited until fiscal 2024, when the benefit is expected to reach approximately 1%, calculated net of interest expense. In regards to interest expense, we expect between $540 million and $560 million of interest expense in fiscal 2023, up from $483 million in fiscal 2022. This increase, driven by incremental debt issuances in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 as outlined in our capital allocation strategy. Importantly, we remain committed to our BBB+ credit rating and leverage cap of 3x rent-adjusted EBITDA. As for tax rates in fiscal 2023, we expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the mid-20% range. This is up from our fiscal 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 22.4% and 23.1%, respectively, which benefited from certain discrete tax items that are not expected to repeat to the same degree in fiscal 2023. Finally, based on the current environment, we expect foreign currency translation to have approximate four percentage point unfavorable impact on fiscal 2023 earnings growth. Despite that, we continue to expect fiscal 2023 GAAP EPS growth to be at the high end of the 15% to 20% range. Fiscal 2023 non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to be at the low end of the long-term range of 15% to 20% as the benefits of the reinvention investments will take time to amplify. It's important to note that Q4 fiscal 2022 included approximately $0.05 of nonrecurring items, largely from discrete tax benefits. And considering the quarterly EPS shape, we expect it to mirror the quarterly shape of operating margin, which will also have a meaningful step-up in the second half of the fiscal year. In closing, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. We are incredibly proud of our Q4 performance, underpinned by the experience our partners create for our customers each and every day. Our 2023 guidance sets the stage for another year of record performance. Importantly, we recognize that our future growth is dependent on our investments in our partners, stores and customers. As we lean in and solve the challenges of our business, together with our partners, we are confident of our path to unlock a new era of growth, creating value for all stakeholders, partners, customers and shareholders. Once again, our success is earned through our more than 450,000 Green Apron partners working across the globe to elevate the Starbucks experience each and every day. Their commitment and their unwavering focus will continue to be the cornerstone of our new era of growth. With that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please state your question.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thanks. I had two questions on the Rewards Together program. First, can you talk about what differs about this program versus the Stars Everywhere program that Starbucks ran about six or seven years ago, when you partnered with New York Times, Lyft and Spotify, that was ultimately discontinued? And then my other question is just on the data sharing. Can you talk about the new capabilities this program is going to afford you and how the data sharing will work between you, Delta and any other new partners that you guys bring on? Thanks.\nHoward Schultz: Thank you for the question. This is Howard. I'm sitting with Brady Brewer, Chief Marketing Officer of Starbucks, and he'll take your question. Brady?\nBrady Brewer: Yes. Thanks for the question. Really, the Reward Together program is about taking like-minded leading loyalty programs and linking them directly to Starbucks Rewards. And the intent is that whether or not you are with an airline like Delta, you can earn miles faster at Starbucks, and you can get additional Starbucks benefits when you fly with Delta. And we're looking at a number of leading brands. And so this is creating direct tech-to-tech connection to link our loyalty programs and make the experiences better for both brands and both sets of customers. In terms of the data, we're really sticking with our continued focus on using data to make the experience better but being very thoughtful and disciplined about the data that we capture, but using it to make the experience better and inform our business. So we're excited about the early stages of Reward Together. What we've seen, as you heard on the call, is extraordinary demand to link accounts in a way that was overwhelming relative to our expectations. So we're excited to see this build in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thank you very much. Howard, since the Analyst Day, the top question we've heard on Starbucks is related to the new long-term comp guidance of 7% to 9%. And it does seem like you're quite confident on that in fiscal '23. It seems like you have a pretty good line of sight, and these quarterly results support that. And I get the feeling fiscal '23 is driven by menu pricing and the China bounce-back. But with that said, the focus, I guess, we're hearing is more looking six to 12 months out, with an even larger system. And in the face of a slowing macro and potential recession, it seems like your product will be more discretionary. So just wondering your confidence or maybe if you could prioritize the drivers to support that 7% to 9% comp, just because yourselves and even your peers, it's just been very difficult to be able to sustain that level without it being driven by price. So especially going into a potential recession, you're confident six to 12 months out that we could still be talking about 7% to 9% for the next couple of years. Any color or prioritization would be great. Thank you.\nHoward Schultz: Thanks, Jeff. Well, let's try and kind of go through the question based on our history, what we've seen in the near term and why we're so confident. If you go back many years, although this is an unprecedented time, we have demonstrated, time and time again, that there is an affordable luxury to Starbucks that our customer base has been willing to support and the loyalty to Starbucks continues. Now in the past, we did not have the inherent benefit of the Rewards program, which as you heard in our prepared remarks, is generating significant revenue for Starbucks, which is highly predictable, and a relationship with that customer base is extremely loyal. The other thing that's different from the years past and which gives us so much confidence is that we've always monitored whether or not our customer base was getting younger every year. We've never wanted to see our customer base get generationally older. We wanted to see it get younger. Not only has it gotten younger, but that young customer, that Gen Z customer, tends to have significantly more discretionary money at their disposal. And their loyalty to Starbucks has been quite significant and predictable. Then you have the pricing power of Starbucks, which we're certainly not going to try and raise prices during this time. But certainly, we've demonstrated, over the last 12 months or so, that we've got almost 6% price increases and we haven't seen the loyalty and the transactions abate. I think customization, which we spoke a lot about in our prepared remarks, is obviously giving us -- and the ticket is becoming more accretive as a result of the modifiers, and those modifiers seem to be more consistent and greater with cold beverages, which is now over 75% of the U.S. business. And then I think we look at the promotional plan that we have for the balance of the year and we look back on our history in terms of the beverages that have succeeded, we look back on the short-term history in terms of what beverages have really been home runs, and I can honestly say we sat through a beverage lineup of innovation a few weeks back and we really had to cull the amount of beverages because we knew we couldn't handle it because there were just too many that we felt so good about. The last thing I'd say, and this is not as quantitative as I would like but it's real, is that during the pandemic and certainly in the last year, Starbucks has picked up consistently -- consistent market share, both in our category and our ability to intercept traffic as a result of the strategic nature of our real estate multiple formats, and we certainly can't avoid this conversation and not talk about the overwhelming success in revenue and how accretive drive-throughs have been. And so net-net, we're highly concerned and humbled by the environment. There isn't a day that goes by in which the lens of every decision we're making is not made -- is made through the concern of what's happening in America and around the world. But we feel that we've got the resources and the know-how, the history and the innovation to produce the kind of numbers that we feel very confident about. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Hi, thank you so much. I have a question and then a follow-up, please. So the question is really about, you just mentioned the premiumization and customization and how that seems to be more common with cold beverages. I guess that feels like it's been a tailwind for a little while now. How much further can you push this, if you will? So cold accounts for 76% in total. How much higher can that be? And as you think about customization, you could share sort of what percentage of orders are customized or something that could give us a sense of how far along you might be in that penetration throughout.\nHoward Schultz: Sure. Yes. I'll start -- sure, go ahead...\nSara Senatore: I'm sorry. And just a question about China. I just wanted to clarify, as you talk about the restrictions, it's really about mobility, not about challenges in opening new stores. Thanks.\nHoward Schultz: Yes. In terms of China, that's 100% correct. There's no issue with regard to opening stores. In fact, we're opening stores at record numbers. And Belinda is on the phone, and if you have a follow-up question about China, she certainly can answer it. In terms of your question about the -- our ability to extend cold and modifiers, a few things. One, cold has certainly surprised us all at Starbucks. But our ability to customize beverages is a significant competitive advantage. There is no other coffee company anywhere in the world that has our ability to respond instantaneously to a customer's request about customization, nor there isn't a coffee company that has our ability behind the counter in terms of flavors, syrups, modifiers, foam, et cetera, to provide the customer what they want. I think cold is in its early stages in terms of what's coming. And the innovation we have around cold through the year will continue to drive awareness and I think, attachment. However, no one should kind of walk away and think about the fact that our coffee -- our hot coffee business is not growing. In fact, it's growing nicely, but cold has kind of taken over. But we have significant innovation plans for hot. So I think the percentage of revenue cold versus hot, I think you'll see hot go up as a result of the innovation we have around the hot platform. And I'll give it to Brady, just to follow up on your question as well.\nBrady Brewer: Yes. I think the -- as Howard said, hot coffee is growing, but cold beverage, over the last few years, has just accelerated, and that added an entire stack of sales volume into the stores. What we're seeing, and Sara mentioned, is that the cold-customized plant-based beverage platform is particularly appealing. The younger you go, the colder the beverage. We've seen significant year-over-year growth in Iced Espresso, which is our biggest product category. We're continuing to now see growth in hot espresso. Refreshers, Nitro, Cold Brew are all growing significantly. But as Howard said, modifiers have grown in double digits year-over-year. Now over 60% of our beverages are customized. And why is that important? It's important because what our customers have discovered is that their favorite beverage is not possible to buy anywhere else. I think that links to the earlier question about navigating rough times too, is this is a beverage you can only get at Starbucks and you can't make it home. And increasingly, customization has enabled that in our stores. So we're just getting started. Lots of growth opportunity ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask about China. Can you talk about your composition of locations in China across Tier 1, Tier 2 and lower-tier cities and just in terms of unit growth, where you're growing across those tiers? And then any color you can provide on trends you're seeing in Tier 1 versus other cities would be helpful. Thank you.\nHoward Schultz: Sure. Belinda Wong, who runs Starbucks China, is on the phone from China, and I think obviously the best person to answer the question. So Belinda, please?\nBelinda Wong: Thank you, Howard. Thank you for the question. Starbucks continues to lead the market in brand share and preference, fueled by our premium positioning, a competitive advantage founded on the exceptional coffee experience delivered by our partners and the deep connections cultivated with our customers. We're very delighted to see the robust growth of the -- of China's coffee market in recent years with the entry of new brands and players. Different brands offer different value propositions, targeting different segments and locations, but together, we'll accelerate coffee culture and overall category adoption. In terms of our new store development strategy, as I have shared during Investor Day, we will build -- we will follow our purpose-built store strategy. And we will go deeper into optimizing our store portfolio, increasing the density in key trade areas in our top 20 cities, in the existing cities that we're in. And we'll also go wider into entering -- continue entering into new cities that we're not in yet. There are plenty of opportunities to grow in those two areas. And thirdly, we will go smarter. We have a very strong store development system that's built by our incredible team in the local market. Powered by data, we have more accurate data to understand where we should be opening the format and the size, and not just the third place experience, but we're able to accurately project where is best placed in terms of our new stores to fulfill omnichannel customer needs in all the cities, be it new or existing cities that we operate in. And lastly, we're going to go greener. As I've shared before during Investor Day, we're going to open 2,500 greener stores by 2025 as part of the portfolio. So we're very confident in the way we're going to grow our new stores and comprehending the increase in the China market. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Thank you. For several calls now, we've been talking about the record number of discrete customers that Starbucks has. And obviously, that's very admirable to be able to talk about that, just having the breadth of the customer base. And I would like to put that in context, 55% on MSR. Presumably, that's a customer that you could get to come to your brand a lot, in other words, to actually have increased frequency relative to the brand of the past. So can you talk about the frequency opportunity that you have, I mean, I guess, in two parts? I mean, one, you're kind of bringing back that 2019 customer to come back as often today as they used to three years ago, kind of the first part of the question. And then, secondly, what are the frequency-driving opportunities that you have for some of the new customers? I mean talk about that as both part of the MSR program as well as other initiatives that you may have.\nHoward Schultz: Brady?\nBrady Brewer: Sure. Thank you, John. While transactions are still lower than FY '19 or pre-COVID levels, what we are seeing is transactions continue to grow. And what is -- a part of this is that products sold, as measured by units per store per day, have been consistently higher than FY '19. So what we're seeing is more group orders. Starbucks Rewards frequency is a function both of our SR members visiting frequently, but we're also adding so many new members. And what we're doing is acquiring customers who are lower frequency and bringing them into the program, which helps increase their frequency. The SR program tends to see a very significant increase in frequency in the first year of membership. And so SR is a strong driver of that for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi.\nJon Tower: Great. I just want to follow up on the China recovery. And curious to understand what's embedded in your expectations for the year for the China outlook. Specifically, it sounds like, obviously, you're betting in your guidance the idea that there's a reopening in the back half of the year. So what's the risk to the numbers, particularly the comp and the earnings recovery in the back half of this year should COVID -- zero-COVID policy stay in place?\nHoward Schultz: Rachel, do you want to start that? And if Belinda wants to add anything. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Yes. Thank you for the question. The way we've considered the recovery in China is really, as we said in the beginning, based on mobility. And so when we talk about an outsized performance in the back half of the year, it's as we lap the severity of the lockdowns. So even though there may still be challenges, if you recall, we have, towards the end of Q2, started to see the severity of the lockdowns with a negative 23% comp in that quarter, followed by a negative 44% comp in the following quarter. So we're basing our expectations of recovery based on the laps and the increased mobility. Certainly, there's -- as we've indicated today, it's nonlinear, but that's how our actual assumptions for recovery are based, which is part of our guidance.\nHoward Schultz: Belinda, do you have any -- sorry. Go ahead, Belinda.\nBelinda Wong: Yes, yes. Let me just add to the fact that how pleased we are to see a solid sequential improvement in Q4 in terms of our revenue and comp sales growth. It's humbling to see what a strong positive correlation we're seeing between easing restrictions and our business recovery. I mean the incredible sequential improvement on our 90-day active members enthusiastically coming back to our stores as soon as the mobility restrictions eases, it really gives us a lot of confidence on our ability to rebound as soon as the mobility restrictions are lifted. So I just wanted to add that. Thank you.\nHoward Schultz: Belinda, can you just add one more thing, if you don't mind, the -- what you've been -- what you and the team have been able to do given the restrictions on digital and delivery, please?\nBelinda Wong: Yes. Despite the short-term COVID disruptions, as we shared at Investor Day, we remain laser-focused on executing our China growth agenda with great discipline and confidence, right? As you heard, we achieved record high-quality new store growth. And now, we have 6,021 new stores across 230 cities, and those new stores continue to achieve best-in-class returns and profitability. We also focused on our fast-growing omnichannel business, and that continued to gain great momentum. As Howard shared, Starbucks Delivers, sales grew 35% year-on-year to a record 24% of our sales mix. That's pretty incredible. And total mobile ordering sales mix now reached 44%. That's something we're very pleased to see, and it's going to be here to stay as we unfold more occasions from our customers. Customers' engagement, as I said before, Rewards active members coming back, we're very pleased to see that. And that's really close to our historic high as well. And we are achieving the highest customer connection score. Our partners are really on the ground, serving our customers. We're learning every day as to how to operate our stores better. We're increasing our muscle and our operational capability. We're getting smarter in our supply chain and our store development. So I'm very pleased to see. And also, one more thing. In terms of our partner engagement, we have achieved record-low full-time retail partner turnover in FY '22. That really demonstrates the partner investments that we have made over the past years are really paying off. So we're very humbled and -- but well positioned and excited to capture the future growth opportunities. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. On the reinvention plan, inside of '23, can you help us prioritize what you think drive sales the most? You talked about retention improving. You've talked about some equipment upgrades. If there's a way to sort of rank order what you think sort of benefits the business, or if there's a cadence, should we think about certain of these initiatives benefiting one part of the year versus the other? And inside of that, can you just talk about speed of service and where you are, where you want to be? It would seem to me, just based on personal experience, that that's still an issue and maybe a gating factor to unlocking greater traffic growth over the next couple of quarters. Thanks.\nHoward Schultz: Frank, can you take the reinvention question, please, and then Sara could talk about speed of service?\nFrank Britt: Sure. The partner experience as the core of the operating model of Starbucks is designed to drive retention, improve connection scores, both to the partner and customer. And the secondary effect, to answer your question about top line growth, is it creates more capacity that allows us to capture that incremental demand that sometimes is challenged in the current operating environment. And so the core of the reinvention agenda, of course, is the combining of innovation around store, customer and partner. But at the end of the day, it's designed to give us the capacity to engage the customers how they want to be engaged, in service of supporting their needs and ultimately, the performance.\nSara Trilling: Thank you. Thank you, Frank. Thank you, John. I just want to start out with just an acknowledgment. We certainly don't have a demand issue in our stores. As we've talked about, we've got total weekly active customers that continue to grow. We're benefiting from incredibly high average weekly sales. And so your call-out about the opportunities, with speed, with service, is top of mind with all of us. I mean notably, over the last quarter, we did see some improvement during peak in our drive-through business in those window times, which is a metric that we continually keep an eye on and really orient our focus in our retail stores, with leaders observing and coaching during that daypart specifically. All I can say is that I acknowledge the opportunity ahead. And what we hope to see with the reduction in turnover, the increase with more tenured partners and overall stability in our stores, that you'll continue to see improvement with speed, with service, whether that's in those peak hours in cafe and drive-through or over the full dayparts.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good afternoon. Howard, I think you mentioned that you're willing to support some of the license partners outside the U.S., if I heard that correctly. And I just wanted to see if you could elaborate on what you mean by that statement and whether you're seeing pockets of issues outside the U.S. with all the pressures in the macro environment. Any elaboration on that would be helpful. Thanks.\nHoward Schultz: Sure. I'll start and respond, and then I'll give it to Michael Conway, who runs International. I think Starbucks has some very unique long-term relationships that go back, in some cases, in terms of the Middle East, Mexico and Latin South America, Korea, some of these relationships go back 25, 30 years. And there's others. And so there is a tremendous level of loyalty, friendship that we have well beyond the business relationship. So we're in constant contact side-by-side with our partners to ensure the fact that they know that if something did come up, we would be a backstop and be there for them. That has not, in any way, been the case, and they have not indicated anything. But we certainly want to be the kind of partner that we can look back on with great pride that we were there for them. I'll give it to Michael Conway, who is working side-by-side with them every day.\nMichael Conway: Thank you, Howard. That's right. We're keeping a close eye on the headwinds that we know are here, both from foreign exchange perspective and inflation perspective. But what I can say is that, so far, we're not seeing any negative impacts. Our business outside of China internationally grew over 30%. We're having double-digit comps in all of our company-operated markets and across all the regions. And so we're staying very close to them. But at the same time, we feel confident that between the strength of our brand, the convenience that we're bringing, the fact that, certainly over this last quarter, we saw travel start to pick up, it was a strong summer and mobility is continuing to open up, we see a lot of tailwind in our business. And we'll stay close to our business partners should they see challenges.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler.\nNicole Regan: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the -- you gave some commentary earlier about the employees. And it sounds like they would have been surveyed in terms of working conditions and benefits. And clearly, you've done the same for consumers. So the two part question, number one, thinking about how you talk to survey the employees and customers, has the process changed for either? And then the second part, part B, where do they overlap? Where is the intersection really of shared ideas between the employees and the customer relationship? Thank you very much.\nHoward Schultz: Why don't Frank and Sara take a shot at that? Thank you for the question, Nicole.\nFrank Britt: Yes. So thank you. So we have a very advanced, what we call, listening capability, where we are constantly sensing how our partners are doing, those who proudly wear the Green Aprons in the store. There is a process that happens on a sort of short-term basis, just to sort of monitor. And then we have a more comprehensive process which we do quarterly. We then deconstruct that. We do a tremendous amount of correlation analysis using some very advanced capabilities we have in the analytics and data science arena. And we try to be very precise about the things we're responding to base on the first principle that we've espoused now for quite a while, which is this idea that we should be creating the new Starbucks with partners and for partners. And so I think we have come a long way in that arena. And yet, as we often say, we're pleased but not satisfied. As it relates to the connection to the customer side, which I'll let Sara further elaborate on, we know, as we've talked about before, there is a direct correlation between partner engagement, which is the sum total of the surveying you've mentioned, and customer engagement. And we know that correlation is real, and it's amplified and you can see it every day in action. And so we try to spend a lot of time understanding that connection between the 2. In the context of the brand, which Brady speaks to quite a bit, we know that care is the number one factor in the brand equity equation of Starbucks. And we know the partner is the epicenter of that care. And so that is the fabric that binds the lens of brand experience as measured by the customer and realized experience as measured by the partner in the store.\nHoward Schultz: Thanks, Frank. And Sara?\nSara Trilling: Thank you, Howard. I would just kind of pull up and offer kind of a broad range perspective, going back to the reinvention overall. And that is that the investments that we're making are directly designed to make it easier for our partners to do their job and to enable them to meet the growing demand in our stores and create new ways with that additional capacity to engage with our customers. We do track partner engagement on a regular basis. And we also mapped that engagement to the activity that we're launching in our stores, so that we can understand the connections, if there are pain points or if there are opportunities, and continue to check and adjust and to design around those learnings looking forward. The other thing I think we're quite excited about is launching some new listening mechanisms related to partner engagement. Our partner app is an example of that, which we're currently piloting and testing. And as we look to the future, we acknowledge that it is an era of co-creation. And those who are closest to the frontline, serving our customers, have a deep and rich understanding of what's needed, and we need to enable them to be able to serve.\nOperator: Thank you. The last question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. You may ask your question.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Thank you. And first of all, Howard, thank you very much for the kind words on Italy and its coffee culture. I wanted to ask a question on the differences that you're seeing in terms of customer behavior or demographic about incremental unique customers that you're seeing across your stores. And in particular, what is attracting them to the brand compared to your existing base?\nHoward Schultz: Brady?\nBrady Brewer: Yes, can I ask a clarifying question? Was that about Italy specifically?\nDanilo Gargiulo: No. That was about the Starbucks system as a whole, so the 9% -- 7% to 9% unique customers that you've seen this quarter.\nBrady Brewer: Oh, great. Yes, I think the relevance of the brand, really, I think as Sara outlined a bit, is not only are we seeing in the U.S., for example, a larger population of 7-day active customers than we've seen ever before. When we get deeper into that, what we see is that our customer base is becoming younger. In the U.S., 51% of our customer base is now Gen Z and Millennial. And in fact now, our customer base is quite diverse. And I think around the world, we continue to attract both young customers and diverse customers. And when you go into our stores, you see that the relevance of Starbucks is not the coffee your parents drink, but the coffee that young people are choosing every single day. Our brand position right now, we have the strongest brand affinity of any away-from-home coffee brand around the world, and it's seen as the first choice for coffee away from home. So the younger you go, the stronger the brand affinity gets. And the more diverse you go, the stronger the brand affinity gets. And so for all of those reasons, we continue to cater to a very diverse and increasingly young customer base with those cold-customized plant-based beverages and the strategy is working, and we'll continue to do so. Thank you.\nHoward Schultz: On behalf of all of us at Starbucks, I wish you and your families a wonderful Thanksgiving vacation, and we look forward to speaking with you at the end of Q1. Have a great holiday season. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we conclude Starbucks' fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2022 conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Frank Britt",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. It was just 50 days ago that we laid out our reinvention agenda that involve five major strategic shifts. First, creating a truly unified global company; second, radically improving our in-store partner experience; thirdly, reimagining our store operating model; fourth, reinvention around what customer connection means; and perhaps, most importantly, redesign the construct of what it means to be a partner at Starbucks. While still early days, we are seeing progress with several key proxy measures. For example, retention has increased with turnover scores at the hourly Barista level, lower by 1 point versus prior year and 4 points versus prior quarter. Additionally, customer connection scores show a 5-points improvement to pre-pandemic levels. All of these are early but encouraging signs. We fully embrace that our partners are the most critical component to our longer-term performance, and we need to be even better at addressing their needs. Partners who proudly wear the Green Apron have bravely shared their stories and their ideas in our co-creation sessions, and we have concentrated our efforts to jointly create solutions with our partners and for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we continue to improve our already industry-leading benefits to a deeper position of strength with several new programs for partners. Representative examples of improvements include: a new incentivized savings program in partnership with Fidelity, designed to help partners in case of unplanned financial challenges; a new student loan debt program to empower partners looking to find the best ways to address their college debt management obligations; an increase in sick time accrual ratios for our partners; an updated family expansion reimbursement program, aimed to assist partners with the cost of growing their families through adoption and the like. We have remained committed to the critical development opportunities of our people. And as a complement to doubling our partner training hours, as Howard noted, we've reintroduced our iconic Black Apron credentialing program, and nearly 5,000 partners have already earned their apron and continue in the program. We've also launched the pilot of a new partner app designed to create one digital community for our 270,000 U.S. and Canada company-owned operated store partners. And over time, this new digital platform will allow partners to stay connected on what matters to them most, including their schedules, their benefits and continuing to use their voice to drive the co-creation of Starbucks. More than 1,000 partners have participated in our testing and are providing feedback for our launch planned for Q2. Obtaining the right mix and number of hours is essential to a thriving partner experience at Starbucks, and we aim to provide desired hours with flexibility and predictability. We are highly focused on honing our staffing models and operating processes to ensure we can allocate the right amount of talent to each store in every daypart and advancing our capabilities to fine-tune our hours of operations by store to reflect unique demand patterns. As part of the reinvention agenda, all of these efforts share in common a primary focus to grow the lifetime value per partner and are connected to the ongoing reinvention initiatives, including in-store waste reduction and further acceleration of equipment rollout to enable an improved partner experience and higher productivity. We will also continue to focus on accelerating our trade area transformation, modernizing the way technology elevates the store experience and continuing supply chain innovation. Longer-term, powered by our partners' insights, we have a very robust agenda and improvement plan powered by a new architecture and vision of the partner experience. And over time, this will translate into an even more partner-centric system in the stores, affirm our reputation as a frontline talent career launchpad and improve retention rates. Finally, as part of this new phase of reinvention, we continue to lean into our centralized project management office to drive better integration among our initiatives and more fully capture the synergies across our store and customer innovations. Together, these initiatives are designed to strengthen our business through top line growth and margin expansion and improve the partner experience. I look forward to sharing more of the progress in the quarters ahead. Let me now turn it over to my partner, Sara. Sure. The partner experience as the core of the operating model of Starbucks is designed to drive retention, improve connection scores, both to the partner and customer. And the secondary effect, to answer your question about top line growth, is it creates more capacity that allows us to capture that incremental demand that sometimes is challenged in the current operating environment. And so the core of the reinvention agenda, of course, is the combining of innovation around store, customer and partner. But at the end of the day, it's designed to give us the capacity to engage the customers how they want to be engaged, in service of supporting their needs and ultimately, the performance. Yes. So thank you. So we have a very advanced, what we call, listening capability, where we are constantly sensing how our partners are doing, those who proudly wear the Green Aprons in the store. There is a process that happens on a sort of short-term basis, just to sort of monitor. And then we have a more comprehensive process which we do quarterly. We then deconstruct that. We do a tremendous amount of correlation analysis using some very advanced capabilities we have in the analytics and data science arena. And we try to be very precise about the things we're responding to base on the first principle that we've espoused now for quite a while, which is this idea that we should be creating the new Starbucks with partners and for partners. And so I think we have come a long way in that arena. And yet, as we often say, we're pleased but not satisfied. As it relates to the connection to the customer side, which I'll let Sara further elaborate on, we know, as we've talked about before, there is a direct correlation between partner engagement, which is the sum total of the surveying you've mentioned, and customer engagement. And we know that correlation is real, and it's amplified and you can see it every day in action. And so we try to spend a lot of time understanding that connection between the 2. In the context of the brand, which Brady speaks to quite a bit, we know that care is the number one factor in the brand equity equation of Starbucks. And we know the partner is the epicenter of that care. And so that is the fabric that binds the lens of brand experience as measured by the customer and realized experience as measured by the partner in the store."

            "name": "Howard Schultz",
            "content": "Thank you, Tiffany. Well, hello from Milan. Today has been a very special day for me and a powerful emotional reminder of the intersection of my life and years with Starbucks. It was 40 years ago, walking the beautiful streets of Milan, that the inspiration for the possibilities of what Starbucks could one day be and mean around the world first struck me. And here I am, back in Milan, celebrating the early days of our beautiful, thriving business in Italy, a country in which no one expected Starbucks to succeed, on the very day of our global launch of holiday, an event that has become a phenomenon all over the world. So much of Starbucks' inspiration has come from Italy. And in Italy, our partner's dedication to the art of coffee, to the elegance and passion of coffee craft and to the delivery of a premium coffee experience to our customers, is being executed at the highest level. Italians have embraced Starbucks. Our top-selling beverage is actually a solo espresso, validating the quality of our coffee and the relevance of Starbucks customer experience that has defined us since Starbucks' founding in 1971. We recently opened our 20th store in Verona to record crowds, with Rome and Naples fast following in 2023. Milan and Italy are reflections of the premium coffee experience Starbucks is delivering to customers in cities and countries everywhere as demonstrated by the very strong Q4 and fiscal 2022 financial and operating performance Starbucks reported this afternoon. In Q4, Starbucks grew global revenues 11% over prior year to a quarterly record of $8.4 billion driven by 7% comp growth globally and 11% comp growth in North America. For the fiscal year, we grew global revenues 13% over prior year to a record $32.3 billion driven by 8% comp growth globally and 12% comp growth in North America. We also grew our global store base 6% in fiscal '22 and ended the year with roughly 36,000 stores in 83 countries. Today, Starbucks serves over 100 million customer occasions from our retail stores around the world and across all channels, delivers over 400 million customer coffee occasions globally every week. We continue to manage the business through today's challenging operating environment, more mindful than ever of the unprecedented global economic uncertainties and challenges confronting our customers. Our strong performance in the quarter and year is particularly gratifying, in that it underscores the relevance of the Starbucks brand and the strength of our relationships with our customers around the world in the face of these unprecedented challenges. We saw strong demand for Starbucks coffee in Q4 and throughout the year in every market and channel in which we operate. We are encouraged by the early signs of recovery we saw in China in Q4, where innovation, increased customer physical and digital engagement with the Starbucks brand and the relaxing of COVID restrictions, drove solid positive sales momentum and sequential quarterly improvement. The speed with which our business in China accelerated in Q4 and the strong positive correlation between Starbucks revenue growth and the relaxing of COVID mobility restriction reinforces our confidence in Starbucks' long-term growth opportunity in China. However, as you know, over the past few weeks, there has been a significant resurgence of COVID in China. With the resurgence has come renewed lockdowns and mobility restrictions pursuant to China's strict zero-COVID policy, including in many cities in which we operate, meaningfully reducing traffic in our stores. We anticipate the current COVID-related uncertainty to continue and repeat the view we shared on our Q3 call and our Investor Day, that while our long-term aspirations for China remain undiminished, we expect the recovery of our business in the country to be nonlinear. I'll spend more time on China in a few minutes. In fiscal 2022, we drove meaningful growth in our global customer base. In the U.S. alone, we grew our unique customers 9% year-over-year, and our U.S. customers are engaging more deeply with the Starbucks brand as evidenced by a 16% increase in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership year-over-year to nearly 29 million members, up 5% over Q3. Today, Starbucks is connecting to more customers more deeply, both in the U.S. and around the world, than ever before, ideally positioning us to drive further acceleration in revenues and comps in the quarters and years ahead. Our performance supports our confidence in the ambitious growth agenda we announced in September, in which we will be adding roughly eight new stores per day, delivering best-in-class returns around the world every day for the next three years, bringing us to nearly 45,000 stores globally by the end of fiscal 2025. Our Q4 results also demonstrate evidence of early but highly encouraging benefits from reinvention plan investments we detailed at Investor Day in September. And as you will hear from Frank Britt, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer, we have clear line of sight to a full array of benefits reinvention will deliver in the quarters and years ahead. Following Frank, Sara Trilling, a 20-year Starbucks partner, who recently took over leadership of our North American business after having successfully led Asia Pacific for the last four years, she will provide insights into our business in North America today and what to expect in the quarters ahead. Then Rachel will highlight our financial and operating performance in Q4 and for the year and provide guidance for the year ahead. And finally, we will end the call with Q&A. When fully rolled out, Starbucks' reinvention, co-created in partnership with our partners across the country, will touch and elevate every aspect of our Starbucks partner, customer and store experiences. Last week, 2,000 Starbucks leaders from across U.S. and Canada converged in Seattle to coalesce around reinvention and take it back to their local markets. I don't think I've ever seen greater engagement in over 40 years of a more positive response to any Starbucks gathering in our history. Reinvention investments will make it easier for our partners to do their jobs, better enable partners to satisfy growing demand in our stores and provide greater opportunity for our partners to engage with our customers. Reinvention investments are already having a measurable positive impact on our business and operations, most notably in terms of improved partner retention, increased speed of service and an elevated customer experience. And I'm particularly pleased that reinvention investments are bringing coffee excellence, coffee craft and joy and a little bit of love back into being a Starbucks Barista. Key to Starbucks' success and the foundation of our long-term growth strategy is Starbucks' continued global leadership around all things coffee and espresso, hot and cold, Starbucks' core. In Q4, we continued to grow from our core, innovate, introduce new levels of customization and premiumization and extend our global coffee leadership in both the hot and cold beverage categories, with an emphasis on cold coffee, a category we single-handedly created and are growing around the world. Customer demand for customized, handcrafted Starbucks cold beverages is so strong that, today, cold coffee beverages account for 76% of total beverage sales in our U.S. company-operated stores. And customers are increasingly further customizing their cold coffee beverages by adding high-margin beverage flavor modifiers to create unique beverages tailored to their own particular taste preferences. We also continue to introduce innovative new core hot coffee and espresso beverages and innovate around iconic platforms, like pumpkin spice, up 17% over last year driven by increased customization, including cold foams. As part of reinvention, we are rolling out a new, completely proprietary, handheld cold foamer that enhances beverage quality and increases speed of service while reducing complexity for our partners. The response from our partners has been overwhelming. Our growing base of new U.S. customers and Starbucks Rewards members, combined with very strong customer response to our innovative hot and cold beverage lineup to deliver the highest net sales week in our history in September. Let me just repeat that. In our history, we had the biggest sales week in September. The strength of our business as we exited September, coupled with a fantastic holiday lineup kicking off today, with our stores turning red, holiday favorites on the menu and the return of our iconic red cups, gives us tremendous confidence heading into holiday in 2023. In North America overall, the combination of customer shifts towards premium hot and cold beverages, increased customization, strategic decisions around beverage, food and modifier pricing and an 18% increase in food sales drove net revenues up 15% year-over-year to a record $6.1 billion. Once again, our convenience channels, drive-through, Mobile Order & Pay and delivery drove 72% of our total sales volume. Starbucks Rewards members drove a record 55% of tender in our U.S. company-operated stores in Q4. Starbucks Rewards continues to deliver value to our customers, enable customer connection and drive our business. And despite its global scale and growth, we have significant untapped opportunities to grow our Rewards program in a very unique way. We recently launched our Reward Together program, enabling a select group of leading brands to partner with us by linking their loyalty program to Starbucks Rewards. Through Reward Together, we will engage and reward members of both brands with new benefits and experiences that will make our Rewards program even more valuable, drive membership and increase customer lifetime value. Our first U.S. partnership with Delta Airlines launched last month to an extraordinary customer response. Both Delta and Starbucks were overwhelmed with what took place. And in September, we announced Starbucks Odyssey, our next-generation loyalty model that integrates NFTs with Rewards. Starbucks Odyssey will enable us to connect even more deeply with customers and give our customers the opportunity to earn and purchase digital collectible assets that will unlock access to new benefits, a digital community and immersive coffee experiences that they cannot get in any other place. Customer response to Starbucks Odyssey has been overwhelming. You will hear more about the Starbucks Odyssey in a few weeks when our first wave of customers have an opportunity to explore this new exciting way to experience and connect with Starbucks. The numbers that we will release in terms of the response will surprise many of you. Our fast-growing 6,600 North American-licensed store business posted very strong results in Q4, with revenues up 25% in Q4 and 29% for the year. We are proceeding with the rollout of [Starbucks Connect] across the U.S. licensed store portfolio. Starbucks Connect enables licensed stores for the first time to offer the full array of Starbucks' Mobile Order & Pay and Rewards benefits. And as you will hear from Sara, the 1,600 licensed stores that have adopted Starbucks Connect are seeing a significant lift in business since adoption. Starbucks Connect enables us to capture demand across our broader portfolio and will be highly accretive to our business. The momentum we saw in our International segment coming out of Q3 continued in Q4, with revenues for the quarter up 12% to $1.8 billion on a constant currency basis. For the year, revenues grew 9% year-over-year to $6.9 billion, also on a constant currency basis. We added 518 stores during the year and now operate nearly 18,500 stores around the world. We are sensitive to the challenges that the rapid increase in the value of our dollar is posing to our International licensees and remain in close contact as we work together to navigate the dynamic environment that we are all operating in. Turning to our Channels business. Starbucks is the number one share in U.S. at-home coffee. Starbucks is the number one share in global ready-to-drink coffee, and continued growth in our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle combined to deliver strong performance in Q4, with revenues increasing 18% on a constant currency basis to $484 million. For the year, revenues also increased 18% to $1.8 billion on a constant currency basis. Now let me begin the discussion around China by saying that Starbucks has been in China for 20 years and that our aspirations for our business in China has never been greater. We have over 6,000 stores in China today. And as Belinda shared at Investor Day, we have close to 9,000 stores -- we will have close to 9,000 stores by 2025. We will be opening our Starbucks China Coffee Innovation Park, including our largest coffee roasting and packaging plant outside the U.S. in summer 2023. Starbucks employs over 60,000 passionate, dedicated partners in China. Our partners are deeply engaged with their customers and demonstrated by today's record high customer connection scores. We continue to be an employer of choice and lead the way in partner investments, recently introducing a 14th month bonus for all full-time partners. And we continue to invest in China to create career and opportunity paths for our partners and to support the communities we serve. We also continue to expand our customer base in China and deepen our digital connection to customers. Active Starbucks Rewards membership grew 29% sequentially in Q4 over Q3 to over 17 million members, just below historic levels, coinciding with the lifting of restrictions and reflecting the relevance and underlying strength of the Starbucks brand in China. Mobile ordering sales mix, nonexistent prior to 2019, drove 44% of mix in Q4. Delivery, up 35% year-over-year, now representing over 24% of sales. We expect mobile, digital, loyalty and delivery to continue to grow and drive our business. However, we are ultrasensitive to the evolving macro challenges that have surfaced regarding China, particularly in connection with the impact of the zero-COVID policy. But our strong belief in China is based on our success in the country and our commitment to playing the long game. We are confident that when COVID disruptions affecting the country abate, Starbucks will emerge not only as the undisputed leader in our category, but likely the number one Western consumer brand in the country for having continued to meaningfully invest in our partners and in our business throughout the pandemic and despite the disruptions. Laxman's immersion is going spectacularly well. He's visited and worked in stores in the U.S. and U.K., quickly connecting and winning the hearts of Starbucks partners wherever he goes, just this week earning his Barista certification in record time and store Green Apron. Laxman's commitment to becoming intimate with store operations and our partner and customer experiences reflects our mutual understanding of what is most important in these early days of his joining Starbucks. He and I engage daily as he absorbs more and more about the company and our business. And the Board, leadership team and I are all deeply invested in his success. I cannot be more confident that Laxman is the right CEO at the right time for Starbucks. Today, Laxman has a front-row seat as we launch our all-important holiday season. Soon, along with our leadership team, he will be leading the company, bringing reinvention to life and guiding Starbucks to the next chapters of our storied history. In closing, Starbucks has never been financially stronger, better positioned or more confident in our future as we enter Q1 and holiday and embark on the exciting new era of growth ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank? Thank you for the question. This is Howard. I'm sitting with Brady Brewer, Chief Marketing Officer of Starbucks, and he'll take your question. Brady? Thanks, Jeff. Well, let's try and kind of go through the question based on our history, what we've seen in the near term and why we're so confident. If you go back many years, although this is an unprecedented time, we have demonstrated, time and time again, that there is an affordable luxury to Starbucks that our customer base has been willing to support and the loyalty to Starbucks continues. Now in the past, we did not have the inherent benefit of the Rewards program, which as you heard in our prepared remarks, is generating significant revenue for Starbucks, which is highly predictable, and a relationship with that customer base is extremely loyal. The other thing that's different from the years past and which gives us so much confidence is that we've always monitored whether or not our customer base was getting younger every year. We've never wanted to see our customer base get generationally older. We wanted to see it get younger. Not only has it gotten younger, but that young customer, that Gen Z customer, tends to have significantly more discretionary money at their disposal. And their loyalty to Starbucks has been quite significant and predictable. Then you have the pricing power of Starbucks, which we're certainly not going to try and raise prices during this time. But certainly, we've demonstrated, over the last 12 months or so, that we've got almost 6% price increases and we haven't seen the loyalty and the transactions abate. I think customization, which we spoke a lot about in our prepared remarks, is obviously giving us -- and the ticket is becoming more accretive as a result of the modifiers, and those modifiers seem to be more consistent and greater with cold beverages, which is now over 75% of the U.S. business. And then I think we look at the promotional plan that we have for the balance of the year and we look back on our history in terms of the beverages that have succeeded, we look back on the short-term history in terms of what beverages have really been home runs, and I can honestly say we sat through a beverage lineup of innovation a few weeks back and we really had to cull the amount of beverages because we knew we couldn't handle it because there were just too many that we felt so good about. The last thing I'd say, and this is not as quantitative as I would like but it's real, is that during the pandemic and certainly in the last year, Starbucks has picked up consistently -- consistent market share, both in our category and our ability to intercept traffic as a result of the strategic nature of our real estate multiple formats, and we certainly can't avoid this conversation and not talk about the overwhelming success in revenue and how accretive drive-throughs have been. And so net-net, we're highly concerned and humbled by the environment. There isn't a day that goes by in which the lens of every decision we're making is not made -- is made through the concern of what's happening in America and around the world. But we feel that we've got the resources and the know-how, the history and the innovation to produce the kind of numbers that we feel very confident about. Thank you. Sure. Yes. I'll start -- sure, go ahead... Yes. In terms of China, that's 100% correct. There's no issue with regard to opening stores. In fact, we're opening stores at record numbers. And Belinda is on the phone, and if you have a follow-up question about China, she certainly can answer it. In terms of your question about the -- our ability to extend cold and modifiers, a few things. One, cold has certainly surprised us all at Starbucks. But our ability to customize beverages is a significant competitive advantage. There is no other coffee company anywhere in the world that has our ability to respond instantaneously to a customer's request about customization, nor there isn't a coffee company that has our ability behind the counter in terms of flavors, syrups, modifiers, foam, et cetera, to provide the customer what they want. I think cold is in its early stages in terms of what's coming. And the innovation we have around cold through the year will continue to drive awareness and I think, attachment. However, no one should kind of walk away and think about the fact that our coffee -- our hot coffee business is not growing. In fact, it's growing nicely, but cold has kind of taken over. But we have significant innovation plans for hot. So I think the percentage of revenue cold versus hot, I think you'll see hot go up as a result of the innovation we have around the hot platform. And I'll give it to Brady, just to follow up on your question as well. Sure. Belinda Wong, who runs Starbucks China, is on the phone from China, and I think obviously the best person to answer the question. So Belinda, please? Brady? Rachel, do you want to start that? And if Belinda wants to add anything. Rachel? Belinda, do you have any -- sorry. Go ahead, Belinda. Belinda, can you just add one more thing, if you don't mind, the -- what you've been -- what you and the team have been able to do given the restrictions on digital and delivery, please? Frank, can you take the reinvention question, please, and then Sara could talk about speed of service? Sure. I'll start and respond, and then I'll give it to Michael Conway, who runs International. I think Starbucks has some very unique long-term relationships that go back, in some cases, in terms of the Middle East, Mexico and Latin South America, Korea, some of these relationships go back 25, 30 years. And there's others. And so there is a tremendous level of loyalty, friendship that we have well beyond the business relationship. So we're in constant contact side-by-side with our partners to ensure the fact that they know that if something did come up, we would be a backstop and be there for them. That has not, in any way, been the case, and they have not indicated anything. But we certainly want to be the kind of partner that we can look back on with great pride that we were there for them. I'll give it to Michael Conway, who is working side-by-side with them every day. Why don't Frank and Sara take a shot at that? Thank you for the question, Nicole. Thanks, Frank. And Sara? Brady? On behalf of all of us at Starbucks, I wish you and your families a wonderful Thanksgiving vacation, and we look forward to speaking with you at the end of Q1. Have a great holiday season. Thank you very much."

But what I can say is that, so far, we're not seeing any negative impacts. Our business outside of China internationally grew over 30%. We're having double-digit comps in all of our company-operated markets and across all the regions. And so we're staying very close to them. But at the same time, we feel confident that between the strength of our brand, the convenience that we're bringing, the fact that, certainly over this last quarter, we saw travel start to pick up, it was a strong summer and mobility is continuing to open up, we see a lot of tailwind in our business. And we'll stay close to our business partners should they see challenges."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Sara, and welcome to your first Starbucks earnings call. And good afternoon, everyone. As you heard throughout this call, starting with Howard, we had record-breaking performance this quarter, and I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved together. We finished fiscal year 2022 with consistently strong demand in the U.S. and in nearly all major markets across the globe, with that demand sustaining as we exited the year. Our Q4 consolidated revenue reached another historical high, $8.4 billion, up 11% from the prior year or 14% when excluding a 3% impact of foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was primarily driven by 7% comparable store sales growth and 6% net-new store growth over the past 12 months, further strengthened by the remarkable momentum in our global licensed store businesses. In addition, this outstanding performance reflects double-digit revenue growth in all three of our reporting segments in constant currencies, showcasing the resiliency of our brand, power of customer loyalty and depth of our diverse portfolio. Q4 consolidated operating margin contracted 380 basis points from the prior year to 15.1%, primarily driven by investments in growth in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training, part of which were investments under our reinvention plan. In addition, operating margin was impacted by inflationary headwinds and deleverage related to COVID restrictions in China. The overall contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets outside of China. Q4 EPS was $0.81, declining 9% from the prior year, but better than expectations, including $0.05 of nonrecurring benefits primarily related to discrete tax benefits. For full year fiscal 2022, our consolidated revenue reached a record $32.3 billion, up 13% from the prior year or 15% when excluding a 2% impact of foreign currency translation driven by 8% comparable store growth, 6% net-new store growth and strength in our global licensed store businesses. Full year consolidated operating margin and EPS were 15.1% and $2.96, respectively. I will now provide segment highlights for Q4. North America delivered revenue of $6.1 billion in Q4, up 15% from the prior year and another all-time record, primarily driven by an 11% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 10% increase in average ticket as well as net-new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months. Impressive momentum in our U.S. licensed store business also contributed to the segment's record revenue performance. My colleagues spoke in detail about our incredible U.S. performance in Q4, posting 11% comparable store sales growth. Average ticket once again broke a record, primarily driven by pricing and food attach. Despite elevated pricing actions taken throughout the year, daily store traffic in the U.S. reached approximately 95% pre-pandemic levels in September, fueled by the wildly successful fall promotion. Importantly, the volume of beverage and food items sold per store has well-exceeded pre-pandemic levels, and the number of unique customers, again, reached an all-time high in Q4, up 9% over the prior year and up more than 1% versus prior quarter, underscoring our brand's expanding reach and relevance and customer loyalty. North America's operating margin was 19% in Q4, contracting 270 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to investments in growth in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training as well as inflationary headwinds, partially offset by pricing and sales leverage. Our disciplined actions to closely manage labor hours, reduce waste and prioritize discretionary spend also contributed to the segment's margin performance as we build a strong foundation for progressive margin expansion in years to come. Moving on to International. The segment delivered third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, down 1% from the prior year or up nearly 12% when excluding a 12% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. This double-digit revenue growth in constant currencies was driven by sustained strength in all major markets outside of China as well as an 8% increase in total store count over the past 12 months. The growth was partially offset by a 5% decline in comparable store sales as the impacts of COVID continued in China. As Howard discussed, our China market continued its recovery in Q4, navigating through reoccurring COVID outbreaks and turbulent consumer mobility. The market posted a comp decline of 16% in Q4, a meaningful sequential improvement from a 44% decline in Q3. Despite this depressed traffic, the China team's outstanding leadership and strength of our brand were markedly evident in the quarter as reflected in record levels of store development, growth in delivery and the highest-ever customer connection scores. Outside of China and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our diverse international markets across the globe sustained incredible momentum in Q4. Collectively, the market's revenue growth exceeded 30% in the quarter when excluding a 19% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. International segment's net-new stores reached a quarterly record at 518, climbing to more than 18,000 stores in total, setting the stage for a new era of growth, with a rapidly expanding footprint around the world. Operating margin for the International segment was 14.5% in Q4, down 750 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by deleverage related to COVID restrictions in China, lower government subsidies as well as partner investments. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and strong sales leverage across markets outside of China. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 16% to $484 million in Q4 or up 18% when excluding a 2% impact from foreign currency translation driven by growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our global ready-to-drink businesses. Channel Development continued to play a vital role in differentiating, diversifying and amplifying our brand by creating customer occasions outside our stores. As a result, Starbucks remains the market leader in both the total U.S. at-home coffee and ready-to-drink categories. Building on the success of our newer platforms, the segment's robust innovations continued in the quarter, including the introductions of ready-to-drink Starbucks Pumpkin Cream Nitro Cold Brew in the U.S. and bottled Frappuccino Smoothie in China, to name a few. The segment's operating margin was 50.6% in Q4, down 170 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by business mix shift. Let's now move on to our fiscal 2023 outlook, which reflects the beginning of a new era of growth. Our guidance remains consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in September. So today, I will reaffirm and refine the guidance specific to fiscal year 2023. And we'll also introduce an outlook on a few below-the-line metrics that were not part of our Investor Day guidance. Starting with the first building block of our growth, comparable store sales growth. We expect fiscal 2023 U.S. comparable sales growth to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. For China, we're expecting outsized comp in fiscal year 2023 as we lap the severity of the lockdowns in the market. Given the quarterly shape of the fiscal 2022 baseline, we expect China comp to be negative in the first quarter, followed by outsized comp in the balance of the year. Our fiscal 2023 global comp growth is expected to be near the high end of our long-term target range of 7% to 9%, consistent with what I shared at Investor Day. And global comp in Q1, reflecting negative comp in China, is expected to be at the low end of the annual guidance range, then expanding in subsequent quarters. Moving on to the second building block, new store growth. We expect our U.S. store count to grow by approximately 3% in fiscal year 2023. In China, we will continue to rapidly expand our store footprint, with approximately 13% growth expected in fiscal year 2023. We expect our global store growth to reach approximately 7%, with over 75% of the growth coming from outside of the U.S. as we continue to diversify our portfolio globally. With this powerful combination of global comp and store growth, coupled with our Channel Development performance, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to reach the range of 10% to 12% in fiscal year 2023 despite an approximately three percentage point unfavorable impact expected from foreign currency translation. Within fiscal 2023, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation is expected to reach approximately four percentage points in the first half of the fiscal year, tempering to approximately one to two percentage points in the back half of the year. Despite the considerable pressure we now expect from foreign currency translation, which could abate, we remain confident in our revenue guidance range for the full year. We have a solid path to capture strong demand, maximize opportunities unlocked from our reinvention plan and deliver attractive revenue results. Our third building block is operating margin. Globally, we expect solid margin expansion in fiscal year 2023. In terms of a quarterly shape, we expect operating margin to be tempered in Q1 and Q2, with meaningfully higher margins in Q3 and Q4 as margin benefits accumulate from the continued unlocking of the reinvention plan, coupled with the expected recovery in China. In addition to the quarterly shape of operating margin, here are a few points to consider. We expect over $1 billion incremental investments in fiscal year 2023, half of which will reflect the annualization of the fiscal 2022 investments. We expect headwinds related to supply chain and commodity inflationary pressures to continue in fiscal 2023, albeit to a lesser extent relative to fiscal 2022. Headwinds will be managed through sales leverage, pricing and productivity from the reinvention, resulting in positive margin expansion as the year progresses, as I previously mentioned. The fourth building block is capital allocation. We expect our CapEx in fiscal 2023 to be approximately $2.5 billion. As we shared during our Investor Day, we also expect to return approximately $20 billion to shareholders in the next three years between dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to targeting an approximately 50% dividend payout ratio as reflected in the recently announced dividend increase, and we'll also resume our buyback program in fiscal 2023. We expect the buyback benefit on EPS to be initially limited until fiscal 2024, when the benefit is expected to reach approximately 1%, calculated net of interest expense. In regards to interest expense, we expect between $540 million and $560 million of interest expense in fiscal 2023, up from $483 million in fiscal 2022. This increase, driven by incremental debt issuances in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 as outlined in our capital allocation strategy. Importantly, we remain committed to our BBB+ credit rating and leverage cap of 3x rent-adjusted EBITDA. As for tax rates in fiscal 2023, we expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the mid-20% range. This is up from our fiscal 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 22.4% and 23.1%, respectively, which benefited from certain discrete tax items that are not expected to repeat to the same degree in fiscal 2023. Finally, based on the current environment, we expect foreign currency translation to have approximate four percentage point unfavorable impact on fiscal 2023 earnings growth. Despite that, we continue to expect fiscal 2023 GAAP EPS growth to be at the high end of the 15% to 20% range. Fiscal 2023 non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to be at the low end of the long-term range of 15% to 20% as the benefits of the reinvention investments will take time to amplify. It's important to note that Q4 fiscal 2022 included approximately $0.05 of nonrecurring items, largely from discrete tax benefits. And considering the quarterly EPS shape, we expect it to mirror the quarterly shape of operating margin, which will also have a meaningful step-up in the second half of the fiscal year. In closing, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. We are incredibly proud of our Q4 performance, underpinned by the experience our partners create for our customers each and every day. Our 2023 guidance sets the stage for another year of record performance. Importantly, we recognize that our future growth is dependent on our investments in our partners, stores and customers. As we lean in and solve the challenges of our business, together with our partners, we are confident of our path to unlock a new era of growth, creating value for all stakeholders, partners, customers and shareholders. Once again, our success is earned through our more than 450,000 Green Apron partners working across the globe to elevate the Starbucks experience each and every day. Their commitment and their unwavering focus will continue to be the cornerstone of our new era of growth. With that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator? Yes. Thank you for the question. The way we've considered the recovery in China is really, as we said in the beginning, based on mobility. And so when we talk about an outsized performance in the back half of the year, it's as we lap the severity of the lockdowns. So even though there may still be challenges, if you recall, we have, towards the end of Q2, started to see the severity of the lockdowns with a negative 23% comp in that quarter, followed by a negative 44% comp in the following quarter. So we're basing our expectations of recovery based on the laps and the increased mobility. Certainly, there's -- as we've indicated today, it's nonlinear, but that's how our actual assumptions for recovery are based, which is part of our guidance."

            "name": "Sara Trilling",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm Sara Trilling. I'm pleased to join you today for my first earnings call in my new role, leading the North America business. While I'm relatively new to this particular role, I'm a 20-year partner and most recently served as Senior Vice President of Asia Pacific. Over my Starbucks career, I've touched nearly every aspect of the business and have served many leadership positions across a variety of functions, including store development, retail operations, product and marketing. And I'm looking forward to applying the relevant breadth and depth of my experiences to this next phase of growth in North America. To build on some of the comments from Frank and Howard, we continue to see very healthy growth in our North America business. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we saw the highest net sales week of all time with the launch of our fall promo. And I'm pleased to share this subsequently led to an incredibly strong September, with the three high sales weeks in our history. Our strong quarter, comparable sales of 11% and revenue growth of 15% were largely driven by a record-breaking fall launch, coupled with continued strategic pricing actions and increased food attach as well as the shift to more premium beverages and a growing demand for personalization in both company-operated as well as licensed businesses. Elevated from pre-pandemic levels, we maintained ticket comp strength in our U.S. company-operated business at 10%, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of increased ticket comp. These results reflect the continued strength in demand for Starbucks as our customers fell into their new normal routine and behaviors. We fully expect the momentum from our record fall launch to continue as our highly anticipated holiday at Starbucks launched just today and include some great seasonal offerings. What gives us further confidence in the holiday season is the strength of the Starbucks brand with younger, more diverse customer groups. More than half our U.S. customer base is Gen Z and Millennials, reflecting relevancy and brand love across generational cohorts, trends we see with diverse customer cohorts as well. We are incredibly pleased with our momentum in the business and the reinforcement of our strategy in the following key areas. First, we've established sustained relevancy of the Starbucks brand in customer loyalty. In fact, Starbucks is consistently, quarter-over-quarter, the leader in market share, first choice and past 30-day visitation when it comes to an away-from-home coffee occasion as measured by our brand equity tracker. We're also pleased to share that customer connection scores have increased 5 points versus pre-pandemic levels. The strength of the brand is further illustrated by the success of our iconic pumpkin spice platform, which grew 17% year-over-year and continues to resonate with customers who love the classic Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as newer additions, such as the Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam modifier. Second, our cold customized beverage strategy is working. We're seeing growth in both hot and cold and increasing customization. In Q4, more than 60% of beverage units sold in the U.S. company-operated business were customized, contributing to the $1 billion and growing annual net sales for modifiers, representing growth of 2x since the first fiscal 2019. Finally, we reinforced our unique position in providing experiential convenience as evidenced by all-time highs in Starbucks Rewards engagement amid Mobile Order & Pay orders. The Starbucks Rewards program in the U.S. grew 90-day active members, ending FY '22 with nearly 29 million members. This represents growth of 16% year-over-year and 55% of our U.S. company-operated revenue in the quarter, up nearly 4% from prior year, representing the highest-ever percent of tender. Mobile Order & Pay surpassed 26% in Q4 for the first time in a quarter, finishing fiscal year '22 at 25% of total transactions. We're incredibly optimistic about our continued momentum in digital, following the unprecedented interest in Starbucks Odyssey, the integration of NFTs with our industry-leading loyalty program to create an accessible Web3 community that brings unique aspects of our brand to life in a new way. We also experienced a wildly successful launch of Reward Together with Delta. With this partnership, our Rewards members are able to earn miles faster through their everyday purchase at Starbucks and earn even more Stars on days when they travel with Delta. The initial response from customers has been extraordinary and beyond our expectation, and this is just the start. Importantly, we finished the year with nearly 25% of our U.S. license portfolio live with Starbucks Connect, allowing us to create a seamless digital experience across our stores, giving customers more ways to connect with our brands, furthering the value of the rewards experience. As part of our reinvention and as we shared at our September Investor Day, we're investing in equipment to innovate for an improved partner and customer experience. We have completed the deployment of Starbucks Cold Brewer and have rolled out the Mastrena 2 espresso machine and new warming ovens to nearly 95% and 72%, respectively, of our stores across the U.S. This equipment collectively supports improvement in our throughput during both peak and full day, while providing the foundation to support elevated partner and customer experiences as we further reinvention plan investments and productivity. The rollouts for these three items will be completed by fiscal year '23 for our company-operated stores. Additionally, we rolled out nearly 60% of our handheld point-of-sale investments to nearly 75% of our cold beverage labelers. Handheld POS is already helping us capture new and latent demand in support of our ambitious revenue expectations. And we expect to see further benefit as we extend the rollout for handheld POS into fiscal year '24. While still in the early days of development, partner and customer reception of the new Siren System innovation we shared at Investor Day is overwhelmingly positive, including the Clover Vertica brewer and the new proprietary on-demand cold-pressed Cold Brew technology. We expect to begin rolling out Clover Vertica brewer later in this fiscal year, with our broader Siren System innovations fast following in fiscal year 2024. Through our investments, we're giving our partners more time to focus on coffee craft and connect with customers, enabling them to continue delivering experiential convenience in a way that only Starbucks can. The powerful unlock is our reinvention positions us for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. In fact, just this last week, we welcomed nearly 2,000 retail leaders from U.S. and Canada to Seattle for our District Manager Leadership Experience. This powerful three day event is designed with great intention to provide a renewed understanding of the critical role each leader plays in our business and with our people and equip them fully to lead their stores and store partners through our reinvention and into our future as we all breathe life into this reinvention plan. To close, what I would leave you with -- is with this. This is an incredibly exciting time to lead our North America business. While the macro environment may have uncertainty, our performance is once again demonstrating the strength and resilience of our brand and our business. We are well positioned in this environment, which will only further strengthen as our reinvention comes to life. I'll now turn it over to Rachel. Thank you. Thank you, Frank. Thank you, John. I just want to start out with just an acknowledgment. We certainly don't have a demand issue in our stores. As we've talked about, we've got total weekly active customers that continue to grow. We're benefiting from incredibly high average weekly sales. And so your call-out about the opportunities, with speed, with service, is top of mind with all of us. I mean notably, over the last quarter, we did see some improvement during peak in our drive-through business in those window times, which is a metric that we continually keep an eye on and really orient our focus in our retail stores, with leaders observing and coaching during that daypart specifically. All I can say is that I acknowledge the opportunity ahead. And what we hope to see with the reduction in turnover, the increase with more tenured partners and overall stability in our stores, that you'll continue to see improvement with speed, with service, whether that's in those peak hours in cafe and drive-through or over the full dayparts. Thank you, Howard. I would just kind of pull up and offer kind of a broad range perspective, going back to the reinvention overall. And that is that the investments that we're making are directly designed to make it easier for our partners to do their job and to enable them to meet the growing demand in our stores and create new ways with that additional capacity to engage with our customers. We do track partner engagement on a regular basis. And we also mapped that engagement to the activity that we're launching in our stores, so that we can understand the connections, if there are pain points or if there are opportunities, and continue to check and adjust and to design around those learnings looking forward. The other thing I think we're quite excited about is launching some new listening mechanisms related to partner engagement. Our partner app is an example of that, which we're currently piloting and testing. And as we look to the future, we acknowledge that it is an era of co-creation. And those who are closest to the frontline, serving our customers, have a deep and rich understanding of what's needed, and we need to enable them to be able to serve."

            "name": "Brady Brewer",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question. Really, the Reward Together program is about taking like-minded leading loyalty programs and linking them directly to Starbucks Rewards. And the intent is that whether or not you are with an airline like Delta, you can earn miles faster at Starbucks, and you can get additional Starbucks benefits when you fly with Delta. And we're looking at a number of leading brands. And so this is creating direct tech-to-tech connection to link our loyalty programs and make the experiences better for both brands and both sets of customers. In terms of the data, we're really sticking with our continued focus on using data to make the experience better but being very thoughtful and disciplined about the data that we capture, but using it to make the experience better and inform our business. So we're excited about the early stages of Reward Together. What we've seen, as you heard on the call, is extraordinary demand to link accounts in a way that was overwhelming relative to our expectations. So we're excited to see this build in the future. Yes. I think the -- as Howard said, hot coffee is growing, but cold beverage, over the last few years, has just accelerated, and that added an entire stack of sales volume into the stores. What we're seeing, and Sara mentioned, is that the cold-customized plant-based beverage platform is particularly appealing. The younger you go, the colder the beverage. We've seen significant year-over-year growth in Iced Espresso, which is our biggest product category. We're continuing to now see growth in hot espresso. Refreshers, Nitro, Cold Brew are all growing significantly. But as Howard said, modifiers have grown in double digits year-over-year. Now over 60% of our beverages are customized. And why is that important? It's important because what our customers have discovered is that their favorite beverage is not possible to buy anywhere else. I think that links to the earlier question about navigating rough times too, is this is a beverage you can only get at Starbucks and you can't make it home. And increasingly, customization has enabled that in our stores. So we're just getting started. Lots of growth opportunity ahead. Sure. Thank you, John. While transactions are still lower than FY '19 or pre-COVID levels, what we are seeing is transactions continue to grow. And what is -- a part of this is that products sold, as measured by units per store per day, have been consistently higher than FY '19. So what we're seeing is more group orders. Starbucks Rewards frequency is a function both of our SR members visiting frequently, but we're also adding so many new members. And what we're doing is acquiring customers who are lower frequency and bringing them into the program, which helps increase their frequency. The SR program tends to see a very significant increase in frequency in the first year of membership. And so SR is a strong driver of that for us. Yes, can I ask a clarifying question? Was that about Italy specifically? Oh, great. Yes, I think the relevance of the brand, really, I think as Sara outlined a bit, is not only are we seeing in the U.S., for example, a larger population of 7-day active customers than we've seen ever before. When we get deeper into that, what we see is that our customer base is becoming younger. In the U.S., 51% of our customer base is now Gen Z and Millennial. And in fact now, our customer base is quite diverse. And I think around the world, we continue to attract both young customers and diverse customers. And when you go into our stores, you see that the relevance of Starbucks is not the coffee your parents drink, but the coffee that young people are choosing every single day. Our brand position right now, we have the strongest brand affinity of any away-from-home coffee brand around the world, and it's seen as the first choice for coffee away from home. So the younger you go, the stronger the brand affinity gets. And the more diverse you go, the stronger the brand affinity gets. And so for all of those reasons, we continue to cater to a very diverse and increasingly young customer base with those cold-customized plant-based beverages and the strategy is working, and we'll continue to do so. Thank you."

Starbucks' strong Q3 results highlighted by 9% global revenue growth to a record $8.2 billion, 3% global comp growth and 9% comp growth in North America once again demonstrates the power and resilience of the Starbucks business and brand all over the world. I've now been back as CEO for four months. During that time, I've immersed myself in every segment, region, operation and aspect of our business. And given my long history with the Company and our culture and my unique understanding and appreciation of the Starbucks brand, the drivers of our global business and the special relationship that exists among our people, our brand and our customers, we've been able to pinpoint the source of each of the issues and challenges confronting the Company upon my return. Some are definitely COVID related, some were a function of not focusing on the long term, and unfortunately, many were self-induced. More important, we now have clear line of sight on what we need to do to totally reinvent the Company and drive accelerated profitable growth around the world. The Q3 results we announced today demonstrate the early progress we have made in just four short months and served as a proof point of the significant long-term global growth opportunity ahead for Starbucks. Each business segment contributed to our Q3 performance. I'm particularly pleased that we delivered our results in the face of stiff ongoing consumer economic and inflationary headwinds. COVID lockdowns across China that kept Shanghai, our largest China market, largely closed for two months, and that continues episodically today, and continuing shifts in customer traffic and behaviors including materially reduced office occupancy in our largest urban markets. Our Q3 performance underscores the success of the investments we are making in our people, extending our global leadership around everything coffee and in groundbreaking beverage, food, digital and technology innovation that is deepening our connection to customers in every market and every channel. And our performance demonstrates that the Starbucks Experience is more relevant and important than ever in today's unsettled world. On today's call, I will highlight the drivers of our Q3 revenue comp and EPS performance. I will then turn the call over to Frank Britt, our Chief Strategy Officer, to provide an overview of our reinvention plan, the strategy underpinning the investments we are making to materially elevate our partner, customer and store experiences. Next month, at Investor Day in Seattle, you will see for yourselves how accretive to our business our reinvention plan will be, increasing efficiency, enabling us to seamlessly handle the increasing demand in our U.S. stores and most of all, elevating our partner, customer and in-store experiences. Our reinvention plan touches every aspect of the Starbucks Experience and sets us up for accelerated long-term profitable growth and value creation benefiting all stakeholders beginning in 2023. We are executing against the reinvention plan with focus, with discipline and a deep sense of urgency. Next, Belinda will update you on China, where our position in the market and our aspirations for the future have never been greater. Rachel will provide a deep dive into our Q3 financial and operating results, and then we'll move on to Q&A. For to Starbucks' success and long-term growth strategy is our global leadership around everything coffee. No company in the world even remotely approaching Starbucks' ability to source, blend, roast and craft the world's best coffees. And in Q3, we continued to extend our coffee leadership, innovate and bring further elements of customization and premiumization to the entire coffee category, including around cold, handcrafted and plant-based coffee beverages. Customer demand for specifically customized cold coffee beverages, a category Starbucks single-handedly created and is now expanding around the world, is so strong that cold beverages now account for roughly 75% of our total beverage sales in U.S. company-operated stores. Customers are increasingly customizing their cold beverages by adding modifiers that enable the creation of a virtually unlimited range of taste, flavor and color profiles, and then sharing their unique coal beverage creations with the world through social media. Starbucks' unique ability to deliver handcrafted, customized cold beverages that satisfy customer desires and different need states while creating opportunities for customers' self-expression deepens our connection to customers, sets us apart from any other industry participant and provides us with a significant ongoing competitive advantage in the marketplace. Iced Shaken Espresso introduced onto our Iced Espresso platform only last year, is resonating so wildly with our Gen Z customers that it has already become the fastest-growing product category in our U.S. company-operated stores, growing 50% year-over-year, more than doubling year-to-date and importantly creating new customer occasions in the midday and afternoon day parts. Iced Shaken Espresso was also resonating around the world. In China, for example where Iced Shaken Espresso was only introduced in June of this year, it is already among our best-selling iced coffee beverages despite mobility restrictions in China. Just to summarize what's going on with cold and specifically customized beverages. The premium customized cold coffee opportunity ahead for Starbucks all around the world is simply enormous. Let me turn to North America. The very strong demand for Starbucks Coffee in the U.S. that we reported on our Q2 call has accelerated in Q3. U.S. company-operated stores delivered record average weekly sales, 5 of the top 10 grossing sales day in our history and a $410 million sales week. In North America, overall, the combination of customer shift towards premium cold beverages, increased customization, strategic decisions on our part with regard to beverage and food and modifier pricing and a 19% increase in food sales, driving net revenues up 13%. In addition, our North American licensed stores business, now 7,000 stores strong and growing, also posted strong results with 24% revenue growth in the quarter. While we are sensitive to the impact inflation and economic uncertainty are having on consumers, it's critically important that you all understand we are not currently seeing any measurable reduction in customer spending or any evidence of customers trading down, reflecting the strength of the Starbucks brand, deep customer engagement and loyalty, pricing power and the premium nature of our beverage and food offerings. What's driving some of the increase in traffic and the strength in our business is our Rewards program. Active Starbucks Rewards membership in Q3 totaled 27.4 million members, up 3.2 million or 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Our loyal Starbucks Rewards members drove a record 53% of U.S. company-operated revenue, Mobile Order & Pay, drive-through delivery also remained quite strong, driving 72% of our U.S. revenue. Increased Starbucks Rewards membership, customer excitement over our beverage and food offerings, plus a fantastic holiday lineup that I'm certain will delight our customers gives us tremendous confidence heading into holiday and 2023. My first order of business upon returning to Starbucks in April was to meet with Starbucks retail store and roasting plant partners across the United States in order to better understand the state of our business and the challenges confronting our partners and the Company. It soon became clear that record demand in our stores was masking significant underlying issues, including, as we shared in our last call, store designs that were ill suited to the evolving customer behavior and traffic patterns we are seeing post COVID. Our stores, in many ways, are windows on America, and our partners everywhere shared similar anxieties over a wide range of issues, affecting their families and their lives around safety, around mental, physical and financial health issues over the widening cultural and racial divide in the state of our country and the world. Many questions whether the American Dream and economic mobility was still realistic aspirations. Our partners also shared how hard it had become to keep up with customer demand and how insufficient training had left new partners unprepared for their roles, challenging partner and customer experiences alike. The conversations were raw and in many ways, painful for our leaders to hear. But core to Starbucks culture is the requirement that we always speak with each other with honesty, transparency and without judgment or fear of appraisal. The truth is, at times, I was overwhelmed by what I heard. The challenges, the fears, the desire for emotional and financial security and the sense of belonging in our partner's lives amid an all uncertainty world. At the same time, I found myself feeling so proud, so appreciative and oftentimes in awe of our partners across the country who showed up every day committed to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers and communities despite the personal challenges and obstacles they were experiencing. We were in a moment where Starbucks leaders needed to put themselves in the shoes of our partners and demonstrate great empathy and compassion towards them. And we needed to address our partners concerns with urgency. What began as informal partner meeting soon evolved into focused co-creation sessions where Starbucks partners and leaders collaborated on how best to re-imagine the next Starbucks. We've since held over 100 co-creation sessions. And from these sessions, our reinvention plan has taken shape. Today, over 30 cross-functional teams are focused exclusively on executing the U.S. reinvention plan you will see take shape over the quarters ahead. And in time, you will see best practices shared around the world. We assembled our 200 top U.S. executives in Seattle last month to kick off Starbucks reinvention and change agenda. In a few minutes, Frank Britt, a key architect of the plan, will provide you with an overview so you can begin to understand how accretive each pillar of the plan will be to our business and brand long into the future. The strong revenue growth we delivered in North America in Q3 is being replicated globally. With the exception of China where the Zero COVID policy continues to result in mobility restrictions and limited store operations, each one of our international regions grew revenues by double digits in Q3. It's an extraordinary accomplishment, reflecting both the strength of the Starbucks brand and strong and accelerating demand for Starbucks coffee all over the world. Our international performance also underscores the correctness of our strategies of investing ahead of the curve in beverage, digital and technology innovation that is relevant to our customers in driving new store growth in every market in which we operate. Overall, our international segment, excluding China, grew revenue 33% year-over-year or 50% excluding FX, while meaningfully expanding operating margin, reflecting the strong operating leverage inherent in our complementary portfolio of company-operated and licensed stores. Last month, several Starbucks leaders joined me on a multi-country tour across several strategic theaters of our EMEA business. In every country we visited, we were inspired by what we heard, felt and observed, product quality, service execution and knowledge of coffee across EMEA are all delivered at the highest levels. Our EMEA teams are executing well, we think together a powerful emotional connection and sense of belonging among our partners and customers with the Starbucks Experience being the shared medium of exchange. And our EMEA partners are literally thriving, inspired and earnestly engaged in bringing our unique culture of respect, purpose, service and an authentic and aspirational love of coffee to life. Interestingly, while thousands of stores in many countries drove strong financial performance during the quarter, I want to showcase one market in particular that serves as a proxy for the strength of the Starbucks brand and demonstrates the enormity of the international opportunity ahead. Italy. Italy, a market we only recently entered and a market that is close to my heart and that no one ever expected us to succeed in. Starbucks is flourishing in Italy. The quality of the coffee, the food and the partner and customer experiences are second to none. Traffic in our Milano Roastery, Starbucks' shrine to coffee, is strong throughout the day, driven largely by tourist activity. But most importantly, traffic in our Italy retail stores is largely local customer driven. And when I was there, what I observed is Italians drinking straight espresso at Starbucks. We are being warmly welcomed in Italy, the country in which our Starbucks journey literally began. Given the success we are enjoying in Milan, we are now planning to open in Rome and in Florence. As home to our EMEA roasting operations, Amsterdam is a strategic foothold for our international efforts. In July, we committed to a planned expansion that will materially increase our roasting capacity in order to meet the rapidly growing demand for Starbucks Coffee across the region. Similar efforts are underway to support a supply chain team that currently handles logistics to over 4,000 stores across 42 countries in EMEA. In Switzerland, we held highly productive sessions with our partners at Nestle. Global Coffee is among Nestle's largest strategic growth categories and our partnership with Nestle now extends across 81 markets focusing on at-home coffee and food service channels. Building on our number one share position in the United States at home, retail and CPG coffee channels, we are in the very early stages of leveraging the Starbucks brand and Nestle's global coffee platforms and significant distribution capabilities to create new super premium coffee occasions on the espresso platform all around the world. Our partnership with Nestle is driving meaningful competitive advantages for both companies in the marketplace and is highly accretive to our business. Looking ahead, we expect to see a closer Starbucks Nestle partnership. This includes introduction of Starbucks varietals onto Nespresso's digital sales platform, a channel that does not presently exist for us and represents a massive global opportunity. Expansion of Starbucks-Nestle partnership to include inclusion of many traditional Starbucks varietals on the Nespresso digital platform, co-creation of Starbucks Reserve arrivals for the virtual platform and the development of an espresso experience in our U.S. Roasteries. We're also looking forward to the launch of our ready-to-drink Starbucks coffees in Southeast Asia, Oceania and Latin America, which will begin rolling out in next quarter. In China, mobility restrictions and limits on in-store dining continue to significantly impact the business. However, as Belinda will soon share, we are beginning to see green shoots of recovery with sales and comps coming out of the quarter, reflecting sequential improvement. Lastly, we have been working on a very exciting new digital initiative that builds on our existing industry-leading digital platform in innovative new ways, all centered around coffee and most importantly, loyalty that we will reveal at Investor Day. We believe this new digital Web three-enabled initiative will allow us to build on the current Starbucks Rewards engagement model with its powerful spend-to-earn Stars approach while also introducing new methods of emotionally engaging customers, expanding our digital third place community and offering a broader set of rewards, including one-of-a-kind experiences that you can't get anywhere else. Integrating our digital Starbucks Rewards ecosystem with Starbucks branded digital collectibles as both a reward and a community building element, this will create an entirely new set of digital network effects that will attract new customers and be accretive to existing customers in our core retail stores. As I mentioned at the outset, we are looking forward to fully showcasing the power and the opportunity of our reinvention plan that we will unleash at next month's Investor Day. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank Britt.\nFrank Britt: Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I've had the good fortune of joining our company during one of its most exciting times, a time of reinvention. We have come together as a Starbucks community and architected a comprehensive plan to future-proof and profitably grow the Company. Our path forward is being informed by tens of thousands of daily customer experiences, and our partner stories, ideas and dreams that have all helped shape over the past several months through on-hand collaboration sessions, digital surveys, live open forums and in direct dialogue with our key leaders. This process is indicative of a new and wide-ranging approach to democratizing innovation at Starbucks. Our reinvention efforts will begin with our core U.S. company-owned retail business, and over time, we'll expand across our global footprint. Specifically, we have prioritized five major strategic shifts to pivot the U.S. business in a new direction. Today, we will provide the guideposts and address what of the overall program, while the how of this agenda will be reviewed on Investor Day in September. To that end, first, powered by ongoing partner co-creation, we work to further connect the Company to truly operate as one global enterprise enabled by new ways of working and a range of contemporary practices and tools. To start, for the U.S. company-owned retail business, we will focus on better integrating our culture and values across the three cohorts of our retail partners, operations partners and support center partners. Our end game is a greater focus as a single company with agility and empowered organization, and we see this work as the fabric that will help bind our change management agenda and will be meaningfully catalytic to our long-term operating and financial performance. Secondly, we are fully embracing the need to radically improve our in-store partner experience. We know that our partners are vital to bringing an elevated Starbucks brand to our customers every day, and we seek to honor, empower and affirm their strategic importance. The first principles of our new partner engagement approach include both greater safety and kindness in our stores, personalized career pathway that drives advancement and opportunity, and an explicit and personal emphasis on improving overall partner well-being. To that end, as we shared in our last earnings call, we have several high-impact improvement efforts in flight, including this week's wage acceleration for all U.S. in-store partners, doubling in-store partner training investments, reintroduction of our iconic Black Apron and Coffee Masters credential and the implementation of a new digital partner engagement platform. We also expect to roll out both the universal tipping and a new recognition and badging platform by calendar year-end 2022. Each of these substantial actions are part of a multiphase path to reinventing the retail partner experience that we expect will have a direct positive effect on partner retention, customer connection and essential brand affinity metrics. Third, we must reimagine our stores. This starts with the core engine of production that must be better calibrated for the customer habits of today and deliver superior experiences through personalization across every format and in every channel. Innovations such as new bar configurations, patented coffee technology, novel store prototypes are high priorities in the plan designed to improve throughput and heavily customized beverages, along with both customer and partner experience. Our high-priority improvement efforts include key equipment acceleration to drive more efficient and effective operations such as Clover Vertica, an expansive renovation and new store agenda. Four, we will further evolve how we reconnect with customers, mindful that each individual consumer must be provided a uniquely personal experience that is unified across channels. Building on our strong track record of superior customer engagement, representative initiatives in this sphere included a reimagined approach for customer-facing products and platforms, new models of effortless digital ordering and further growing the value proposition of our loyalty programs through novel and new strategic partnerships. Fifth, we will redesign what partnership means at Starbucks, creating new ways to continue to evolve us from a listening company to a co-creation company. This translates into new approaches to shared innovation, shared accountability and shared success. This is both a competitive and a generational necessity and for us, it's actually quite natural. Starbucks is built through the power of our partners' ideas and voices, and we know that reinvention must first unleash and then harness the power within every one of our partners. Finally, it's important to be declarative that within our highly integrated change agenda, coffee innovation is far more than an initiative or a project. Instead, the role of coffee will be threaded throughout each of our priorities and serve as our inspiration, foundation and fiercest differentiator in defining the future of Starbucks. In summary, we firmly believe that when you combine the five strategic reinvention areas, bolstered by a rich tapestry of aligned initiatives and the reaffirmation of the importance of coffee, you will begin to see the emergence of a Starbucks that once again drives outsized performance financially, outsized impact socially, and creates a work environment where all of our partners feel greater personal agency and are providing a personalized career path that matches their unique needs and aspirations. In the end, our goal is to become a wholly new kind of company that again sets a new higher standard for our industry and our business overall. We look forward to sharing more details on our Investor Day in September. And now I'll turn the call over to Belinda.\nBelinda Wong: Thank you, Frank. In Q3, China faced its most severe COVID disruption since the onset of the pandemic. Mobility restrictions and lockdowns were implemented faster and eased more slowly under China's Zero COVID policy. Shanghai, our largest market with more than 940 stores, was completely locked down for approximately 2/3 of the quarter. In Beijing, 150 stores or roughly 1/3 of our stores in the market were closed for almost six weeks, with the balance of our Beijing stores operating without indoor dining. We entered Q3 with over 1,300 stores close to 1/4 of our total portfolio temporarily closed. We exited the quarter with roughly 2,000 stores across nearly 50 cities operating with mandated reductions in seating capacity or other COVID restrictions. Similar patents remain today with COVID restrictions being eased in some cities and new restrictions imposed in others. We continue to expect our recovery in China to be nonlinear. In Q3, we continued to deepen our partnerships with suppliers, landlords and local authorities, streamline and adapt our supply chain, add new chapters to our COVID playbook and position the business for accelerated profitable growth as soon as COVID restrictions are fully lifted. Together, these efforts have provided us the flexibility and muscle we need to continue to operate as efficiently as possible given current market challenges. As a result, we were able to move quickly to reopen 90% of our Shanghai stores just within a few days of the 50 reopening. We continue to put our partners first, ensuring their safety and well-being and compensating them fully even when our stores were closed. In turn, our partners continue to deliver exceptional experiences for our customers as reflected in the record high customer connection scores we achieved in Q3. COVID is forcing Starbucks to become more flexible, resilient and agile in China and get even better at operating and executing at scale. The benefit of our investments in our people and our operations will become increasingly evident in post-COVID quarters and years ahead. COVID-related headwinds in Q3 resulted in Starbucks net revenue in China declining 40% and sales comp declining 44% versus last year. But I'm pleased to report that we saw immediate improvement in traffic and sales following Shanghai's reopening in early June, saw steady sequential improvement in both metrics through the month and exited the quarter with a negative comp of 24% after indoor dining restrictions in Shanghai were partially lifted at the end of June. The improvement was fueled by customers returning to our stores and celebrating the reconnection and familiarity with the Starbucks brand. We're seeing a strong positive correlation between comp improvement and the easing of COVID restrictions, giving us confidence that we'll see both a strong rebound in sales and improved flow-through once mobility restrictions in China are fully lifted. We continued our store expansion in Q3, opening up 107 net new stores and entering three new cities despite the headwinds and now operate 5,761 stores across 228 cities, and we remain on back to have 6,000 stores in China by the end of this year. Our new stores continue to achieve best-in-class returns and profitability. The investments we're making to elevate our customers' digital experience and strengthen their digital connection Starbucks are paying off. Mobile ordering sales mix increased to a record high 47% in Q3, up 13% over prior year and up 4% over Q2 as we adapted to COVID-driven changes in customer behavior. We also continue to invest in product innovation and extending Starbucks coffee leadership and authority in China. As Howard mentioned, Iced Shaken Espresso introduced only in June has already become one of our best-selling iced coffee beverages among our Gen Z customers, driving both sales and incremental traffic. Our Q3 performance demonstrates the resilience of the Starbucks brand and business in China and that we're continuing our relentless focus on the long term even as we navigate short-term disruptions, positioning us to resume accelerated and long-term sustainable growth in China as soon as COVID restrictions are fully lifted. I want to sincerely thank all of our partners in China for their dedication, commitment and deep loyalty and for taking care of our communities, our customers and each other during this unprecedented time. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rachel. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Belinda, and good afternoon, everyone. As Howard mentioned at the top of the call, we delivered record-breaking revenue performance during the quarter, driven by continued strong customer demand globally despite a greater-than-expected impact from mobility restrictions in China. We also exceeded our earnings expectations demonstrating our ability to effectively deliver results while executing on planned investments and navigating a dynamic environment. In Q3, we delivered record quarterly global revenue of $8.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year, or 11% when excluding the 2% impact of foreign currency translation. Our strong growth was driven by double-digit revenue growth in the U.S. as well as nearly all major markets and channels across our global portfolio, partially offset by a 40% decline in China revenue. Q3 consolidated operating margin contracted 350 basis points from the prior year to 16.9%, primarily driven by ongoing inflationary headwinds, significant investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and deleverage related to COVID lockdowns in China. These were partially offset by pricing in North America and leverage outside of China. Q3 EPS was $0.84, declining 15% from the prior year but ahead of expectations. I will now provide segment highlights for Q3. North America delivered revenue of $6.1 billion in Q3, up 13% from the prior year and also an all-time record, primarily driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales, including an 8% increase in average ticket as well as net new store growth over the past 12 months. Compelling growth in our U.S. licensed store business also contributed to the segment's strong revenue performance. Our U.S. business posted 9% comparable store sales growth, driven by ticket, a remarkable feat considering we were lapping a record-breaking quarter from last year. Our average ticket reached an all-time high yet again with the year-over-year increase driven by strategic pricing actions and food attached. Strong food attached is a direct result of continued innovation which resonates with our customers. New items, including our lime frosted coconut bar and staples such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich, both performed well. Our creative innovation approach has led to successful beverage and food pairings, fueling food attach and driving day part growth. While transactions remained below pre-pandemic levels, average weekly sales and unique customer counts reached record levels in the quarter, demonstrating that the Starbucks brand is reaching more customers than ever, and customers are highly engaged when they frequent our stores. As both Howard and Frank discussed, we are singularly focused on executing the reinvention plan. Although measurable benefits of the reinvention plan investments will begin to manifest in FY '23, we are encouraged by the investments made so far this year, as we've already experienced increased labor availability and stability, more predictable operating hours as well as higher partner engagement scores in the U.S. Our tenured partner turnover, those with one to two years of tenure, has also improved, evidence that our targeted investments to address wage compression are making a difference. We know based on data across our more than 9,000 U.S. company-operated stores that stores with lower turnover and higher partner engagement tend to have better operational and financial metrics relative to their peer set often leading to better overall customer connection stores. We believe our intentional and targeted investments, which are part of the reinvention plan, will meaningfully elevate the Starbucks experience for partners, stores and customers. North America's operating margin was 22.2% in Q3, contracting 250 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to ongoing inflationary headwinds, labor investments including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training support costs, partially offset by pricing. While we begin executing investments under the reinvention plan, we were also focused on taking disciplined actions to offset margin pressures. Such measures include targeted pricing actions, store throughput initiatives and prioritization of discretionary spend, enabling the segment to fund critical investments while delivering Q3 performance as planned. Moving on to international. The segment delivered third quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, down 6% from the prior year or up 3% when excluding a 9% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. We saw strong sales growth across every major market in the segment outside of China and increased our net new store count by 8% over the last 12 months. The growth was partially offset by an 18% decline in comparable store sales, reflecting the severe impacts of COVID lockdowns across China, as Belinda noted. Outside of China, the tremendous growth of our international markets across our global portfolio continued into Q3, growing at 50% and more than offsetting the revenue challenges we experienced in China when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Virtually all of our key markets and regions posted double-digit revenue growth, including our licensed markets. Most of these markets revenues have reached or exceeded pre-COVID levels and have set new record highs in recent quarters, driven by strong innovation and expanded digital capabilities. Strong momentum, combined with the sizable opportunity afforded by new store formats, gives us great confidence in the long runway of growth ahead for our international markets. Operating margin for the International segment was 12.4% in Q3, down 950 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by the leverage related to COVID impacts in China, sustained inflationary headwinds, lapping higher prior year government subsidies as well as partner investments, partially offset by strong sales leverage across markets outside of China. Looking ahead, however, the International segment may face near-term challenges. Given the prolonged lockdowns in China with limited mobility recovery in Q3, the headwinds now extend into Q4 as the market continues to recover. The current pace of recovery implies that China's operating income contribution as a percent of global operating income may be reduced further than what we had previously anticipated to roughly 1/4 of the contribution realized in a typical fiscal year. Outside of China, the increase in COVID cases around the world may temper the rapid growth we are currently seeing in many markets. Moving on to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 16% to $480 million in Q3, driven by growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our ready-to-drink businesses. Channel development continues to play an essential role in amplifying and diversifying the Starbucks presence around the world and creating new occasions. Starbucks remains the market leader in both the total U.S. at-home coffee and ready-to-drink categories. As Howard mentioned, our partnership with Nestle continues to strengthen, and we're pleased with the competitive advantage it has created and excited about the heightened performance the strategic partnership will unleash. Newer platforms continue to be significant drivers of growth for the Global Coffee Alliance, including Starbucks By Nespresso and Starbucks Creamers. Within our ready-to-drink lineups, we continue to be pleased with our recent product innovations like our new chilled cup offerings in our international markets with robust innovations in the pipeline, fueling continued long-term growth. The segment's operating margin was 40% in Q3, down 670 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by a decline in joint venture income related to our U.S. ready-to-drink business, primarily due to inflation as well as business mix shift. Now moving on to the balance of fiscal year '22. While our guidance remains suspended for the balance of this fiscal year, we wanted to provide some insights regarding Q4. We now expect our Q4 margin and EPS to be lower than Q3 with greater year-over-year pressures primarily due to three reasons: First, the start of mobility recovery in China was later than expected, impacting the pace of recovery previously assumed in Q4. Second, our Q3 performance benefited from approximately $0.05 of nonrecurring benefits, including release of a custom duties accrual, tax credits, government subsidies and other items which we do not expect to continue in Q4. And third, as previously announced, Q4 will be impacted by a sequential step-up in our investments as well as our typical seasonality. Between executing on the reinvention plan and other investments such as increases in wage benefits announced earlier this year, we expect our U.S. investments to more than double from Q3 to Q4. Although these factors will impact our Q4 results, they're expected to be transitory in nature, and our commitment to accelerating long-term growth remains intact. From a shareholder return perspective, although we announced the suspension of share repurchases for the balance of fiscal year '22, we have nearly returned $6 billion between share repurchases and dividends during the first three quarters of fiscal '22. Additionally, we remain committed to sustaining an attractive dividend and continue to target an earnings payout ratio of approximately 50%, which is near the top end of growth companies of our size and scale. Our commitment reflects our confidence in the strength of the business and to returning compelling cash distributions to shareholders while retaining balance sheet flexibility and funding our investments. In closing, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. Our Q3 performance underscored continued strength in customer demand for Starbucks Coffee across the globe, balanced with our ability to execute investments despite macroeconomic and operational headwinds. Our commitment to deliver shareholder value has not wavered, and we are making the right decisions and investments today for the future of Starbucks, balancing the value we create for all stakeholders. Our acceleration of long-term growth is rooted in our ability to execute against our reinvention plan, and we're looking forward to sharing details and providing a comprehensive update on our business outlook for FY '23 and beyond at our Investor Day in September. As always, the real trend for our success belongs to all of our Green Apron partners around the world who strive to deliver the best Starbucks experience possible each and every day. They have our greatest respect and appreciation as we reinvent the next phase of Starbucks together. With that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate all the color and the update. Just one question, two parts. The first just relates to the new CEO. Just wondering your thoughts in terms of whether that leader will have the ability to perhaps blaze a different path than that laid out at the Investor Day. It would just seem like there's some risk in terms of that hiring with the perhaps reinvention plan already laid out. So any color you could provide on the CEO search would be great? And then just as a follow-up, is there any color you can share in terms of the tweaks you're thinking about the long-term top or bottom line algorithm? I know you previously alluded to some maybe acceleration of unit growth, but anything you can share in terms of early insights into the long-term algorithm changes would be great.\nHoward Schultz: I'll take the first question, which I think is an easier one. There is absolutely no risk whatsoever to the reinvention modernization plan that we've outlined in terms of CEO succession. And let me try and explain what I mean by that. We've got a, in my view, an extraordinary slate of candidates who are very interested in the job. We've narrowed it down to a select few. The biggest piece of this puzzle, in addition to experience, domain understanding of the market and a global person, is an understanding of the culture, values and guiding principles of the Company, someone who really has a conscience in terms of the humanity in Starbucks. And all the candidates that we are talking to, we are paralleling the reinvention and modernization plan, so there's no misunderstanding. And I can tell you that the candidates are extremely excited and positive and in agreement with what we're doing in terms of investing ahead of the growth curve, reinventing the partner customer and store experience and the equity and power of the brand is apparent. No one on this call should think whatsoever that there's any risk in terms of this plan not being executed. And lastly, I've committed myself to stay as long as necessary to ensure the fact that the new CEO has a soft landing in the Company, that we have a long immersion process, and then I transition on the Board so I can mentor and help the next CEO. I'm encouraged by the quality of the candidates. And certainly the candidates who are we are looking at a world view of the economy, geopolitical issues and understanding the power of the Starbucks brand and most importantly, the humanity of the Company.\nRachel Ruggeri: And Jeffrey, I'll take the second part of your question. As it relates to FY '23, as you know, we've suspended guidance for the remainder of this fiscal year, and we look forward to sharing more about our long-term growth algorithm with you at Investor Day. That will share perspective on FY '23 as well as a longer-term time period. So, we'll be looking forward to updating you then regarding what we're expecting for FY '23 and beyond.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: I know there's a lot of conversation about the U.S. business that's seeing record customer demand, but the overall number still suggests that same-store traffic is still down somewhere in the double digits, excuse me, versus 2019. So I just wanted to kind of drill down a little bit in terms of what some capacity or efficiency enhancements at the store level might mean. So firstly, is there a plan? Or do you have a thought of kind of returning that core morning day part business, the ritual business, kind of the real habit-driven business that was long such an important part of everyone's life in the U.S.? Is it just a return to normal from a customer side? Or do you have some specific initiatives to maybe bring that customer back is kind of the first part of the question. And the second part of the question, as it relates to adding capacity in the afternoon, which I think is where your growth has been the best, we've seen a shift to food, we've seen a shift to cold. How much capacity can be added to that afternoon business through things like better training hours, procedural changes versus what might be more complicated and time-consuming around equipment and actual physical store design that, in this current environment, whether equipment or permitting, what have you, just might take more time?\nJohn Culver: John, this is John Culver. Just real quick. We're very bullish on our business right now just in terms of the overall growth prospects and the number of customers that are walking in our doors each and every day. Now clearly, the composition of customer visits have shifted versus what we saw in pre-pandemic. And so, new routines are being established. And we're seeing that particularly in the suburban areas as well as the convenience channels of drive-through, MOP and delivery. Those channels accounted for 72% of our revenues. Generally speaking, we see single transactions in those channels with a much higher ticket, which has translated into higher ticket for the quarter. So that's one big piece of it. The second piece as related to day parts, we are seeing morning continuing to grow in the quarter, represented 51% of our sales which is beginning to return to normal. That will be driven by the urban core opening up -- back up. We did see for the fifth consecutive quarter, positive comp growth in the urban core and on the edges of that. And we're optimistic that those morning routines are going to start coming back, which will drive higher transactions and probably a little bit lower ticket at that time because those are single transactions at that point in time. We continue to see strong beverage growth overall, 9% in the quarter. Cold, obviously, was the biggest contributor, 74% of our beverage sales was cold. But when you look at it across all categories, espresso, brewed coffee, refreshers, all those were strong double digit in the quarter. And then equally is the optimism that we have with the ability to customize and modify beverages. If you look at modifiers that are contributing to the growth of the business, those grew over $60 million in the quarter and contributed significantly to the attach rate. In addition, we're seeing a higher attach on food. Food drove 19% growth in the quarter and clearly across all day parts of food, whether that'd be morning, afternoon or early evening, we saw strong growth, double-digit growth across all those food categories. So we feel good about the numbers of customers coming in. And then just a couple more data points I would add to this is, first off, our average weekly sales are at an all-time high. And when you look at our average weekly sales, we were 30% up versus pre-pandemic levels, okay? So that's one data point. The second data point as it relates to unique customer visits, and this gets to more customers coming in our stores. Our unique customer visits were up 6% versus last year and up 9% versus last quarter. And clearly, the Mobile Order & Pay digital footprint continues to grow, again, 27 million members, up 19%. So, we feel good about the path that we're on. As customers begin to normalize routines, we feel transactions will come up. We'll continue to invest in the areas of engaging our customers and meeting them where they're at. So, we feel good about the traction that we have thus far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nAndy Barish: Just wondering if there's any way to kind of quantify what this current wage increase, the wage inflation that you have managed and put in response to some of the partner issue, but also more so kind of where does this go next? Is it really more of a benefits issue? And do you think this kind of -- this latest increase sort of gets you place from all front?\nRachel Ruggeri: Andy, I can start with part of that question, and I'll probably turn it over to Frank to give a little bit more color. But what I can say is of the wage investments that we've taken in of our broader investments overall, as you know, it's an incremental $1 billion this year, largely related to wage. But in addition to that, more training hours, more labor hours to be able to support some of our production. What that does when you think about it is from a revenue standpoint on a consolidated basis, in Q3, that was about 2% of our overall consolidated revenue. It will be about 4% next quarter. So that gives you a perspective. I think when we think about what's coming to FY '23, certainly, we'll share more about that at Investor Day. But I think this really sets the stage for us to be able to do exactly the foundational parts of our reinvention plan, which are really trying to address the better experience for our partners through increasing the experience of our stores, providing better training, overall benefits leading to an overall engagement increase for our partners. In addition to that, we're also spending to be able to ensure that we're elevating the experience for our customers. The combination of that we see as a great foundation to where we head in the future. But I'll turn it over to Frank for a little bit more color.\nFrank Britt: Yes. I think that one of the thesis we have is the reinvention is that in the same way that we distinguish ourselves over the years to personalize the experience for the customer, we feel like the same principles can be applied to our Green Aprons. And so, the work that we're doing is to lay the foundation to complement wage increases -- to complement wage increases to meet a variety of other needs that folks have based on either where they are in their lives and or where they are in their careers. And so what you should expect from us in the months and quarters ahead is a greater opportunity to personalize the experience for Green Aprons to meet them where they are. And that could include a whole variety of things from new services, new types of flexibility, new types of credentialing models, new types of training notions and just moving us away from a one-size-fits-all approach to meet people where they are in their lives, the same way we've done it so well with our customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nLauren Silberman: Howard, you mentioned no measurable reduction in customer spending or trade down. Can you help us the performance of Rewards customers versus non-Rewards customers? And any differences in behavior between the cohorts? And then related, I believe Starbucks Rewards was launched back in 2008. Can you remind us of the reasons you launched the program at that time? And as it evolved over the last 15 years, how do you think it will play a role should we see a more challenging consumer environment?\nHoward Schultz: Sure. I think Rachel will begin the answer.\nRachel Ruggeri: I can start with in terms of the difference between our Rewards customers and our non-Rewards customers is what we saw is, as John spoke about, our customer counts reached an all-time high this quarter, and that was both in SR and non-SR. Our SR rewards customers increased greater relative to our non-Rewards, but both groups increased. And what we saw is our SR members had a higher member spend, all-time high. So we saw an all-time high in terms of member spend for our rewards customers. And that's driven by a combination of things, more strategic pricing, more premium beverages, more personalization as well as greater attach. So that's really what drove that. So we're seeing an increasing engagement from our Rewards customers. And we think that has a benefit for us over the longer term, particularly as we continue to personalize the experience more uniquely so that we can have a deeper relationship and engagement with the customer which will allow us to have the ability to continue to provide value in ways that are more personalized to them individually as a customer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Great. And thanks for the comments so far, including on the customer response to pricing. I wanted to ask about transactions. I could have imagined a few quarters ago that transactions would be recovering on a three-year basis versus pre-COVID levels, but transactions seem to have stalled out in the last few quarters, actually decelerated a bit versus 2019. I'm wondering why do you think that is? And what factors do you think are driving somewhat more stubborn recovery when it comes to transactions?\nRachel Ruggeri: David, this is Rachel. I can take that question. What we'd say is absolutely, we see lower transactions relative to pre-pandemic levels, so FY '19. But we're actually seeing our transactions improve versus prior year. So, we are ahead versus prior year, while still below from an FY '19 level. And what we're seeing is really a change. We believe it's a change in consumer behavior where we're seeing a higher ticket in a more moderate transaction. And I think what plays into that is, some of the dynamics of where people work today versus going into the office each and every day, there's a shift in consumer behaviors. We've also created newer formats and more points of stores so that customers can meet us where they need us to be. And we think that's also helped with the dynamic shaping a different dynamic in terms of a revenue perspective. Transactions are always an opportunity. But the way we look at it is having more customers and seeing that those -- that more and more customers are engaging with our brands and they're spending more with each visit, turns out to be a different formula for us, but an equally important formula, we're just seeing growth in a different way.\nHoward Schultz: I would add one other thing that hasn't come up yet, and that is the relevancy that Starbucks has with young people, and I think I mentioned this in the last call that one of the metrics for me personally has always been trying to understand on an annual basis, is our customer getting older or younger. And we don't want to be in a business where our customer base is aging, and we have a less relevant situation with younger people. We have never been, in our history, more relevant than we are today to Gen Z. And to me, that cohort is so powerful and the attachment rate that we have with them and the loyalty is just building. And so the other thing I'd say is that of course, you're going to look back to 2019, I understand that, but the world has changed so dramatically. Pattern recognition among customers is so different. And if you didn't have the historical perspective, that I understand that you do, and you just isolated Starbucks business today without historical numbers. You have to say, wow, what an extraordinary franchise, look at the equity of the brand on a global basis. Look what we're able to do in multiple formats, multiple countries, multiple channels of distribution. And I think for me, there's no doubt that the morning day part is going to come roaring back. And it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when. And you couple our afternoon business now on cold with a morning business in terms of people coming back to work, the acceleration of the business and the operating leverage that we always have had is just going to be that apparent. And I think the work that we're doing on the partner side, what we haven't said is there is a direct correlation with the investments we're making with our people and retention. And the greatest return that we can have on our investments is lowering attrition and retaining our people. And that is what you'll see in the quarters ahead.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Saleh: I want to come back to the reinvention plan. I think the third pillar was reimagining the stores. I was hoping, Howard, you could provide a little bit more context or color on this? Are we -- are we talking about more store closures? Is this remodels? What exactly do you feel is the issue? Is it throughput? I'm just trying to understand the level of investment you might need in 2023.\nHoward Schultz: We don't anticipate store closures will be material in any way. We're going to share with you with great specificity what we're going to -- how we're going to reinvent the store model, both in terms of the customer journey and the equipment that is going to significantly give us capacity that we don't have and make our people -- make our partners job much easier. You will see all that and more September 13.\nRachel Ruggeri: And if I could just add, we've already been spending, Peter. Some of the investment we're doing this year of the $1 billion, some of it's pointed at some of the reimagining of the stores. Specifically, it's pointed at ensuring that we have better uptime in our stores so that the equipment is working and the partners are able to serve the customers and the demand. In addition to that, we've rolled out new and more innovative equipment to help with overall efficiency and the complexity in our stores. So we've started that journey, and we'll continue that. But I think that's an important aspect of -- it's not always just about a new store. It's actually about helping to also improve the efficiency of the engine today, and we can do some of that with operational standards as well as equipment and innovation, and we've started that process.\nHoward Schultz: Let me introduce you to Deb, who -- is our runs technology at Starbucks. And I think just to give her an opportunity to share with you what her and team are working on with regard to reinvention.\nBelinda Wong: Yes. Thanks, Howard, and it's a pleasure to be here in joining Starbucks. So as we think about the reinvention plan, looking forward to sharing more on September 13, but to add on to what Rachel was just saying, there is a real opportunity to continue to invest today and tomorrow in modernizing our stores. Job number one is making sure our partners have smooth operating stores, and we know technology is at the core of that. And then as we move forward and what we'll be sharing more on the 13th is as we look to modernize technology and really be the engine behind the reinvention plan here, we believe that the critical competitive advantage that we're going to be bringing is speed at scale through really repositioning our core technology foundations to be even more agile and more cost efficient. And I look forward to sharing more of that.\nHoward Schultz: John, do you want to...\nJohn Culver: Thank you. Just going to the investments that we're making in the immediate term, particularly on equipment to drive throughput and productivity. And John, this goes back to your second part of your question, I apologize for not addressing it then. But first and foremost, it's about the Mastrena two and getting Mastrena machines out. Currently, we're in 86% of our stores, and we'll complete the rollout by the end of this fiscal year. We have warming oven upgrades going on to our current ovens. We have 60% of those deployed, and we'll have 75% deployed by the end of the fiscal year. We've developed an in-house proprietary cold brew system, and that's currently been deployed to all stores across the U.S. And also, we continue to see the growth of cold beverage. So improvements in the cold beverage station and in particular, cold beverage labelers which are dedicated to that station. We currently have those in 38% of our stores that will go to 80% by the end of the fiscal year. We also see opportunity with handheld order points. So if you think about it, handheld tablets, currently, that's in 50% of our stores will continue to deploy that and anticipated in 65% by the end of the year. That will drive speed of service and in particular, higher throughput and drive-thru. And then equally on the back of the house is the automated ordering. And we are seeing huge opportunity for automated ordering as we are fully deployed across all food and merchandise, across all stores in the U.S. and we are quickly moving towards getting that up and running as it relates to the beverage and the remaining products in our stores. So, we've got a lot of work that's happening around that, and it will make our business operate a lot more efficiently.\nHoward Schultz: Before the other question, I just feel bad. International is not to cover off the ball, and no one's asked Michael Conway a question. So Mike, I got to give you some air time.\nMichael Conway: Thanks, Howard. I appreciate it. So I am excited about the results we had. As you shared, we were up 50% ex China and international. Just to give a little more texture because the strength was across all the regions. So Latin America, again, strong comp growth, well over 50%. EMEA, driven by the U.K., comps grew well into the double digits again. Asia Pacific, also very strong strength, double-digit revenue growth. And within Asia, we had Korea at 1,700 stores this quarter. We had Indonesia which reached 500 stores, and that's actually the 10th market globally to do so. So a lot of growth and a lot of investments still going on. And in Japan, our third largest market globally, the comps accelerated to their strongest point this year. And what's behind it? I would say of three things. First, we partner very closely with our business partners to invest in those key growth levers, like expanding the digital capabilities, so Starbucks Rewards and Mobile Order & Pay. We've also enabled new channels like delivery, which is proven to be like in the U.S. quite incremental for transactions. Secondly, our license partners are investing in stores. So they are seeing the resilience of the brand and the investing in stores, particularly stores like drive-thru where we're seeing outsized growth. And then finally, travel is slowly starting to return, specifically within the regions, but also we're starting to see across regions, and that gives us a real outlook that as travel continues, there's more growth ahead in these regions. So we're excited about the growth we're seeing in international, for sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nSharon Zackfia: I wanted to follow up on a comment you made earlier about retention and the unlock you can get there as tenured increases for the baristas in the U.S. Can you talk about what average tenure is now versus maybe where it was in 2019? And maybe similarly, I know you mentioned in China, I think customer connectivity scores are at an all-time high. Where is that now in the U.S.? And how are you measuring throughput in the U.S. versus kind of more normalized pre-pandemic?\nJohn Culver: Yes, Sharon, this is John. I'll take that on retention. Obviously, we continue to make investments in our people, both from a wage as well as from a training standpoint. We are seeing some green shoots in improving retention overall, and we're optimistic that, that will carry into the coming quarter as well as, as we go into FY '23. Just to give you a few data points, we hired a record number of partners this fiscal year thus far. And what we've been able to do as we've hired partners is we've been able to reduce the number of open positions, and thus, in turn, increase the number of operating hours that our stores are open. This has been enabled. We streamlined the hiring process and put this in place in record time for our individual markets. And what we've seen is that after turnover peaked in Q2 of this year, we are seeing the early signs of these investments paying off. Our average pay right now stands at roughly $17 an hour. That's inclusive of our floor being at $15 an hour, which goes into effect broadly across the country, effective August 1. That significantly demonstrates this $1 billion wage investment that we are making this fiscal year in our people. And then we also increased barista training, basically doubling the hours for new hire baristas to 40 hours as well as our new supervisors. And as we look at this area of the business, labor, staffing, retention, all those things. The metrics we're tracking is turnover, hours of operation, fully staffed stores and obviously, operating with Mobile Order & Pay open full time. Rachel alluded to the fact that stores with lower turnover drive higher partner engagement and deliver better operating and financial metrics, which thus leads to higher customer experience stores. And we are seeing a trend uptick in customer experience -- customer experience scores. So we feel we're on the right path. We have more work to do, but we are making progress.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Charles: Howard, notwithstanding the strong U.S. same-store sales you posted this quarter and your comments about not seeing any trade down or reduce customer spend, but with investor concern around a macro slowdown, can you talk about if Starbucks were to see deterioration in U.S. traffic over the next 12 months or so, what efforts to your disposal would you lean in to remind customers that Starbucks is an affordable luxury? And if I can sneak one more in for Belinda. Looking beyond the 6,000-store target for China at 2022 end, is the prolonged state of China mobility restrictions giving you any pause on medium-term development plans? I know you guys talked about peak ROIC prior to the restrictions, but I'm just curious for your updated thoughts.\nHoward Schultz: Well, let's try to unpack the question about Starbucks as an affordable luxury and possibility of a significant slowdown economically in the country. Historically, 51 years in business, we have been able to navigate and manage through very difficult economic headwinds. And although we've raised prices roughly about 5% or so over the last 12 months, the fact that our customers continue to see Starbucks not only as a great product and a great experience but all the things that ladder up to the equity of the brand and the quality of the coffee. So listen, I think every day that goes by, what's on my mind is the significant challenge economically that people are going through, and we're not taking our success and current engagement with our customers in any way as an entitlement. We have to earn it every day. And I think when we had our 200 top people here from the field just 1.5 weeks ago, we all talked about the need every single day to exceed the expectations of every single customer to understand what it means to take it personal as we did in 2008 during the cataclysmic financial crisis, and we managed through that one. And I think the other thing is, we've never had as many -- if you look at the national footprint of Starbucks, the multiple footprints in terms of the different types of formats that Starbucks has provides us with an ability to create convenience that we've never had before, specifically in the drive-thru. And so if you take that and then you ladder up the Starbucks Rewards program, and that probably is where we would go to provide discounts and value and a value proposition on an ongoing basis with our existing Rewards customers if, in fact, there was a significant downturn in the economy. But I think when we talk to our peer group as we have about what they're experiencing, I think they're shocked, stunned that Starbucks continues to create the kind of velocity without any indication whatsoever of customers turning away from Starbucks or most specifically trading down. And why we highlighted cold beverages so much was two reasons. One is that, that is a Gen Z product. And as I said earlier, that is a key customer cohort for Starbucks. Secondarily, we have a significant competitive advantage in our ability to customize almost any beverage that our customers want with speed. And then the last piece of that is the competitive advantage that we have is that the modifiers that our customers are adding to cold is a greater number than they add to hot. The modifiers are raising the ticket and the modifiers produce color and excitement to the Gen Z audience and they immediately put it on social media. But we're in the early stages of the cold beverage platform in terms of what we're going to bring in terms of innovation and the modifiers and the customization gives us a significant competitive advantage. You layer all of that on what I said earlier, and that is the morning day part coming back with velocity. And I think all bets are off in terms of the operating leverage that we're going to get in here.\nRachel Ruggeri: I'll answer the second part of the question. Thank you. Despite the COVID headwinds, we remain on track to operate 6,000 stores by the end of this year. We added 107 net new stores in Q3 with our new stores continuing to deliver great returns and profitability. The fact that we could still open more than one store per day in Q3 speak volume to our team's capabilities, our resilience and a strong operating muscle we have built. We remain highly confident in the resilience and dynamism of the Chinese consumer economy. China's coffee market is still in its very early stages, and we have a long runway for growth ahead. Store development will continue to fuel the growth for Starbucks China and we'll continue to expand our retail footprint in a strategic and disciplined way. We're going to continue to go wide, enter into more new cities. We're going to continue to go deep in filling with more innovative formats to deliver the perfect and most relevant Starbucks experience for our customers, and we're going to continue to go smart by data-powered decisions, optimizing size, formats, locations, investment, et cetera. So thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Sarah Senatore with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSarah Senatore: Just a quick clarification and then a question. The clarification is just on the comment about accelerating growth. I think it was interpreted as meaning faster unit growth versus perhaps productivity gains or volume in the stores. And I just wanted to clarify if that was the right interpretation. But the core question is actually on China. I know clearly, the lion's share of what's happening is driven by the restrictions. But Belinda, could you maybe just talk about anything you can say about market share gains? I know you mentioned connection scores have never been higher. Is that typically correlated with comps or share gains? Just something to help us contextualize Starbucks positioning ex all these exogenous factors?\nHoward Schultz: Rachel will take the first question on our enthusiasm for growth and then Belinda will end it.\nRachel Ruggeri: Yes. Sarah, when we talk about accelerated growth, we're specifically talking about our metrics related to revenue, margin and earnings. And that's really going to be fueled as it has in the past by growth in unit growth. So our new stores, growth in innovation as well as growth in our digital customer relationships. So that's how I think about what we're talking about accelerated growth. Unit growth is a part of it. It's one of the catalysts, but there are many other factors as we talk about accelerating our growth.\nHoward Schultz: Belinda?\nBelinda Wong: In China, I mean, in Q3, we had a pretty difficult quarter because of COVID. But as I've shared before, we still achieved record high connection scores. And we're -- all the investments that we have put in into our partners and our operations will become increasingly evident and will benefit us in the future. I am super confident of our potential in China. And once all the COVID restrictions are lifted, we're going to accelerate our growth once again. Thank you.\nHoward Schultz: So I think in terms of our Investor Day, I really hope that the majority of you will make the trip to Seattle. There's still good weather at that point. It shouldn't rain. But I think those of you who do not come will miss out on really seeing and understanding the breadth of the level of innovation and modernization that we're going to bring to the Company and how quickly it's going to come. So I hope that you all come. It will be a good time, a lot of interest that we've had already, but please try and make it to Seattle. Thank you so much, and we'll see you September 13. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks' Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Frank. In Q3, China faced its most severe COVID disruption since the onset of the pandemic. Mobility restrictions and lockdowns were implemented faster and eased more slowly under China's Zero COVID policy. Shanghai, our largest market with more than 940 stores, was completely locked down for approximately 2/3 of the quarter. In Beijing, 150 stores or roughly 1/3 of our stores in the market were closed for almost six weeks, with the balance of our Beijing stores operating without indoor dining. We entered Q3 with over 1,300 stores close to 1/4 of our total portfolio temporarily closed. We exited the quarter with roughly 2,000 stores across nearly 50 cities operating with mandated reductions in seating capacity or other COVID restrictions. Similar patents remain today with COVID restrictions being eased in some cities and new restrictions imposed in others. We continue to expect our recovery in China to be nonlinear. In Q3, we continued to deepen our partnerships with suppliers, landlords and local authorities, streamline and adapt our supply chain, add new chapters to our COVID playbook and position the business for accelerated profitable growth as soon as COVID restrictions are fully lifted. Together, these efforts have provided us the flexibility and muscle we need to continue to operate as efficiently as possible given current market challenges. As a result, we were able to move quickly to reopen 90% of our Shanghai stores just within a few days of the 50 reopening. We continue to put our partners first, ensuring their safety and well-being and compensating them fully even when our stores were closed. In turn, our partners continue to deliver exceptional experiences for our customers as reflected in the record high customer connection scores we achieved in Q3. COVID is forcing Starbucks to become more flexible, resilient and agile in China and get even better at operating and executing at scale. The benefit of our investments in our people and our operations will become increasingly evident in post-COVID quarters and years ahead. COVID-related headwinds in Q3 resulted in Starbucks net revenue in China declining 40% and sales comp declining 44% versus last year. But I'm pleased to report that we saw immediate improvement in traffic and sales following Shanghai's reopening in early June, saw steady sequential improvement in both metrics through the month and exited the quarter with a negative comp of 24% after indoor dining restrictions in Shanghai were partially lifted at the end of June. The improvement was fueled by customers returning to our stores and celebrating the reconnection and familiarity with the Starbucks brand. We're seeing a strong positive correlation between comp improvement and the easing of COVID restrictions, giving us confidence that we'll see both a strong rebound in sales and improved flow-through once mobility restrictions in China are fully lifted. We continued our store expansion in Q3, opening up 107 net new stores and entering three new cities despite the headwinds and now operate 5,761 stores across 228 cities, and we remain on back to have 6,000 stores in China by the end of this year. Our new stores continue to achieve best-in-class returns and profitability. The investments we're making to elevate our customers' digital experience and strengthen their digital connection Starbucks are paying off. Mobile ordering sales mix increased to a record high 47% in Q3, up 13% over prior year and up 4% over Q2 as we adapted to COVID-driven changes in customer behavior. We also continue to invest in product innovation and extending Starbucks coffee leadership and authority in China. As Howard mentioned, Iced Shaken Espresso introduced only in June has already become one of our best-selling iced coffee beverages among our Gen Z customers, driving both sales and incremental traffic. Our Q3 performance demonstrates the resilience of the Starbucks brand and business in China and that we're continuing our relentless focus on the long term even as we navigate short-term disruptions, positioning us to resume accelerated and long-term sustainable growth in China as soon as COVID restrictions are fully lifted. I want to sincerely thank all of our partners in China for their dedication, commitment and deep loyalty and for taking care of our communities, our customers and each other during this unprecedented time. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rachel. Rachel? Yes. Thanks, Howard, and it's a pleasure to be here in joining Starbucks. So as we think about the reinvention plan, looking forward to sharing more on September 13, but to add on to what Rachel was just saying, there is a real opportunity to continue to invest today and tomorrow in modernizing our stores. Job number one is making sure our partners have smooth operating stores, and we know technology is at the core of that.

            "name": "Frank Britt",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I've had the good fortune of joining our company during one of its most exciting times, a time of reinvention. We have come together as a Starbucks community and architected a comprehensive plan to future-proof and profitably grow the Company. Our path forward is being informed by tens of thousands of daily customer experiences, and our partner stories, ideas and dreams that have all helped shape over the past several months through on-hand collaboration sessions, digital surveys, live open forums and in direct dialogue with our key leaders. This process is indicative of a new and wide-ranging approach to democratizing innovation at Starbucks. Our reinvention efforts will begin with our core U.S. company-owned retail business, and over time, we'll expand across our global footprint. Specifically, we have prioritized five major strategic shifts to pivot the U.S. business in a new direction. Today, we will provide the guideposts and address what of the overall program, while the how of this agenda will be reviewed on Investor Day in September. To that end, first, powered by ongoing partner co-creation, we work to further connect the Company to truly operate as one global enterprise enabled by new ways of working and a range of contemporary practices and tools. To start, for the U.S. company-owned retail business, we will focus on better integrating our culture and values across the three cohorts of our retail partners, operations partners and support center partners. Our end game is a greater focus as a single company with agility and empowered organization, and we see this work as the fabric that will help bind our change management agenda and will be meaningfully catalytic to our long-term operating and financial performance. Secondly, we are fully embracing the need to radically improve our in-store partner experience. We know that our partners are vital to bringing an elevated Starbucks brand to our customers every day, and we seek to honor, empower and affirm their strategic importance. The first principles of our new partner engagement approach include both greater safety and kindness in our stores, personalized career pathway that drives advancement and opportunity, and an explicit and personal emphasis on improving overall partner well-being. To that end, as we shared in our last earnings call, we have several high-impact improvement efforts in flight, including this week's wage acceleration for all U.S. in-store partners, doubling in-store partner training investments, reintroduction of our iconic Black Apron and Coffee Masters credential and the implementation of a new digital partner engagement platform. We also expect to roll out both the universal tipping and a new recognition and badging platform by calendar year-end 2022. Each of these substantial actions are part of a multiphase path to reinventing the retail partner experience that we expect will have a direct positive effect on partner retention, customer connection and essential brand affinity metrics. Third, we must reimagine our stores. This starts with the core engine of production that must be better calibrated for the customer habits of today and deliver superior experiences through personalization across every format and in every channel. Innovations such as new bar configurations, patented coffee technology, novel store prototypes are high priorities in the plan designed to improve throughput and heavily customized beverages, along with both customer and partner experience. Our high-priority improvement efforts include key equipment acceleration to drive more efficient and effective operations such as Clover Vertica, an expansive renovation and new store agenda. Four, we will further evolve how we reconnect with customers, mindful that each individual consumer must be provided a uniquely personal experience that is unified across channels. Building on our strong track record of superior customer engagement, representative initiatives in this sphere included a reimagined approach for customer-facing products and platforms, new models of effortless digital ordering and further growing the value proposition of our loyalty programs through novel and new strategic partnerships. Fifth, we will redesign what partnership means at Starbucks, creating new ways to continue to evolve us from a listening company to a co-creation company. This translates into new approaches to shared innovation, shared accountability and shared success. This is both a competitive and a generational necessity and for us, it's actually quite natural. Starbucks is built through the power of our partners' ideas and voices, and we know that reinvention must first unleash and then harness the power within every one of our partners. Finally, it's important to be declarative that within our highly integrated change agenda, coffee innovation is far more than an initiative or a project. Instead, the role of coffee will be threaded throughout each of our priorities and serve as our inspiration, foundation and fiercest differentiator in defining the future of Starbucks. In summary, we firmly believe that when you combine the five strategic reinvention areas, bolstered by a rich tapestry of aligned initiatives and the reaffirmation of the importance of coffee, you will begin to see the emergence of a Starbucks that once again drives outsized performance financially, outsized impact socially, and creates a work environment where all of our partners feel greater personal agency and are providing a personalized career path that matches their unique needs and aspirations. In the end, our goal is to become a wholly new kind of company that again sets a new higher standard for our industry and our business overall. We look forward to sharing more details on our Investor Day in September. And now I'll turn the call over to Belinda. Yes. I think that one of the thesis we have is the reinvention is that in the same way that we distinguish ourselves over the years to personalize the experience for the customer, we feel like the same principles can be applied to our Green Aprons. And so, the work that we're doing is to lay the foundation to complement wage increases -- to complement wage increases to meet a variety of other needs that folks have based on either where they are in their lives and or where they are in their careers. And so what you should expect from us in the months and quarters ahead is a greater opportunity to personalize the experience for Green Aprons to meet them where they are. And that could include a whole variety of things from new services, new types of flexibility, new types of credentialing models, new types of training notions and just moving us away from a one-size-fits-all approach to meet people where they are in their lives, the same way we've done it so well with our customers."

            "name": "Howard Schultz",
            "content": "Thank you, Tiffany. Good afternoon, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Starbucks' strong Q3 results highlighted by 9% global revenue growth to a record $8.2 billion, 3% global comp growth and 9% comp growth in North America once again demonstrates the power and resilience of the Starbucks business and brand all over the world. I've now been back as CEO for four months. During that time, I've immersed myself in every segment, region, operation and aspect of our business. And given my long history with the Company and our culture and my unique understanding and appreciation of the Starbucks brand, the drivers of our global business and the special relationship that exists among our people, our brand and our customers, we've been able to pinpoint the source of each of the issues and challenges confronting the Company upon my return. Some are definitely COVID related, some were a function of not focusing on the long term, and unfortunately, many were self-induced. More important, we now have clear line of sight on what we need to do to totally reinvent the Company and drive accelerated profitable growth around the world. The Q3 results we announced today demonstrate the early progress we have made in just four short months and served as a proof point of the significant long-term global growth opportunity ahead for Starbucks. Each business segment contributed to our Q3 performance. I'm particularly pleased that we delivered our results in the face of stiff ongoing consumer economic and inflationary headwinds. COVID lockdowns across China that kept Shanghai, our largest China market, largely closed for two months, and that continues episodically today, and continuing shifts in customer traffic and behaviors including materially reduced office occupancy in our largest urban markets. Our Q3 performance underscores the success of the investments we are making in our people, extending our global leadership around everything coffee and in groundbreaking beverage, food, digital and technology innovation that is deepening our connection to customers in every market and every channel. And our performance demonstrates that the Starbucks Experience is more relevant and important than ever in today's unsettled world. On today's call, I will highlight the drivers of our Q3 revenue comp and EPS performance. I will then turn the call over to Frank Britt, our Chief Strategy Officer, to provide an overview of our reinvention plan, the strategy underpinning the investments we are making to materially elevate our partner, customer and store experiences. Next month, at Investor Day in Seattle, you will see for yourselves how accretive to our business our reinvention plan will be, increasing efficiency, enabling us to seamlessly handle the increasing demand in our U.S. stores and most of all, elevating our partner, customer and in-store experiences. Our reinvention plan touches every aspect of the Starbucks Experience and sets us up for accelerated long-term profitable growth and value creation benefiting all stakeholders beginning in 2023. We are executing against the reinvention plan with focus, with discipline and a deep sense of urgency. Next, Belinda will update you on China, where our position in the market and our aspirations for the future have never been greater. Rachel will provide a deep dive into our Q3 financial and operating results, and then we'll move on to Q&A. For to Starbucks' success and long-term growth strategy is our global leadership around everything coffee. No company in the world even remotely approaching Starbucks' ability to source, blend, roast and craft the world's best coffees. And in Q3, we continued to extend our coffee leadership, innovate and bring further elements of customization and premiumization to the entire coffee category, including around cold, handcrafted and plant-based coffee beverages. Customer demand for specifically customized cold coffee beverages, a category Starbucks single-handedly created and is now expanding around the world, is so strong that cold beverages now account for roughly 75% of our total beverage sales in U.S. company-operated stores. Customers are increasingly customizing their cold beverages by adding modifiers that enable the creation of a virtually unlimited range of taste, flavor and color profiles, and then sharing their unique coal beverage creations with the world through social media. Starbucks' unique ability to deliver handcrafted, customized cold beverages that satisfy customer desires and different need states while creating opportunities for customers' self-expression deepens our connection to customers, sets us apart from any other industry participant and provides us with a significant ongoing competitive advantage in the marketplace. Iced Shaken Espresso introduced onto our Iced Espresso platform only last year, is resonating so wildly with our Gen Z customers that it has already become the fastest-growing product category in our U.S. company-operated stores, growing 50% year-over-year, more than doubling year-to-date and importantly creating new customer occasions in the midday and afternoon day parts. Iced Shaken Espresso was also resonating around the world. In China, for example where Iced Shaken Espresso was only introduced in June of this year, it is already among our best-selling iced coffee beverages despite mobility restrictions in China. Just to summarize what's going on with cold and specifically customized beverages. The premium customized cold coffee opportunity ahead for Starbucks all around the world is simply enormous. Let me turn to North America. The very strong demand for Starbucks Coffee in the U.S. that we reported on our Q2 call has accelerated in Q3. U.S. company-operated stores delivered record average weekly sales, 5 of the top 10 grossing sales day in our history and a $410 million sales week. In North America, overall, the combination of customer shift towards premium cold beverages, increased customization, strategic decisions on our part with regard to beverage and food and modifier pricing and a 19% increase in food sales, driving net revenues up 13%. In addition, our North American licensed stores business, now 7,000 stores strong and growing, also posted strong results with 24% revenue growth in the quarter. While we are sensitive to the impact inflation and economic uncertainty are having on consumers, it's critically important that you all understand we are not currently seeing any measurable reduction in customer spending or any evidence of customers trading down, reflecting the strength of the Starbucks brand, deep customer engagement and loyalty, pricing power and the premium nature of our beverage and food offerings. What's driving some of the increase in traffic and the strength in our business is our Rewards program. Active Starbucks Rewards membership in Q3 totaled 27.4 million members, up 3.2 million or 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Our loyal Starbucks Rewards members drove a record 53% of U.S. company-operated revenue, Mobile Order & Pay, drive-through delivery also remained quite strong, driving 72% of our U.S. revenue. Increased Starbucks Rewards membership, customer excitement over our beverage and food offerings, plus a fantastic holiday lineup that I'm certain will delight our customers gives us tremendous confidence heading into holiday and 2023. My first order of business upon returning to Starbucks in April was to meet with Starbucks retail store and roasting plant partners across the United States in order to better understand the state of our business and the challenges confronting our partners and the Company. It soon became clear that record demand in our stores was masking significant underlying issues, including, as we shared in our last call, store designs that were ill suited to the evolving customer behavior and traffic patterns we are seeing post COVID. Our stores, in many ways, are windows on America, and our partners everywhere shared similar anxieties over a wide range of issues, affecting their families and their lives around safety, around mental, physical and financial health issues over the widening cultural and racial divide in the state of our country and the world. Many questions whether the American Dream and economic mobility was still realistic aspirations. Our partners also shared how hard it had become to keep up with customer demand and how insufficient training had left new partners unprepared for their roles, challenging partner and customer experiences alike. The conversations were raw and in many ways, painful for our leaders to hear. But core to Starbucks culture is the requirement that we always speak with each other with honesty, transparency and without judgment or fear of appraisal. The truth is, at times, I was overwhelmed by what I heard. The challenges, the fears, the desire for emotional and financial security and the sense of belonging in our partner's lives amid an all uncertainty world. At the same time, I found myself feeling so proud, so appreciative and oftentimes in awe of our partners across the country who showed up every day committed to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers and communities despite the personal challenges and obstacles they were experiencing. We were in a moment where Starbucks leaders needed to put themselves in the shoes of our partners and demonstrate great empathy and compassion towards them. And we needed to address our partners concerns with urgency. What began as informal partner meeting soon evolved into focused co-creation sessions where Starbucks partners and leaders collaborated on how best to re-imagine the next Starbucks. We've since held over 100 co-creation sessions. And from these sessions, our reinvention plan has taken shape. Today, over 30 cross-functional teams are focused exclusively on executing the U.S. reinvention plan you will see take shape over the quarters ahead. And in time, you will see best practices shared around the world. We assembled our 200 top U.S. executives in Seattle last month to kick off Starbucks reinvention and change agenda. In a few minutes, Frank Britt, a key architect of the plan, will provide you with an overview so you can begin to understand how accretive each pillar of the plan will be to our business and brand long into the future. The strong revenue growth we delivered in North America in Q3 is being replicated globally. With the exception of China where the Zero COVID policy continues to result in mobility restrictions and limited store operations, each one of our international regions grew revenues by double digits in Q3. It's an extraordinary accomplishment, reflecting both the strength of the Starbucks brand and strong and accelerating demand for Starbucks coffee all over the world. Our international performance also underscores the correctness of our strategies of investing ahead of the curve in beverage, digital and technology innovation that is relevant to our customers in driving new store growth in every market in which we operate. Overall, our international segment, excluding China, grew revenue 33% year-over-year or 50% excluding FX, while meaningfully expanding operating margin, reflecting the strong operating leverage inherent in our complementary portfolio of company-operated and licensed stores. Last month, several Starbucks leaders joined me on a multi-country tour across several strategic theaters of our EMEA business. In every country we visited, we were inspired by what we heard, felt and observed, product quality, service execution and knowledge of coffee across EMEA are all delivered at the highest levels. Our EMEA teams are executing well, we think together a powerful emotional connection and sense of belonging among our partners and customers with the Starbucks Experience being the shared medium of exchange. And our EMEA partners are literally thriving, inspired and earnestly engaged in bringing our unique culture of respect, purpose, service and an authentic and aspirational love of coffee to life. Interestingly, while thousands of stores in many countries drove strong financial performance during the quarter, I want to showcase one market in particular that serves as a proxy for the strength of the Starbucks brand and demonstrates the enormity of the international opportunity ahead. Italy. Italy, a market we only recently entered and a market that is close to my heart and that no one ever expected us to succeed in. Starbucks is flourishing in Italy. The quality of the coffee, the food and the partner and customer experiences are second to none. Traffic in our Milano Roastery, Starbucks' shrine to coffee, is strong throughout the day, driven largely by tourist activity. But most importantly, traffic in our Italy retail stores is largely local customer driven. And when I was there, what I observed is Italians drinking straight espresso at Starbucks. We are being warmly welcomed in Italy, the country in which our Starbucks journey literally began. Given the success we are enjoying in Milan, we are now planning to open in Rome and in Florence. As home to our EMEA roasting operations, Amsterdam is a strategic foothold for our international efforts. In July, we committed to a planned expansion that will materially increase our roasting capacity in order to meet the rapidly growing demand for Starbucks Coffee across the region. Similar efforts are underway to support a supply chain team that currently handles logistics to over 4,000 stores across 42 countries in EMEA. In Switzerland, we held highly productive sessions with our partners at Nestle. Global Coffee is among Nestle's largest strategic growth categories and our partnership with Nestle now extends across 81 markets focusing on at-home coffee and food service channels. Building on our number one share position in the United States at home, retail and CPG coffee channels, we are in the very early stages of leveraging the Starbucks brand and Nestle's global coffee platforms and significant distribution capabilities to create new super premium coffee occasions on the espresso platform all around the world. Our partnership with Nestle is driving meaningful competitive advantages for both companies in the marketplace and is highly accretive to our business. Looking ahead, we expect to see a closer Starbucks Nestle partnership. This includes introduction of Starbucks varietals onto Nespresso's digital sales platform, a channel that does not presently exist for us and represents a massive global opportunity. Expansion of Starbucks-Nestle partnership to include inclusion of many traditional Starbucks varietals on the Nespresso digital platform, co-creation of Starbucks Reserve arrivals for the virtual platform and the development of an espresso experience in our U.S. Roasteries. We're also looking forward to the launch of our ready-to-drink Starbucks coffees in Southeast Asia, Oceania and Latin America, which will begin rolling out in next quarter. In China, mobility restrictions and limits on in-store dining continue to significantly impact the business. However, as Belinda will soon share, we are beginning to see green shoots of recovery with sales and comps coming out of the quarter, reflecting sequential improvement. Lastly, we have been working on a very exciting new digital initiative that builds on our existing industry-leading digital platform in innovative new ways, all centered around coffee and most importantly, loyalty that we will reveal at Investor Day. We believe this new digital Web three-enabled initiative will allow us to build on the current Starbucks Rewards engagement model with its powerful spend-to-earn Stars approach while also introducing new methods of emotionally engaging customers, expanding our digital third place community and offering a broader set of rewards, including one-of-a-kind experiences that you can't get anywhere else. Integrating our digital Starbucks Rewards ecosystem with Starbucks branded digital collectibles as both a reward and a community building element, this will create an entirely new set of digital network effects that will attract new customers and be accretive to existing customers in our core retail stores. As I mentioned at the outset, we are looking forward to fully showcasing the power and the opportunity of our reinvention plan that we will unleash at next month's Investor Day. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank Britt. I'll take the first question, which I think is an easier one. There is absolutely no risk whatsoever to the reinvention modernization plan that we've outlined in terms of CEO succession. And let me try and explain what I mean by that. We've got a, in my view, an extraordinary slate of candidates who are very interested in the job. We've narrowed it down to a select few. The biggest piece of this puzzle, in addition to experience, domain understanding of the market and a global person, is an understanding of the culture, values and guiding principles of the Company, someone who really has a conscience in terms of the humanity in Starbucks. And all the candidates that we are talking to, we are paralleling the reinvention and modernization plan, so there's no misunderstanding. And I can tell you that the candidates are extremely excited and positive and in agreement with what we're doing in terms of investing ahead of the growth curve, reinventing the partner customer and store experience and the equity and power of the brand is apparent. No one on this call should think whatsoever that there's any risk in terms of this plan not being executed. And lastly, I've committed myself to stay as long as necessary to ensure the fact that the new CEO has a soft landing in the Company, that we have a long immersion process, and then I transition on the Board so I can mentor and help the next CEO. I'm encouraged by the quality of the candidates. And certainly the candidates who are we are looking at a world view of the economy, geopolitical issues and understanding the power of the Starbucks brand and most importantly, the humanity of the Company. Sure. I think Rachel will begin the answer. I would add one other thing that hasn't come up yet, and that is the relevancy that Starbucks has with young people, and I think I mentioned this in the last call that one of the metrics for me personally has always been trying to understand on an annual basis, is our customer getting older or younger. And we don't want to be in a business where our customer base is aging, and we have a less relevant situation with younger people. We have never been, in our history, more relevant than we are today to Gen Z. And to me, that cohort is so powerful and the attachment rate that we have with them and the loyalty is just building. And so the other thing I'd say is that of course, you're going to look back to 2019, I understand that, but the world has changed so dramatically. Pattern recognition among customers is so different. And if you didn't have the historical perspective, that I understand that you do, and you just isolated Starbucks business today without historical numbers. You have to say, wow, what an extraordinary franchise, look at the equity of the brand on a global basis. Look what we're able to do in multiple formats, multiple countries, multiple channels of distribution. And I think for me, there's no doubt that the morning day part is going to come roaring back. And it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when. And you couple our afternoon business now on cold with a morning business in terms of people coming back to work, the acceleration of the business and the operating leverage that we always have had is just going to be that apparent. And I think the work that we're doing on the partner side, what we haven't said is there is a direct correlation with the investments we're making with our people and retention. And the greatest return that we can have on our investments is lowering attrition and retaining our people. And that is what you'll see in the quarters ahead. We don't anticipate store closures will be material in any way. We're going to share with you with great specificity what we're going to -- how we're going to reinvent the store model, both in terms of the customer journey and the equipment that is going to significantly give us capacity that we don't have and make our people -- make our partners job much easier. You will see all that and more September 13. Let me introduce you to Deb, who -- is our runs technology at Starbucks. And I think just to give her an opportunity to share with you what her and team are working on with regard to reinvention. John, do you want to... Before the other question, I just feel bad. International is not to cover off the ball, and no one's asked Michael Conway a question. So Mike, I got to give you some air time. Well, let's try to unpack the question about Starbucks as an affordable luxury and possibility of a significant slowdown economically in the country. Historically, 51 years in business, we have been able to navigate and manage through very difficult economic headwinds. And although we've raised prices roughly about 5% or so over the last 12 months, the fact that our customers continue to see Starbucks not only as a great product and a great experience but all the things that ladder up to the equity of the brand and the quality of the coffee. So listen, I think every day that goes by, what's on my mind is the significant challenge economically that people are going through, and we're not taking our success and current engagement with our customers in any way as an entitlement. We have to earn it every day. And I think when we had our 200 top people here from the field just 1.5 weeks ago, we all talked about the need every single day to exceed the expectations of every single customer to understand what it means to take it personal as we did in 2008 during the cataclysmic financial crisis, and we managed through that one. And I think the other thing is, we've never had as many -- if you look at the national footprint of Starbucks, the multiple footprints in terms of the different types of formats that Starbucks has provides us with an ability to create convenience that we've never had before, specifically in the drive-thru. And so if you take that and then you ladder up the Starbucks Rewards program, and that probably is where we would go to provide discounts and value and a value proposition on an ongoing basis with our existing Rewards customers if, in fact, there was a significant downturn in the economy. But I think when we talk to our peer group as we have about what they're experiencing, I think they're shocked, stunned that Starbucks continues to create the kind of velocity without any indication whatsoever of customers turning away from Starbucks or most specifically trading down. And why we highlighted cold beverages so much was two reasons. One is that, that is a Gen Z product. And as I said earlier, that is a key customer cohort for Starbucks. Secondarily, we have a significant competitive advantage in our ability to customize almost any beverage that our customers want with speed. And then the last piece of that is the competitive advantage that we have is that the modifiers that our customers are adding to cold is a greater number than they add to hot. The modifiers are raising the ticket and the modifiers produce color and excitement to the Gen Z audience and they immediately put it on social media. But we're in the early stages of the cold beverage platform in terms of what we're going to bring in terms of innovation and the modifiers and the customization gives us a significant competitive advantage. You layer all of that on what I said earlier, and that is the morning day part coming back with velocity. And I think all bets are off in terms of the operating leverage that we're going to get in here. Rachel will take the first question on our enthusiasm for growth and then Belinda will end it. Belinda? So I think in terms of our Investor Day, I really hope that the majority of you will make the trip to Seattle. There's still good weather at that point. It shouldn't rain. But I think those of you who do not come will miss out on really seeing and understanding the breadth of the level of innovation and modernization that we're going to bring to the Company and how quickly it's going to come. So I hope that you all come. It will be a good time, a lot of interest that we've had already, but please try and make it to Seattle. Thank you so much, and we'll see you September 13. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael Conway",
            "content": "Thanks, Howard. I appreciate it. So I am excited about the results we had. As you shared, we were up 50% ex China and international. Just to give a little more texture because the strength was across all the regions. So Latin America, again, strong comp growth, well over 50%. EMEA, driven by the U.K., comps grew well into the double digits again. Asia Pacific, also very strong strength, double-digit revenue growth. And within Asia, we had Korea at 1,700 stores this quarter. We had Indonesia which reached 500 stores, and that's actually the 10th market globally to do so. So a lot of growth and a lot of investments still going on. And in Japan, our third largest market globally, the comps accelerated to their strongest point this year. And what's behind it? I would say of three things. First, we partner very closely with our business partners to invest in those key growth levers, like expanding the digital capabilities, so Starbucks Rewards and Mobile Order & Pay. We've also enabled new channels like delivery, which is proven to be like in the U.S. quite incremental for transactions. Secondly, our license partners are investing in stores. So they are seeing the resilience of the brand and the investing in stores, particularly stores like drive-thru where we're seeing outsized growth. And then finally, travel is slowly starting to return, specifically within the regions, but also we're starting to see across regions, and that gives us a real outlook that as travel continues, there's more growth ahead in these regions. So we're excited about the growth we're seeing in international, for sure."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Belinda, and good afternoon, everyone. As Howard mentioned at the top of the call, we delivered record-breaking revenue performance during the quarter, driven by continued strong customer demand globally despite a greater-than-expected impact from mobility restrictions in China. We also exceeded our earnings expectations demonstrating our ability to effectively deliver results while executing on planned investments and navigating a dynamic environment. In Q3, we delivered record quarterly global revenue of $8.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year, or 11% when excluding the 2% impact of foreign currency translation. Our strong growth was driven by double-digit revenue growth in the U.S. as well as nearly all major markets and channels across our global portfolio, partially offset by a 40% decline in China revenue. Q3 consolidated operating margin contracted 350 basis points from the prior year to 16.9%, primarily driven by ongoing inflationary headwinds, significant investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and deleverage related to COVID lockdowns in China. These were partially offset by pricing in North America and leverage outside of China. Q3 EPS was $0.84, declining 15% from the prior year but ahead of expectations. I will now provide segment highlights for Q3. North America delivered revenue of $6.1 billion in Q3, up 13% from the prior year and also an all-time record, primarily driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales, including an 8% increase in average ticket as well as net new store growth over the past 12 months. Compelling growth in our U.S. licensed store business also contributed to the segment's strong revenue performance. Our U.S. business posted 9% comparable store sales growth, driven by ticket, a remarkable feat considering we were lapping a record-breaking quarter from last year. Our average ticket reached an all-time high yet again with the year-over-year increase driven by strategic pricing actions and food attached. Strong food attached is a direct result of continued innovation which resonates with our customers. New items, including our lime frosted coconut bar and staples such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich, both performed well. Our creative innovation approach has led to successful beverage and food pairings, fueling food attach and driving day part growth. While transactions remained below pre-pandemic levels, average weekly sales and unique customer counts reached record levels in the quarter, demonstrating that the Starbucks brand is reaching more customers than ever, and customers are highly engaged when they frequent our stores. As both Howard and Frank discussed, we are singularly focused on executing the reinvention plan. Although measurable benefits of the reinvention plan investments will begin to manifest in FY '23, we are encouraged by the investments made so far this year, as we've already experienced increased labor availability and stability, more predictable operating hours as well as higher partner engagement scores in the U.S. Our tenured partner turnover, those with one to two years of tenure, has also improved, evidence that our targeted investments to address wage compression are making a difference. We know based on data across our more than 9,000 U.S. company-operated stores that stores with lower turnover and higher partner engagement tend to have better operational and financial metrics relative to their peer set often leading to better overall customer connection stores. We believe our intentional and targeted investments, which are part of the reinvention plan, will meaningfully elevate the Starbucks experience for partners, stores and customers. North America's operating margin was 22.2% in Q3, contracting 250 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to ongoing inflationary headwinds, labor investments including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training support costs, partially offset by pricing. While we begin executing investments under the reinvention plan, we were also focused on taking disciplined actions to offset margin pressures. Such measures include targeted pricing actions, store throughput initiatives and prioritization of discretionary spend, enabling the segment to fund critical investments while delivering Q3 performance as planned. Moving on to international. The segment delivered third quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, down 6% from the prior year or up 3% when excluding a 9% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. We saw strong sales growth across every major market in the segment outside of China and increased our net new store count by 8% over the last 12 months. The growth was partially offset by an 18% decline in comparable store sales, reflecting the severe impacts of COVID lockdowns across China, as Belinda noted. Outside of China, the tremendous growth of our international markets across our global portfolio continued into Q3, growing at 50% and more than offsetting the revenue challenges we experienced in China when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Virtually all of our key markets and regions posted double-digit revenue growth, including our licensed markets. Most of these markets revenues have reached or exceeded pre-COVID levels and have set new record highs in recent quarters, driven by strong innovation and expanded digital capabilities. Strong momentum, combined with the sizable opportunity afforded by new store formats, gives us great confidence in the long runway of growth ahead for our international markets. Operating margin for the International segment was 12.4% in Q3, down 950 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by the leverage related to COVID impacts in China, sustained inflationary headwinds, lapping higher prior year government subsidies as well as partner investments, partially offset by strong sales leverage across markets outside of China. Looking ahead, however, the International segment may face near-term challenges. Given the prolonged lockdowns in China with limited mobility recovery in Q3, the headwinds now extend into Q4 as the market continues to recover. The current pace of recovery implies that China's operating income contribution as a percent of global operating income may be reduced further than what we had previously anticipated to roughly 1/4 of the contribution realized in a typical fiscal year. Outside of China, the increase in COVID cases around the world may temper the rapid growth we are currently seeing in many markets. Moving on to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 16% to $480 million in Q3, driven by growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our ready-to-drink businesses. Channel development continues to play an essential role in amplifying and diversifying the Starbucks presence around the world and creating new occasions. Starbucks remains the market leader in both the total U.S. at-home coffee and ready-to-drink categories. As Howard mentioned, our partnership with Nestle continues to strengthen, and we're pleased with the competitive advantage it has created and excited about the heightened performance the strategic partnership will unleash. Newer platforms continue to be significant drivers of growth for the Global Coffee Alliance, including Starbucks By Nespresso and Starbucks Creamers. Within our ready-to-drink lineups, we continue to be pleased with our recent product innovations like our new chilled cup offerings in our international markets with robust innovations in the pipeline, fueling continued long-term growth. The segment's operating margin was 40% in Q3, down 670 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by a decline in joint venture income related to our U.S. ready-to-drink business, primarily due to inflation as well as business mix shift. Now moving on to the balance of fiscal year '22. While our guidance remains suspended for the balance of this fiscal year, we wanted to provide some insights regarding Q4. We now expect our Q4 margin and EPS to be lower than Q3 with greater year-over-year pressures primarily due to three reasons: First, the start of mobility recovery in China was later than expected, impacting the pace of recovery previously assumed in Q4. Second, our Q3 performance benefited from approximately $0.05 of nonrecurring benefits, including release of a custom duties accrual, tax credits, government subsidies and other items which we do not expect to continue in Q4. And third, as previously announced, Q4 will be impacted by a sequential step-up in our investments as well as our typical seasonality. Between executing on the reinvention plan and other investments such as increases in wage benefits announced earlier this year, we expect our U.S. investments to more than double from Q3 to Q4. Although these factors will impact our Q4 results, they're expected to be transitory in nature, and our commitment to accelerating long-term growth remains intact. From a shareholder return perspective, although we announced the suspension of share repurchases for the balance of fiscal year '22, we have nearly returned $6 billion between share repurchases and dividends during the first three quarters of fiscal '22. Additionally, we remain committed to sustaining an attractive dividend and continue to target an earnings payout ratio of approximately 50%, which is near the top end of growth companies of our size and scale. Our commitment reflects our confidence in the strength of the business and to returning compelling cash distributions to shareholders while retaining balance sheet flexibility and funding our investments. In closing, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. Our Q3 performance underscored continued strength in customer demand for Starbucks Coffee across the globe, balanced with our ability to execute investments despite macroeconomic and operational headwinds. Our commitment to deliver shareholder value has not wavered, and we are making the right decisions and investments today for the future of Starbucks, balancing the value we create for all stakeholders. Our acceleration of long-term growth is rooted in our ability to execute against our reinvention plan, and we're looking forward to sharing details and providing a comprehensive update on our business outlook for FY '23 and beyond at our Investor Day in September. As always, the real trend for our success belongs to all of our Green Apron partners around the world who strive to deliver the best Starbucks experience possible each and every day. They have our greatest respect and appreciation as we reinvent the next phase of Starbucks together. With that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator? And Jeffrey, I'll take the second part of your question. As it relates to FY '23, as you know, we've suspended guidance for the remainder of this fiscal year, and we look forward to sharing more about our long-term growth algorithm with you at Investor Day. That will share perspective on FY '23 as well as a longer-term time period. So, we'll be looking forward to updating you then regarding what we're expecting for FY '23 and beyond. Andy, I can start with part of that question, and I'll probably turn it over to Frank to give a little bit more color. But what I can say is of the wage investments that we've taken in of our broader investments overall, as you know, it's an incremental $1 billion this year, largely related to wage. But in addition to that, more training hours, more labor hours to be able to support some of our production. What that does when you think about it is from a revenue standpoint on a consolidated basis, in Q3, that was about 2% of our overall consolidated revenue. It will be about 4% next quarter. So that gives you a perspective. I think when we think about what's coming to FY '23, certainly, we'll share more about that at Investor Day. But I think this really sets the stage for us to be able to do exactly the foundational parts of our reinvention plan, which are really trying to address the better experience for our partners through increasing the experience of our stores, providing better training, overall benefits leading to an overall engagement increase for our partners. In addition to that, we're also spending to be able to ensure that we're elevating the experience for our customers. The combination of that we see as a great foundation to where we head in the future. But I'll turn it over to Frank for a little bit more color. I can start with in terms of the difference between our Rewards customers and our non-Rewards customers is what we saw is, as John spoke about, our customer counts reached an all-time high this quarter, and that was both in SR and non-SR. Our SR rewards customers increased greater relative to our non-Rewards, but both groups increased. And what we saw is our SR members had a higher member spend, all-time high. So we saw an all-time high in terms of member spend for our rewards customers. And that's driven by a combination of things, more strategic pricing, more premium beverages, more personalization as well as greater attach. So that's really what drove that. So we're seeing an increasing engagement from our Rewards customers. And we think that has a benefit for us over the longer term, particularly as we continue to personalize the experience more uniquely so that we can have a deeper relationship and engagement with the customer which will allow us to have the ability to continue to provide value in ways that are more personalized to them individually as a customer. David, this is Rachel. I can take that question. What we'd say is absolutely, we see lower transactions relative to pre-pandemic levels, so FY '19. But we're actually seeing our transactions improve versus prior year. So, we are ahead versus prior year, while still below from an FY '19 level. And what we're seeing is really a change. We believe it's a change in consumer behavior where we're seeing a higher ticket in a more moderate transaction. And I think what plays into that is, some of the dynamics of where people work today versus going into the office each and every day, there's a shift in consumer behaviors. We've also created newer formats and more points of stores so that customers can meet us where they need us to be. And we think that's also helped with the dynamic shaping a different dynamic in terms of a revenue perspective. Transactions are always an opportunity. But the way we look at it is having more customers and seeing that those -- that more and more customers are engaging with our brands and they're spending more with each visit, turns out to be a different formula for us, but an equally important formula, we're just seeing growth in a different way. And if I could just add, we've already been spending, Peter. Some of the investment we're doing this year of the $1 billion, some of it's pointed at some of the reimagining of the stores. Specifically, it's pointed at ensuring that we have better uptime in our stores so that the equipment is working and the partners are able to serve the customers and the demand. In addition to that, we've rolled out new and more innovative equipment to help with overall efficiency and the complexity in our stores. So we've started that journey, and we'll continue that. But I think that's an important aspect of -- it's not always just about a new store. It's actually about helping to also improve the efficiency of the engine today, and we can do some of that with operational standards as well as equipment and innovation, and we've started that process. I'll answer the second part of the question. Thank you. Despite the COVID headwinds, we remain on track to operate 6,000 stores by the end of this year. We added 107 net new stores in Q3 with our new stores continuing to deliver great returns and profitability. The fact that we could still open more than one store per day in Q3 speak volume to our team's capabilities, our resilience and a strong operating muscle we have built. We remain highly confident in the resilience and dynamism of the Chinese consumer economy. China's coffee market is still in its very early stages, and we have a long runway for growth ahead. Store development will continue to fuel the growth for Starbucks China and we'll continue to expand our retail footprint in a strategic and disciplined way. We're going to continue to go wide, enter into more new cities. We're going to continue to go deep in filling with more innovative formats to deliver the perfect and most relevant Starbucks experience for our customers, and we're going to continue to go smart by data-powered decisions, optimizing size, formats, locations, investment, et cetera. So thank you. Yes. Sarah, when we talk about accelerated growth, we're specifically talking about our metrics related to revenue, margin and earnings. And that's really going to be fueled as it has in the past by growth in unit growth. So our new stores, growth in innovation as well as growth in our digital customer relationships. So that's how I think about what we're talking about accelerated growth. Unit growth is a part of it. It's one of the catalysts, but there are many other factors as we talk about accelerating our growth."

            "name": "John Culver",
            "content": "John, this is John Culver. Just real quick. We're very bullish on our business right now just in terms of the overall growth prospects and the number of customers that are walking in our doors each and every day. Now clearly, the composition of customer visits have shifted versus what we saw in pre-pandemic. And so, new routines are being established. And we're seeing that particularly in the suburban areas as well as the convenience channels of drive-through, MOP and delivery. Those channels accounted for 72% of our revenues. Generally speaking, we see single transactions in those channels with a much higher ticket, which has translated into higher ticket for the quarter. So that's one big piece of it. The second piece as related to day parts, we are seeing morning continuing to grow in the quarter, represented 51% of our sales which is beginning to return to normal. That will be driven by the urban core opening up -- back up. We did see for the fifth consecutive quarter, positive comp growth in the urban core and on the edges of that. And we're optimistic that those morning routines are going to start coming back, which will drive higher transactions and probably a little bit lower ticket at that time because those are single transactions at that point in time. We continue to see strong beverage growth overall, 9% in the quarter. Cold, obviously, was the biggest contributor, 74% of our beverage sales was cold. But when you look at it across all categories, espresso, brewed coffee, refreshers, all those were strong double digit in the quarter. And then equally is the optimism that we have with the ability to customize and modify beverages. If you look at modifiers that are contributing to the growth of the business, those grew over $60 million in the quarter and contributed significantly to the attach rate. In addition, we're seeing a higher attach on food. Food drove 19% growth in the quarter and clearly across all day parts of food, whether that'd be morning, afternoon or early evening, we saw strong growth, double-digit growth across all those food categories. So we feel good about the numbers of customers coming in. And then just a couple more data points I would add to this is, first off, our average weekly sales are at an all-time high. And when you look at our average weekly sales, we were 30% up versus pre-pandemic levels, okay? So that's one data point. The second data point as it relates to unique customer visits, and this gets to more customers coming in our stores. Our unique customer visits were up 6% versus last year and up 9% versus last quarter. And clearly, the Mobile Order & Pay digital footprint continues to grow, again, 27 million members, up 19%. So, we feel good about the path that we're on. As customers begin to normalize routines, we feel transactions will come up. We'll continue to invest in the areas of engaging our customers and meeting them where they're at. So, we feel good about the traction that we have thus far. Thank you. Just going to the investments that we're making in the immediate term, particularly on equipment to drive throughput and productivity. And John, this goes back to your second part of your question, I apologize for not addressing it then. But first and foremost, it's about the Mastrena two and getting Mastrena machines out. Currently, we're in 86% of our stores, and we'll complete the rollout by the end of this fiscal year. We have warming oven upgrades going on to our current ovens. We have 60% of those deployed, and we'll have 75% deployed by the end of the fiscal year. We've developed an in-house proprietary cold brew system, and that's currently been deployed to all stores across the U.S. And also, we continue to see the growth of cold beverage. So improvements in the cold beverage station and in particular, cold beverage labelers which are dedicated to that station. We currently have those in 38% of our stores that will go to 80% by the end of the fiscal year. We also see opportunity with handheld order points. So if you think about it, handheld tablets, currently, that's in 50% of our stores will continue to deploy that and anticipated in 65% by the end of the year. That will drive speed of service and in particular, higher throughput and drive-thru. And then equally on the back of the house is the automated ordering. And we are seeing huge opportunity for automated ordering as we are fully deployed across all food and merchandise, across all stores in the U.S. and we are quickly moving towards getting that up and running as it relates to the beverage and the remaining products in our stores. So, we've got a lot of work that's happening around that, and it will make our business operate a lot more efficiently. Yes, Sharon, this is John. I'll take that on retention. Obviously, we continue to make investments in our people, both from a wage as well as from a training standpoint. We are seeing some green shoots in improving retention overall, and we're optimistic that, that will carry into the coming quarter as well as, as we go into FY '23. Just to give you a few data points, we hired a record number of partners this fiscal year thus far. And what we've been able to do as we've hired partners is we've been able to reduce the number of open positions, and thus, in turn, increase the number of operating hours that our stores are open. This has been enabled. We streamlined the hiring process and put this in place in record time for our individual markets. And what we've seen is that after turnover peaked in Q2 of this year, we are seeing the early signs of these investments paying off. Our average pay right now stands at roughly $17 an hour. That's inclusive of our floor being at $15 an hour, which goes into effect broadly across the country, effective August 1. That significantly demonstrates this $1 billion wage investment that we are making this fiscal year in our people. And then we also increased barista training, basically doubling the hours for new hire baristas to 40 hours as well as our new supervisors. And as we look at this area of the business, labor, staffing, retention, all those things. The metrics we're tracking is turnover, hours of operation, fully staffed stores and obviously, operating with Mobile Order & Pay open full time. Rachel alluded to the fact that stores with lower turnover drive higher partner engagement and deliver better operating and financial metrics, which thus leads to higher customer experience stores. And we are seeing a trend uptick in customer experience -- customer experience scores. So we feel we're on the right path. We have more work to do, but we are making progress."

And with that, allow me to turn the call over to Howard.\nHoward Schultz: Thank you, Tiffany. Love and responsibility brought me back to Starbucks, my love of the company and my deep responsibility to our partners and shareholders. In the month I've been back, I've traveled the country and met with thousands of Starbucks retail store partners and visited all 5 of our roasting plants, and I've learned first-hand about the unique challenges confronting the company today. I've also experienced the passionate relationship our partners have with the company and the enduring emotional connection our customers have to the Starbucks brand. COVID presented unprecedented operating challenges to consumer brands. COVID also drove dramatic changes in customer behavior that Starbucks stores and systems were not designed or built for. The challenges have been amplified by record demand for Starbucks coffee in our U.S. stores that has accelerated with the lifting of COVID restrictions. Our Q2 results tell the story. In Q2, our sales comp in North America grew 12% over last year, 23% compared to Q2 2020. Both drive-thru and Mobile Order & Pay activity have surged, together now generating over 70% of our U.S. store volume. Delivery, a nearly $500 million business, is up 30% in the first half of fiscal year. And in our stores, customers are increasingly further customizing already complex handcrafted cold beverages. The combination of shifts and customer patterns, accelerating demand and algorithms built for different customer behaviors has placed tremendous strain on our U.S. store partners. Ordinarily, we would have anticipated and invested ahead of the shifts we're seeing, but COVID disruptions interfered with our ability to make the required investments in store design, operations, infrastructure and technology to do so. As a result, we've been unable to meet the relentless demand we're seeing in our U.S. stores as seamlessly as our customers and partners expect and candidly deserve. Simply said, we do not, today, have the adequate capacity to meet the growing demand for Starbucks coffees. Going forward, we will be making investments in our partners and business to literally catch up on investments we have not made and make further investments to position the company ahead of the coming growth curve. We will also be accelerating our new store growth with 90% of new stores being high-returning drive-thru. Our newest class of drive-thrus will integrate new store designs, technology, including more handheld devices and equipment improvements that will increase efficiency, speed of service, and we believe deliver even greater profitability in the future. We will then incorporate the new technologies and equipment into our existing stores and provide our people with the tools and resources they need to elevate the Starbucks experience we deliver to our customers and create even more demand in the future. And we'll be making significant investments to extend our digital capabilities and deepen our digital connection to customers and the emotional attachment our customers have to the Starbucks brand. Returns on our digital investments are consistently among the highest returns we generate, which brings us to the decision we will revisit in fiscal '23 to suspend stock buybacks. Buying back stock yields us, on average, about a 10% return. With Starbucks' treasure trove of global assets, a 10% return is not satisfactory to me. Throughout our history, the investments we have made in our people and business have always delivered outsized returns to our shareholders. We're so eager to show off our pipeline of disruptive innovation that we're moving our Investor Day up to September in Seattle from December in New York. The significant innovation around technology and personalization we will reveal our industry game-changers that will further increase store productivity and efficiency. What you will see is the coming transformation and reimagination of the Starbucks customer and partner experiences. The transformation will accelerate already record demand in our stores, but the investments will enable us to handle the increased demand and deliver increased profitability, while also delivering an elevated experience to our customers, and most importantly, reducing strain on our partners. We must reintroduce joy in the customer and emotional connection back into the partner experience. We've identified over $200 million of investment that's incremental to the significant investments we've already committed to in our U.S. company-operated stores this year. These include further investments in training, wage and equipment and new investments in internal communication with our people, where we will launch a new partner app to communicate directly with all store partners. We will also be reaffirming our commitment to coffee excellence and partner education by reintroducing our black apron, Coffee Master and origin trip programs. And in 2023, we will introduce enhanced digital tipping for our partners. We believe these investments will improve retention and recruiting and elevate the experience we deliver to our partners and our customers. Over the last month, we've realigned Starbucks U.S. organization to focus entirely on transforming and reimagining our core U.S. business. Belinda Wong will share plans for accelerated growth in China as soon as COVID-related mobility restrictions there are lifted. And make no mistake, our aspirations around China have never been greater and I remain convinced Starbucks' business in China will be eventually larger than our business in the U.S. We have a big breakthrough idea around the launch of Starbucks Web 3.0 and a unique platform for NFTs that Brady Brewer and Adam Brotman, architect of Mobile Order & Pay and the Starbucks digital app, who is serving as a special adviser to us, will shortly tell you about. I believe Web 3.0 will create an authentic digital third place experience and drive substantial new revenue streams for Starbucks and be accretive to the brand. Our Web 3.0 strategy is a proxy for the greater ambition we have for the company going forward. Despite the fact that post COVID, our customers are not using our stores the same way, and we've been operationally challenged as a result, our national retail footprint and best-in-class real estate portfolio is still enabling us to meet customers wherever they are and irrespective of their need state. This relentless demand we're seeing in our stores today underscores this reality. Looking ahead, trying to imagine thousands of vastly more productive and efficient Starbucks stores reconfigured to align with today's customer behavior and built around technology that will deliver increased speed of service, improved labor management and reduced unit cost, an elevated partner and customer experience. Now imagine the accretive impact to our financials when we reengineer our stores to deliver what we're capable of in delivering and arm our people with the tools and resources they need to once again exceed our customers' expectations. From my perspective, I understand what's needed, and I'm back to lead this transformation and committed to seeing it through. Starbucks sits alone with something few, if any, of our peers literally have, and that is unmet demand. Companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing, promotions and social media trying to create demand. We have demand everywhere we look, despite having not lived up to the expectations we set for ourselves, let alone exceeding the expectations of our customers and our people since the pandemic. The big opportunity ahead for us is to meet strong and growing demand in our stores more efficiently and effectively and to leverage technology to enhance productivity and reduce burden on our store partners. Let me highlight just a few sources of the accelerating demand we're seeing in our U.S. stores and business. Mobile Order & Pay, an over $4 billion business, is up 400% in 5 years, is up 20% over last year. Our $500 million delivery business is up 30% over last year. The Starbucks Card puts our brand in the hands of nearly 120 million people and is alone larger than the entire gift card category. Starbucks customers are increasingly prepaying for their purchases in huge volumes, roughly $11 billion last year, and we are on track to exceed that figure this year. At this moment, well over $1 billion is loaded on Starbucks Cards waiting to be spent in our stores. And active Starbucks Rewards membership in the U.S. grew 17% over last year to Q2 to 27 million members. Strong underlying demand means the productivity and efficiency investments I've described represent literally low-hanging fruit available to us right now. And ever since, Starbucks remains a growth company today and will remain a growth company into the future. Two related dynamics underscore the power of the equity of the Starbucks brand and support our growth aspirations: consistent pricing power and strong demand for Starbucks products in CPG channels. Over the last year, we raised prices several times to address increasing inflationary pressures. Yet, we experienced negligible customer attrition, once again demonstrating the elasticity of demand for Starbucks coffee. Even so, inflationary pressures have outpaced our price increases, resulting in several points of margin compression in the short term and costing us over 200 basis points in the first half of the fiscal year. In Q2, we were able to absorb the incremental cost while still delivering on our EPS expectations. In our channels business, Starbucks today has the #1 share in the U.S. at at-home coffee and the #1 share in global ready-to-drink coffee. Customer loyalty inside and outside our stores has never been greater. You have to ask yourself how many retail companies have a consumer brand that is best of class and literally the #1 position in grocery and in multiple channels of distribution? You'd be hard-pressed to find any. I could not be more optimistic or confident in the successful transformation and reimagination of our store partner and customer experiences. Let me turn to China. I cannot think of any other Western consumer brand, let alone a food and beverage retailer, that has performed as well as us in China over the last 20 years. I say that with great pride having been to China so often, building confidence, trust and respect for relationships with government officials and working closely with our Chinese team. However, the situation in China is unprecedented. Shanghai, a city 4x the size of New York City, is completely locked down. Other major cities, including Beijing, are experiencing new COVID outbreaks and implementing new mobility restrictions pursuant to China's strict zero-COVID policy. Conditions in China are such that we have virtually no ability to predict our performance in China in the back half of the year. Given the materiality and the high level of ongoing uncertainty around China, accelerating inflation and the significant investments we are planning, the only responsible course of action for us to take is to suspend guidance for Q3 and Q4. As we move through Q3 and approach September's Investor Day, we will have much greater visibility on Q4, holiday and fiscal '23, and be in a position to share details around our comprehensive post-COVID China plan with you. I'm very pleased with the growth we're seeing from our international business. Excluding China, our International segment grew comps in the double digits in the quarter, stronger than anticipated, demonstrating the strength of our diversified portfolio and the opportunity ahead. Even including the impact of China, our International segment still grew 4% in the quarter over last year to a record $1.7 billion. Our international store base grew 9% over last year to over 17,700 stores. 15% of that growth was in licensed markets. We expect 75% of the net new stores we will open in fiscal '22 to be outside the U.S., further underscoring the enormous global and the opportunity ahead. Now let me turn to a subject in the news. Across America, there is a movement in the media and across multiple industries, including the service sector, whereby fellow citizens have begun turning to labor unions as a means of gaining voice, representation and improved working conditions. This movement is not related to any specific company. We are highly emphatic to the root causes of the frustration and anxieties that Gen Z Americans are facing, having come of age during turbulent moments in our history: the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, The Great Recession and now The Global Coronavirus Pandemic. These young people have completely valid concerns given today's uncertainty and economic instability. They look around and they see the burgeoning labor movement as a possible remedy to what they are feeling. I understand the climate, and I'm deeply sensitive to the needs of all of our green apron partners. Yet, we have a very different and vastly more positive vision for our company based on listening, connecting and collaborating directly with our people. Throughout our history at Starbucks, we have led our industry, and in many cases, corporate America, in introducing breakthrough benefits for our people. Aon Hewitt, the gold standard in benefits, rate Starbucks in the 100th percentile in the retail sector, the 100th percentile, including from part-time workers who want stability and flexibility to achieve their future aspirations. That means no retail company in America ranks above Starbucks for the benefits we provide our people. We are proud of our history and leadership in wages and benefits, and we are committed to doing even more to meet the evolving needs of our Starbucks partners in the future. Sharing success through wins and benefits with our partners is among our core values, and has been for 50 years, and our values are not and never have been the result of demands or interference from any outside entity. It's who we are, it's who we have been and who we always will be. Compare any union contract in our sector to the constantly expanding list of wages and benefits we have provided our people for decades and the union contract will not even come close to what Starbucks offers. We remain committed to doing the right thing for each and every Starbucks partner and that includes respect for differing opinions, inclusion and embracing diversity and individuality. Today, we take further steps to modernize our pay and benefits vision for our partners with further investments in wage, barista skills training, coffee excellence and financial wellness and literacy. And in September, we will share additional initiatives we are planning for Starbucks partners in areas that include help with student loan refinancing, additional skills recognition programs, enhanced in-app tipping and new profit sharing initiatives. Partners at Starbucks U.S. company-operated stores, where we have the right to unilaterally make these changes, will receive these wages and benefit enhancements. This covers more than 240,000 Starbucks partners and roughly 8,800 Starbucks stores across the country. We do not have the same freedom to make these improvements at locations that have a union or where union organizing is underway. Partners in those stores will receive the wages increases that were announced in October 21, but Federal law prohibits us from promising new wages and benefits at stores involved in union organizing. And by law, we cannot implement unilateral changes at stores that have a union. Where Starbucks is required to engage in collective bargaining, we will negotiate in good faith. Starbucks will not favor or discriminate against any partner based on union issues. And we will respect the right of Starbucks partners to make their own decisions when exercising these rights. A question I get asked frequently is how long are you going to stay? So let me try and preempt it here. I've just framed the enthusiasm and the optimism I have for our transformation plan going forward. We have line of sight on what the transformation looks like and how meaningfully our plan will benefit the company and our people as together we co-create and reimagine the future chapters of Starbucks' story history. The plan I share is being designed mindfully and strategically and will be executed successfully. This I can assure you. The Board and I have agreed I will stay to help transition our next leader. We are driving towards naming the new leader in the fall. After joining the company, he or she will undergo full immersion and have the opportunity to collaborate with me for a defined but not indefinite period. The plan is for me to completely hand over the CEO reign sometime in the first calendar quarter of '23 and to thereafter remain on the Starbucks Board. Over the last 50 years, we have built Starbucks into one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. And we have delivered best-in-class returns to our shareholders since being a public company in 1992. The investments in our people and our company we discuss today will absolutely assure that despite our success in the past, our best days are ahead. We're looking forward to demonstrating what's ahead and the enthusiasm we have to sharing that with you on our Investor Day in September. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Belinda. Belinda?\nBelinda Wong : Thank you, Howard. While we are into the third year of navigating through COVID in China, in Q2, we encountered the most severe resurgence of the virus to date. 72% of the 225 cities we're in experienced Omicron outbreaks, including Shanghai and Shenzhen. With this more infectious variant, mobility restrictions and lockdowns are imposed faster and relaxed more cautiously. Starbucks' focus since the start of the pandemic has been to protect the health and well-being of our partners and customers, provide support and show up positively in our communities. Our efforts have deepened our connection to customers and made our partners proud. Over the last 2 years, we have built up muscle and agility to navigate through COVID challenges. With every resurgence, we add new chapters to our China COVID playbook, strengthening our capabilities and resilience. As we moved into Q3 and continuing today, roughly 1/3 of our stores remain temporarily closed or are offering delivery or MOP only. And most of our remaining stores are operating under strict safety protocols that interfere with our traffic and operations. As a result, net revenue in China declined 14% and sales comp declined 20% in Q2 versus last year, after adjusting for the VAT subsidy, all from reduced traffic. We expect an even greater impact on our Q3 results due to the timing of the Shanghai lockdown and a further resurgence of the virus in other cities, including Beijing. We expect mobility restrictions to continue under the country's zero-COVID policy for the foreseeable future. In Q2, we continue to invest to increase our digital commission to customers. As a result, digital mix now represents a record 43% of sales. Our launch of Starbucks Delivers on Meituan in January has driven incrementality and make Starbucks the coffee category leader on third-party delivery platforms. We remain laser-focused on our growth as we manage through short-term challenges. At our China Investor Day in 2018, we shared our aspiration to operate 6,000 stores in China by 2022. Despite years of COVID disruptions, we remain on track to do so, adding 97 net new stores in Q2, with our new stores continuing to deliver best-in-class returns and profitability. We also continue to invest in smart technologies to improve our productivity and efficiency, leverage our scale and deliver an elevated experience to our partners and customers. We're extremely proud that despite COVID challenges, we achieved our highest-ever customer connection score in March. The enduring loyalty and connection our customers have to the Starbucks brand sets us apart from all competitors. Today, 1 in 2 coffee consumer in China choose Starbucks over any other coffee retail brand, a huge lead that we have held for years and continue to build upon. On dreams and aspirations for Starbucks China have never been greater, and I'm incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in China while managing through the pandemic. Our accomplishments are due to the extraordinary dedication and efforts of our 70,000 partners. No coffee retailer in China is better positioned than Starbucks to navigate the current headwinds or to resume accelerated growth once COVID mobility restrictions are lifted. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady. Brady?\nBrady Brewer: Thank you, Belinda. Starbucks is one of the most sought-after brands in the world. And by engaging deeply with our customers over 50 years, we've amassed a treasure trove of assets, both physical and digital, just 1 example being the nearly 27 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. We're activating these unique brand assets as a catalyst to accelerate the future of Starbucks as a global brand and as a business. From our beginning, we've nurtured human connection and served a fundamental belief that coffee brings us together. We brought this to life in what we've called the third place, a place between home and work, where you could connect and feel a sense of belonging over coffee. Now we are extending the third place concept of Starbucks into a new kind of community. Emerging technologies associated with Web 3, and specifically NFTs, now enable this aspiration and allow us to extend who Starbucks has always been at our core. We are creating the digital third place.  To achieve this, we will broaden our framework of what it means for people to be a member of the Starbucks community, adding new concepts such as ownership and community-based membership models that we see developing in the Web 3 space. We will lead by aligning our initiatives with our sustainability commitments, making deliberate choices to build the community on environmentally sustainable Web 3 platforms. Imagine acquiring a new digital collectible from Starbucks, where that product also serves as your access pass to a global Starbucks community, one with engaging content experiences and collaboration all centered around coffee. This community will further strengthen the Starbucks brand, engage our partners and we expect it to be accretive to our business. Starbucks has the history of taking leading-edge technology and innovation and making it accessible and approachable to the mainstream. You've seen it with our digital experiences, whether it was introducing ability to pay with your phone, mobile order or even access WiFi long ago. Starbucks can serve as a bridge to the future for our nearly 100 million customer occasions per week around the world. We'll take our first step toward a digital third place and our broad vision for Web 3 with an anticipated launch in this year. This is just the beginning of an exciting future. Now I'll turn it over to Rachel.\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks' performance in Q2 demonstrated strong customer demand across our portfolio despite continuing COVID headwinds. We delivered global revenue of $7.6 billion in Q2, up 15% from the prior year, a second quarter record. Our results were primarily driven by 18% revenue growth in the U.S. and stellar performance across our diverse global portfolio. We are particularly pleased with the strong results in light of the dynamic environment. Q2 consolidated operating margin contracted 300 basis points from the prior year to 13%, primarily due to inflation, which increased over the course of the quarter, significant investments in store partner wages and benefits and reduced traffic in China. The margin contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America. Q2 EPS was $0.59, declining 3% from the prior year, consistent with our expectations. I will now provide some segment highlights for Q2. North America delivered revenue of $5.4 billion in Q2, up 17% from the prior year and also a Q2 record, primarily driven by a 12% increase in comparable store sales comprised of a 7% increase in average ticket and a 5% increase in transactions. Strong performance of new stores over the past 12 months and the accelerated recovery of our licensed stores also contributed to this compelling level of revenue growth. U.S. comparable store sales were 12% despite significant store hour modifications in the early part of the quarter. The sustained momentum across our core platform and food attached, coupled with return of winter favorites and newer offerings such as the Pistachio Latte all contributed to these strong results. Our average ticket continued to grow, reaching an all-time high, driven by strategic beverage pricing and another record-breaking quarter of food attach with food sales increasing 25% from the prior year. We continue to engage with customers where and how they prefer, as our drive-thru windows, mobile order and delivery channels collectively accounted for 75% of U.S. company-operated sales in Q2. These convenient order channels and compelling product offerings cannot be easily replicated at home. Our customers continue to make Starbucks a part of their daily routine, fueling growth across all dayparts and drive- drive-thrus and cafes with specific strength in suburban and rural areas. Underpinning the enduring demand is our continued focus on digital customer engagement with Starbucks Rewards members delivering 54% of the revenue in our U.S. company-operated stores, the highest level of engagement on record, up 2 percentage points from the prior year. North America's operating margin was 17.2% in Q2, contracting 260 basis points from the prior year due to inflation, investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training as well as the lapping of prior year government subsidies. These margin headwinds were partially offset by pricing and sales leverage. Throughout the quarter, we executed our plan to offset near-term margin pressures by accelerating price increases, reducing spend in discretionary cost areas and activating throughput initiatives across our operations. These actions helped the company deliver Q2 profitability as planned despite higher-than-expected COVID isolation pay and ongoing inflationary headwinds, which increased considerably over the course of the quarter. Moving on to International. The segment delivered its highest second quarter revenue ever, reaching $1.7 billion, up 4% over the prior year despite the impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns in China. The growth was primarily driven by a 9% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and strong sales growth from our international licensees, including the conversion of our Korean market to a fully licensed business. Growth was partially offset by an 8% decline in comparable store sales, including a 3% decline attributable to the lapping prior year benefit as well as a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the VAT impact, international comparable store sales declined 5%. And excluding China, international comparable store sales increased meaningfully. Shifting to China. As you're aware, and as Belinda discussed, China continues to battle COVID resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns. Although China's comparable store sales improved sequentially in January, traffic lessened considerably in February and March as Omicron cases surged and lockdowns were implemented, leading to a comparable store sales decline of nearly 50% in the last week of March as we exited the quarter. As a result, second quarter comparable store sales declined 23% in the market or 20% excluding an impact of lapping the prior year VAT relief. At the end of Q2, roughly 1/3 of our stores in China remains temporarily closed or offered mobile ordering channels only. A sizable number of these stores were high-volume stores located in Tier 1 cities, including Shanghai, with the balance of active stores operating under elevated COVID safety protocols. Despite the considerable near-term headwinds, we remain focused on executing against our growth strategy in China. As Belinda shared, given our portfolio's healthy fundamentals, expanding digital footprint and record customer connection, coupled with vast opportunity ahead, we remain very optimistic for our future growth in China. Outside of China, the recovery of our international markets gained momentum across our global portfolio in Q2, with many of our licensed markets achieving record revenue levels in the quarter with revenue growth for the segment outside of China reaching 23%, once again demonstrating the underlying health of our business as mobility restrictions subside. Operating margins for the International segment was 13.1% in Q2, down 600 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by strategic and partner investments lapping higher prior year COVID relief, including government subsidies as well as higher product and distribution costs from sales mix shift, partially offset by sales leverage across the P&L. Strong performance of our international markets outside of China helped offset the significant sales deleverage in China. As the adverse impact from China lockdowns intensified in the last few weeks of Q2 and amplified further as we entered Q3, we expect China's results to continue to be a headwind throughout the current quarter. Moving on to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 25% to $463 million in Q2, primarily driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance as well as the strength in our international ready-to-drink business. The segment continued to amplify the Starbucks brand, led by the growth of our U.S. at-home coffee under the Global Coffee Alliance, which continued to see strong performance driven by Starbucks by Nespresso platform, fueled by the Vertuo line. We had exciting innovation launches in our ready-to-drink business, including Starbucks BAYA Energy in the U.S. and new chilled cup offerings in our international markets. The segment's operating margin was 42.7% in Q2, down 400 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to business mix shift driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance. Moving on to our guidance for the balance of our fiscal '22 year. Given the uncertainty around further mobility restrictions and lockdowns in China resulting from the government's strict zero-COVID policies as well as increasing inflationary headwinds, it's become increasingly difficult for us to predict the back half of the year with reasonable accuracy. Thus, as Howard mentioned, we believe the only responsible thing to do is to spend guidance for balance of this fiscal year. However, to provide additional insights, we believe our results for the balance of the year will be significantly pressured with heavier pressure in Q3. From a capital allocation perspective, although we suspended share repurchases for the balance of the fiscal year, we've returned more than $5 billion between share repurchases and our quarterly dividend during the first half of our fiscal year. We expect share repurchases made earlier in the year to contribute at least 1% to our FY '22 EPS growth. We will provide a comprehensive update on our business outlook and our capital allocation commitments for FY '23 and beyond at our Investor Day in September. However, as Howard mentioned, we are confident the investments we are making in our partners, our stores and our brand will deliver significant returns in excess of historical levels, resulting in accelerated long-term growth. To summarize, the 2 key takeaways from my prepared remarks today. Our Q2 performance underscores the strong customer demand across our business and around the world. We remain committed to the growth opportunity ahead in all channels and markets, creating and delivering exceptional value to all our stakeholders, our partners, our customers and our shareholders long into the future. Once again, the real credit for our success belongs to our green apron partners around the world who continue to go above and beyond to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience every day. That experience drove our growth and will continue to be the heart of our business as we reimagine the future of Starbucks together. With that, Howard, Belinda, Brady and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver, Michael Conway and Adam Brotman. Thank you. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Sarah Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Thank you very much, and welcome back, Howard. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the investments you're making? And I guess, twofold, one is, as you point out, Starbucks has been ahead of the curve on -- certainly, on wages. So is this about putting more hours in? I know you talked about training. I'm just trying to give a little bit more color on what that means. And in particular, if I look at your transactions in the U.S. or North America, they're still down versus what we saw in prior to the pandemic. So just trying to get a sense of is it -- that these are more complex orders? Or how should we think about any color ahead of what you'll talk to us more about on September?\nHoward Schultz: Well, thank you, Sara. As I mentioned in my remarks, over the last few weeks, I pretty much have crisscrossed the country in meeting with Starbucks partners and really listening very carefully to their concerns, their suggestions in what we really are calling a co-creation to the future of the company. I think it's important to understand that the business, as I mentioned, has changed dramatically in terms of Mobile Order & Pay, cold beverages is now almost 80% of the business. And the equipment in our stores and the layout of the stores have not been designed for the way customers are using our stores today. And that has put enormous pressure on our people. So the first thing we must do is give them new tools, and there will be upgrades in equipment that will be sequentially brought into the stores to try and relieve them on the pressure, that's 1 investment on the equipment side. There'll be a fair amount of investment in technology to do everything we can to upgrade the algorithms of labor scheduling and there will be upgrades in the digital app itself to be able to provide customers with a more accurate method of when their beverage is going to be ready. And then there's the wage piece. And I think as I said, we've always been ahead of the curve, but I think we haven't done enough. And I think it's -- we have to recognize that there is a lot of pressure on our people. We want to do everything we can, and so we're going to raise wages again. And I think if you think about Starbucks, Starbucks has been probably quite essentially the most experiential brand over the last 20, 30 years, and that experience comes to life as a relation -- because of the relationship that our people have with our customers. If we want to exceed the expectations of our customers, we have to exceed the expectations of our people. And so during COVID and post COVID, our attrition rate, like almost every other retailer, has gone up significantly. If you look at where we can really be much more efficient is that we can provide our people with better training, better wages, better equipment behind the counters to give them the tools and resources, the self-confidence and self-esteem to do their job, we will lower attrition and our retention rate will be much greater. That alone is a significant level of ways in which we can take money out of the P&L and money out of the store economics. So I think, let me put it in my own language. I mean, you have to ask yourself, is Starbucks half empty or half full? Listen, Starbucks is completely half full. Look at the assets we have. Look at how many customers are reaching out to Starbucks every day. The demand is accelerating, and that's despite the fact that we're not doing our best. As I said in my remarks, just wait until we upgrade the system, upgrade wages, give our people the tools and confidence. And once again, you're going to see us recording the kind of store-level economics we have in the past. The other thing I'd say is that the inflationary issues, which are significant and growing, that's an anomaly in America. We all know the inflation is a problem, but it's going to come down. And the other issue is China. We are so well positioned in China for the future, and the China restrictions are going to abate, and there's no consumer brand that I can identify that is better positioned than we are to take advantage. And as I said in my remarks, the China business is going to be bigger than the U.S. So is it glass half full? You bet it is.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAndrew Barish : Just a quick question on the areas of inflation that you're seeing now. I understand the future needs for equipment and training and wages, but where specifically are you seeing the inflation accelerating at this point, if you could?\nRachel Ruggeri : Sure. Hey, Andy, thanks for the question, it's Rachel. Our answer to that is, as we talked about in Q2, we saw inflationary pressures elevate in Q2 versus Q1. And that was related to a number of factors, some of them COVID-related. But as we've, seen going from Q2 and for the balance of the year, we're seeing increasing inflationary pressures across our supply chain, both in labor as well as freight and then across our commodities. And I would say it's pretty equal, half between commodities, half between our supply chain with freight being the bigger factor of the issues in the supply chain. So that's what we're seeing continue to elevate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Thank you so much, Howard. Appreciate the remarks, very thorough and passionate. Obviously, not something you bear but I'm sure there's a lengthy short list of candidates to be a successor for you. Can you talk a little about the pedigree and characteristics that you and the Board are looking for in your successor?\nHoward Schultz : I want to be very careful because I want to be sensitive to the people we're talking to and be respectful of all the candidates. Obviously, we want someone who has domain cultural experience in terms of the sensitivity of the values and culture of Starbucks Coffee Company. The person really needs to understand what it means to put on a green apron and work behind the Starbucks counter and be able to enhance and preserve the culture and values that we hold so dear at Starbucks. That person needs to have global experience. We're a global company. And obviously, we're looking for a servant leader and someone who's going to be here for the long term. There's no shortage of people who would like this job, and I think the Board and I have been very encouraged by the fact that we've been able to talk to wonderful candidates who really bring a lot to the table, but we're being very judicious and very careful, but we are going to find the right person. And I've committed to the Board that I will do everything I can to ensure a soft landing and good immersion. And then I'll stay on the Board to help the company and help the new CEO.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein : Thank you very much and welcome back Howard. Just one clarification and then a question. The clarification, I know you mentioned $200 million of incremental investment on the conference call, yet I see the press release is talking about upwards of $1 billion for the fiscal year. So I just wanted to reconcile whether the $1 billion is all inclusive of prior investments as well as the $200 million? But otherwise, my question, Howard, is just as we look to fiscal '23, it does seem like you're in somewhat of an unusual position kind of echoing the last question, returning as CEO. But expecting to hire a new CEO on the floor, I'm just wondering how do you walk that fine line stabilizing the business today but being sensitive to not offering too much of a new strategy or making major structural changes, which I would think would be something the new CEO will be keen to establish?\nHoward Schultz : Yes. I'll give Rachel the question on the investment first.\nRachel Ruggeri : Sure. Thanks, Jeffrey. So from an investment perspective, the more than 200 that Howard shared in his prepared remarks, that's in relation to -- we've already made investments this year, and that's incremental to the investments we've already committed to this year. So if you recall, we've already committed to investments on wage, some aspects of training as well as labor. In addition to that, we're having another round of investments on top of that that will be related to further wage investments, but also modernizing our training and our collaboration as well as celebrating coffee and coffee excellence as well as some equipment and other innovation in our stores to help with overall store productivity and improving our store operations. So the collective nature of that gets to about $1 billion in this year alone.\nHoward Schultz : In terms of your question, I think it's a question that I've spoken to the Board about a fair amount to ensure the fact that the strategy that we are now engaged in and the investments that we are focused on are the right ones regardless of who the next CEO is going to be. And I think the lens in which we're making all these investments is 100% through the lens of what can we do to exceed the expectations of both our customers and our people. And if you look at the demand of Starbucks, the strategy is we are all focused on 1 thing right now and that is to reimagine and rebuild and restore belief and trust for our people and do everything we can to rebuild the core U.S. business post COVID. So I think any CEO that's going to come in is going to understand that the core business of Starbucks is under significant pressure, primarily because of the demand we have. In addition to that, I think the next CEO is going to be a creative person who's going to understand that the equity of the Starbucks brand has real legitimacy and relevance outside of our stores. In the world we're living in today, our customer base is getting younger, they're digital natives, and they expect Starbucks to be as relevant outside of our stores as we are inside. And what you heard Brady talked about and Adam's arrival here in terms of Web 3.0 and the NFT platform, the new CEO, obviously, needs to have an understanding and a grasp and a conviction on the fact that we can play in multiple theaters that could be accretive on their own merit and complementary to our retail business and have done really, really well, and we think we can, can be a bounce back to creating incremental traffic and revenue not only in its core business in terms of retail, but a new business that's going to create incremental revenue unto itself.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe : How are you, Howard? Obviously, the suspension of the share buyback is very symbolic, and it's something that you mentioned today and obviously got a lot of attention when it was announced initially. And I am curious on CapEx that was previously guided at around $2 billion. You have $4 billion of cash. I mean you have talked about some increased stepped up investments, but it's hard to see those investments even in fiscal '23 materially drawing down your caps. So I just wanted to get a little bit more sense in terms of your highest returning caps that you can spend in your business as opposed to being given by shareholders. But was that really something that you wanted to do symbolically in terms of not just to the employees of the shareholders? Or did you feel like that was something that you had to do financially because some of the capital needs and perhaps OpEx needs of the business going forward actually will draw into some of that cash that you have currently?\nHoward Schultz : Well, John, first off, you and I are probably the oldest people on this call. For those of you who are not familiar with John's career, he's been with us, I think, since the IPO in '92. So John, I think you've seen this movie before. Listen, the decision to suspend the buyback was not symbolic. We're not making symbolic decisions. We're making strategic decisions that we think are the best interest of our shareholders. And the investments that we're currently making are going to drive a better return than the current way in which we look at buybacks, which is 10%, 11%. And for example, if we increase retention at 10%, 20%, the investments we're making are going to be significantly greater than that. You're right about the balance sheet, but I wanted to be very conservative, and I certainly wanted to send a signal to the market that we're playing the long game. We're not in it for the short run. We've always been -- always embraced building a great enduring company. That's where we are today. Starbucks' best days are ahead of us. We've never been more enthused, more proud, more optimistic, and this is the right decision to make. Rachel, do you want to add some on it?\nRachel Ruggeri: Yes. And if I could just add to that, the decision we made around suspending our buybacks was related to FY '22. So we'll come back at Investor Day in September and provide a more comprehensive capital allocation strategy for '23 and beyond. So I think it's important to consider that when you think about the decision we made. I also would say just to punctuate Howard's point is that we have the opportunity as we've looked at the back half of this year. Remember that we've already repurchased $4 billion this year. And so we've been able -- between buybacks and dividends, returned about $5 billion to shareholders, so we've leveraged that as a way to create value. But as we look at the back half of this year and we look at the priority of our investments, what Howard talked about in his prepared remarks, investments in technology, investments in digital, investments in our stores, they all have an outsized return relative to what we could do with buybacks. Perfect example of that is you know very well our new stores and the return we see on our new stores. More recently, we've seen our new stores in U.S. have an ROI of about 55%. So we have a significant opportunity ahead of us as we think about really not only strengthening the business, but creating more value over the long term. And I think you'll see a lot more about that at Investor Day in September.\nHoward Schultz : Rachel, before we get another question, if you don't mind, Michael, would you just take a few minutes because there's been a lot of chatter about China's impact on international? And just give a -- I know you just got back from Japan and Korea, just talk a little bit about your trip in international in general.\nMichael Conway : Yes. Thanks, Howard. Yes, we're seeing very strong recovery across many of our international markets outside of China as restrictions are starting to lift around the world. I was just in Japan, Korea, which is our #3 and #4 markets globally and I can tell you, customers are back out. They're starting to return to their routines and they're starting to return to our stores. In many of our key markets, Japan, Korea, the UK, Mexico, our average store sales are actually higher than our pre-COVID averages. As you heard, our international markets had a strong rate of 23% when you exclude China. And we have strength across all the regions. So for example, in Latin America, where we just now -- we just achieved 1,500 stores, we had strong momentum at a system comp of more than 40% in Q2. In EMEA, our UK comps grew at 67%, representing the highest comping company-operated market in Q2 as traffic continues to come into Central London, metro areas, and we are increasing drive-thrus in that market at a significant rate. In Asia Pacific, year-over-year, our revenue grew more than 50% with Korea leading the way. And then in Japan, our third largest market globally, we had double-digit comps as customer engagement is increasing. And this is despite the fact that there was Omicron and lockdowns early in January and into February. And these markets are starting to ease restrictions, Korea just on Monday removed mask mandate, and so customers are coming back to our stores. So I'm excited about the growth potential in front of us as the recovery continues. Our licensed partners are seeing the strength of our brand. They're committed to investing in our brands and as evidenced by the store growth that we're seeing. And then we have tremendous runway for growth when you think about the opportunity with the digital flywheel, and we're working hard to expand that and to build loyalty and frequency with our global customers. So we expect the international momentum to continue as more and more markets start to relax restrictions and customers will come back to Starbucks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs.\nJared Garber: Howard, if I could ask a question just on sort of the multichannel means in which consumers sort of interact with your brand now. You highlighted it in the call that there's several different sort of service channels now that we think about in terms of the consumer coming into the store themselves and then you've got the high penetration, so you said about 80% of sale, which is delivery, drive-thru or Mobile Order & Pay. Can you help frame maybe how you're thinking about the Starbucks of the future? And how maybe the actual in-store operations will shift from how they are today to serve that multichannel need?\nHoward Schultz: Thank you. I'm going to give that to Brady. Go ahead, Brady.\nBrady Brewer: Hello, Jared. Yes. We're really looking at this and asking ourselves 3 questions. One is, on the foundation of the Starbucks Experience, which is us knowing our customers by name, knowing their favorite drink, we're asking ourselves, how can we do that in the digital space? Knowing every single customer, personalizing the experience and then making that experience absolutely effortless for the customer. Increasingly, that's what customers are seeking, an effortless, personalized human connection at Starbucks. And so we're seeing that play out in the drive-thru. We're seeing that in our delivery growth, as Howard mentioned, growing 30% year-over-year. And with MOP now 25% of our business, obviously, we're seeing that there. So it's about how does Starbucks unlock that magic connection? Which only Starbucks can between connection and convenience. And because we've been successful with that so far, that's why we're seeing customers adopt those channels so quickly and so holistically, but I'd say we're just getting started.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: I wanted to come back to the idea of the investment needed to reimagine the Starbucks experience. First, Rachel, I understand the $200 million is probably within 2022, do you think 2023, at a high level, is still a reinvestment year in the business? And you made a comment about seeing returns in excess of historical levels over time. I wasn't sure if that was a comment that you believed that ultimately margins could achieve or exceed your historical goals of 18% to 19%? Or what does that comment broadly mean about excess returns versus historical levels?\nRachel Ruggeri : Sure. I can speak to the more than $200 million that Howard shared in his prepared remarks is relative to FY '22. In terms of what we're expecting for FY '23 and FY '24, we have near-term pressure in our business, and that's between the pressure we're seeing in, with inflation as well as what we're seeing in China and then the investments we're choosing to make. But while we're seeing near-term pressure, we have line of sight to a very solid path of accelerated growth in the future. I'm excited to share that with you at Investor Day. So at Investor Day, we'll provide more about our business as well as our broader, more comprehensive capital allocation strategy for '23 and beyond.\nHoward Schultz : I think just to pick up on that, we have been a growth company. We believe that Starbucks will maintain our position as a growth company. And given the demand we have and the capacity restraints, it really said we should be opening more stores. So I think you're going to see at our Investor Day, which we're very enthused to move up from December to September, we want to accelerate growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: So Starbucks is well regarded as one of the best companies with leading comp and benefits, very front-footed in terms of investment. Howard, as you've spoken to partners across the U.S., the sentiment towards the brand differ across markets or based on the tenure of the employees, can you just talk about the different factors there? Or a partner is relatively consistent in what they're looking for?\nHoward Schultz: Because we are in a situation where anything we say or might say could be misinterpreted by outside attorneys that are trying to find ways at which Starbucks at fault, I want to be very careful here. My prepared remarks needs to be what we're going to say regarding the union issues. My comments and the emotional relationship that I had in these meetings, partners across the country were really quite extraordinary. The love that people have for the company. The challenges that they've had personally and professionally as a result of COVID. The responsibility that they feel Starbucks has, which we agree with, to do everything we can to make their life better. But I don't want to go any further than that because I think the investments we're going to make for our people is a method to do everything we can to exceed our expectations, and we'll speak more about that in September. And I just want to say, we're moving up the Investor Day from December to September because we are quite enthused and excited to kind of move it up and share with you our plans for the future, accelerated growth, new store ideas, the technology, all the things we're going to share with you, including the relationship that we'll have with our people. And I think, just thinking out loud, I think we should have some of our people who are tenured managers of Starbucks and tenured green apron partners, they would talk to you about their experience with the company, which I think you'll find quite interesting.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh : Howard, you mentioned additional wage increases and investments. You also mentioned some enhanced tipping options that are coming. Can you talk about that decision and maybe the timing? And what you expect the consumer response to that to be?\nHoward Schultz : Sure. Brady, help me out. The digital tipping opportunity is perhaps the #1 single issue to provide more cash in the hands of our people. Right now, the only way our people can get a tip is on the Starbucks Card. And so they're missing out on a significant amount of money because customers want to give them a cashless tip, don't have the ability to do it because they're not paying on the Starbucks Card. That has been one of the most requested opportunities from our partners in the meetings I've had around the country, and this is something we're going to accelerate as much as we can. Brady, you want to take the other piece?\nBrady Brewer : Sure. So yes, I mean, I think on the tipping side of things, we're adding functionality throughout the year. We've got a lot of people working on this. As Howard said, it's one of the top requests. Currently, a customer can tip using the MLP experience, but we don't have the ability in many other parts of our store experience when a person is paying with a credit card, a stored value card or the app in our cafe and in the drive-thru. So that's what we anticipate working very quickly against to bring that functionality to our partners.\nRachel Ruggeri : And if I could just add on the wage, the majority of the wage investments that Howard talked about, just specific to wage, were part of what we already committed to earlier this year. But in addition to that, as we've made the move on wage for the majority of our hourly partners, our baristas and we've also committed to addressing compression in tenure in its most recent move as well. So that will mean that every one of our partners will also have an increase this summer.\nHoward Schultz : Can I just repeat that? Every Starbucks person who is a non-manager at Starbucks will be getting an increase in pay.\nRachel Ruggeri : That's right.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino : Good afternoon and welcome back, Howard. Howard, I guess, my first question or first part of the question is a clarification. You mentioned over $200 million of investments have been identified and that seems a little small in relation to kind of your ambitious vision about transforming the company. So can you clarify whether that's just a starting point when you have more in mind? Or whether that's the total of what you're thinking? And then secondly, I guess, if there's any directional commentary you can offer about what the longer-term margin outlook might look like, including these investments relative to the prior targets the company had before you return.\nHoward Schultz : Sure. I think, given the investment question, I'll give it to Rachel, turn to the margin question, I'll give that to Rachel as well. But clearly, the inflationary number, which is quite stiff, is going to abate. And when it does, we'll be in a great position because we will do -- we will have done things to handle the demand which we're having trouble doing now. But Rachel, go ahead.\nRachel Ruggeri : Yes. Let me just speak to the more than $200 million that Howard addressed in his prepared remarks, is on top of the commitments we'd already made earlier this year are largely related to wage. So the combination of that is about $1 billion in this year alone. And so certainly, we'll have further investments that we'll make over time that we'll share with you at Investor Day. But I think it's important to remember that a little more than $200 million on top of the commitments we've already made, so it's a pretty big broad investment when you look at it from that perspective. And relative to margins, I think as Howard spoke about, we expect that some portion of inflation will essentially abate. In addition to that, I think what's really important and the pressure we're seeing in the back half of the year is that's largely pressure from what we're seeing in China and the amplification in Q3. And just to give you a perspective, what we're projecting for the balance of the year is that typically, what we typically see from China in terms of market contribution on OI will be half of what we typically expect. As the market returns and mobility increases, we know that the growth rhythm there is strong. We believe in the opportunity ahead, and that will also give us further opportunity as we think about that into the future. But I think when you think about those 2 aspects and the investments we're making today, that will return investments in retention, investments in recruiting, investments in our ability to make our store operations improve, that's going to lead to greater partner engagement. -- and partner engagement leads to better customer experience overall. We know that equation. It's worked for us for 50 years. It's going to be the key to what we deliver over the next 50 years, and it's critical to our growth. So I think the combination of all of that gives us line of sight to the fact that we firmly believe we'll be able to have a path to accelerated growth in the future, which we'll share with you at Investor Day.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\nSharon Zackfia: I guess a question on the unmet demand that you're seeing in North America or specifically the U.S., can you talk about kind of where your measures of productivity or throughput are relative to pre-pandemic particularly given the barista turnover that you've seen?\nJohn Culver: Yes. Sharon, this is John. I think what we're seeing is that as we get our stores operating at full capacity and as we come through COVID early in the quarter, we have now increased hours of operation. And at the same time, also increase to full staffing levels in our stores and having all channels open. So we're getting a much better read on how our productivity is progressing. Clearly, we measure on drive-thru out the window time. Clearly, in the stores, we measure items sold per labor hour. And there are other measurements that, that we track as well. We watched all those things very closely. I think one of the things I would just also highlight on the investments we're making for the remainder of this year is a big investment on training for our partners. And one of the things that we heard loud and clear in these listening session and co-creation sessions was they wanted more training. And today, we offer about 23 hours of training to a new barista entering our stores, and we're going to push that 40 hours beginning the end of June, and that will significantly enhance their skill sets, make them more confident in preparing the beverages and ultimately, make them feel successful reducing overall complexity of doing the job and ultimately feeling successful. So ultimately, we do feel that will help increase productivity. But it's all about enhancing that partner experience giving them the tools that they need to be successful and making sure that we're investing in them. And then you've got the equipment aspect as well. We've got significant investments that we're making around the Mastrena machines, around the Merrychef ovens, around handheld order points for drive-thru and also the investments we're going to make on the cold beverage station to increase the capacity of the cold beverage work area for our partners going forward, which will help improve productivity as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer : Welcome back, Howard. I think John was actually touching on the question I was going to ask about, which is around capacity constraints. I'm wondering if you could maybe touch on what you're seeing in terms of service times or any metrics that would sort of prove to you that there's an opportunity or room for improvement. And I got a sense from your answer just then and before that that you think a lot of this is going to be solved more on the capital investment side with new machines, for example, and sort of reconfiguring how the cold beverage area works. But do you think there's also going to be more expense type investment, labor, you mentioned the people with the handhelds and the drive-thru, any sort of breakdown of how you see this investment playing out?\nJohn Culver: Yes. What we'll see is we'll see an investment from an expense standpoint on obviously, training, which I highlighted earlier, which we think will have significant positive impact for our partners and making them better prepared to do their jobs. Number two, the equipment investments, although those will be capitalized, they will also have some expense as we go through and do installations. When we do the renovations in the stores, that portion would be capitalized, although there will be some expectation to that as well. And then Howard and Rachel have touched on some of the digital investments we want to make in the stores not only for customers but for partners. And from a partner standpoint, it's all around automating the ordering system. We have automated ordering rolled out completely across the U.S. for our food and merchandise. We're in proof-of-concept testing right now for beverage items that are the remainder of the items, and we anticipate that, that will also be an unlock to help improve the partner experience to reduce complexity and to allow our partners to focus on our customers. And then the last thing I would just say as it relates to the productivity measures. We believe very strongly that as we've come through COVID, we experienced significant challenges on staffing stores. And as we progress through the quarter in Q2 and as COVID eased, staffing levels normalized, hours of operation began normalizing as well and all channels were open, productivity became coming back into the stores, and that was signified by the strong performance from a comp perspective that we saw in the quarter to deliver a 12% comp as well as see the increase of attach of food at record levels, signifies that our partners are doing heroic work to meet the demand of the customers and what they're seeing in their stores. And I just want to acknowledge all our partners across the U.S. for the tremendous job they're doing to exceed those expectations of our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Howard Schultz for closing remarks.\nHoward Schultz: I guess this is my opportunity to close the call. Our intent today was to provide a comprehensive overview of what we've done in the last 5, 6 weeks. And also to give you a sense of the passion and enthusiasm and optimism we have about the future of the company. Clearly, there are things that are not in our control right now. The situation in China, the level of inflation are things that we didn't plan on that we're managing through. But when you take inflation out and you take the problems in China out, both of which we believe are going to abate, we're going to be really well positioned to take advantage of the position we occupy in the marketplace, and that is from a global perspective. You heard Michael tell you how strong our business is in international, excluding China. You heard me talk about the strength of our CPG business, which demonstrates the strength of our brand outside of our stores. The other thing which I did not mention is one of the metrics that I've always been concerned about was whether or not our customer base was getting younger, that we were staying as relevant as possible with young people. That's exactly where we are. Our customer base is getting younger. And that, to me, says so much about the strength of the brand in terms of our 50-year history. And so as we head into the summer and holiday season and the investor conference, I think we're going to be well positioned to really share with you the plans we have for holiday in fiscal '23 and beyond. For those of you who have known me a long time and many of you have followed the company for many years, you were around in 2008. Now this is not 2008. But when we came back in 2008, one of the main issues was we had to create demand. We didn't have demand. And so the demand that we have right now is such a blessing, such a gift. And so what we have to do is harness the issues that we have to deal with in terms of capacity, exceeding the expectations of our people. I've been here long enough to understand what the challenges are and long enough to understand the extraordinary opportunity Starbucks has in the marketplace domestically and around the world. We have challenges, but we have the experience and the know-how to address them. And most importantly, we're taking the long -- we're playing the long game. We're making the investments ahead of the curve, and we are going to accelerate growth. And for those investors who had faith in us in 2008, I hope that you'll understand that the glass is clearly half full, and we are going to be back to where we always have been and that is delivering the kind of financial results that you've come to expect us from. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks' Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Howard. While we are into the third year of navigating through COVID in China, in Q2, we encountered the most severe resurgence of the virus to date. 72% of the 225 cities we're in experienced Omicron outbreaks, including Shanghai and Shenzhen. With this more infectious variant, mobility restrictions and lockdowns are imposed faster and relaxed more cautiously. Starbucks' focus since the start of the pandemic has been to protect the health and well-being of our partners and customers, provide support and show up positively in our communities. Our efforts have deepened our connection to customers and made our partners proud. Over the last 2 years, we have built up muscle and agility to navigate through COVID challenges. With every resurgence, we add new chapters to our China COVID playbook, strengthening our capabilities and resilience. As we moved into Q3 and continuing today, roughly 1/3 of our stores remain temporarily closed or are offering delivery or MOP only. And most of our remaining stores are operating under strict safety protocols that interfere with our traffic and operations. As a result, net revenue in China declined 14% and sales comp declined 20% in Q2 versus last year, after adjusting for the VAT subsidy, all from reduced traffic. We expect an even greater impact on our Q3 results due to the timing of the Shanghai lockdown and a further resurgence of the virus in other cities, including Beijing. We expect mobility restrictions to continue under the country's zero-COVID policy for the foreseeable future. In Q2, we continue to invest to increase our digital commission to customers. As a result, digital mix now represents a record 43% of sales. Our launch of Starbucks Delivers on Meituan in January has driven incrementality and make Starbucks the coffee category leader on third-party delivery platforms. We remain laser-focused on our growth as we manage through short-term challenges. At our China Investor Day in 2018, we shared our aspiration to operate 6,000 stores in China by 2022. Despite years of COVID disruptions, we remain on track to do so, adding 97 net new stores in Q2, with our new stores continuing to deliver best-in-class returns and profitability. We also continue to invest in smart technologies to improve our productivity and efficiency, leverage our scale and deliver an elevated experience to our partners and customers. We're extremely proud that despite COVID challenges, we achieved our highest-ever customer connection score in March. The enduring loyalty and connection our customers have to the Starbucks brand sets us apart from all competitors. Today, 1 in 2 coffee consumer in China choose Starbucks over any other coffee retail brand, a huge lead that we have held for years and continue to build upon. On dreams and aspirations for Starbucks China have never been greater, and I'm incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in China while managing through the pandemic. Our accomplishments are due to the extraordinary dedication and efforts of our 70,000 partners. No coffee retailer in China is better positioned than Starbucks to navigate the current headwinds or to resume accelerated growth once COVID mobility restrictions are lifted. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady. Brady?"

            "name": "Howard Schultz",
            "content": "Thank you, Tiffany. Love and responsibility brought me back to Starbucks, my love of the company and my deep responsibility to our partners and shareholders. In the month I've been back, I've traveled the country and met with thousands of Starbucks retail store partners and visited all 5 of our roasting plants, and I've learned first-hand about the unique challenges confronting the company today. I've also experienced the passionate relationship our partners have with the company and the enduring emotional connection our customers have to the Starbucks brand. COVID presented unprecedented operating challenges to consumer brands. COVID also drove dramatic changes in customer behavior that Starbucks stores and systems were not designed or built for. The challenges have been amplified by record demand for Starbucks coffee in our U.S. stores that has accelerated with the lifting of COVID restrictions. Our Q2 results tell the story. In Q2, our sales comp in North America grew 12% over last year, 23% compared to Q2 2020. Both drive-thru and Mobile Order & Pay activity have surged, together now generating over 70% of our U.S. store volume. Delivery, a nearly $500 million business, is up 30% in the first half of fiscal year. And in our stores, customers are increasingly further customizing already complex handcrafted cold beverages. The combination of shifts and customer patterns, accelerating demand and algorithms built for different customer behaviors has placed tremendous strain on our U.S. store partners. Ordinarily, we would have anticipated and invested ahead of the shifts we're seeing, but COVID disruptions interfered with our ability to make the required investments in store design, operations, infrastructure and technology to do so. As a result, we've been unable to meet the relentless demand we're seeing in our U.S. stores as seamlessly as our customers and partners expect and candidly deserve. Simply said, we do not, today, have the adequate capacity to meet the growing demand for Starbucks coffees. Going forward, we will be making investments in our partners and business to literally catch up on investments we have not made and make further investments to position the company ahead of the coming growth curve. We will also be accelerating our new store growth with 90% of new stores being high-returning drive-thru. Our newest class of drive-thrus will integrate new store designs, technology, including more handheld devices and equipment improvements that will increase efficiency, speed of service, and we believe deliver even greater profitability in the future. We will then incorporate the new technologies and equipment into our existing stores and provide our people with the tools and resources they need to elevate the Starbucks experience we deliver to our customers and create even more demand in the future. And we'll be making significant investments to extend our digital capabilities and deepen our digital connection to customers and the emotional attachment our customers have to the Starbucks brand. Returns on our digital investments are consistently among the highest returns we generate, which brings us to the decision we will revisit in fiscal '23 to suspend stock buybacks. Buying back stock yields us, on average, about a 10% return. With Starbucks' treasure trove of global assets, a 10% return is not satisfactory to me. Throughout our history, the investments we have made in our people and business have always delivered outsized returns to our shareholders. We're so eager to show off our pipeline of disruptive innovation that we're moving our Investor Day up to September in Seattle from December in New York. The significant innovation around technology and personalization we will reveal our industry game-changers that will further increase store productivity and efficiency. What you will see is the coming transformation and reimagination of the Starbucks customer and partner experiences. The transformation will accelerate already record demand in our stores, but the investments will enable us to handle the increased demand and deliver increased profitability, while also delivering an elevated experience to our customers, and most importantly, reducing strain on our partners. We must reintroduce joy in the customer and emotional connection back into the partner experience. We've identified over $200 million of investment that's incremental to the significant investments we've already committed to in our U.S. company-operated stores this year. These include further investments in training, wage and equipment and new investments in internal communication with our people, where we will launch a new partner app to communicate directly with all store partners. We will also be reaffirming our commitment to coffee excellence and partner education by reintroducing our black apron, Coffee Master and origin trip programs. And in 2023, we will introduce enhanced digital tipping for our partners. We believe these investments will improve retention and recruiting and elevate the experience we deliver to our partners and our customers. Over the last month, we've realigned Starbucks U.S. organization to focus entirely on transforming and reimagining our core U.S. business. Belinda Wong will share plans for accelerated growth in China as soon as COVID-related mobility restrictions there are lifted. And make no mistake, our aspirations around China have never been greater and I remain convinced Starbucks' business in China will be eventually larger than our business in the U.S. We have a big breakthrough idea around the launch of Starbucks Web 3.0 and a unique platform for NFTs that Brady Brewer and Adam Brotman, architect of Mobile Order & Pay and the Starbucks digital app, who is serving as a special adviser to us, will shortly tell you about. I believe Web 3.0 will create an authentic digital third place experience and drive substantial new revenue streams for Starbucks and be accretive to the brand. Our Web 3.0 strategy is a proxy for the greater ambition we have for the company going forward. Despite the fact that post COVID, our customers are not using our stores the same way, and we've been operationally challenged as a result, our national retail footprint and best-in-class real estate portfolio is still enabling us to meet customers wherever they are and irrespective of their need state. This relentless demand we're seeing in our stores today underscores this reality. Looking ahead, trying to imagine thousands of vastly more productive and efficient Starbucks stores reconfigured to align with today's customer behavior and built around technology that will deliver increased speed of service, improved labor management and reduced unit cost, an elevated partner and customer experience. Now imagine the accretive impact to our financials when we reengineer our stores to deliver what we're capable of in delivering and arm our people with the tools and resources they need to once again exceed our customers' expectations. From my perspective, I understand what's needed, and I'm back to lead this transformation and committed to seeing it through. Starbucks sits alone with something few, if any, of our peers literally have, and that is unmet demand. Companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing, promotions and social media trying to create demand. We have demand everywhere we look, despite having not lived up to the expectations we set for ourselves, let alone exceeding the expectations of our customers and our people since the pandemic. The big opportunity ahead for us is to meet strong and growing demand in our stores more efficiently and effectively and to leverage technology to enhance productivity and reduce burden on our store partners. Let me highlight just a few sources of the accelerating demand we're seeing in our U.S. stores and business. Mobile Order & Pay, an over $4 billion business, is up 400% in 5 years, is up 20% over last year. Our $500 million delivery business is up 30% over last year. The Starbucks Card puts our brand in the hands of nearly 120 million people and is alone larger than the entire gift card category. Starbucks customers are increasingly prepaying for their purchases in huge volumes, roughly $11 billion last year, and we are on track to exceed that figure this year. At this moment, well over $1 billion is loaded on Starbucks Cards waiting to be spent in our stores. And active Starbucks Rewards membership in the U.S. grew 17% over last year to Q2 to 27 million members. Strong underlying demand means the productivity and efficiency investments I've described represent literally low-hanging fruit available to us right now. And ever since, Starbucks remains a growth company today and will remain a growth company into the future. Two related dynamics underscore the power of the equity of the Starbucks brand and support our growth aspirations: consistent pricing power and strong demand for Starbucks products in CPG channels. Over the last year, we raised prices several times to address increasing inflationary pressures. Yet, we experienced negligible customer attrition, once again demonstrating the elasticity of demand for Starbucks coffee. Even so, inflationary pressures have outpaced our price increases, resulting in several points of margin compression in the short term and costing us over 200 basis points in the first half of the fiscal year. In Q2, we were able to absorb the incremental cost while still delivering on our EPS expectations. In our channels business, Starbucks today has the #1 share in the U.S. at at-home coffee and the #1 share in global ready-to-drink coffee. Customer loyalty inside and outside our stores has never been greater. You have to ask yourself how many retail companies have a consumer brand that is best of class and literally the #1 position in grocery and in multiple channels of distribution? You'd be hard-pressed to find any. I could not be more optimistic or confident in the successful transformation and reimagination of our store partner and customer experiences. Let me turn to China. I cannot think of any other Western consumer brand, let alone a food and beverage retailer, that has performed as well as us in China over the last 20 years. I say that with great pride having been to China so often, building confidence, trust and respect for relationships with government officials and working closely with our Chinese team. However, the situation in China is unprecedented. Shanghai, a city 4x the size of New York City, is completely locked down. Other major cities, including Beijing, are experiencing new COVID outbreaks and implementing new mobility restrictions pursuant to China's strict zero-COVID policy. Conditions in China are such that we have virtually no ability to predict our performance in China in the back half of the year. Given the materiality and the high level of ongoing uncertainty around China, accelerating inflation and the significant investments we are planning, the only responsible course of action for us to take is to suspend guidance for Q3 and Q4. As we move through Q3 and approach September's Investor Day, we will have much greater visibility on Q4, holiday and fiscal '23, and be in a position to share details around our comprehensive post-COVID China plan with you. I'm very pleased with the growth we're seeing from our international business. Excluding China, our International segment grew comps in the double digits in the quarter, stronger than anticipated, demonstrating the strength of our diversified portfolio and the opportunity ahead. Even including the impact of China, our International segment still grew 4% in the quarter over last year to a record $1.7 billion. Our international store base grew 9% over last year to over 17,700 stores. 15% of that growth was in licensed markets. We expect 75% of the net new stores we will open in fiscal '22 to be outside the U.S., further underscoring the enormous global and the opportunity ahead. Now let me turn to a subject in the news. Across America, there is a movement in the media and across multiple industries, including the service sector, whereby fellow citizens have begun turning to labor unions as a means of gaining voice, representation and improved working conditions. This movement is not related to any specific company. We are highly emphatic to the root causes of the frustration and anxieties that Gen Z Americans are facing, having come of age during turbulent moments in our history: the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, The Great Recession and now The Global Coronavirus Pandemic. These young people have completely valid concerns given today's uncertainty and economic instability. They look around and they see the burgeoning labor movement as a possible remedy to what they are feeling. I understand the climate, and I'm deeply sensitive to the needs of all of our green apron partners. Yet, we have a very different and vastly more positive vision for our company based on listening, connecting and collaborating directly with our people. Throughout our history at Starbucks, we have led our industry, and in many cases, corporate America, in introducing breakthrough benefits for our people. Aon Hewitt, the gold standard in benefits, rate Starbucks in the 100th percentile in the retail sector, the 100th percentile, including from part-time workers who want stability and flexibility to achieve their future aspirations. That means no retail company in America ranks above Starbucks for the benefits we provide our people. We are proud of our history and leadership in wages and benefits, and we are committed to doing even more to meet the evolving needs of our Starbucks partners in the future. Sharing success through wins and benefits with our partners is among our core values, and has been for 50 years, and our values are not and never have been the result of demands or interference from any outside entity. It's who we are, it's who we have been and who we always will be. Compare any union contract in our sector to the constantly expanding list of wages and benefits we have provided our people for decades and the union contract will not even come close to what Starbucks offers. We remain committed to doing the right thing for each and every Starbucks partner and that includes respect for differing opinions, inclusion and embracing diversity and individuality. Today, we take further steps to modernize our pay and benefits vision for our partners with further investments in wage, barista skills training, coffee excellence and financial wellness and literacy. And in September, we will share additional initiatives we are planning for Starbucks partners in areas that include help with student loan refinancing, additional skills recognition programs, enhanced in-app tipping and new profit sharing initiatives. Partners at Starbucks U.S. company-operated stores, where we have the right to unilaterally make these changes, will receive these wages and benefit enhancements. This covers more than 240,000 Starbucks partners and roughly 8,800 Starbucks stores across the country. We do not have the same freedom to make these improvements at locations that have a union or where union organizing is underway. Partners in those stores will receive the wages increases that were announced in October 21, but Federal law prohibits us from promising new wages and benefits at stores involved in union organizing. And by law, we cannot implement unilateral changes at stores that have a union. Where Starbucks is required to engage in collective bargaining, we will negotiate in good faith. Starbucks will not favor or discriminate against any partner based on union issues. And we will respect the right of Starbucks partners to make their own decisions when exercising these rights. A question I get asked frequently is how long are you going to stay? So let me try and preempt it here. I've just framed the enthusiasm and the optimism I have for our transformation plan going forward. We have line of sight on what the transformation looks like and how meaningfully our plan will benefit the company and our people as together we co-create and reimagine the future chapters of Starbucks' story history. The plan I share is being designed mindfully and strategically and will be executed successfully. This I can assure you. The Board and I have agreed I will stay to help transition our next leader. We are driving towards naming the new leader in the fall. After joining the company, he or she will undergo full immersion and have the opportunity to collaborate with me for a defined but not indefinite period. The plan is for me to completely hand over the CEO reign sometime in the first calendar quarter of '23 and to thereafter remain on the Starbucks Board. Over the last 50 years, we have built Starbucks into one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. And we have delivered best-in-class returns to our shareholders since being a public company in 1992. The investments in our people and our company we discuss today will absolutely assure that despite our success in the past, our best days are ahead. We're looking forward to demonstrating what's ahead and the enthusiasm we have to sharing that with you on our Investor Day in September. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Belinda. Belinda? Well, thank you, Sara. As I mentioned in my remarks, over the last few weeks, I pretty much have crisscrossed the country in meeting with Starbucks partners and really listening very carefully to their concerns, their suggestions in what we really are calling a co-creation to the future of the company. I think it's important to understand that the business, as I mentioned, has changed dramatically in terms of Mobile Order & Pay, cold beverages is now almost 80% of the business. And the equipment in our stores and the layout of the stores have not been designed for the way customers are using our stores today. And that has put enormous pressure on our people. So the first thing we must do is give them new tools, and there will be upgrades in equipment that will be sequentially brought into the stores to try and relieve them on the pressure, that's 1 investment on the equipment side. There'll be a fair amount of investment in technology to do everything we can to upgrade the algorithms of labor scheduling and there will be upgrades in the digital app itself to be able to provide customers with a more accurate method of when their beverage is going to be ready. And then there's the wage piece. And I think as I said, we've always been ahead of the curve, but I think we haven't done enough. And I think it's -- we have to recognize that there is a lot of pressure on our people. We want to do everything we can, and so we're going to raise wages again. And I think if you think about Starbucks, Starbucks has been probably quite essentially the most experiential brand over the last 20, 30 years, and that experience comes to life as a relation -- because of the relationship that our people have with our customers. If we want to exceed the expectations of our customers, we have to exceed the expectations of our people. And so during COVID and post COVID, our attrition rate, like almost every other retailer, has gone up significantly. If you look at where we can really be much more efficient is that we can provide our people with better training, better wages, better equipment behind the counters to give them the tools and resources, the self-confidence and self-esteem to do their job, we will lower attrition and our retention rate will be much greater. That alone is a significant level of ways in which we can take money out of the P&L and money out of the store economics. So I think, let me put it in my own language. I mean, you have to ask yourself, is Starbucks half empty or half full? Listen, Starbucks is completely half full. Look at the assets we have. Look at how many customers are reaching out to Starbucks every day. The demand is accelerating, and that's despite the fact that we're not doing our best. As I said in my remarks, just wait until we upgrade the system, upgrade wages, give our people the tools and confidence. And once again, you're going to see us recording the kind of store-level economics we have in the past. The other thing I'd say is that the inflationary issues, which are significant and growing, that's an anomaly in America. We all know the inflation is a problem, but it's going to come down. And the other issue is China. We are so well positioned in China for the future, and the China restrictions are going to abate, and there's no consumer brand that I can identify that is better positioned than we are to take advantage. And as I said in my remarks, the China business is going to be bigger than the U.S. So is it glass half full? You bet it is. I want to be very careful because I want to be sensitive to the people we're talking to and be respectful of all the candidates. Obviously, we want someone who has domain cultural experience in terms of the sensitivity of the values and culture of Starbucks Coffee Company. The person really needs to understand what it means to put on a green apron and work behind the Starbucks counter and be able to enhance and preserve the culture and values that we hold so dear at Starbucks. That person needs to have global experience. We're a global company. And obviously, we're looking for a servant leader and someone who's going to be here for the long term. There's no shortage of people who would like this job, and I think the Board and I have been very encouraged by the fact that we've been able to talk to wonderful candidates who really bring a lot to the table, but we're being very judicious and very careful, but we are going to find the right person. And I've committed to the Board that I will do everything I can to ensure a soft landing and good immersion. And then I'll stay on the Board to help the company and help the new CEO. Yes. I'll give Rachel the question on the investment first. In terms of your question, I think it's a question that I've spoken to the Board about a fair amount to ensure the fact that the strategy that we are now engaged in and the investments that we are focused on are the right ones regardless of who the next CEO is going to be. And I think the lens in which we're making all these investments is 100% through the lens of what can we do to exceed the expectations of both our customers and our people. And if you look at the demand of Starbucks, the strategy is we are all focused on 1 thing right now and that is to reimagine and rebuild and restore belief and trust for our people and do everything we can to rebuild the core U.S. business post COVID. So I think any CEO that's going to come in is going to understand that the core business of Starbucks is under significant pressure, primarily because of the demand we have. In addition to that, I think the next CEO is going to be a creative person who's going to understand that the equity of the Starbucks brand has real legitimacy and relevance outside of our stores. In the world we're living in today, our customer base is getting younger, they're digital natives, and they expect Starbucks to be as relevant outside of our stores as we are inside. And what you heard Brady talked about and Adam's arrival here in terms of Web 3.0 and the NFT platform, the new CEO, obviously, needs to have an understanding and a grasp and a conviction on the fact that we can play in multiple theaters that could be accretive on their own merit and complementary to our retail business and have done really, really well, and we think we can, can be a bounce back to creating incremental traffic and revenue not only in its core business in terms of retail, but a new business that's going to create incremental revenue unto itself. Well, John, first off, you and I are probably the oldest people on this call. For those of you who are not familiar with John's career, he's been with us, I think, since the IPO in '92. So John, I think you've seen this movie before. Listen, the decision to suspend the buyback was not symbolic. We're not making symbolic decisions. We're making strategic decisions that we think are the best interest of our shareholders. And the investments that we're currently making are going to drive a better return than the current way in which we look at buybacks, which is 10%, 11%. And for example, if we increase retention at 10%, 20%, the investments we're making are going to be significantly greater than that. You're right about the balance sheet, but I wanted to be very conservative, and I certainly wanted to send a signal to the market that we're playing the long game. We're not in it for the short run. We've always been -- always embraced building a great enduring company. That's where we are today. Starbucks' best days are ahead of us. We've never been more enthused, more proud, more optimistic, and this is the right decision to make. Rachel, do you want to add some on it? Rachel, before we get another question, if you don't mind, Michael, would you just take a few minutes because there's been a lot of chatter about China's impact on international? And just give a -- I know you just got back from Japan and Korea, just talk a little bit about your trip in international in general. Thank you. I'm going to give that to Brady. Go ahead, Brady. I think just to pick up on that, we have been a growth company. We believe that Starbucks will maintain our position as a growth company. And given the demand we have and the capacity restraints, it really said we should be opening more stores. So I think you're going to see at our Investor Day, which we're very enthused to move up from December to September, we want to accelerate growth. Because we are in a situation where anything we say or might say could be misinterpreted by outside attorneys that are trying to find ways at which Starbucks at fault, I want to be very careful here. My prepared remarks needs to be what we're going to say regarding the union issues. My comments and the emotional relationship that I had in these meetings, partners across the country were really quite extraordinary. The love that people have for the company. The challenges that they've had personally and professionally as a result of COVID. The responsibility that they feel Starbucks has, which we agree with, to do everything we can to make their life better. But I don't want to go any further than that because I think the investments we're going to make for our people is a method to do everything we can to exceed our expectations, and we'll speak more about that in September. And I just want to say, we're moving up the Investor Day from December to September because we are quite enthused and excited to kind of move it up and share with you our plans for the future, accelerated growth, new store ideas, the technology, all the things we're going to share with you, including the relationship that we'll have with our people. And I think, just thinking out loud, I think we should have some of our people who are tenured managers of Starbucks and tenured green apron partners, they would talk to you about their experience with the company, which I think you'll find quite interesting. Sure. Brady, help me out. The digital tipping opportunity is perhaps the #1 single issue to provide more cash in the hands of our people. Right now, the only way our people can get a tip is on the Starbucks Card. And so they're missing out on a significant amount of money because customers want to give them a cashless tip, don't have the ability to do it because they're not paying on the Starbucks Card. That has been one of the most requested opportunities from our partners in the meetings I've had around the country, and this is something we're going to accelerate as much as we can. Brady, you want to take the other piece? Can I just repeat that? Every Starbucks person who is a non-manager at Starbucks will be getting an increase in pay. Sure. I think, given the investment question, I'll give it to Rachel, turn to the margin question, I'll give that to Rachel as well. But clearly, the inflationary number, which is quite stiff, is going to abate. And when it does, we'll be in a great position because we will do -- we will have done things to handle the demand which we're having trouble doing now. But Rachel, go ahead. I guess this is my opportunity to close the call. Our intent today was to provide a comprehensive overview of what we've done in the last 5, 6 weeks. And also to give you a sense of the passion and enthusiasm and optimism we have about the future of the company. Clearly, there are things that are not in our control right now. The situation in China, the level of inflation are things that we didn't plan on that we're managing through. But when you take inflation out and you take the problems in China out, both of which we believe are going to abate, we're going to be really well positioned to take advantage of the position we occupy in the marketplace, and that is from a global perspective. You heard Michael tell you how strong our business is in international, excluding China. You heard me talk about the strength of our CPG business, which demonstrates the strength of our brand outside of our stores. The other thing which I did not mention is one of the metrics that I've always been concerned about was whether or not our customer base was getting younger, that we were staying as relevant as possible with young people. That's exactly where we are. Our customer base is getting younger. And that, to me, says so much about the strength of the brand in terms of our 50-year history. And so as we head into the summer and holiday season and the investor conference, I think we're going to be well positioned to really share with you the plans we have for holiday in fiscal '23 and beyond. For those of you who have known me a long time and many of you have followed the company for many years, you were around in 2008. Now this is not 2008. But when we came back in 2008, one of the main issues was we had to create demand. We didn't have demand. And so the demand that we have right now is such a blessing, such a gift. And so what we have to do is harness the issues that we have to deal with in terms of capacity, exceeding the expectations of our people. I've been here long enough to understand what the challenges are and long enough to understand the extraordinary opportunity Starbucks has in the marketplace domestically and around the world. We have challenges, but we have the experience and the know-how to address them. And most importantly, we're taking the long -- we're playing the long game. We're making the investments ahead of the curve, and we are going to accelerate growth. And for those investors who had faith in us in 2008, I hope that you'll understand that the glass is clearly half full, and we are going to be back to where we always have been and that is delivering the kind of financial results that you've come to expect us from. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Howard. Yes, we're seeing very strong recovery across many of our international markets outside of China as restrictions are starting to lift around the world. I was just in Japan, Korea, which is our #3 and #4 markets globally and I can tell you, customers are back out. They're starting to return to their routines and they're starting to return to our stores. In many of our key markets, Japan, Korea, the UK, Mexico, our average store sales are actually higher than our pre-COVID averages. As you heard, our international markets had a strong rate of 23% when you exclude China. And we have strength across all the regions. So for example, in Latin America, where we just now -- we just achieved 1,500 stores, we had strong momentum at a system comp of more than 40% in Q2. In EMEA, our UK comps grew at 67%, representing the highest comping company-operated market in Q2 as traffic continues to come into Central London, metro areas, and we are increasing drive-thrus in that market at a significant rate. In Asia Pacific, year-over-year, our revenue grew more than 50% with Korea leading the way. And then in Japan, our third largest market globally, we had double-digit comps as customer engagement is increasing. And this is despite the fact that there was Omicron and lockdowns early in January and into February. And these markets are starting to ease restrictions, Korea just on Monday removed mask mandate, and so customers are coming back to our stores. So I'm excited about the growth potential in front of us as the recovery continues. Our licensed partners are seeing the strength of our brand. They're committed to investing in our brands and as evidenced by the store growth that we're seeing. And then we have tremendous runway for growth when you think about the opportunity with the digital flywheel, and we're working hard to expand that and to build loyalty and frequency with our global customers. So we expect the international momentum to continue as more and more markets start to relax restrictions and customers will come back to Starbucks."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks' performance in Q2 demonstrated strong customer demand across our portfolio despite continuing COVID headwinds. We delivered global revenue of $7.6 billion in Q2, up 15% from the prior year, a second quarter record. Our results were primarily driven by 18% revenue growth in the U.S. and stellar performance across our diverse global portfolio. We are particularly pleased with the strong results in light of the dynamic environment. Q2 consolidated operating margin contracted 300 basis points from the prior year to 13%, primarily due to inflation, which increased over the course of the quarter, significant investments in store partner wages and benefits and reduced traffic in China. The margin contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America. Q2 EPS was $0.59, declining 3% from the prior year, consistent with our expectations. I will now provide some segment highlights for Q2. North America delivered revenue of $5.4 billion in Q2, up 17% from the prior year and also a Q2 record, primarily driven by a 12% increase in comparable store sales comprised of a 7% increase in average ticket and a 5% increase in transactions. Strong performance of new stores over the past 12 months and the accelerated recovery of our licensed stores also contributed to this compelling level of revenue growth. U.S. comparable store sales were 12% despite significant store hour modifications in the early part of the quarter. The sustained momentum across our core platform and food attached, coupled with return of winter favorites and newer offerings such as the Pistachio Latte all contributed to these strong results. Our average ticket continued to grow, reaching an all-time high, driven by strategic beverage pricing and another record-breaking quarter of food attach with food sales increasing 25% from the prior year. We continue to engage with customers where and how they prefer, as our drive-thru windows, mobile order and delivery channels collectively accounted for 75% of U.S. company-operated sales in Q2. These convenient order channels and compelling product offerings cannot be easily replicated at home. Our customers continue to make Starbucks a part of their daily routine, fueling growth across all dayparts and drive- drive-thrus and cafes with specific strength in suburban and rural areas. Underpinning the enduring demand is our continued focus on digital customer engagement with Starbucks Rewards members delivering 54% of the revenue in our U.S. company-operated stores, the highest level of engagement on record, up 2 percentage points from the prior year. North America's operating margin was 17.2% in Q2, contracting 260 basis points from the prior year due to inflation, investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training as well as the lapping of prior year government subsidies. These margin headwinds were partially offset by pricing and sales leverage. Throughout the quarter, we executed our plan to offset near-term margin pressures by accelerating price increases, reducing spend in discretionary cost areas and activating throughput initiatives across our operations. These actions helped the company deliver Q2 profitability as planned despite higher-than-expected COVID isolation pay and ongoing inflationary headwinds, which increased considerably over the course of the quarter. Moving on to International. The segment delivered its highest second quarter revenue ever, reaching $1.7 billion, up 4% over the prior year despite the impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns in China. The growth was primarily driven by a 9% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and strong sales growth from our international licensees, including the conversion of our Korean market to a fully licensed business. Growth was partially offset by an 8% decline in comparable store sales, including a 3% decline attributable to the lapping prior year benefit as well as a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the VAT impact, international comparable store sales declined 5%. And excluding China, international comparable store sales increased meaningfully. Shifting to China. As you're aware, and as Belinda discussed, China continues to battle COVID resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns. Although China's comparable store sales improved sequentially in January, traffic lessened considerably in February and March as Omicron cases surged and lockdowns were implemented, leading to a comparable store sales decline of nearly 50% in the last week of March as we exited the quarter. As a result, second quarter comparable store sales declined 23% in the market or 20% excluding an impact of lapping the prior year VAT relief. At the end of Q2, roughly 1/3 of our stores in China remains temporarily closed or offered mobile ordering channels only. A sizable number of these stores were high-volume stores located in Tier 1 cities, including Shanghai, with the balance of active stores operating under elevated COVID safety protocols. Despite the considerable near-term headwinds, we remain focused on executing against our growth strategy in China. As Belinda shared, given our portfolio's healthy fundamentals, expanding digital footprint and record customer connection, coupled with vast opportunity ahead, we remain very optimistic for our future growth in China. Outside of China, the recovery of our international markets gained momentum across our global portfolio in Q2, with many of our licensed markets achieving record revenue levels in the quarter with revenue growth for the segment outside of China reaching 23%, once again demonstrating the underlying health of our business as mobility restrictions subside. Operating margins for the International segment was 13.1% in Q2, down 600 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by strategic and partner investments lapping higher prior year COVID relief, including government subsidies as well as higher product and distribution costs from sales mix shift, partially offset by sales leverage across the P&L. Strong performance of our international markets outside of China helped offset the significant sales deleverage in China. As the adverse impact from China lockdowns intensified in the last few weeks of Q2 and amplified further as we entered Q3, we expect China's results to continue to be a headwind throughout the current quarter. Moving on to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 25% to $463 million in Q2, primarily driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance as well as the strength in our international ready-to-drink business. The segment continued to amplify the Starbucks brand, led by the growth of our U.S. at-home coffee under the Global Coffee Alliance, which continued to see strong performance driven by Starbucks by Nespresso platform, fueled by the Vertuo line. We had exciting innovation launches in our ready-to-drink business, including Starbucks BAYA Energy in the U.S. and new chilled cup offerings in our international markets. The segment's operating margin was 42.7% in Q2, down 400 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to business mix shift driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance. Moving on to our guidance for the balance of our fiscal '22 year. Given the uncertainty around further mobility restrictions and lockdowns in China resulting from the government's strict zero-COVID policies as well as increasing inflationary headwinds, it's become increasingly difficult for us to predict the back half of the year with reasonable accuracy. Thus, as Howard mentioned, we believe the only responsible thing to do is to spend guidance for balance of this fiscal year. However, to provide additional insights, we believe our results for the balance of the year will be significantly pressured with heavier pressure in Q3. From a capital allocation perspective, although we suspended share repurchases for the balance of the fiscal year, we've returned more than $5 billion between share repurchases and our quarterly dividend during the first half of our fiscal year. We expect share repurchases made earlier in the year to contribute at least 1% to our FY '22 EPS growth. We will provide a comprehensive update on our business outlook and our capital allocation commitments for FY '23 and beyond at our Investor Day in September. However, as Howard mentioned, we are confident the investments we are making in our partners, our stores and our brand will deliver significant returns in excess of historical levels, resulting in accelerated long-term growth. To summarize, the 2 key takeaways from my prepared remarks today. Our Q2 performance underscores the strong customer demand across our business and around the world. We remain committed to the growth opportunity ahead in all channels and markets, creating and delivering exceptional value to all our stakeholders, our partners, our customers and our shareholders long into the future. Once again, the real credit for our success belongs to our green apron partners around the world who continue to go above and beyond to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience every day. That experience drove our growth and will continue to be the heart of our business as we reimagine the future of Starbucks together. With that, Howard, Belinda, Brady and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver, Michael Conway and Adam Brotman. Thank you. Operator? Sure. Hey, Andy, thanks for the question, it's Rachel. Our answer to that is, as we talked about in Q2, we saw inflationary pressures elevate in Q2 versus Q1. And that was related to a number of factors, some of them COVID-related. But as we've, seen going from Q2 and for the balance of the year, we're seeing increasing inflationary pressures across our supply chain, both in labor as well as freight and then across our commodities. And I would say it's pretty equal, half between commodities, half between our supply chain with freight being the bigger factor of the issues in the supply chain. So that's what we're seeing continue to elevate. Sure. Thanks, Jeffrey. So from an investment perspective, the more than 200 that Howard shared in his prepared remarks, that's in relation to -- we've already made investments this year, and that's incremental to the investments we've already committed to this year. So if you recall, we've already committed to investments on wage, some aspects of training as well as labor. In addition to that, we're having another round of investments on top of that that will be related to further wage investments, but also modernizing our training and our collaboration as well as celebrating coffee and coffee excellence as well as some equipment and other innovation in our stores to help with overall store productivity and improving our store operations. So the collective nature of that gets to about $1 billion in this year alone. Yes. And if I could just add to that, the decision we made around suspending our buybacks was related to FY '22. So we'll come back at Investor Day in September and provide a more comprehensive capital allocation strategy for '23 and beyond. So I think it's important to consider that when you think about the decision we made. I also would say just to punctuate Howard's point is that we have the opportunity as we've looked at the back half of this year. Remember that we've already repurchased $4 billion this year. And so we've been able -- between buybacks and dividends, returned about $5 billion to shareholders, so we've leveraged that as a way to create value. But as we look at the back half of this year and we look at the priority of our investments, what Howard talked about in his prepared remarks, investments in technology, investments in digital, investments in our stores, they all have an outsized return relative to what we could do with buybacks. Perfect example of that is you know very well our new stores and the return we see on our new stores. More recently, we've seen our new stores in U.S. have an ROI of about 55%. So we have a significant opportunity ahead of us as we think about really not only strengthening the business, but creating more value over the long term. And I think you'll see a lot more about that at Investor Day in September. Sure. I can speak to the more than $200 million that Howard shared in his prepared remarks is relative to FY '22. In terms of what we're expecting for FY '23 and FY '24, we have near-term pressure in our business, and that's between the pressure we're seeing in, with inflation as well as what we're seeing in China and then the investments we're choosing to make. But while we're seeing near-term pressure, we have line of sight to a very solid path of accelerated growth in the future. I'm excited to share that with you at Investor Day. So at Investor Day, we'll provide more about our business as well as our broader, more comprehensive capital allocation strategy for '23 and beyond. And if I could just add on the wage, the majority of the wage investments that Howard talked about, just specific to wage, were part of what we already committed to earlier this year. But in addition to that, as we've made the move on wage for the majority of our hourly partners, our baristas and we've also committed to addressing compression in tenure in its most recent move as well. So that will mean that every one of our partners will also have an increase this summer. That's right. Yes. Let me just speak to the more than $200 million that Howard addressed in his prepared remarks, is on top of the commitments we'd already made earlier this year are largely related to wage. So the combination of that is about $1 billion in this year alone. And so certainly, we'll have further investments that we'll make over time that we'll share with you at Investor Day. But I think it's important to remember that a little more than $200 million on top of the commitments we've already made, so it's a pretty big broad investment when you look at it from that perspective. And relative to margins, I think as Howard spoke about, we expect that some portion of inflation will essentially abate. In addition to that, I think what's really important and the pressure we're seeing in the back half of the year is that's largely pressure from what we're seeing in China and the amplification in Q3. And just to give you a perspective, what we're projecting for the balance of the year is that typically, what we typically see from China in terms of market contribution on OI will be half of what we typically expect. As the market returns and mobility increases, we know that the growth rhythm there is strong. We believe in the opportunity ahead, and that will also give us further opportunity as we think about that into the future. But I think when you think about those 2 aspects and the investments we're making today, that will return investments in retention, investments in recruiting, investments in our ability to make our store operations improve, that's going to lead to greater partner engagement. -- and partner engagement leads to better customer experience overall. We know that equation. It's worked for us for 50 years. It's going to be the key to what we deliver over the next 50 years, and it's critical to our growth. So I think the combination of all of that gives us line of sight to the fact that we firmly believe we'll be able to have a path to accelerated growth in the future, which we'll share with you at Investor Day."

            "name": "John Culver",
            "content": "Yes. Sharon, this is John. I think what we're seeing is that as we get our stores operating at full capacity and as we come through COVID early in the quarter, we have now increased hours of operation. And at the same time, also increase to full staffing levels in our stores and having all channels open. So we're getting a much better read on how our productivity is progressing. Clearly, we measure on drive-thru out the window time. Clearly, in the stores, we measure items sold per labor hour. And there are other measurements that, that we track as well. We watched all those things very closely. I think one of the things I would just also highlight on the investments we're making for the remainder of this year is a big investment on training for our partners. And one of the things that we heard loud and clear in these listening session and co-creation sessions was they wanted more training. And today, we offer about 23 hours of training to a new barista entering our stores, and we're going to push that 40 hours beginning the end of June, and that will significantly enhance their skill sets, make them more confident in preparing the beverages and ultimately, make them feel successful reducing overall complexity of doing the job and ultimately feeling successful. So ultimately, we do feel that will help increase productivity. But it's all about enhancing that partner experience giving them the tools that they need to be successful and making sure that we're investing in them. And then you've got the equipment aspect as well. We've got significant investments that we're making around the Mastrena machines, around the Merrychef ovens, around handheld order points for drive-thru and also the investments we're going to make on the cold beverage station to increase the capacity of the cold beverage work area for our partners going forward, which will help improve productivity as well. Yes. What we'll see is we'll see an investment from an expense standpoint on obviously, training, which I highlighted earlier, which we think will have significant positive impact for our partners and making them better prepared to do their jobs. Number two, the equipment investments, although those will be capitalized, they will also have some expense as we go through and do installations. When we do the renovations in the stores, that portion would be capitalized, although there will be some expectation to that as well. And then Howard and Rachel have touched on some of the digital investments we want to make in the stores not only for customers but for partners. And from a partner standpoint, it's all around automating the ordering system. We have automated ordering rolled out completely across the U.S. for our food and merchandise. We're in proof-of-concept testing right now for beverage items that are the remainder of the items, and we anticipate that, that will also be an unlock to help improve the partner experience to reduce complexity and to allow our partners to focus on our customers. And then the last thing I would just say as it relates to the productivity measures. We believe very strongly that as we've come through COVID, we experienced significant challenges on staffing stores. And as we progress through the quarter in Q2 and as COVID eased, staffing levels normalized, hours of operation began normalizing as well and all channels were open, productivity became coming back into the stores, and that was signified by the strong performance from a comp perspective that we saw in the quarter to deliver a 12% comp as well as see the increase of attach of food at record levels, signifies that our partners are doing heroic work to meet the demand of the customers and what they're seeing in their stores. And I just want to acknowledge all our partners across the U.S. for the tremendous job they're doing to exceed those expectations of our customers."

            "name": "Brady Brewer",
            "content": "Thank you, Belinda. Starbucks is one of the most sought-after brands in the world. And by engaging deeply with our customers over 50 years, we've amassed a treasure trove of assets, both physical and digital, just 1 example being the nearly 27 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. We're activating these unique brand assets as a catalyst to accelerate the future of Starbucks as a global brand and as a business. From our beginning, we've nurtured human connection and served a fundamental belief that coffee brings us together. We brought this to life in what we've called the third place, a place between home and work, where you could connect and feel a sense of belonging over coffee. Now we are extending the third place concept of Starbucks into a new kind of community. Emerging technologies associated with Web 3, and specifically NFTs, now enable this aspiration and allow us to extend who Starbucks has always been at our core. We are creating the digital third place.  To achieve this, we will broaden our framework of what it means for people to be a member of the Starbucks community, adding new concepts such as ownership and community-based membership models that we see developing in the Web 3 space. We will lead by aligning our initiatives with our sustainability commitments, making deliberate choices to build the community on environmentally sustainable Web 3 platforms. Imagine acquiring a new digital collectible from Starbucks, where that product also serves as your access pass to a global Starbucks community, one with engaging content experiences and collaboration all centered around coffee. This community will further strengthen the Starbucks brand, engage our partners and we expect it to be accretive to our business. Starbucks has the history of taking leading-edge technology and innovation and making it accessible and approachable to the mainstream. You've seen it with our digital experiences, whether it was introducing ability to pay with your phone, mobile order or even access WiFi long ago. Starbucks can serve as a bridge to the future for our nearly 100 million customer occasions per week around the world. We'll take our first step toward a digital third place and our broad vision for Web 3 with an anticipated launch in this year. This is just the beginning of an exciting future. Now I'll turn it over to Rachel. Hello, Jared. Yes. We're really looking at this and asking ourselves 3 questions. One is, on the foundation of the Starbucks Experience, which is us knowing our customers by name, knowing their favorite drink, we're asking ourselves, how can we do that in the digital space? Knowing every single customer, personalizing the experience and then making that experience absolutely effortless for the customer. Increasingly, that's what customers are seeking, an effortless, personalized human connection at Starbucks. And so we're seeing that play out in the drive-thru. We're seeing that in our delivery growth, as Howard mentioned, growing 30% year-over-year. And with MOP now 25% of our business, obviously, we're seeing that there. So it's about how does Starbucks unlock that magic connection? Which only Starbucks can between connection and convenience. And because we've been successful with that so far, that's why we're seeing customers adopt those channels so quickly and so holistically, but I'd say we're just getting started. Sure. So yes, I mean, I think on the tipping side of things, we're adding functionality throughout the year. We've got a lot of people working on this. As Howard said, it's one of the top requests. Currently, a customer can tip using the MLP experience, but we don't have the ability in many other parts of our store experience when a person is paying with a credit card, a stored value card or the app in our cafe and in the drive-thru. So that's what we anticipate working very quickly against to bring that functionality to our partners."

Before we dive into the quarter's results, I want to take a moment to reflect on the fact the world is now entering the third year of this pandemic and recognize that over this period, Starbucks has made significant progress driving our business recovery. The last two years have been anything but linear. Many parts of the world continue to experience significant COVID-related disruptions, including Starbucks' two lead markets, United States and China. However, through a dynamic and challenging environment, three things have remained true for Starbucks. First, global consumer demand for Starbucks is strengthening across our offerings and throughout all dayparts. This is a result of our work over the past year to expand digital customer relationships, introduce new beverage offerings, and provide a safe, familiar and convenient experience for our customers. Second, we remain unwavering in prioritizing the health and safety of our store partners and customers, even when the associated costs may create short-term earnings pressure. We have consistently provided best-in-class COVID benefits to our partners since this pandemic began. And third, the flexible operating protocols we established from the beginning of the pandemic continued to serve us well. The combination of these things has enabled us to adapt to near-term challenges while continuing to invest in what we know is a long-term opportunity for all stakeholders. Starbucks delivered record first quarter revenue of $8.1 billion, representing 19% growth. Global same-store sales grew 13%, demonstrating strong customer affinity for Starbucks. Demand for Starbucks continues to build, and we are fully committed to capitalizing on this momentum for the long-term. That said, while we have seen extraordinary top line growth, we've also experienced extraordinary cost pressure, which impacted our margin performance. As the Omicron variant began to quickly spread, it resulted in higher-than-anticipated costs in three key areas across our U.S. business, each of which impacted our results similarly. A highly transmissible Omicron variant amplified staffing shortages in our supply chain, resulting in higher-than-planned distribution and transportation costs. We also experienced a significant increase in our industry-leading COVID isolation pay for our partners, and we saw higher-than-anticipated costs from training and onboarding of new Starbucks partners. As we navigate the near-term challenges of this latest COVID variant, we remain confident in our ability to rapidly adapt while continuing to drive our long-term agenda of share gains, growth, and value creation. In our other lead market, China, the zero-COVID policy there contributed to significant disruption to store hours and transaction volume. Net new store growth and performance remained strong, yet overall revenue and profitability came in below expectations. While we believe that these dynamics are contemporary, we are focused on appropriately navigating the evolving macro dynamics and balancing long-term investments in the business. I'll now provide more insight into our Q1 results and the actions we are taking to address the current state of our business, industry, and overall economy while continuing to prioritize our partners and ensuring Starbucks delivers long-term profitable growth. In the U.S., we experienced very strong customer demand over the holiday season. Our ability to deliver the Starbucks Experience to our customers how, when, and where they want, resulted in first quarter revenue of $5.3 billion. Year-over-year revenue growth of 23% was driven by a double-digit increase in customer traffic, highlighting our compelling holiday lineup and strong in-store and digital customer connection throughout the holiday season. Customer demand increased through all dayparts and resulted in record Starbucks Card activations and reloads in excess of $3 billion. Starbucks Rewards grew 21% to a record 26.4 million 90-day active members. Average ticket grew mid-single digits, demonstrating our continued differentiation through customized premium beverages and compelling food options. Prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant, we were experiencing some inflationary pressures and staffing issues resulting from the broader pandemic. When the Omicron surge began, inflationary costs and staffing shortages were amplified well in excess of our expectations. As I mentioned, three primary factors: on inflation, COVID-related pay, and training and onboarding of new partners impacted our profitability to approximately the same degree, even while customer demand remained strong. Now, let me outline the impacts we believe these will have for the near-term and more importantly, the actions we are taking to address each of them. Like many others in the industry, we felt the impact of Omicron in the wider COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we experienced a rapid increase in supply chain costs related to distribution and transportation as our third-party delivery providers had Omicron-related staffing shortages, impacting their ability to fulfill a portion of our distribution needs. This required us to greatly increase the use of much more expensive spot market and alternative delivery solutions in order to meet strong customer demand. As a result, supply chain-driven inflationary costs were unexpectedly amplified by Omicron and rapidly accelerated in December, impacting our U.S. business by more than 170 basis points on margin in the quarter. As we entered fiscal year 2022, we had estimated full year inflationary impacts of around 200 basis points on margin. For the balance of the year, we expect these costs to increase versus our previous estimate. Like most economists, we anticipate supply chain disruptions will continue for the foreseeable future. We have already taken pricing actions this fiscal year, one in October 2021 and another in January 2022. And we have additional pricing actions planned through the balance of this year, which play an important role to mitigate cost pressures, including inflation, as we position our business for the future. There are many factors that contribute to our thoughtful pricing strategy, including: the increasing U.S. inflation rate currently running at 7% or perhaps greater as well as wage, customer demand, and other costs; second, the rapid spread of Omicron through the U.S. required us to quickly adapt store protocols. From our very beginning, and as we've demonstrated throughout this pandemic, Starbucks has always prioritized the health and wellness of our partners by offering some of the best benefits in the industry. This moment is no different. Our COVID vaccination pay has supported thousands of partners and the broader efforts in helping get more people vaccinated. And with the highly transmissible Omicron variant, we had more partners leverage our COVID isolation benefits as they were either home sick or home isolating after being exposed to the virus, which led to significantly higher COVID-related benefits paid than expected. We expect similar usage of COVID isolation and vaccination pay through this next quarter, moderating in the back half of fiscal 2022. Throughout this pandemic, COVID isolation pay has been a critically important partner benefit. To help offset the higher-than-expected expense of this benefit, we are taking the necessary measures to reduce spending in discretionary areas of our U.S. P&L. As an example, with strong customer demand, we believe we can tighten up a bit more in our G&A expenses, including promotional spend and marketing. We believe these measures are prudent as we work to balance increasing cost pressures with our commitment to our partners. Finally, with approximately 4 million Americans who have not yet returned to the workforce, nearly every business in the services industry is facing staffing challenges and increased turnover.  The battle for talent is notable. While Starbucks has always been committed to attracting and retaining the best partners with our differentiated pay and benefits package, we too experienced staffing issues. In response to this challenge and as an employer of choice, we hired an increasing number of new partners into our business this past quarter, which rapidly increased our training costs well above historic levels. This investment is critical to the success of our business as we work to create a great Starbucks Experience where partners feel supported and customers feel uplifted. We know from experience that the continued investments in our partners, both tenured and new, will continue to drive the levels of customer connection and overall productivity that support the long-term success and differentiation of our business. And we remain confident that the $1 billion investment in partner wages and hours that we announced on our fiscal 2021 Q4 call is the right long-term investment to ensure we have the very best talent to support our business.  In addition to these actions and as we highlighted on the last call, we continue to implement operational efficiencies throughout the organization to drive the productivity critical to our commitment to long-term margin expansion. In summary, the demand in our U.S. market is very strong, and we have tremendous opportunity for continued growth, as highlighted by our robust revenue results. As a leadership team, we hold ourselves accountable to the actions we have outlined to ensure our revenue growth is also reflected in our bottom line. To deliver compelling financial results to all Starbucks' stakeholders, we must continue to balance ongoing profitability with long-term investments. Turning to China. We continue to grow our store footprint in Q1 as we surpassed 5,500 stores in the market. This brings our global store footprint to a record 34,317 stores. It's important to note that our latest generation of new stores in China continued to perform well as best-in-class store profitability and return on investment were achieved. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members in China reached nearly 18 million, an increase of 2.6 million versus prior year, with members contributing 75% of sales. Mobility restrictions and the country's zero-COVID policy have presented significant headwinds, contributing to a minus 10% same-store comp after adjusting for the VAT subsidy from a year ago. We adhered to COVID health regulations and, as a result, experienced closures dynamic store protocols or reduced operations in 3/4 of our stores throughout China exiting Q1.  That said, our business in China continues to represent significant long-term growth. We are playing the long game as we navigate a dynamic environment. We are encouraged by the performance and growth in our digital offering as it drives new customer occasions and opens new channels of convenience.  Digital ordering continues to resonate with customers, growing to a Q1 record 38% of sales. Customer demand was evident across both the morning and afternoon dayparts. This coupled with our continued store expansion is a testament to the significant growth opportunity in the market. Through these challenges, however, our partners persevered and responded to ensure in-store safety by staffing health stations, taking temperatures and ensuring masks were worn by both partners and customers. Importantly, our customer connection scores were at an all-time high in the quarter. This is a testament to the resiliency of our partners and the strength of our brand, giving us confidence that as COVID-related restrictions eventually abate, our opportunity for growth in China remains as compelling as ever. Looking more broadly at the international markets outside of China, we saw strong results for the quarter. The broad portfolio of markets in our International segment, excluding China, delivered outstanding results this quarter, posting 27% revenue growth with strength across Europe, Latin America, Japan, Korea and broader Asia-Pacific. This illustrates the power of a diversified portfolio and gives us confidence in our global growth potential. Shifting from International, we continue to see impressive revenue growth from our Channel Development markets. And we are pleased with the continued performance of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9 as Starbucks at-home coffee continues to gain market share over the prior year, driven by Starbucks by Nespresso.  And through our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo, we recently announced our entrance into the energy category with Starbucks BAYA energy drink, a ready-to-drink beverage crafted from caffeine naturally found in coffee fruit as well as antioxidants to give consumers a feel-good boost. Energy drinks represent a rapidly growing category. We believe this new beverage differentiates us, opening up another category in the portfolio for growth. Before I turn the call over to Rachel, I want to highlight that this quarter's record top line performance in a uniquely challenging operating environment, along with the set of actions outlined above, gives us confidence in our growth at scale agenda. While quarterly results can be difficult to predict in this dynamic environment, our strong demand and operating flexibility throughout this pandemic have enabled us to build an even stronger, more resilient company. While we expect these complexities to persist through the near-term, Starbucks is well-positioned to adapt and continue to deliver great experiences for partners and customers. Consumer demand for Starbucks is strong across all markets and continues to grow. We will continue to balance appropriate levels of near-term profitability with the partner investments and innovations that drive customer loyalty and, in turn, long-term growth. For over two years now, and thanks to our partners, our business has emerged stronger after each wave of a COVID surge has peaked, and we expect this will be the case as Omicron runs its course. We have significant growth opportunities ahead and the investments we are making position Starbucks to continue capturing share in the fast-growing coffee addressable market while driving double-digit earnings growth over the long term.  With that, we are reiterating our fiscal 2022 guidance for revenue but believe it is prudent to revise margin and earnings guidance to reflect the cost pressures that were amplified by the Omicron variant. We view these as near-term pressures, and we have a clear set of actions to manage through this moment.  With that, I now turn the call over to Rachel to walk you through details of our Q1 results and fiscal 2022 guidance components. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q1 performance showcased the strength of the Starbucks brand underscored by strong customer demand despite intermittent COVID headwinds, which accelerated this quarter given the highly transmissible Omicron variant. At the same time, it also highlighted continued industry pressures and operational challenges, which we are actively addressing as Kevin highlighted moments ago. Starbucks delivered global revenue of $8.1 billion in the first quarter, up 19% from the prior year, setting a Q1 record, primarily driven by the exceptional holiday performance in the U.S., coupled with strong results from our global portfolio with remarkable breadth and depth despite continued mobility disruptions to our China operations impacted by the country's zero-COVID policy. Q1 consolidated operating margin contracted 30 basis points from the prior year to 15.1% due primarily to significant investments in store partner wages and benefits as well as inflation, partially offset by sales leverage and pricing in North America. Q1 EPS was $0.72, up 18% from the prior year reflecting strong revenue growth. However, it was lower than our expectations due primarily to our U.S. business, driven by the three key factors Kevin outlined: accelerated inflation, extended COVID-related pay and increased spend on new partner training and support costs. I will now provide some segment highlights for Q1. The North America segment delivered revenue of $5.7 billion in Q1, up 23% from the prior year, primarily driven by an 18% increase in comparable store sales, including a 12% increase in transactions and a 6% increase in average ticket. Two-year comp in this segment reached 12% for the quarter, representing the sixth quarter of sequential improvement and the highest two-year comp since the onset of the pandemic despite modified store hours across many regions. Our average ticket remained elevated even as group ordering continues to normalize, driven by pricing, record-breaking food attach, which had its seventh consecutive quarter at an all-time high and strong holiday performance. Our drive-through windows and mobile orders continued to account for approximately 70% of U.S. company-operated sales, offering our customers safe, convenient and personalized ways to engage with Starbucks. 53% of spend in our U.S. company-operated stores was generated by our Starbucks Rewards customer base with the 90-day active membership reaching 26.4 million, up 21% over the prior year, adding 1.6 million new active members in this quarter alone. North America\u2019s operating margin was 18.8% in Q1, up 10 basis points from the prior year as sales leverage, pricing, sourcing savings and the benefit of the North America trade area transformation were largely offset by investments in store partner wages, high inflation as well as increased spend on new partner training, onboarding and support costs to address labor market conditions. Moving on to International. In the International segment, we set a Q1 revenue record as the segment reached $1.9 billion, up 12% over the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by 9% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and strong sales growth from our international licensees, including the conversion of our Korea market to a fully licensed business. These increases were partially offset by 3% decrease in comparable store sales. Excluding a 3% decline attributable to lapping the prior year VAT benefit, the segment\u2019s comparable store sales were flat as reoccurring COVID resurgences severely hindered mobility and impacted our business in China, where the majority of stores were operating under elevated safety protocols and reduced store hours even as we exited the quarter. Reflecting the pandemic-related safety and mobility restrictions in China, the market\u2019s comparable store sales declined 14% in Q1, including a 4% decrease from lapping the prior year VAT release. However, we remain committed to and focused on our growth strategy in the market. As a result, we opened 197 net new stores and entered 16 new cities in the quarter in China, both record highs for any Q1 period. Additionally, our over 5,500 stores in the market remain committed to elevating the Starbucks Experience, setting operational records with our highest customer engagement scores in the quarter and lowest partner turnover in the last three years. Last month, we also expanded Starbucks Delivers to the Meituan platforms market-wide, partnering with China\u2019s leading e-commerce service provider to enhance the customer experience, continuing with our plan to grow our delivery business in the quarters to come. Outside of China, a number of our international markets across our global portfolio saw a sustained recovery in Q1, including Japan and the UK contributing meaningfully to our revenue growth. Operating margin for the International segment was 18.3% in Q1, down 170 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by investments in store partner wages and benefits and strategic initiatives as well as higher profit and distribution costs from a sales mix shift, partially offset by sales leverage. Moving on to Channel Development. Revenue grew 12% to $417 million in Q1, primarily driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance as well as the strength in our international ready-to-drink business. Based on IRI and Euromonitor data, Starbucks once again retained the number one brand position in both the U.S. at-home coffee and global ready-to-drink categories during the quarter, reinforcing customers\u2019 desire to replicate their Starbucks in-store experience and fulfill their Starbucks\u2019 taste profiles while at home or on the go. The segment operating margin was 43.9% in Q1, down 480 basis points from the prior year as our North American coffee partnership joint venture income declined due to supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures as well as business mix shifts. Moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2022. We reiterate our fiscal 2022 global comparable store sales growth guidance of high single digit and revenue guidance range of $32.5 billion to $33 billion. Considering meaningful margin headwinds that exist in this dynamic operating environment, with inflation at its highest level in decades, COVID-19 resurgences impacting our businesses globally and a continued industry-wide labor shortage, we believe it is prudent to revise both our fiscal 2022 operating margin and EPS guidance at this time. Based on the latest trends in our outlook, we anticipate over 200 basis points of incremental margin pressure in fiscal 2022 from inflation, COVID-related pay, new partner training and support costs as well as reduced sales from mobility restrictions combined. As Kevin outlined, however, we have and we will continue to take intentional steps to offset these pressures, including selectively accelerating price increases, tightly managing numerous cost areas as well as actioning throughput initiatives across our operations. We also believe there will be some moderation in staffing-related costs specifically related to training expenses as our partner investments begin to translate into higher retention. Collectively, the margin benefits from these actions are expected to nearly offset the anticipated margin pressure. In addition to these actions, we will continue to prioritize investments that will drive our growth over the long-term, including raising U.S. store partner wages as previously announced. As a result, we expect fiscal 2022 GAAP margin to approach 16.5% and non-GAAP margin to approach 17%. Moving on to EPS. Given our Q1 results and margin pressures expected in the balance of the year, our fiscal 2022 GAAP EPS is now expected to decline by a range of 4% to 6%. Additionally, we expect our fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% from the base of $3.10 in fiscal 2021 that excludes the extra week and is adjusted for the change in the non-GAAP treatment of certain integration costs. The EPS growth range reflects our Q1 results, accounts for the appropriate steps we are taking to manage and drive the business and account for the impacts of the three headwinds we\u2019ve discussed. In terms of quarterly margin and EPS cadence, we expect headwinds to intensify in Q2 as Omicron disruptions escalated in January. While the intensity throughout Q2 is unknown, we expect Q2 quarterly non-GAAP EPS and margins to be below prior year levels, with significant improvement in Q3 coming from our margin enhancement actions materializing. Q4 is then expected to show continued recovery but at a more gradual pace, inclusive of the summer step-up in wage investments as we raise the U.S. average store hourly wage to $17. Assuming no other significant impacts, including further impacts from COVID, we anticipate our EPS to return to double-digit growth in fiscal 2023 and beyond. All other full year 2022 guidance metrics, including global net new store count, CapEx, interest expense and tax rates are unchanged from what we previously communicated on our fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Despite the unexpected global impacts of Omicron or other potential variant resurgences, we remain confident in delivering outstanding top line growth in fiscal 2022, enabled by incredible customer demand, our diversified portfolio and continued ability to deliver the valuable human connection to our customers in a safe, convenient and consistent manner. We also continue to stand by our commitment to return $20 billion to our shareholders over the next three years and have returned more than $4 billion in Q1 between share repurchases and our quarterly dividend. Finally, given the dynamic operating environment and the incremental cost pressures reflected in our fiscal 2022 guidance, we now expect year-on-year margin improvement in fiscal 2023 with a return to the long-term target of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2024. Of course, all of these estimates presume no new material business disruptions, whether from the pandemic or the broader economy. Although our efforts to adapt to the evolving market conditions may take longer than initially anticipated, our long-term growth model remains intact, guided by the belief that the success of our company starts with investing in our partners, which ultimately creates value for customers and for all Starbucks\u2019 stakeholders, including our shareholders. In closing, the three key points summarizing my prepared remarks are: first, Q1 demonstrated our strong revenue growth and the resilience of our brand while also highlighting margin pressures, which we are addressing through purposeful actions; second, given the evolving macro and operating environment, we are revising our margin and EPS outlook for fiscal 2022 while reaffirming strong top line growth; and finally, we remain committed to our long-term growth model. As always, credit for our success today and tomorrow belongs to our passionate Starbucks partners around the world who deliver a safe, authentic and personalized Starbucks Experience to our customers with care and commitment. Our partners have our greatest respect and appreciation. With that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver, Michael Conway and Leo Tsoi. Thank you. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. A question on the operating margin guidance for both this year and the out years. It sounds like this year, you\u2019re now saying approaching 17% on a non-GAAP basis. But now not getting back to the 18% to 19% until fiscal 2024, albeit I guess, still growing in fiscal 2023 off of the 17%. So, I just want to make sure I understood that correctly. And if you could then prioritize the initiatives to return to that 18% to 19%, I know you had previously mentioned labor investment should drive sales, which would be critical. And then you had a variety of cost saving initiatives and ultimately, pricing would be there to backstop. I just want to make sure we have that prioritization right in terms of the biggest buckets that give you the confidence getting back to that 18% to 19%. Thank you.\nRachel Ruggeri: This is Rachel. Thank you for the question. How I\u2019d start would say, as we look at FY2022, based on what we saw in Q1 and what we\u2019re guiding for the balance of the year, we think approaching 17%, the better gauge of our margin has allowed us to \u2013 as we\u2019re seeing, we saw cost pressures accelerate in December, and we\u2019re seeing those intensify as we noted in January and into Q2. Now we\u2019ll take action against those costs but it will take us a little bit of time. And so, for that reason, we believe it\u2019s prudent for us to guide approaching 17%. With that, as we exit FY2022 and as we enter FY2023, we\u2019ll now see a lower margin \u2013 a slightly lower margin than what we had originally guided. And as a result of that, we\u2019re continuing to look at ways to drive sales, as you outlined. That is our biggest opportunity for us to be able to drive margin and to grow earnings in the future. So, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our business in the areas that are going to drive sales both in this year as in FY2023. We\u2019ll also continue to focus on the areas this year and into next year that will help us continue the momentum that we\u2019re seeing. So, sales is by and large, our biggest opportunity. In addition to that, as we\u2019ve outlined, we\u2019ll continue to take pricing while we balance pricing decisions and actions with our demand. And so that will be another big opportunity for us as we continue to grow. And then we\u2019ll continue to find efficiencies in our business. As we\u2019ve outlined, we\u2019ve been working on efficiencies related to productivity that will help support this year and it will also expand into FY2023. We certainly have opportunity as we think about, from a tailwind perspective, as we see recovery both in China as well as in our U.S. business and as we continue to further the efficiencies focusing on. But broadly, I would say sales, by and large, is going to be our continued opportunity for our growth not only this year but into FY2023. So hopefully, that gives you a perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJared Garber: Hi, thanks for the question. Wanted to follow up on the previous question a little bit as it relates to margins. Rachel or Kevin, could you help frame maybe some of the pricing actions that you\u2019ve taken? And what maybe you still have left in the chamber, so to speak, to help offset some of these pricing \u2013 or some of these inflationary pressures? And what are you seeing on the demand side as it relates to sort of elasticity of demand with these pricing actions going through in the last couple of months and then what you\u2019re looking at going forward? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: Yes, Jared, this is Kevin. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ve commented before, we have a very sophisticated approach to pricing that leverages analytics, artificial intelligence, and it\u2019s overseen by a very talented team who do the modeling and look at the elasticity of demand along with the pricing actions on an ongoing basis. I think we mentioned some of the pricing actions we took both in October and January. I\u2019ll hand to John here in a second to talk through those in the U.S., but with those pricing actions, we still saw incredibly strong demand through the holiday season. But John, let me hand to you to go through the specifics.\nJohn Culver: Yes, Jared, thanks for your question. Our pricing strategy, as Kevin has shared and Rachel as well, is driven by several factors such as inflation rates, partner investments, the infrastructure investments that we want to make, and then obviously, the investments we want to make on continuing the innovation pipeline. We do all those things while balancing the premium value for our customers and the experience we want to provide them. As we saw inflation begin to increase in the middle of this past year, we made the decision to take pricing and we implemented pricing effective October 1. As inflation continued to grow, we saw that. We needed to take additional action and we did so effective January 1. So, we\u2019ve taken two moves around pricing to help mitigate the challenges that we\u2019re seeing. Now we also have additional pricing action that we have planned for the balance of the year that will additionally help offset the trends and some of the cost pressures that we\u2019re seeing. And as Kevin highlighted, that\u2019s being informed by the analytics and insight team. In terms of elasticity, we have not seen any meaningful impact to customer demand. To the contrary, our customer demand continues to grow. We\u2019re coming off of a very strong quarter in terms of transaction growth at 12% for the quarter in the U.S., the highest since pre-pandemic levels, and our ticket is also very strong as well. So we watch that very closely and we will adjust accordingly.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thanks. A question for John or Leo. Obviously, the China sales environment has been challenging, and you guys are not immune to it despite some pretty impressive gains in the digital and loyalty strategies. China development remains robust and on track for the year, but just curious what would it take for you to reconsider China development plans to slow down openings and focus more intensely on improving the same-store sales? Thanks.\nKevin Johnson: Leo, why don\u2019t you take that one?\nLeo Tsoi: Certainly. Hi, Andrew. First of all, I want to say Happy New Year to everyone. This is the second year \u2013 second day of our Chinese New Year here in China. Now your question on the store opening and the development, what I\u2019d like to say is that we have actually opened more than 1,200 stores in the past two years, and most of them we actually opened during the pandemic. This is equivalent to more than one-fifth of our portfolio, which is larger than many of the other retailers in the market for years. And what is more, as Kevin just mentioned, we have been able, all these new stores to achieve the best-in-class profitability and returns. And this goes to show the huge market potential that we are here to unlock. And so when you see this entire development, it is important to note that 70% of our growth actually in China is driven by our new store openings, and I\u2019ll say, will continue to drive and leverage the opportunity here as we see in this market development. And simply put, the three strategies that we\u2019ve been working on is proven. Number one is to go wide to add them into more [indiscernible] cities. Second is to go deeper by bringing a rich and diversified stock portfolios that curate new coffee experience to our customers. And third, as the pandemic is coming back and with a resurgence, we continue to be go smarter to leverage the power of our data analytics and also to drive our store economics, including our store footprint so that we can operate in these markets. And I have \u2013 I must say that I\u2019ve been in this market for more than 10 years. What I\u2019m seeing is we are really in the early stages of these markets. And as we go wide, go deep and go smarter, actually, our opening is actually helping us to build our success for the long-term. Thank you, Andrew.\nKevin Johnson: And I\u2019ll just reinforce the key point that Leo made is as we continue to build these net new stores, they\u2019re performing at best-in-class store profitability and return on investment. And as long as we keep delivering best-in-class profitability, return on investment, we\u2019re going to continue to lean in on building new stores and play the long game. In your question, Andrew, is what would cause us to rethink that, the answer would be if we saw revenue and return on investment not meeting that hurdle rate that we feel comfortable with, we would reevaluate. But right now, it's amazing. Through this pandemic, as Leo mentioned, as we go wider and deeper in our new store development, they are performing extremely well. And so we're going to continue to lean in.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSara Senatore: I wanted to ask about the U.S. same-store sales number. And first of all, did you see any impact on the top line with the advent of Omicron? I know you mentioned cost, of course, but a lot of the industry did see a dampening effect on comps in the back half of December. And then on a related note, you're seeing transaction growth when most restaurants still are not. So maybe could you talk a bit about what's happening? Is it coming in your urban markets? Does it have different regional footprint? Just trying to understand how your traffic might be recovering in a way that the rest of the industry doesn't seem to be? Thanks.\nJohn Culver: Yes. Sara, thanks for the question. Yes, we did see an Omicron impact especially amplify in the last two to three weeks of the quarter. And it played out in a couple of ways, obviously, in terms of as the cases surged, number one, customer mobility was impacted. But then also, we saw our partners also have a similar surge in the number of cases as well as call-outs, which Kevin spoke to and Rachel spoke to in terms of the Omicron COVID pay or the COVID pay that we provide our partners. Now with that, we also were in the midst of having a record holiday quarter and couldn't be more proud of the work that the team did in terms of delivering very strong top line growth of 23% in a very, very complex environment. In terms of what we're seeing in terms of the transactions and the growth of transactions, there is a pent-up demand for Starbucks and for people wanting and longing to return to their normalized routine. So a couple of things that I would just call out. First, the beverage attach that we're seeing in the stores continues to normalize. We've seen strong beverage mix growth across, in particular, cold beverages, which now account for 70% \u2013 over 70% of our beverage transactions. We've also seen strength in alt-dairy and the growth of alt-dairy and then also an increase in the modifier performance, whether it was the holiday beverage or the overall promotion that we saw, very strong growth. Food continues to grow and break all-time records in the quarter, and really, that's being driven by breakfast and by bakery. The other thing I would just add is that our peak transactions improved versus the prior quarter and a year-over-year basis. And then we had strong growth on the digital side. We now surpassed 26 million 90-day active members. And as part of that, our non-SR customer transactions continued to grow and reached its highest level since the pre-pandemic. In terms of the stores and where we saw traction in that, the suburban and the rural stores, where drive-thrus are the most prevalent, continue to outpace the rest of the portfolio. Our drive-thrus had its fourth straight quarter of double-digit comp growth. The central business district, the urban core and the urban edge recovery also continues, and it was the third quarter in a row of positive comps for all three of those urbanities. And then the convenience channels continue to play a big role. Between MOP, drive-thru and delivery, that accounted for over 70% of our sales in the quarter. So very encouraged with the strong customer demand and the way in which our partners really were able to meet the needs of our customers and step up under very, very challenging circumstances.\nKevin Johnson: And Sara, I would just add to everything John just said, what we've seen too is following each COVID wave, we've seen customer demand strengthen. And we anticipate that's going to happen following Omicron as well. But John and his team have done a fantastic job navigating this place, and I think he did a great job outlining the actions that we've taken that have driven that result.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Glass: Hi, thank you very much. Going back to productivity, what have you learned from this experience in terms of the ability to start to reduce store hours, to reduce menu items and complexity? And does that play a role in your productivity, that is to say, reducing some of those things? Or is that antithetical to your goal of driving sales?\nKevin Johnson: Yes. Thanks for the question, John. I'll just comment briefly and then I'll hand it over to John to take into some more detail. But certainly, we have learned to be very, very adaptable throughout this pandemic. And so certainly, when these COVID waves hit, we know how to adapt store protocols, store hours, if we need to consolidate partners in one store and temporarily close a store, we do that. If we need to amplify certain channels like drive-thru or mobile for pickup, we do that. So we've become very adaptable. And I think one of the things that's helped us is also see the opportunities for us to drive productivity gains certainly as we look to the future. And both are very important, how we adapt to COVID but also how we simplify the work in our stores and bring solutions that give us productivity while, at the same time, it improves the partner and the customer experience. And John, I'll let you just talk a little bit about the details of some things you guys are working on.\nJohn Culver: Yes. This is an area, John, that the team is laser focused on. And clearly, it starts with taking action to reduce the complexity of the work in our stores for our partners to meet the demand of our customers. And we've shared previous calls the work that we've got going on around automated ordering. That continues to be put in place to reduce those manual routines of our partners. We continue to make investments in improved functionality for our equipment and better flow-through of that equipment in terms of what it's able to produce, whether that's the measuring of two machines, whether that's the warming ovens or whether that's our cold brew system, and then also at the same time, always assessing our beverage routines, ways in which we can build beverages, become more effective and more productive in building those beverages and drive better productivity. And then lastly, in terms of eliminating low-volume SKUs, we have taken action to eliminate and reduce low-volume SKUs. We did that during the first surge of COVID where we ran into some of the supply chain challenges. We took action to pull some of the low-volume food items out of the stores, and we have not had a meaningful impact to overall sales revenue. So productivity plays a key role for us going forward, and it's an area that we're laser focused on.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nLauren Silberman: Thanks for the question. So on membership, so rewards membership up 21% in the quarter, U.S. traffic, 12%, so active rewards member growth has been faster than traffic, which I think is something we've seen over the past couple of quarters. Can you talk about the dynamics of that difference? And then you previously talked about members spending 2x to 3x more once they join the program. Does that still hold with the newer cohorts that are coming into the program? And if so, how long does it take for those new members to move along that maturity curve?\nJohn Culver: Okay. Thank you very much, Lauren. As I shared, we added and grew our active memberships 21% in the quarter and we now exceed 26 million active members. We added five million active 90-day members on a year-over-year basis. So Starbucks Rewards now represents 53% of the spend in our stores, which is at an all-time high and which is a three-point increase versus fiscal \u2013 Q1 fiscal 2021. As part of that, their growth in terms of spend has grown commensurately. We're seeing significant increase in the spend in the first year of membership versus the prior 12 months of the preceding membership. We're seeing a strong lift in spend when they join, regardless of whether the customer is high or low frequency. And Rewards members, as you shared, are spending at an elevated rate and visit our stores at a 3x frequency rate versus our nonmembers. So we're going to continue, as a company, to double down in this area, and we see it as significant upside and presenting tremendous value to meet the need states of our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good afternoon. My questions on the turnover in the U.S, it seems like that might have surprised you in the most recent quarter, given your commentary about training costs and onboarding new partners. So I guess that\u2019s a trend maybe we haven\u2019t heard from others. So I wanted to understand kind of what you think drove that spike in turnover if you had one, and why you think that might ease as the year goes on here.\nJohn Culver: Yes, David, I\u2019ll take that question. And clearly, it\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re in a constrained labor environment broadly across the country. In particular, foodservice is one of the most heavily impacted in terms of finding available labor and staffing the needs of a business. Our turnover rates, I would say, as we track them, they were and have been elevated versus our pre-COVID levels. But what we\u2019ve done with the actions that we\u2019ve taken as we emerged out of the quarter, we\u2019re beginning to see that turnover rate stabilize. And basically, our hourly turnover rate has basically flattened over the course of the last several weeks. In addition to that, we\u2019ve also seen a significant uptick in terms of partner sentiment, which is improving as well. So for us, we are an employer of choice. We\u2019re going to continue to make the right investments in our partners, whether that has to do with wage, whether that has to do with benefits or just really giving them the opportunity to grow with the company. And we feel very confident that we\u2019re going to come out of this in a much stronger place, given the actions that we\u2019ve taken. But clearly, it is a challenging environment. We\u2019ve had to adjust our labor models and adjust store hours to address it. And we\u2019ve been able to navigate it thus far, and we have confidence that we\u2019ll continue to be able to navigate that.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Barish with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Barish: Yes, good afternoon. Rachel, I was just trying to understand a little bit more on the kind of 200 basis points of other inflation and how that\u2019s changed or different from what you were talking about kind of going into this year on the prior guide.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure, and I believe you\u2019re referring to the 200 basis points that maybe Kevin addressed in his prepared remarks. There\u2019s a couple of ways I\u2019d look at the 200 that we had is in Kevin\u2019s prepared remarks, we talked about nearly 200 basis points, the majority of that was inflationary pressures as we began FY2022. So as you recall, we had expected to have elevated cost pressures going into FY2022 related to the decisions we made around wage but also the inflationary pressures, both in freight and labor across our supply chain and across and through our commodities. What we\u2019ve seen, those costs have actually, as we\u2019ve outlined, accelerated in December and have intensified, really largely related to Omicron into January. So when we talk about the back half of the year having another 200 basis points of headwinds, the lion\u2019s share of that is really inflationary pressures related to Omicron that we saw in December and that we\u2019re seeing further in Q2. That also includes the COVID-related pay as well as training. As we get through Q2 and when Omicron subsides, I don\u2019t know exactly when that will happen, but as it does, we would expect that our inflationary pressures related to Omicron would lessen in terms of the impact on margin. But overall, our inflationary pressures in FY2022 will remain elevated relative to FY2021.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to get back to the discussion on U.S. traffic because it looks to us that U.S. same-store traffic is still down double digits from the first quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2021, and despite at least what you said last quarter, a record number of discrete customers, obviously, a record number of MSR members. So I wonder like what the big kind of addressable buckets in your opinion there is to kind of re-attract the frequency of your previous customer base is kind of the first point. And secondly, is there anything that you can do with the direct communication functions around MSR, the personalization, what have you to really step on the gas for that program to get back your overall store visitation levels back to the levels it was in 2019 or fiscal first quarter of 2020, whatever you want to call it?\nJohn Culver: Yes, John, just as it relates to the transactions that you mentioned, we are focused on getting back to those levels. A couple of things that are impacting it is obviously, the way in which our stores are set up and how customers are being mobile or not going to work and not having their normal routines. Now we did see on the good side, a positive side, return of the breakfast daypart and peak transactions, which gives us optimism for hope in terms of growing those transactions during that period. In addition, I would say that we\u2019re going to continue to leverage the convenience channels of Mobile Order & Pay as well as drive-through and delivery to meet the changing customer needs to drive transaction growth going forward as well. And then lastly, I would say that we will continue to assess the store footprint to make sure that we are building new stores and relocating additional stores \u2013 existing stores into the areas where customers are, given the pandemic and the changes that have occurred in the pandemic. And Starbucks Rewards is going to play a significant role in that as part of that growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Just a follow-up on John\u2019s with regard to on-premise traffic, it\u2019s obviously been weak across all U.S. restaurants. Could you talk about your on-premise traffic per store and how that compares to pre-COVID? And looking at that gap, how much of that do you think is going to be an easy sales win as soon as consumers become more comfortable with regard to COVID? And how much do you think might be a lingering change just due to behaviors shifting longer-term? Thanks.\nJohn Culver: Yes. I think that what we see \u2013 well, I know what we\u2019ve seen is that as we\u2019ve had to adjust store operating protocols, in some cases, we\u2019ve gone to pickup-only, we\u2019ve gone to drive-thru-only and we\u2019ve readjusted the format. So the ability for customers to come into the stores and to sit in the store is not at the level of capacity than it was back prior to COVID. This is an area that we\u2019re continuing to focus on in adjusting and reopening the stores fully, number one, as we\u2019re able to, given COVID, and number two, as we\u2019re able to, given some of the staffing challenges that we\u2019ve seen. So we continue to adjust and monitor this very closely and make decisions on a daily basis. Now in terms of customers and their changing routines and how much is going to go back to where it was before and how much has changed, we feel confident that given the Starbucks Experience, our customers come to us because they love a great premium experience in a high quality cup of coffee. And whether it is coming in our stores or coming through the convenience channels, we\u2019re going to continue to grow in all those areas and meet the change whatever it is for our customers going forward in terms of their routines.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Johnson for closing remarks.\nKevin Johnson: Well, thank you all for joining us today. I hope you get a sense of three things: number one, this holiday period, we saw strong customer demand; number two, with the cost pressures we\u2019re facing, we\u2019re being proactive in a set of actions that we\u2019re taking across the company, including pricing and tightening up in other discretionary cost areas to address this. And certainly, as we\u2019ve seen in post \u2013 in the past COVID surges, that when those surges end, we see stronger demand return from what we saw even before that COVID spike, and we anticipate that to happen with Omicron. So we thank you all for joining us today, and we\u2019re looking forward to having you also join our Annual Meeting of Shareholders in March. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks first quarter fiscal year 2022 conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Leo Tsoi",
            "content": "Certainly. Hi, Andrew. First of all, I want to say Happy New Year to everyone. This is the second year \u2013 second day of our Chinese New Year here in China. Now your question on the store opening and the development, what I'd like to say is that we have actually opened more than 1,200 stores in the past two years, and most of them we actually opened during the pandemic. This is equivalent to more than one-fifth of our portfolio, which is larger than many of the other retailers in the market for years. And what is more, as Kevin just mentioned, we have been able, all these new stores to achieve the best-in-class profitability and returns. And this goes to show the huge market potential that we are here to unlock. And so when you see this entire development, it is important to note that 70% of our growth actually in China is driven by our new store openings, and I'll say, will continue to drive and leverage the opportunity here as we see in this market development. And simply put, the three strategies that we've been working on is proven. Number one is to go wide to add them into more [indiscernible] cities. Second is to go deeper by bringing a rich and diversified stock portfolios that curate new coffee experience to our customers. And third, as the pandemic is coming back and with a resurgence, we continue to be go smarter to leverage the power of our data analytics and also to drive our store economics, including our store footprint so that we can operate in these markets. And I have \u2013 I must say that I've been in this market for more than 10 years. What I'm seeing is we are really in the early stages of these markets. And as we go wide, go deep and go smarter, actually, our opening is actually helping us to build our success for the long-term. Thank you, Andrew."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "John Culver",
            "content": "Yes, Jared, thanks for your question. Our pricing strategy, as Kevin has shared and Rachel as well, is driven by several factors such as inflation rates, partner investments, the infrastructure investments that we want to make, and then obviously, the investments we want to make on continuing the innovation pipeline. We do all those things while balancing the premium value for our customers and the experience we want to provide them. As we saw inflation begin to increase in the middle of this past year, we made the decision to take pricing and we implemented pricing effective October 1. As inflation continued to grow, we saw that. We needed to take additional action and we did so effective January 1. So, we've taken two moves around pricing to help mitigate the challenges that we're seeing. Now we also have additional pricing action that we have planned for the balance of the year that will additionally help offset the trends and some of the cost pressures that we're seeing. And as Kevin highlighted, that's being informed by the analytics and insight team. In terms of elasticity, we have not seen any meaningful impact to customer demand. To the contrary, our customer demand continues to grow. We're coming off of a very strong quarter in terms of transaction growth at 12% for the quarter in the U.S., the highest since pre-pandemic levels, and our ticket is also very strong as well. So we watch that very closely and we will adjust accordingly. Yes. Sara, thanks for the question. Yes, we did see an Omicron impact especially amplify in the last two to three weeks of the quarter. And it played out in a couple of ways, obviously, in terms of as the cases surged, number one, customer mobility was impacted. But then also, we saw our partners also have a similar surge in the number of cases as well as call-outs, which Kevin spoke to and Rachel spoke to in terms of the Omicron COVID pay or the COVID pay that we provide our partners. Now with that, we also were in the midst of having a record holiday quarter and couldn't be more proud of the work that the team did in terms of delivering very strong top line growth of 23% in a very, very complex environment. In terms of what we're seeing in terms of the transactions and the growth of transactions, there is a pent-up demand for Starbucks and for people wanting and longing to return to their normalized routine. So a couple of things that I would just call out. First, the beverage attach that we're seeing in the stores continues to normalize. We've seen strong beverage mix growth across, in particular, cold beverages, which now account for 70% \u2013 over 70% of our beverage transactions. We've also seen strength in alt-dairy and the growth of alt-dairy and then also an increase in the modifier performance, whether it was the holiday beverage or the overall promotion that we saw, very strong growth. Food continues to grow and break all-time records in the quarter, and really, that's being driven by breakfast and by bakery. The other thing I would just add is that our peak transactions improved versus the prior quarter and a year-over-year basis. And then we had strong growth on the digital side. We now surpassed 26 million 90-day active members. And as part of that, our non-SR customer transactions continued to grow and reached its highest level since the pre-pandemic. In terms of the stores and where we saw traction in that, the suburban and the rural stores, where drive-thrus are the most prevalent, continue to outpace the rest of the portfolio. Our drive-thrus had its fourth straight quarter of double-digit comp growth. The central business district, the urban core and the urban edge recovery also continues, and it was the third quarter in a row of positive comps for all three of those urbanities. And then the convenience channels continue to play a big role. Between MOP, drive-thru and delivery, that accounted for over 70% of our sales in the quarter. So very encouraged with the strong customer demand and the way in which our partners really were able to meet the needs of our customers and step up under very, very challenging circumstances. Yes. This is an area, John, that the team is laser focused on. And clearly, it starts with taking action to reduce the complexity of the work in our stores for our partners to meet the demand of our customers. And we've shared previous calls the work that we've got going on around automated ordering. That continues to be put in place to reduce those manual routines of our partners. We continue to make investments in improved functionality for our equipment and better flow-through of that equipment in terms of what it's able to produce, whether that's the measuring of two machines, whether that's the warming ovens or whether that's our cold brew system, and then also at the same time, always assessing our beverage routines, ways in which we can build beverages, become more effective and more productive in building those beverages and drive better productivity. And then lastly, in terms of eliminating low-volume SKUs, we have taken action to eliminate and reduce low-volume SKUs. We did that during the first surge of COVID where we ran into some of the supply chain challenges. We took action to pull some of the low-volume food items out of the stores, and we have not had a meaningful impact to overall sales revenue. So productivity plays a key role for us going forward, and it's an area that we're laser focused on. Okay. Thank you very much, Lauren. As I shared, we added and grew our active memberships 21% in the quarter and we now exceed 26 million active members. We added five million active 90-day members on a year-over-year basis. So Starbucks Rewards now represents 53% of the spend in our stores, which is at an all-time high and which is a three-point increase versus fiscal \u2013 Q1 fiscal 2021. As part of that, their growth in terms of spend has grown commensurately.

            "name": "Kevin Johnson",
            "content": "Thank you, Tiffany, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. Before we dive into the quarter's results, I want to take a moment to reflect on the fact the world is now entering the third year of this pandemic and recognize that over this period, Starbucks has made significant progress driving our business recovery. The last two years have been anything but linear. Many parts of the world continue to experience significant COVID-related disruptions, including Starbucks' two lead markets, United States and China. However, through a dynamic and challenging environment, three things have remained true for Starbucks. First, global consumer demand for Starbucks is strengthening across our offerings and throughout all dayparts. This is a result of our work over the past year to expand digital customer relationships, introduce new beverage offerings, and provide a safe, familiar and convenient experience for our customers. Second, we remain unwavering in prioritizing the health and safety of our store partners and customers, even when the associated costs may create short-term earnings pressure. We have consistently provided best-in-class COVID benefits to our partners since this pandemic began. And third, the flexible operating protocols we established from the beginning of the pandemic continued to serve us well. The combination of these things has enabled us to adapt to near-term challenges while continuing to invest in what we know is a long-term opportunity for all stakeholders. Starbucks delivered record first quarter revenue of $8.1 billion, representing 19% growth. Global same-store sales grew 13%, demonstrating strong customer affinity for Starbucks. Demand for Starbucks continues to build, and we are fully committed to capitalizing on this momentum for the long-term. That said, while we have seen extraordinary top line growth, we've also experienced extraordinary cost pressure, which impacted our margin performance. As the Omicron variant began to quickly spread, it resulted in higher-than-anticipated costs in three key areas across our U.S. business, each of which impacted our results similarly. A highly transmissible Omicron variant amplified staffing shortages in our supply chain, resulting in higher-than-planned distribution and transportation costs. We also experienced a significant increase in our industry-leading COVID isolation pay for our partners, and we saw higher-than-anticipated costs from training and onboarding of new Starbucks partners. As we navigate the near-term challenges of this latest COVID variant, we remain confident in our ability to rapidly adapt while continuing to drive our long-term agenda of share gains, growth, and value creation. In our other lead market, China, the zero-COVID policy there contributed to significant disruption to store hours and transaction volume. Net new store growth and performance remained strong, yet overall revenue and profitability came in below expectations. While we believe that these dynamics are contemporary, we are focused on appropriately navigating the evolving macro dynamics and balancing long-term investments in the business. I'll now provide more insight into our Q1 results and the actions we are taking to address the current state of our business, industry, and overall economy while continuing to prioritize our partners and ensuring Starbucks delivers long-term profitable growth. In the U.S., we experienced very strong customer demand over the holiday season. Our ability to deliver the Starbucks Experience to our customers how, when, and where they want, resulted in first quarter revenue of $5.3 billion. Year-over-year revenue growth of 23% was driven by a double-digit increase in customer traffic, highlighting our compelling holiday lineup and strong in-store and digital customer connection throughout the holiday season. Customer demand increased through all dayparts and resulted in record Starbucks Card activations and reloads in excess of $3 billion. Starbucks Rewards grew 21% to a record 26.4 million 90-day active members. Average ticket grew mid-single digits, demonstrating our continued differentiation through customized premium beverages and compelling food options. Prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant, we were experiencing some inflationary pressures and staffing issues resulting from the broader pandemic. When the Omicron surge began, inflationary costs and staffing shortages were amplified well in excess of our expectations. As I mentioned, three primary factors: on inflation, COVID-related pay, and training and onboarding of new partners impacted our profitability to approximately the same degree, even while customer demand remained strong. Now, let me outline the impacts we believe these will have for the near-term and more importantly, the actions we are taking to address each of them. Like many others in the industry, we felt the impact of Omicron in the wider COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we experienced a rapid increase in supply chain costs related to distribution and transportation as our third-party delivery providers had Omicron-related staffing shortages, impacting their ability to fulfill a portion of our distribution needs. This required us to greatly increase the use of much more expensive spot market and alternative delivery solutions in order to meet strong customer demand. As a result, supply chain-driven inflationary costs were unexpectedly amplified by Omicron and rapidly accelerated in December, impacting our U.S. business by more than 170 basis points on margin in the quarter. As we entered fiscal year 2022, we had estimated full year inflationary impacts of around 200 basis points on margin. For the balance of the year, we expect these costs to increase versus our previous estimate. Like most economists, we anticipate supply chain disruptions will continue for the foreseeable future. We have already taken pricing actions this fiscal year, one in October 2021 and another in January 2022. And we have additional pricing actions planned through the balance of this year, which play an important role to mitigate cost pressures, including inflation, as we position our business for the future. There are many factors that contribute to our thoughtful pricing strategy, including: the increasing U.S. inflation rate currently running at 7% or perhaps greater as well as wage, customer demand, and other costs; second, the rapid spread of Omicron through the U.S. required us to quickly adapt store protocols. From our very beginning, and as we've demonstrated throughout this pandemic, Starbucks has always prioritized the health and wellness of our partners by offering some of the best benefits in the industry. This moment is no different. Our COVID vaccination pay has supported thousands of partners and the broader efforts in helping get more people vaccinated. And with the highly transmissible Omicron variant, we had more partners leverage our COVID isolation benefits as they were either home sick or home isolating after being exposed to the virus, which led to significantly higher COVID-related benefits paid than expected. We expect similar usage of COVID isolation and vaccination pay through this next quarter, moderating in the back half of fiscal 2022. Throughout this pandemic, COVID isolation pay has been a critically important partner benefit. To help offset the higher-than-expected expense of this benefit, we are taking the necessary measures to reduce spending in discretionary areas of our U.S. P&L. As an example, with strong customer demand, we believe we can tighten up a bit more in our G&A expenses, including promotional spend and marketing. We believe these measures are prudent as we work to balance increasing cost pressures with our commitment to our partners. Finally, with approximately 4 million Americans who have not yet returned to the workforce, nearly every business in the services industry is facing staffing challenges and increased turnover.  The battle for talent is notable. While Starbucks has always been committed to attracting and retaining the best partners with our differentiated pay and benefits package, we too experienced staffing issues. In response to this challenge and as an employer of choice, we hired an increasing number of new partners into our business this past quarter, which rapidly increased our training costs well above historic levels. This investment is critical to the success of our business as we work to create a great Starbucks Experience where partners feel supported and customers feel uplifted. We know from experience that the continued investments in our partners, both tenured and new, will continue to drive the levels of customer connection and overall productivity that support the long-term success and differentiation of our business. And we remain confident that the $1 billion investment in partner wages and hours that we announced on our fiscal 2021 Q4 call is the right long-term investment to ensure we have the very best talent to support our business.  In addition to these actions and as we highlighted on the last call, we continue to implement operational efficiencies throughout the organization to drive the productivity critical to our commitment to long-term margin expansion. In summary, the demand in our U.S. market is very strong, and we have tremendous opportunity for continued growth, as highlighted by our robust revenue results. As a leadership team, we hold ourselves accountable to the actions we have outlined to ensure our revenue growth is also reflected in our bottom line. To deliver compelling financial results to all Starbucks' stakeholders, we must continue to balance ongoing profitability with long-term investments. Turning to China. We continue to grow our store footprint in Q1 as we surpassed 5,500 stores in the market. This brings our global store footprint to a record 34,317 stores. It's important to note that our latest generation of new stores in China continued to perform well as best-in-class store profitability and return on investment were achieved. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members in China reached nearly 18 million, an increase of 2.6 million versus prior year, with members contributing 75% of sales. Mobility restrictions and the country's zero-COVID policy have presented significant headwinds, contributing to a minus 10% same-store comp after adjusting for the VAT subsidy from a year ago. We adhered to COVID health regulations and, as a result, experienced closures dynamic store protocols or reduced operations in 3/4 of our stores throughout China exiting Q1.  That said, our business in China continues to represent significant long-term growth. We are playing the long game as we navigate a dynamic environment. We are encouraged by the performance and growth in our digital offering as it drives new customer occasions and opens new channels of convenience.  Digital ordering continues to resonate with customers, growing to a Q1 record 38% of sales. Customer demand was evident across both the morning and afternoon dayparts. This coupled with our continued store expansion is a testament to the significant growth opportunity in the market. Through these challenges, however, our partners persevered and responded to ensure in-store safety by staffing health stations, taking temperatures and ensuring masks were worn by both partners and customers. Importantly, our customer connection scores were at an all-time high in the quarter. This is a testament to the resiliency of our partners and the strength of our brand, giving us confidence that as COVID-related restrictions eventually abate, our opportunity for growth in China remains as compelling as ever. Looking more broadly at the international markets outside of China, we saw strong results for the quarter. The broad portfolio of markets in our International segment, excluding China, delivered outstanding results this quarter, posting 27% revenue growth with strength across Europe, Latin America, Japan, Korea and broader Asia-Pacific. This illustrates the power of a diversified portfolio and gives us confidence in our global growth potential. Shifting from International, we continue to see impressive revenue growth from our Channel Development markets. And we are pleased with the continued performance of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle\u0301 as Starbucks at-home coffee continues to gain market share over the prior year, driven by Starbucks by Nespresso.  And through our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo, we recently announced our entrance into the energy category with Starbucks BAYA energy drink, a ready-to-drink beverage crafted from caffeine naturally found in coffee fruit as well as antioxidants to give consumers a feel-good boost. Energy drinks represent a rapidly growing category. We believe this new beverage differentiates us, opening up another category in the portfolio for growth. Before I turn the call over to Rachel, I want to highlight that this quarter's record top line performance in a uniquely challenging operating environment, along with the set of actions outlined above, gives us confidence in our growth at scale agenda. While quarterly results can be difficult to predict in this dynamic environment, our strong demand and operating flexibility throughout this pandemic have enabled us to build an even stronger, more resilient company. While we expect these complexities to persist through the near-term, Starbucks is well-positioned to adapt and continue to deliver great experiences for partners and customers. Consumer demand for Starbucks is strong across all markets and continues to grow. We will continue to balance appropriate levels of near-term profitability with the partner investments and innovations that drive customer loyalty and, in turn, long-term growth. For over two years now, and thanks to our partners, our business has emerged stronger after each wave of a COVID surge has peaked, and we expect this will be the case as Omicron runs its course. We have significant growth opportunities ahead and the investments we are making position Starbucks to continue capturing share in the fast-growing coffee addressable market while driving double-digit earnings growth over the long term.  With that, we are reiterating our fiscal 2022 guidance for revenue but believe it is prudent to revise margin and earnings guidance to reflect the cost pressures that were amplified by the Omicron variant. We view these as near-term pressures, and we have a clear set of actions to manage through this moment.  With that, I now turn the call over to Rachel to walk you through details of our Q1 results and fiscal 2022 guidance components. Rachel? Yes, Jared, this is Kevin. Thanks for the question. I've commented before, we have a very sophisticated approach to pricing that leverages analytics, artificial intelligence, and it's overseen by a very talented team who do the modeling and look at the elasticity of demand along with the pricing actions on an ongoing basis. I think we mentioned some of the pricing actions we took both in October and January. I'll hand to John here in a second to talk through those in the U.S., but with those pricing actions, we still saw incredibly strong demand through the holiday season. But John, let me hand to you to go through the specifics. Leo, why don't you take that one? And I'll just reinforce the key point that Leo made is as we continue to build these net new stores, they're performing at best-in-class store profitability and return on investment. And as long as we keep delivering best-in-class profitability, return on investment, we're going to continue to lean in on building new stores and play the long game. In your question, Andrew, is what would cause us to rethink that, the answer would be if we saw revenue and return on investment not meeting that hurdle rate that we feel comfortable with, we would reevaluate. But right now, it's amazing. Through this pandemic, as Leo mentioned, as we go wider and deeper in our new store development, they are performing extremely well. And so we're going to continue to lean in. And Sara, I would just add to everything John just said, what we've seen too is following each COVID wave, we've seen customer demand strengthen. And we anticipate that's going to happen following Omicron as well. But John and his team have done a fantastic job navigating this place, and I think he did a great job outlining the actions that we've taken that have driven that result. Yes. Thanks for the question, John. I'll just comment briefly and then I'll hand it over to John to take into some more detail. But certainly, we have learned to be very, very adaptable throughout this pandemic. And so certainly, when these COVID waves hit, we know how to adapt store protocols, store hours, if we need to consolidate partners in one store and temporarily close a store, we do that. If we need to amplify certain channels like drive-thru or mobile for pickup, we do that. So we've become very adaptable. And I think one of the things that's helped us is also see the opportunities for us to drive productivity gains certainly as we look to the future. And both are very important, how we adapt to COVID but also how we simplify the work in our stores and bring solutions that give us productivity while, at the same time, it improves the partner and the customer experience. And John, I'll let you just talk a little bit about the details of some things you guys are working on. Well, thank you all for joining us today. I hope you get a sense of three things: number one, this holiday period, we saw strong customer demand; number two, with the cost pressures we're facing, we're being proactive in a set of actions that we're taking across the company, including pricing and tightening up in other discretionary cost areas to address this. And certainly, as we've seen in post \u2013 in the past COVID surges, that when those surges end, we see stronger demand return from what we saw even before that COVID spike, and we anticipate that to happen with Omicron. So we thank you all for joining us today, and we're looking forward to having you also join our Annual Meeting of Shareholders in March. Thank you, everybody."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q1 performance showcased the strength of the Starbucks brand underscored by strong customer demand despite intermittent COVID headwinds, which accelerated this quarter given the highly transmissible Omicron variant. At the same time, it also highlighted continued industry pressures and operational challenges, which we are actively addressing as Kevin highlighted moments ago. Starbucks delivered global revenue of $8.1 billion in the first quarter, up 19% from the prior year, setting a Q1 record, primarily driven by the exceptional holiday performance in the U.S., coupled with strong results from our global portfolio with remarkable breadth and depth despite continued mobility disruptions to our China operations impacted by the country's zero-COVID policy. Q1 consolidated operating margin contracted 30 basis points from the prior year to 15.1% due primarily to significant investments in store partner wages and benefits as well as inflation, partially offset by sales leverage and pricing in North America. Q1 EPS was $0.72, up 18% from the prior year reflecting strong revenue growth. However, it was lower than our expectations due primarily to our U.S. business, driven by the three key factors Kevin outlined: accelerated inflation, extended COVID-related pay and increased spend on new partner training and support costs. I will now provide some segment highlights for Q1. The North America segment delivered revenue of $5.7 billion in Q1, up 23% from the prior year, primarily driven by an 18% increase in comparable store sales, including a 12% increase in transactions and a 6% increase in average ticket. Two-year comp in this segment reached 12% for the quarter, representing the sixth quarter of sequential improvement and the highest two-year comp since the onset of the pandemic despite modified store hours across many regions. Our average ticket remained elevated even as group ordering continues to normalize, driven by pricing, record-breaking food attach, which had its seventh consecutive quarter at an all-time high and strong holiday performance. Our drive-through windows and mobile orders continued to account for approximately 70% of U.S. company-operated sales, offering our customers safe, convenient and personalized ways to engage with Starbucks. 53% of spend in our U.S. company-operated stores was generated by our Starbucks Rewards customer base with the 90-day active membership reaching 26.4 million, up 21% over the prior year, adding 1.6 million new active members in this quarter alone. North America's operating margin was 18.8% in Q1, up 10 basis points from the prior year as sales leverage, pricing, sourcing savings and the benefit of the North America trade area transformation were largely offset by investments in store partner wages, high inflation as well as increased spend on new partner training, onboarding and support costs to address labor market conditions. Moving on to International. In the International segment, we set a Q1 revenue record as the segment reached $1.9 billion, up 12% over the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by 9% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and strong sales growth from our international licensees, including the conversion of our Korea market to a fully licensed business. These increases were partially offset by 3% decrease in comparable store sales. Excluding a 3% decline attributable to lapping the prior year VAT benefit, the segment's comparable store sales were flat as reoccurring COVID resurgences severely hindered mobility and impacted our business in China, where the majority of stores were operating under elevated safety protocols and reduced store hours even as we exited the quarter. Reflecting the pandemic-related safety and mobility restrictions in China, the market's comparable store sales declined 14% in Q1, including a 4% decrease from lapping the prior year VAT release. However, we remain committed to and focused on our growth strategy in the market. As a result, we opened 197 net new stores and entered 16 new cities in the quarter in China, both record highs for any Q1 period. Additionally, our over 5,500 stores in the market remain committed to elevating the Starbucks Experience, setting operational records with our highest customer engagement scores in the quarter and lowest partner turnover in the last three years. Last month, we also expanded Starbucks Delivers to the Meituan platforms market-wide, partnering with China's leading e-commerce service provider to enhance the customer experience, continuing with our plan to grow our delivery business in the quarters to come. Outside of China, a number of our international markets across our global portfolio saw a sustained recovery in Q1, including Japan and the UK contributing meaningfully to our revenue growth. Operating margin for the International segment was 18.3% in Q1, down 170 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by investments in store partner wages and benefits and strategic initiatives as well as higher profit and distribution costs from a sales mix shift, partially offset by sales leverage. Moving on to Channel Development. Revenue grew 12% to $417 million in Q1, primarily driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance as well as the strength in our international ready-to-drink business. Based on IRI and Euromonitor data, Starbucks once again retained the number one brand position in both the U.S. at-home coffee and global ready-to-drink categories during the quarter, reinforcing customers' desire to replicate their Starbucks in-store experience and fulfill their Starbucks' taste profiles while at home or on the go. The segment operating margin was 43.9% in Q1, down 480 basis points from the prior year as our North American coffee partnership joint venture income declined due to supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures as well as business mix shifts. Moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2022. We reiterate our fiscal 2022 global comparable store sales growth guidance of high single digit and revenue guidance range of $32.5 billion to $33 billion. Considering meaningful margin headwinds that exist in this dynamic operating environment, with inflation at its highest level in decades, COVID-19 resurgences impacting our businesses globally and a continued industry-wide labor shortage, we believe it is prudent to revise both our fiscal 2022 operating margin and EPS guidance at this time. Based on the latest trends in our outlook, we anticipate over 200 basis points of incremental margin pressure in fiscal 2022 from inflation, COVID-related pay, new partner training and support costs as well as reduced sales from mobility restrictions combined. As Kevin outlined, however, we have and we will continue to take intentional steps to offset these pressures, including selectively accelerating price increases, tightly managing numerous cost areas as well as actioning throughput initiatives across our operations. We also believe there will be some moderation in staffing-related costs specifically related to training expenses as our partner investments begin to translate into higher retention. Collectively, the margin benefits from these actions are expected to nearly offset the anticipated margin pressure. In addition to these actions, we will continue to prioritize investments that will drive our growth over the long-term, including raising U.S. store partner wages as previously announced. As a result, we expect fiscal 2022 GAAP margin to approach 16.5% and non-GAAP margin to approach 17%. Moving on to EPS. Given our Q1 results and margin pressures expected in the balance of the year, our fiscal 2022 GAAP EPS is now expected to decline by a range of 4% to 6%. Additionally, we expect our fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% from the base of $3.10 in fiscal 2021 that excludes the extra week and is adjusted for the change in the non-GAAP treatment of certain integration costs. The EPS growth range reflects our Q1 results, accounts for the appropriate steps we are taking to manage and drive the business and account for the impacts of the three headwinds we've discussed. In terms of quarterly margin and EPS cadence, we expect headwinds to intensify in Q2 as Omicron disruptions escalated in January. While the intensity throughout Q2 is unknown, we expect Q2 quarterly non-GAAP EPS and margins to be below prior year levels, with significant improvement in Q3 coming from our margin enhancement actions materializing. Q4 is then expected to show continued recovery but at a more gradual pace, inclusive of the summer step-up in wage investments as we raise the U.S. average store hourly wage to $17. Assuming no other significant impacts, including further impacts from COVID, we anticipate our EPS to return to double-digit growth in fiscal 2023 and beyond. All other full year 2022 guidance metrics, including global net new store count, CapEx, interest expense and tax rates are unchanged from what we previously communicated on our fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Despite the unexpected global impacts of Omicron or other potential variant resurgences, we remain confident in delivering outstanding top line growth in fiscal 2022, enabled by incredible customer demand, our diversified portfolio and continued ability to deliver the valuable human connection to our customers in a safe, convenient and consistent manner. We also continue to stand by our commitment to return $20 billion to our shareholders over the next three years and have returned more than $4 billion in Q1 between share repurchases and our quarterly dividend. Finally, given the dynamic operating environment and the incremental cost pressures reflected in our fiscal 2022 guidance, we now expect year-on-year margin improvement in fiscal 2023 with a return to the long-term target of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2024. Of course, all of these estimates presume no new material business disruptions, whether from the pandemic or the broader economy. Although our efforts to adapt to the evolving market conditions may take longer than initially anticipated, our long-term growth model remains intact, guided by the belief that the success of our company starts with investing in our partners, which ultimately creates value for customers and for all Starbucks' stakeholders, including our shareholders. In closing, the three key points summarizing my prepared remarks are: first, Q1 demonstrated our strong revenue growth and the resilience of our brand while also highlighting margin pressures, which we are addressing through purposeful actions; second, given the evolving macro and operating environment, we are revising our margin and EPS outlook for fiscal 2022 while reaffirming strong top line growth; and finally, we remain committed to our long-term growth model. As always, credit for our success today and tomorrow belongs to our passionate Starbucks partners around the world who deliver a safe, authentic and personalized Starbucks Experience to our customers with care and commitment. Our partners have our greatest respect and appreciation. With that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver, Michael Conway and Leo Tsoi. Thank you. Operator? This is Rachel. Thank you for the question. How I'd start would say, as we look at FY2022, based on what we saw in Q1 and what we're guiding for the balance of the year, we think approaching 17%, the better gauge of our margin has allowed us to \u2013 as we're seeing, we saw cost pressures accelerate in December, and we're seeing those intensify as we noted in January and into Q2. Now we'll take action against those costs but it will take us a little bit of time. And so, for that reason, we believe it's prudent for us to guide approaching 17%. With that, as we exit FY2022 and as we enter FY2023, we'll now see a lower margin \u2013 a slightly lower margin than what we had originally guided. And as a result of that, we're continuing to look at ways to drive sales, as you outlined. That is our biggest opportunity for us to be able to drive margin and to grow earnings in the future. So, we'll continue to invest in our business in the areas that are going to drive sales both in this year as in FY2023. We'll also continue to focus on the areas this year and into next year that will help us continue the momentum that we're seeing. So, sales is by and large, our biggest opportunity. In addition to that, as we've outlined, we'll continue to take pricing while we balance pricing decisions and actions with our demand. And so that will be another big opportunity for us as we continue to grow. And then we'll continue to find efficiencies in our business. As we've outlined, we've been working on efficiencies related to productivity that will help support this year and it will also expand into FY2023. We certainly have opportunity as we think about, from a tailwind perspective, as we see recovery both in China as well as in our U.S. business and as we continue to further the efficiencies focusing on. But broadly, I would say sales, by and large, is going to be our continued opportunity for our growth not only this year but into FY2023. So hopefully, that gives you a perspective. Sure, and I believe you're referring to the 200 basis points that maybe Kevin addressed in his prepared remarks. There's a couple of ways I'd look at the 200 that we had is in Kevin's prepared remarks, we talked about nearly 200 basis points, the majority of that was inflationary pressures as we began FY2022. So as you recall, we had expected to have elevated cost pressures going into FY2022 related to the decisions we made around wage but also the inflationary pressures, both in freight and labor across our supply chain and across and through our commodities. What we've seen, those costs have actually, as we've outlined, accelerated in December and have intensified, really largely related to Omicron into January. So when we talk about the back half of the year having another 200 basis points of headwinds, the lion's share of that is really inflationary pressures related to Omicron that we saw in December and that we're seeing further in Q2. That also includes the COVID-related pay as well as training. As we get through Q2 and when Omicron subsides, I don't know exactly when that will happen, but as it does, we would expect that our inflationary pressures related to Omicron would lessen in terms of the impact on margin. But overall, our inflationary pressures in FY2022 will remain elevated relative to FY2021."

Welcome to Starbucks' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you in advance to those who will join us this afternoon where we will share an update on our long-term strategies and celebrate the launch of a holiday at Starbucks. Before we get started this morning, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to our Starbucks partners around the world for a very successful fiscal year 2023. I've learned through connecting with so many of you how our reinvention plan has continued to be well executed, giving us great momentum in this age of our transformation at Starbucks. I have discovered how our brand is uniquely delivered in our stores and digitally through our extraordinary partners and the tremendous headroom we see for our global business. Turning now to our business performance. Rachel and I will share details of our strong results delivered in the quarter and fiscal year 2023, and we will also share our confidence in the company's long-term opportunity with guidance for fiscal year 2024. What you will take away from this call today is that we have great momentum, fueled largely by our reinvention plan. We are seeing the work pay off through improved partner and customer experiences, as well as captured improvements in efficiency and margin. We believe this bodes well for this next year and for years beyond. To deliver our long-term sustainable growth, we are focused on five areas. You will hear more on what we call our triple shot reinvention and our continued momentum this afternoon. The discussion will provide a more detailed outlook on our three core and two enabling priority areas. First, we will elevate the brand through our stores. Second, we will strengthen and scale in digital. Third, we will become truly global. Fourth, we will unlock efficiencies, including outside stock. Finally, we will reinvigorate the partner culture at Starbucks. In the fourth quarter, our total company revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, representing an 11% increase year-over-year. Full-year revenue reached a record of $36 billion, representing 12% growth year-over-year for fiscal 2023, or 14% when excluding the 2% impact of foreign currency translation, aligning our revenue growth at the high end of our guidance range. Equally impressive, our global comparable store sales increased 8% year-over-year, both for the quarter and the fiscal year 2023, driven by a healthy mix of ticket and transaction growth. We grew earnings per share by 31% to $1.06 for the quarter and by $0.20 to $3.54 for the fiscal year, again, aligning to the top end of our guidance range. Importantly, we grew margin by 310 basis points for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points on a full-year basis. And we did all this while growing our global store count to over 38,000, in line with our store growth guidance of 7% in fiscal year 2023. Demand for Starbucks remains strong around the world. Here in the U.S., our largest market, we saw momentum sustain throughout the quarter. Revenue for the quarter was up a record 12%, underpinned by 8% comps. We had a remarkable fall launch that led to record-breaking average weekly sales. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members reached a new record this quarter of nearly 33 million 90-day active members, and setting records in spend per member and total member spend. Customers remain loyal to their favorite four menu classics that have stood the test of time, including the Pumpkin Spice Latte, which celebrated its 20th anniversary. In addition to very strong performance in our core offerings, we also have strong performance with new offerings, including our Apple-inspired beverages and food items. The results from the quarter, including the dynamic way we are driving ticket growth, give us great confidence in our menu innovation on both an individual product overall portfolio level. We have proven that complementary yet competing products and flavors can successfully coexist, such as pumpkin and Apple, with the right menu innovation, marketing mix, and strategic pricing strategies. As customer demands have evolved, we've delivered more beverages, food, and personalization and customization across existing and new formats to meet their expectations and grow the business. Our continued investments in our partners, equipment, supply chain, and technology are paying off, evidenced by a margin expansion across North America to 23.2% this past quarter. Timed with our busiest cold foam promotion of the year, the recent rollout of our new portable cold foamers to all U.S. company-operated stores, enhanced productivity in the fourth quarter. and lessened the trade on our partners, while continuing to meet the high cold beverage demand. In support of the continued growth in cold beverages, we delivered over 550 new Nugget ice machines and remained on track with installation prioritized for our most ice-constrained stores in fiscal year 2024. Clover Vertica, our on-demand single-cup brewer, is now installed in over 600 of our stores across the U.S., and we continue the on-schedule rollout of the Siren System cold and food stations, prioritizing new stores and renovation locations. Our portfolio and pipeline management of new equipment design and rollout plans are robust and enabled us to deliver our results. We have created a more stable environment in our stores. Hours per partner increased in the quarter by 5% as we continue filing schedules that fit our partners and customers' needs. Total was down in the fourth quarter by 10%, while barista tenure increased by 16% for the quarter. Customer connection scores also improved in the quarter relative to this time last year. We did all of this by investing over 20% of this year's profits back into our partners and stores through wages, training, equipment, and new store growth. All this is further evidence that our strategy is working. Turning to International. In the fourth quarter, we saw record store growth of nearly 600 stores across the segment, with International store count remaining higher than that of the U.S. We also experienced record double-digit revenue growth internationally in the quarter, with continued growth on every key market around the world. Our comparable same-store sales in our company-operated markets for both the U.K. and Japan remained well above historical averages in fiscal year 2023, with growth attributed to higher profitability and higher productivity store formats, as well as elevated digital and partner experiences. We saw strong customer demand for our beverage and food offerings around the world with record global demand for our pumpkin platform. And in our international license markets, Starbucks Rewards programs grew by 4 million 90-day active members, now contributing to 30% of total sales, up 9 percentage points in just one year, driven by the growth for Starbucks Digital Solutions. Supported by our strong brand globally, outside of China, our International segment is well ahead of the growth pace we indicated at last year's Investor Day, with focused growth in our company-operated markets and motivated business partners powering our licensed stores. Turning to China. We were pleased with our performance in the quarter. delivering revenue growth of 8% from the prior year or up 15% when excluding approximately 6% impact of foreign currency translation. This has further supported by a comp of 5% squarely in line with our expectations. Full-year revenue grew to $3 billion, up 3% from the prior year or up 11% excluding approximately 8% impact foreign currency translation with comp of 2%. Our performance in China improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter, with revenue in the second half of the year 20% higher than the first half, reflecting our growth momentum. These results underscore the strength of beverage and food offerings, the success of our market strategies, and the powerful execution unleashed by our partners in China as we capture the abundant opportunities in front of us. We continue to see strength from coffee-forward innovations, delighting our customers with locally relevant product innovation like the Moose Espresso and the smaller-sized Intenso range, a first in the world. We're also seeing higher food sales with tremendous headroom in this area, driving both transaction and ticket opportunities. In Q4, we saw continued momentum across the omnichannel experiences of Starbucks in China with strength in store through Mobile Order & Pay, Mobile Order Delivery, E-commerce, and in channels. China now has over 21 million active loyalty members, representing 22% year-over-year growth, with many members skewing younger to build our next generation of customers. In the quarter, we opened a record 326 net new purpose-driven stores in China, reaching 13% net new store growth over the prior year to over 6,800 stores at the end of fiscal year 2023. The outstanding financial returns of new stores give us confidence we will reach our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025, opening nearly 1,000 net new stores every year. Finally, the September opening of the China Coffee Innovation Park, designed to be our most energy-efficient and sustainable coffee manufacturing and distribution center in the world, further signaled our commitment to the largest consumer market in the world and the growth of our business in China for China. We look forward to sharing more on the headroom we see in China later today. The momentum against the backdrop of headwinds in China this past year gives us optimism in our position and affirm our distinctive competitive advantages for our business. These advantages include our uplifting partners, including our China leadership team, our distinctive stores, our vertically integrated and highly digitized efficient operations, and our relevant innovation. We will maintain our leading position in the premium market as we continue to grow in scale across our current portfolio and through new tiers of cities in this growing market of coffee drinkers. Finally, our channel business continues to elevate the Starbucks brand around the world at home and on the go, creating Starbucks moments for consumers outside of our retail stores. We're the number one ready-to-drink brand around the world. Notably, in the fourth quarter, we celebrated our five-year partnership with the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. This Nestl\u00e9 relationship, which includes We Proudly Serve Food service locations as well as additional partnerships, such as our Nova Mera channel partnership with PepsiCo and international partners like Tingyi and Arla have helped us grow our customer touch points, and is now in nearly 90 markets around the world. For fiscal year 2023, we saw notable growth in our leading channel market position as well as accretive brand equity as we continue to be recognized for our innovation. Some notable accolades include awards in China Ready Select, in the Europe, Middle East, Africa multiserve business as well as achieving 1 billion in servings in Korea and selling out of Grab & Go in Japan. In closing, while navigating an environment of unprecedented volatility throughout fiscal year 2023, we finished our fourth quarter and full year strong delivering on our guidance. Our reinvention is moving ahead of schedule, fueling revenue growth, efficiency and margin expansion. Notably, we continue to see the positive impact of our reinvention on our partner and customer experiences, proof points that we can continue to innovate, grow, and strengthen our business while creating value for all. Looking ahead, we remain fully optimistic about our headroom across the U.S. and internationally, and we see limitless possibilities across all areas of the business. While the global business environment remains uncertain, we are confident in our ability to adapt and innovate to meet evolving consumer needs. We will continue to invest in our partners to expand upon our reinvention and to deliver on our sustainability and social impact initiatives, all while driving long-term growth. We feel very good about the business momentum for next year, the continued strength of the brand, and the opportunity for growth in the years ahead. I look forward to sharing greater detail around these strategies for growth with you later this afternoon. Our performance this past year and the plans ahead give us great confidence in the multiple paths we have in front of us to achieve our long-term results. I will now hand the call over to Rachel to walk you through further details of the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results, as well as our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing you this afternoon. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri : Thank you, Laxman, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our strong Q4 and full fiscal year 2023 performance, which delivered on our full-year guidance shared at the 2022 Investor Day. Our fiscal year 2023 double-digit earnings growth was a direct result of both double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion, as our focus and disciplined execution of our reinvention delivered tangible financial results. Our Q4 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, up 9% from the prior year or up 12% when excluding a 1% impact of foreign currency translation. As Laxman mentioned, the U.S. business delivered strong performance with record-breaking average weekly sales from an overwhelmingly successful fall launch, and our International business was also strong, with China performing in line with our expectations. Combined, this resulted in our consolidated comparable store sales growth of 8% and net new company-operated store growth of 7% globally over the prior year, as well as sustained momentum in our global licensed markets. Q4 consolidated operating margin expanded 310 basis points from the prior year to 18.2%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by increased efficiency throughout our U.S. stores as our strong execution on reinvention amplified results even greater than we anticipated, coupled with sales leverage and pricing. Margin expansion continued to be partially offset by our investments in store partners as well as higher G&A costs and support of reinvention. Q4 EPS was $1.06, up 31% from the prior year, driven by strong performance across our segments, especially the U.S., as its results were bolstered by the amplified success of our reinvention. For fiscal year 2023, our consolidated revenue reached a record $36 billion, up 12% from the prior year or up 14% when excluding approximately two percentage impact of foreign currency translation. Consistent with our guidance, our revenue growth included 8% comparable store growth and 7% net new company-operated store growth over prior year, as well as ongoing contributions from our global licensed store businesses. Our fiscal year 2023 consolidated op margin was 16.1%, up 100 basis points versus prior year. And EPS of $3.54 was up 20% over prior year. above our recent guidance of 16% to 17%. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q4. North America delivered another quarter of record revenue with $6.9 billion in Q4, up 12% from the prior year, driven by a combination of an 8% increase in comparable store sales, consisting of 6% and 2% growth in average ticket and transactions, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% over the prior year and contributions from our licensed store business, which continues to benefit from increased travel. When considering growth from all stores, comp new and licensed, we were pleased to see more than two-thirds of our growth came from transactions, mix, attach, and customization, which we collectively call demand. Our U.S. business delivered 8% comparable store sales growth in Q4, primarily driven by strong ticket performance with 6% comp growth, which benefited from volume, mix, attach, customization, and pricing. Our customers continue to favor more premium beverages, creating a new normal as it relates to mix and customization. To fuel this, we continue to lean in with innovation, offering our Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte, which boosted tea cells; as well as Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam, which become a customization favorite with our customers. In addition to our beverage success, we also had another record quarter of food attached, driven by both our core breakfast sandwiches and promotional items, such as our Baked Apple Croissant. The success we're having in driving incremental spend gives us confidence that we're delivering meaningful value and a differentiated experience to our customers. Transaction comparable sales growth in the quarter was 2%, which, combined with another quarter of a record ticket, drove multiple record average weekly sales, including delivering our sixth-highest sales weeks ever, driven by our successful fall launch. Demand continued outside of our promotion windows, which translates to future opportunities as we leverage targeted offers to our most loyal customers, increasing efficiency as we create a more personalized experience. As it relates to demand, it was another record-breaking quarter for key aspects of our Starbucks Rewards program, active members, spend per member, and total member spend, which all surpassed previous highs. To further illustrate the strength of demand, we saw total customer growth among our occasional customers as well. Collectively, this demand speaks to the stickiness of our business. That, coupled with increased customer connection scores and growth across transactions, mix, customization, and attach, all leads to a durable and growing business. U.S. licensed store revenue remained strong in Q4, up 18% from the prior year, benefiting from consumers adopting pre-COVID routines of summer and business travel and expanded digital offerings, such as MOP and airports and curbside at select retailers, enabling us with more ways to meet our customers where they are, supporting increasing demand. North America's operating margin was 23.2% in Q4, expanding 420 basis points from the prior year, driven by increased efficiency in our stores, largely from reinvention, sales leverage, and favorable impacts of pricing, partially offset by continued investment in our partners. Moving on to International. In the quarter, the segment delivered $2 billion in revenue, up 11% from the prior year or up 15% when excluding approximately 3% impact from foreign currency translation. Our revenue growth momentum continues off of a remarkable prior quarter and stems from double-digit growth in the majority of our international regions demonstrating global strength. The segment delivered a 5% increase in comparable store sales driven by a 6% transaction growth, as store traffic increased and digital engagement continued with an increasing Starbucks Rewards member base. In addition, the International segment delivered 12% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year, with China contributing a significant portion of store growth as they had their highest store openings this year, equating to almost four new store openings daily in Q4, exceeding our expectations. Collectively, the segment surpassed the 20,000-store mark with ample headroom for growth across markets in the years to come. Shifting to China. As Laxman shared, China's revenue in the quarter and on a full-year basis grew by double digits driven by strength in our new stores and comparable store sales growth of 5%. Importantly, China's average weekly sales grew quarter-over-quarter, in line with our guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth. Comparable store sales growth of 5% was driven by strong transaction growth of 8% over the prior year, reflecting the strong brand affinity we create with locally relevant food and beverage and the consistent experience our partners deliver with every visit, differentiating us in the market. We continue to see long-term growth in China with significant opportunities in dayparts, digital offerings, and store format, and accordingly, continue to make investments for the future of our partners, stores, and local community. Notably, in the quarter, as Laxman shared, we opened the Coffee Innovation Park, our largest roasting plant outside of the U.S., demonstrating our unwavering commitment to our business in China. Operating margin for the International segment was 15.2% in Q4, expanding 70 basis points over the prior year, driven by sales leverage partially offset by digital investments. We are pleased with our margin, reflecting the strength of business and enabling us to unlock capital to reinvest back in the business to fuel growth. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue was $486 million in Q4, essentially flat over the prior year, in line with our expectations. This was driven largely by at-home coffee, while probably holding the number one share position in the category at 16.1%, as well as the number one position in ready-to-drink achieving our highest share in two years. Our fall launch in conjunction with our North America coffee partnership drove our performance resulting in the segment growing better than overall category. Segment's operating margin was 55.8% in Q4, up an impressive 520 basis points from prior year and exceeding our expectations, driven by ongoing strong performance in the North America coffee partnership. This segment continues to be highly margin accretive to our business and we're excited by the significant profit growth we're seeing in this channel. Shifting to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Our guidance accounts for the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment as we see it today. Additionally, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation. First, let me start with the foundation of our growth, comparable sales growth. We expect fiscal year 2024 global comp growth to be 5% to 7%. While this is a change from our prior year global comp guidance of 7% to 9%, our comp range, coupled with our strong new store performance and momentum in our licensed business, drives a broader and more durable growth narrative supporting our attractive consolidated revenue growth. For color, our fiscal year 2024 U.S. comparable store sales are expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7% as our business continues to have substantial headroom spurred by our leading innovation and technology, increasing customer loyalty and strong digital engagement as evidenced by the U.S. finishing fiscal year 2023 with strong performance of 9% comp growth. Another positive driver of our fiscal year 2024, 5% to 7% global comp growth is the performance in China, with comp expected to be in the range of 4% to 6% in Q2 through Q4, with a higher comp in Q1 as we lap prior year mobility restrictions. Such growth is fueled by our increasing digital capability, coupled with the local opportunity we see stemming from our relevant product innovation and purpose-designed stores, which are resonating with customers and driving engagement. Our new store performance, combined with our strong China comp guidance, will give another year of double-digit revenue growth in the market, delivering on our momentum. Next, in thinking of our global new store growth, we expect global new store growth of approximately 7%, with approximately 75% of the growth still coming from outside of the U.S. as we continue to focus on our strategic global expansion, reaching nearly 41,000 stores globally by the end of fiscal year 2024. We -- of the approximate 7% growth, we expect our U.S. store count to grow by approximately 4% in fiscal year 2024, driven by our dynamic portfolio format, expanding our white space opportunity. We anticipate China will continue its rapid growth of approximately 13% in fiscal year 2024, given the attractive unit economics of our new stores. We expect the remainder of our growth will be driven by the robust development in our other markets around the world that are leveraging the strength of our brand internationally and becoming more global. The combination of our global comp growth that I discussed a few minutes ago and our global store growth as well as continued growth in our licensed business, sets the foundation of our consolidated revenue growth. For fiscal year 2024, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to continue in the range of 10% to 12%, albeit at the low end of the range. This does not include any impact from foreign currency translation. We expect the foundational elements of our growth will be partially offset by an expected high single-digit revenue decline in our Channel Development segment largely related to the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee and broad optimization. Absent those impacts, Channel Development revenue is expected to be flat year-over-year. We're proud to reinforce yet another year of double-digit revenue growth at the low end of a 10% to 12% range, building on a very strong fiscal year 2023 performance, all of which reinforces the confidence we have in our business and opportunities we see ahead. Shifting to operating margin. We expect progressive margin expansion in fiscal year 2024 as we continue to deliver efficiency both in and out of our stores, inclusive of approximately $1 billion in incremental high-return, growth-oriented investments balanced across our partners, stores, and customers across wages, new store equipment and enhancements, digital and product innovation, and supply chain modernization. We will also continue our focus and discipline in unlocking strategic efficiencies across our business, and have multiple work streams underway to support approximately $1 billion in incremental leverage opportunity. These efficiencies, paired with sales leverage and strategic pricing, support continued investment in our business even as we expand margin and grow earnings over the long term. We will provide greater detail around our efficiency work streams in our strategy meeting later today. In addition, we expect our Channel Development segment to continue to be accretive to overall operating margin, with operating margin expanding to the high 40% to low 50% range from their favorable portfolio mix. Moving on to capital allocation. Through a very disciplined approach to capital allocation, our return on invested capital in fiscal year 2023 approach 25%, a meaningful improvement from prior year. Equally important, we expect this upward trajectory to continue in fiscal year 2024. We expect our CapEx in fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $3 billion, with over 85% of our CapEx directly invested in our global store portfolio. We also expect to continue our stable dividend approach and remain committed to targeting an approximate 50% dividend payout ratio, displaying our confidence in our long-term growth and attracting a broad investor base, which benefits all stakeholders. As one of the highest dividend payers among high-growth companies, we are proud to have recently commemorated our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase with a CAGR of 20% over such period. Our capital allocation strategy has positioned us well to be able to continue significant business investments while retaining financial flexibility and maintaining our BBB+ investment-grade credit rating. Regarding tax rates in fiscal year 2024, we expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the mid-20% range. This is higher than our fiscal year 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 23.6%, which benefited from certain discrete tax items that are not expected to reoccur in fiscal year 2024. In closing my guidance comments, we continue to expect fiscal year 2024 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the 15% to 20% range. Proudly, we expect our double-digit EPS growth will be a result of a balanced plan, compromised of both revenue growth and margin expansion. Overall, we are pleased with the durability of our business and strong foundation fiscal 2023 has set for fiscal year 2024, and our guidance is a product of our confidence in our continued long-term growth. We look forward to telling you more about our limitless opportunities in our afternoon strategy meeting. Before I close and turn it over to Tiffany, I want to thank the more than 450,000 partners who wear the green apron across the globe for their tireless contributions to create the experience that makes Starbucks such a meaningful place for all of our customers. It's because of you that I have such great confidence in the opportunity ahead. Tiffany?\nTiffany Willis : Thank you, Rachel. At this time, we'll proceed with our normal Q&A session, which will last until the top of the hour. Just for clarification, this Q&A session shall be focused on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 results and fiscal year 2024 guidance. Questions on topics outside of either of those should be held into our afternoon strategy meeting. Kevin, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nSara Senatore : Thank you, very much. I had a question about China, please, which I think we've heard the competitive environment there very intense. And I was just curious if that was perhaps some of what we saw in terms of positive traffic, but perhaps a negative ticket, and then some of the investments you're making, and perhaps that might be gating factors for margin expansion? The positive same-store sales, I think, certainly suggest that your business is executing well. But just trying to get a read on competitive intensity and maybe implications for new unit economics and the margin structure for the business going forward. Thanks.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you for the question. Let me start with the answer here. Our brand in China is known as Shing Baka and it uplifts the everyday for millions of customers in China. And as Rachel said, our business is also strong, 5% comp in Q4. If you look at the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, the growth difference in the second half was 20% higher than the first. One thing you should know is that if adjust the morning daypart, the morning daypart for our business in China now is higher than it was pre-COVID. We have very strong local innovation. And to answer your question, if you look at the transactions that Rachel mentioned, we're very comfortable with the food and beverage transactions. And what we see there, including the price realization that we have, the ticket that you mentioned specifically points to merchandise, and what we had in the store, which we are still working through. But we feel very good about the competitive position of beverages, the competitive position of food. We feel very good about the cash returns of the stores that we are opening. They're very strong. The team has done a wonderful job in ensuring that the cost of builds are low, with the productivity that we have been able to accomplish in our stores. We feel good about the overall returns that we are getting there. And I'm heartened by the -- by how the business is coming together despite all the headwinds that have been there for the last couple of years.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nJeffrey Bernstein : Great. I had a question and then just one clarification. The question is on the U.S. comp. Laxman, I think you mentioned momentum sustained through the fourth quarter. Just wondering if you could offer any color on whether there's been any change in consumer behavior in recent months for better or for worse. I know there's some concern about affordability into a slowing macro, I was hoping maybe you could prioritize the greatest levers to reaccelerate the U.S. comp if they were to slow. And my clarification. Just Rachel, you gave fiscal '24 guidance. I appreciate the color. I know you mentioned 5% to 7% worldwide comp and 15% to 20% EPS. That worldwide comp is below the current long-term 7% to 9%, is it fair that those are still the long-term guidance metrics? Or might those be updated later today? Just trying to clarify the guidance you gave for fiscal '24 relative to the long-term guidance. Thank you.\nLaxman Narasimhan: I'll take the first question and Rachel for the second. On the first question, clearly, we're reading all these statements about the macro uncertainty, and it's clear that we are navigating the uncertain economies and markets around the world. But rather than talking about the economy in general terms, let me just speak about what we see with the Starbucks customer. Customer demand for us remains strong. We're not really seeing any change in the sentiment in our customer base at this time. And I think what it does is it reflects the strength of the Starbucks brand globally, it reflects the loyalty of our customers, it reflects our position in their routine and it also reflects the long-term durability of this business. Now we, of course, watch all of this extremely carefully. Unlike 2008, which is the number that people have been tattling around, we have a widely more diversified set of channels that we participate in. We have digital relationships worldwide with over 75 million customers in terms of their last 90-day activity. But we can reach a multiple of those digitally. So, it's a much larger universe than what we would traditionally refer to as just our 90-day active users. So, we have the ability to reach our customers, and we have multiple levers in terms of how we deal with any uncertainty that we might see, and that's true as well in the U.S. So, I feel good about the momentum we have. We're obviously extremely watchful and humble about where we are, and we'll do everything we can to exceed the expectations of our partners and our customers. But we do have multiple levers to play. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you for the question. The way I'd look at the comp guidance is as we look at a very strong fiscal year 2023, and as we move into FY '24, our comp guidance of 5% to 7% on the global comp guidance range as well as for North America, we believe, reflects both a healthy as well as achievable comp guidance that supports not only the strength that we've seen and the momentum, but it supports the confidence we have in the business. I think what's important to think about is we've been talking about a more balanced approach to how we drive our earnings growth. And so, when we look at comp, it's part of a broader growth narrative. Where we look at comp, we're looking at the performance of our new stores and the performance of our licensed stores. And collectively, that's supporting the revenue growth range that I provided. That, coupled with progressive margin expansion, gives us a balanced approach to achieving the 15% to 20% earnings growth guidance, which we believe is attractive but also reflects the confidence that we have in the business and the momentum that we're seeing.\nOperator: Next question is coming from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. The Americas operating margin, 23.2%, up over four points, could you provide a bridge or describe the biggest contributors to this? Maybe not just by line item, but also, but what is the color behind that? What is going right operationally, both in the stores and in supply chain that's driving that? And of course, this is a lot higher than where the Street is for fiscal '24. I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about that margin for '24 as part of your guidance. Thanks.\nRachel Ruggeri: David, I would start with saying our guidance on margin for next year is progressive margin expansion. And remember, on a full-year basis -- even with the strength we saw in Q4, on a full-year basis, we achieved 100 basis points of margin expansion, which we're incredibly pleased with. In the quarter, in Q4, we saw very strong margin expansion, particularly in North America, the 420 basis points that we spoke about, that as the benefits of the reinvention have begun to amplify. And so, we expected that would amplify in the back half of the year, and that's what happened. And so, when you look at the drivers of that 420 basis points, the largest driver of it, around 340 basis points or so, is leverage we saw in our store operating expense. And that's really driven by, what I'd say, is the sustained operational efficiencies from our reinvention. So, the investments we made are fueling growth, investments in our partners, in wages, in training, in our new store and equipment, and that's leading to a more stable environment overall, which is supporting that leverage. It's allowing us to be more efficient in how we serve the customer. So that's the biggest driver in the quarter. Next is sales leverage, followed by a strategic pricing. And that sales leverage really comes from the fact that in Q4, our fall launch resonated with customers, and we saw record demand really across the globe, but largely in our U.S. business, and that also fueled the margin expansion. And then that all helped to offset the investments we've made, including investments in G&A, investment in partner wages, as well as investment in G&A. Now when we look to FY '24, we will expect some of that momentum to continue. But I would say it's more important to look on a full-year basis, and we'll continue to see margin expand more in line with what we saw on the full-year basis. But again, continued margin expansion. And it's that combination of strength in our revenue, but also strength in our reinvention, which is delivering very tangible financial results.\nLaxman Narasimhan: If I could just add to this. Growth is clearly a real enabler of leverage, and you'll see that reflected in the various lines in our P&L. Additionally, we see efficiency opportunities. And later this afternoon, we're going to detail out a $3 billion savings program and efficiency over three years, with a big portion of that coming from outside the store in the supply chain, in particular, and you'll see that a portion of that is certainly coming out in our top line. And so, this gives us the real confidence as we look ahead around the kind of efficiency that we have, that gives us the ability to invest in the business and at the same time, deliver the progressive margin expansion that Rachel talked about.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\nLauren Silberman : Thank you. Congrats on the, quarter. Also, on just U.S. comps and traffic. Can you help unpack where the growth is coming from? Is it new customers, existing customers, rewards members or more occasional customers? And then can you give us an update on where you're running with transactions per store per day? Thank you.\nRachel Ruggeri: Lauren, I'll start by just saying, overall, our traffic continues to be strong and it's growing. So, when you look at the success of our performance in the quarter, particularly in the U.S., our highest-ever average weekly sales were driven by a combination of strength in traffic but also strength in overall ticket. And we saw a record number of customers coming into our stores and spending a record amount. Now those customers are both our rewards customers as well as our non-Starbucks Rewards customers. So, we're seeing growth in our customer base across the segments. And that's driving strong performance as each customer is spending more. And I think what's unique about our business, particularly over the past couple of years is we've evolved and adapted towards our changing consumer demands. And so, we're seeing total transactions growing overall, both in our comp stores, in our new stores as well as our licensed stores. And importantly, we're seeing units per transaction significantly higher. And that's driven by the growth we're seeing in drive-through as well as delivery, which has a higher attach rate or more group orders. And that's all leading to the stronger performance that we saw in the quarter and will fuel the momentum as we go forward. And in terms of traffic, when I think about FY '24, the comp guidance range that we provided includes continuing improvement in our traffic. So, our transactions per store per day improved this quarter versus last quarter and the year before. And we'll expect that improvement to continue in FY '24, as well as we'll continue to expect an improvement in ticket as we very purposely innovate around customization, more premium beverages as well as ensure we're able to continue to drive attach. And the combination of that will support our double-digit revenue growth that I guided to.\nLaxman Narasimhan: If I can just add one thing to it. I think what has happened over the last several years is how much this business has evolved in order to meet the customer where it's at. And I think you're seeing that as well in traffic, in transactions, but also in what we're doing in purpose-defined stores, and later this afternoon, we're going to talk a bit about how we're going to lean in even further around how we meet customers where they are at.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, good morning. Thanks, for taking my question. I was hoping you could give us an update as you talk about the transaction improving, how speed is improving or throughput, whether how you measure that in the drive-through or kind of on the front line as I would think of it walking into the store.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Let me start and then Rachel can add to it. One of the things that the team has worked on incredibly on over the last year or so is putting in place a much stronger operating foundation in the stores. And I'm very proud of the progress that they are making. And that includes how we deal with the processes in the drive-thrus. You're seeing real improvement in terms of out of the window of time in the drive-thru. The team has put operating practices across these various formats. And I feel very good about the progress that they are making in that area. I think in terms of the automation or the equipment that we have also brought into the store, that has also been a driver of some of the changes that we have seen. I think just ahead of the summer, we were able to get in the portable cold foam blender into stores, which really helped our partners deal with the growth in volume on beverages in the summer. So, a combination of operating practices, the equipment that we are putting in place, all of that adds to much stronger operational foundation in our store, and we expect that to continue.\nRachel Ruggeri: The only thing I would add to that, Sharon, is that's all part of our reinvention. So, it's all about finding ways to be able to optimize the production environment so we can better support our partners in serving our customers. And to Laxman's point, we've seen tangible benefits in the quarter and actually throughout the year has driven improvements in our out-the-window time. We measure what good looks like, and we've made great improvements and there's more opportunity ahead. And that's helping us to not only more efficiently serve the customers, but it's what's leading to the margin expansion as well as the earnings growth that we're seeing. And we'll continue to further those, what I'd say, areas of focus in FY '24, specifically on staffing and scheduling as we continue to work on ensuring we have the right hours for our partners at their periods of preferences, which will create another level of stability in our store environment and greater engagement overall that will, again, help us in terms of the efficiency in serving our customers. So, we expect that momentum to continue.\nOperator: Next question is coming from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. There's been a lot of conversation this quarter about throughput, particularly at the drive-thru, but we can also talk in-store. Can you talk about your peak hour or peak 15-minute throughput opportunity? That firstly, you've already realized that you think you can realize with a more optimized store operational platform and especially having employees with greater tenure. How much more of an opportunity do we have from here?\nLaxman Narasimhan: John, if I could take that on. Thank you for your question. We have more opportunities than what we have realized, but we make very good progress. If you look at staffing and scheduling and how we are working on that, I think we've made material progress in that area. And I think as a consequence of that, you've seen attrition levels now lower than where they were pre-COVID. You see tenures of partners in the store increase. And that's going to continue. I think if you just look at what we've been able to achieve with the investments that we've made in our partners with wages and other benefits that have been provided to them. If you take a look at the take-home income, on average for our partners on a year-over-year basis, it's up 20% on average. Now there's still more to come. If you go back to 2020 and you look at where we are right now, the number is about close to 50% higher, but we still have further opportunities. And I think what that's going to help us, it's going to help us at peak times. It's going to help us in the speak 15 minutes that you talked about. But also as we look at demand overall and we look at the portfolio of stores we run and how we work with digital with those, you're going to see a stock later this afternoon around how we find ways to simplify what happens in the store and also meet a broader set of demand with very careful choices about how we locate stores, what we do with stores, how we digitally amplify what we are doing in terms of demand. But also, in supply, how we link that with the equipment we're bringing in with a strong operating foundation. So, there's more opportunity than what we have now.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nBrian Harbour: Good morning. Can I just ask about the step-up in your CapEx budget and what that's going to be directed towards? And I guess, more broadly, is there any sort of equipment rollout that you're kind of accelerating versus what you've previously talked about, or perhaps store remodels that could be accelerated?\nRachel Ruggeri: Brian, thank you for the question. Our CapEx will increase to around approximately $3 billion, and the majority of that, over 85%, will be focused on new store growth, increase in renovations. So, we're significantly increasing our renovations to about -- in the U.S., about 1,000 renovations next year. So, an increase in new stores globally, renovations, as well as equipment in the stores. But the larger percentage of it is really the new store growth globally as well as the renovation. The new equipment is equipment that we've spoken about, the rollout of further rollout of Negedice, for the rollout of Clover Vertica, some continuing work around refreshment and dispense. So, some of those opportunities around creating broader efficiencies to be able to create operational consistency across the stores. Then outside of that 85%, we'll be seeing supply chain modernization costs as well as some costs in China supporting an innovation and technology center. And so that's largely how the costs are made up. What we're encouraged by that is those tend to have very high return, they're very high growth-oriented investments. So, we expect to see improvement in our return on invested capital, much like what we saw this year where we achieved nearly 25% on our ROIC, given the very disciplined approach we took to investments last year. And we see this year as we increase our capital, our ability to continue to further that by making very disciplined choices in these high-return, growth-oriented investments.\nOperator: Our last question today is coming from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your line is now live.\nDanilo Gargiulo : Thank you. Laxman, in the press release, you were mentioning that the reinvention plan is moving ahead of schedule. So which aspects of this acceleration are you most proud of? And which aspect do you expect to accelerate the most in the months to come?\nLaxman Narasimhan: I'm very pleased with the way that the reinvention plan is implemented. A couple highlights I think the progress we've made on staffing and scheduling is extremely strong. Furthermore, if you look at what we've been able to accomplished with regard to efficiencies and the culture and the capability and the processes we now have in place in order to systematically attack these efficiencies across the business is actually very strong as well.  What we are accelerating on top of that is how we think about purpose-defined stores and what we're doing in putting together a strong operating foundation in our stores. That is going to really help us as we create the infrastructure, we create the store footprint, against which we will add to the equipment that we have in stores. Our equipment pipeline, what we have, the way we manage our new equipment, what's coming in, that entire pipeline and portfolio management is entirely on track. And we feel very good about the progress we are making there. And I think that is something that we're going to continue to see going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. That was our last question. I'll now turn the call over to Laxman for closing remarks.\nLaxman Narasimhan: I want to thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to appreciate all your questions, and I look forward to seeing you all this afternoon when we have our strategic update, and when we get to celebrate our holiday launch with you.

            "content": "Thank you, Tiffany. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Starbucks' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you in advance to those who will join us this afternoon where we will share an update on our long-term strategies and celebrate the launch of a holiday at Starbucks. Before we get started this morning, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to our Starbucks partners around the world for a very successful fiscal year 2023. I've learned through connecting with so many of you how our reinvention plan has continued to be well executed, giving us great momentum in this age of our transformation at Starbucks. I have discovered how our brand is uniquely delivered in our stores and digitally through our extraordinary partners and the tremendous headroom we see for our global business. Turning now to our business performance. Rachel and I will share details of our strong results delivered in the quarter and fiscal year 2023, and we will also share our confidence in the company's long-term opportunity with guidance for fiscal year 2024. What you will take away from this call today is that we have great momentum, fueled largely by our reinvention plan. We are seeing the work pay off through improved partner and customer experiences, as well as captured improvements in efficiency and margin. We believe this bodes well for this next year and for years beyond. To deliver our long-term sustainable growth, we are focused on five areas. You will hear more on what we call our triple shot reinvention and our continued momentum this afternoon. The discussion will provide a more detailed outlook on our three core and two enabling priority areas. First, we will elevate the brand through our stores. Second, we will strengthen and scale in digital. Third, we will become truly global. Fourth, we will unlock efficiencies, including outside stock. Finally, we will reinvigorate the partner culture at Starbucks. In the fourth quarter, our total company revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, representing an 11% increase year-over-year. Full-year revenue reached a record of $36 billion, representing 12% growth year-over-year for fiscal 2023, or 14% when excluding the 2% impact of foreign currency translation, aligning our revenue growth at the high end of our guidance range. Equally impressive, our global comparable store sales increased 8% year-over-year, both for the quarter and the fiscal year 2023, driven by a healthy mix of ticket and transaction growth. We grew earnings per share by 31% to $1.06 for the quarter and by $0.20 to $3.54 for the fiscal year, again, aligning to the top end of our guidance range. Importantly, we grew margin by 310 basis points for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points on a full-year basis. And we did all this while growing our global store count to over 38,000, in line with our store growth guidance of 7% in fiscal year 2023. Demand for Starbucks remains strong around the world. Here in the U.S., our largest market, we saw momentum sustain throughout the quarter. Revenue for the quarter was up a record 12%, underpinned by 8% comps. We had a remarkable fall launch that led to record-breaking average weekly sales. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members reached a new record this quarter of nearly 33 million 90-day active members, and setting records in spend per member and total member spend. Customers remain loyal to their favorite four menu classics that have stood the test of time, including the Pumpkin Spice Latte, which celebrated its 20th anniversary. In addition to very strong performance in our core offerings, we also have strong performance with new offerings, including our Apple-inspired beverages and food items. The results from the quarter, including the dynamic way we are driving ticket growth, give us great confidence in our menu innovation on both an individual product overall portfolio level. We have proven that complementary yet competing products and flavors can successfully coexist, such as pumpkin and Apple, with the right menu innovation, marketing mix, and strategic pricing strategies. As customer demands have evolved, we've delivered more beverages, food, and personalization and customization across existing and new formats to meet their expectations and grow the business. Our continued investments in our partners, equipment, supply chain, and technology are paying off, evidenced by a margin expansion across North America to 23.2% this past quarter. Timed with our busiest cold foam promotion of the year, the recent rollout of our new portable cold foamers to all U.S. company-operated stores, enhanced productivity in the fourth quarter. and lessened the trade on our partners, while continuing to meet the high cold beverage demand. In support of the continued growth in cold beverages, we delivered over 550 new Nugget ice machines and remained on track with installation prioritized for our most ice-constrained stores in fiscal year 2024. Clover Vertica, our on-demand single-cup brewer, is now installed in over 600 of our stores across the U.S., and we continue the on-schedule rollout of the Siren System cold and food stations, prioritizing new stores and renovation locations. Our portfolio and pipeline management of new equipment design and rollout plans are robust and enabled us to deliver our results. We have created a more stable environment in our stores. Hours per partner increased in the quarter by 5% as we continue filing schedules that fit our partners and customers' needs. Total was down in the fourth quarter by 10%, while barista tenure increased by 16% for the quarter. Customer connection scores also improved in the quarter relative to this time last year. We did all of this by investing over 20% of this year's profits back into our partners and stores through wages, training, equipment, and new store growth. All this is further evidence that our strategy is working. Turning to International. In the fourth quarter, we saw record store growth of nearly 600 stores across the segment, with International store count remaining higher than that of the U.S. We also experienced record double-digit revenue growth internationally in the quarter, with continued growth on every key market around the world. Our comparable same-store sales in our company-operated markets for both the U.K. and Japan remained well above historical averages in fiscal year 2023, with growth attributed to higher profitability and higher productivity store formats, as well as elevated digital and partner experiences. We saw strong customer demand for our beverage and food offerings around the world with record global demand for our pumpkin platform. And in our international license markets, Starbucks Rewards programs grew by 4 million 90-day active members, now contributing to 30% of total sales, up 9 percentage points in just one year, driven by the growth for Starbucks Digital Solutions. Supported by our strong brand globally, outside of China, our International segment is well ahead of the growth pace we indicated at last year's Investor Day, with focused growth in our company-operated markets and motivated business partners powering our licensed stores. Turning to China. We were pleased with our performance in the quarter. delivering revenue growth of 8% from the prior year or up 15% when excluding approximately 6% impact of foreign currency translation. This has further supported by a comp of 5% squarely in line with our expectations. Full-year revenue grew to $3 billion, up 3% from the prior year or up 11% excluding approximately 8% impact foreign currency translation with comp of 2%. Our performance in China improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter, with revenue in the second half of the year 20% higher than the first half, reflecting our growth momentum. These results underscore the strength of beverage and food offerings, the success of our market strategies, and the powerful execution unleashed by our partners in China as we capture the abundant opportunities in front of us. We continue to see strength from coffee-forward innovations, delighting our customers with locally relevant product innovation like the Moose Espresso and the smaller-sized Intenso range, a first in the world. We're also seeing higher food sales with tremendous headroom in this area, driving both transaction and ticket opportunities. In Q4, we saw continued momentum across the omnichannel experiences of Starbucks in China with strength in store through Mobile Order & Pay, Mobile Order Delivery, E-commerce, and in channels. China now has over 21 million active loyalty members, representing 22% year-over-year growth, with many members skewing younger to build our next generation of customers. In the quarter, we opened a record 326 net new purpose-driven stores in China, reaching 13% net new store growth over the prior year to over 6,800 stores at the end of fiscal year 2023. The outstanding financial returns of new stores give us confidence we will reach our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025, opening nearly 1,000 net new stores every year. Finally, the September opening of the China Coffee Innovation Park, designed to be our most energy-efficient and sustainable coffee manufacturing and distribution center in the world, further signaled our commitment to the largest consumer market in the world and the growth of our business in China for China. We look forward to sharing more on the headroom we see in China later today. The momentum against the backdrop of headwinds in China this past year gives us optimism in our position and affirm our distinctive competitive advantages for our business. These advantages include our uplifting partners, including our China leadership team, our distinctive stores, our vertically integrated and highly digitized efficient operations, and our relevant innovation. We will maintain our leading position in the premium market as we continue to grow in scale across our current portfolio and through new tiers of cities in this growing market of coffee drinkers. Finally, our channel business continues to elevate the Starbucks brand around the world at home and on the go, creating Starbucks moments for consumers outside of our retail stores. We're the number one ready-to-drink brand around the world. Notably, in the fourth quarter, we celebrated our five-year partnership with the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle\u0301. This Nestle\u0301 relationship, which includes We Proudly Serve Food service locations as well as additional partnerships, such as our Nova Mera channel partnership with PepsiCo and international partners like Tingyi and Arla have helped us grow our customer touch points, and is now in nearly 90 markets around the world. For fiscal year 2023, we saw notable growth in our leading channel market position as well as accretive brand equity as we continue to be recognized for our innovation. Some notable accolades include awards in China Ready Select, in the Europe, Middle East, Africa multiserve business as well as achieving 1 billion in servings in Korea and selling out of Grab & Go in Japan. In closing, while navigating an environment of unprecedented volatility throughout fiscal year 2023, we finished our fourth quarter and full year strong delivering on our guidance. Our reinvention is moving ahead of schedule, fueling revenue growth, efficiency and margin expansion. Notably, we continue to see the positive impact of our reinvention on our partner and customer experiences, proof points that we can continue to innovate, grow, and strengthen our business while creating value for all. Looking ahead, we remain fully optimistic about our headroom across the U.S. and internationally, and we see limitless possibilities across all areas of the business. While the global business environment remains uncertain, we are confident in our ability to adapt and innovate to meet evolving consumer needs. We will continue to invest in our partners to expand upon our reinvention and to deliver on our sustainability and social impact initiatives, all while driving long-term growth. We feel very good about the business momentum for next year, the continued strength of the brand, and the opportunity for growth in the years ahead. I look forward to sharing greater detail around these strategies for growth with you later this afternoon. Our performance this past year and the plans ahead give us great confidence in the multiple paths we have in front of us to achieve our long-term results. I will now hand the call over to Rachel to walk you through further details of the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results, as well as our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing you this afternoon. Rachel? Thank you for the question. Let me start with the answer here. Our brand in China is known as Shing Baka and it uplifts the everyday for millions of customers in China. And as Rachel said, our business is also strong, 5% comp in Q4. If you look at the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, the growth difference in the second half was 20% higher than the first. One thing you should know is that if adjust the morning daypart, the morning daypart for our business in China now is higher than it was pre-COVID. We have very strong local innovation. And to answer your question, if you look at the transactions that Rachel mentioned, we're very comfortable with the food and beverage transactions. And what we see there, including the price realization that we have, the ticket that you mentioned specifically points to merchandise, and what we had in the store, which we are still working through. But we feel very good about the competitive position of beverages, the competitive position of food. We feel very good about the cash returns of the stores that we are opening. They're very strong. The team has done a wonderful job in ensuring that the cost of builds are low, with the productivity that we have been able to accomplish in our stores. We feel good about the overall returns that we are getting there. And I'm heartened by the -- by how the business is coming together despite all the headwinds that have been there for the last couple of years. I'll take the first question and Rachel for the second. On the first question, clearly, we're reading all these statements about the macro uncertainty, and it's clear that we are navigating the uncertain economies and markets around the world. But rather than talking about the economy in general terms, let me just speak about what we see with the Starbucks customer. Customer demand for us remains strong. We're not really seeing any change in the sentiment in our customer base at this time. And I think what it does is it reflects the strength of the Starbucks brand globally, it reflects the loyalty of our customers, it reflects our position in their routine and it also reflects the long-term durability of this business. Now we, of course, watch all of this extremely carefully. Unlike 2008, which is the number that people have been tattling around, we have a widely more diversified set of channels that we participate in. We have digital relationships worldwide with over 75 million customers in terms of their last 90-day activity. But we can reach a multiple of those digitally. So, it's a much larger universe than what we would traditionally refer to as just our 90-day active users. So, we have the ability to reach our customers, and we have multiple levers in terms of how we deal with any uncertainty that we might see, and that's true as well in the U.S. So, I feel good about the momentum we have. We're obviously extremely watchful and humble about where we are, and we'll do everything we can to exceed the expectations of our partners and our customers. But we do have multiple levers to play. Rachel? If I could just add to this. Growth is clearly a real enabler of leverage, and you'll see that reflected in the various lines in our P&L. Additionally, we see efficiency opportunities. And later this afternoon, we're going to detail out a $3 billion savings program and efficiency over three years, with a big portion of that coming from outside the store in the supply chain, in particular, and you'll see that a portion of that is certainly coming out in our top line. And so, this gives us the real confidence as we look ahead around the kind of efficiency that we have, that gives us the ability to invest in the business and at the same time, deliver the progressive margin expansion that Rachel talked about. If I can just add one thing to it. I think what has happened over the last several years is how much this business has evolved in order to meet the customer where it's at. And I think you're seeing that as well in traffic, in transactions, but also in what we're doing in purpose-defined stores, and later this afternoon, we're going to talk a bit about how we're going to lean in even further around how we meet customers where they are at. Let me start and then Rachel can add to it. One of the things that the team has worked on incredibly on over the last year or so is putting in place a much stronger operating foundation in the stores. And I'm very proud of the progress that they are making. And that includes how we deal with the processes in the drive-thrus. You're seeing real improvement in terms of out of the window of time in the drive-thru. The team has put operating practices across these various formats. And I feel very good about the progress that they are making in that area. I think in terms of the automation or the equipment that we have also brought into the store, that has also been a driver of some of the changes that we have seen. I think just ahead of the summer, we were able to get in the portable cold foam blender into stores, which really helped our partners deal with the growth in volume on beverages in the summer. So, a combination of operating practices, the equipment that we are putting in place, all of that adds to much stronger operational foundation in our store, and we expect that to continue. John, if I could take that on. Thank you for your question. We have more opportunities than what we have realized, but we make very good progress. If you look at staffing and scheduling and how we are working on that, I think we've made material progress in that area. And I think as a consequence of that, you've seen attrition levels now lower than where they were pre-COVID. You see tenures of partners in the store increase. And that's going to continue. I think if you just look at what we've been able to achieve with the investments that we've made in our partners with wages and other benefits that have been provided to them. If you take a look at the take-home income, on average for our partners on a year-over-year basis, it's up 20% on average. Now there's still more to come. If you go back to 2020 and you look at where we are right now, the number is about close to 50% higher, but we still have further opportunities. And I think what that's going to help us, it's going to help us at peak times. It's going to help us in the speak 15 minutes that you talked about. But also as we look at demand overall and we look at the portfolio of stores we run and how we work with digital with those, you're going to see a stock later this afternoon around how we find ways to simplify what happens in the store and also meet a broader set of demand with very careful choices about how we locate stores, what we do with stores, how we digitally amplify what we are doing in terms of demand. But also, in supply, how we link that with the equipment we're bringing in with a strong operating foundation. So, there's more opportunity than what we have now. I'm very pleased with the way that the reinvention plan is implemented. A couple highlights I think the progress we've made on staffing and scheduling is extremely strong. Furthermore, if you look at what we've been able to accomplished with regard to efficiencies and the culture and the capability and the processes we now have in place in order to systematically attack these efficiencies across the business is actually very strong as well.  What we are accelerating on top of that is how we think about purpose-defined stores and what we're doing in putting together a strong operating foundation in our stores. That is going to really help us as we create the infrastructure, we create the store footprint, against which we will add to the equipment that we have in stores. Our equipment pipeline, what we have, the way we manage our new equipment, what's coming in, that entire pipeline and portfolio management is entirely on track. And we feel very good about the progress we are making there. And I think that is something that we're going to continue to see going forward. I want to thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to appreciate all your questions, and I look forward to seeing you all this afternoon when we have our strategic update, and when we get to celebrate our holiday launch with you. Thank you all for joining us this morning."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Laxman, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our strong Q4 and full fiscal year 2023 performance, which delivered on our full-year guidance shared at the 2022 Investor Day. Our fiscal year 2023 double-digit earnings growth was a direct result of both double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion, as our focus and disciplined execution of our reinvention delivered tangible financial results. Our Q4 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, up 9% from the prior year or up 12% when excluding a 1% impact of foreign currency translation. As Laxman mentioned, the U.S. business delivered strong performance with record-breaking average weekly sales from an overwhelmingly successful fall launch, and our International business was also strong, with China performing in line with our expectations. Combined, this resulted in our consolidated comparable store sales growth of 8% and net new company-operated store growth of 7% globally over the prior year, as well as sustained momentum in our global licensed markets. Q4 consolidated operating margin expanded 310 basis points from the prior year to 18.2%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by increased efficiency throughout our U.S. stores as our strong execution on reinvention amplified results even greater than we anticipated, coupled with sales leverage and pricing. Margin expansion continued to be partially offset by our investments in store partners as well as higher G&A costs and support of reinvention. Q4 EPS was $1.06, up 31% from the prior year, driven by strong performance across our segments, especially the U.S., as its results were bolstered by the amplified success of our reinvention. For fiscal year 2023, our consolidated revenue reached a record $36 billion, up 12% from the prior year or up 14% when excluding approximately two percentage impact of foreign currency translation. Consistent with our guidance, our revenue growth included 8% comparable store growth and 7% net new company-operated store growth over prior year, as well as ongoing contributions from our global licensed store businesses. Our fiscal year 2023 consolidated op margin was 16.1%, up 100 basis points versus prior year. And EPS of $3.54 was up 20% over prior year. above our recent guidance of 16% to 17%. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q4. North America delivered another quarter of record revenue with $6.9 billion in Q4, up 12% from the prior year, driven by a combination of an 8% increase in comparable store sales, consisting of 6% and 2% growth in average ticket and transactions, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% over the prior year and contributions from our licensed store business, which continues to benefit from increased travel. When considering growth from all stores, comp new and licensed, we were pleased to see more than two-thirds of our growth came from transactions, mix, attach, and customization, which we collectively call demand. Our U.S. business delivered 8% comparable store sales growth in Q4, primarily driven by strong ticket performance with 6% comp growth, which benefited from volume, mix, attach, customization, and pricing. Our customers continue to favor more premium beverages, creating a new normal as it relates to mix and customization. To fuel this, we continue to lean in with innovation, offering our Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte, which boosted tea cells; as well as Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam, which become a customization favorite with our customers. In addition to our beverage success, we also had another record quarter of food attached, driven by both our core breakfast sandwiches and promotional items, such as our Baked Apple Croissant. The success we're having in driving incremental spend gives us confidence that we're delivering meaningful value and a differentiated experience to our customers. Transaction comparable sales growth in the quarter was 2%, which, combined with another quarter of a record ticket, drove multiple record average weekly sales, including delivering our sixth-highest sales weeks ever, driven by our successful fall launch. Demand continued outside of our promotion windows, which translates to future opportunities as we leverage targeted offers to our most loyal customers, increasing efficiency as we create a more personalized experience. As it relates to demand, it was another record-breaking quarter for key aspects of our Starbucks Rewards program, active members, spend per member, and total member spend, which all surpassed previous highs. To further illustrate the strength of demand, we saw total customer growth among our occasional customers as well. Collectively, this demand speaks to the stickiness of our business. That, coupled with increased customer connection scores and growth across transactions, mix, customization, and attach, all leads to a durable and growing business. U.S. licensed store revenue remained strong in Q4, up 18% from the prior year, benefiting from consumers adopting pre-COVID routines of summer and business travel and expanded digital offerings, such as MOP and airports and curbside at select retailers, enabling us with more ways to meet our customers where they are, supporting increasing demand. North America's operating margin was 23.2% in Q4, expanding 420 basis points from the prior year, driven by increased efficiency in our stores, largely from reinvention, sales leverage, and favorable impacts of pricing, partially offset by continued investment in our partners. Moving on to International. In the quarter, the segment delivered $2 billion in revenue, up 11% from the prior year or up 15% when excluding approximately 3% impact from foreign currency translation. Our revenue growth momentum continues off of a remarkable prior quarter and stems from double-digit growth in the majority of our international regions demonstrating global strength. The segment delivered a 5% increase in comparable store sales driven by a 6% transaction growth, as store traffic increased and digital engagement continued with an increasing Starbucks Rewards member base. In addition, the International segment delivered 12% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year, with China contributing a significant portion of store growth as they had their highest store openings this year, equating to almost four new store openings daily in Q4, exceeding our expectations. Collectively, the segment surpassed the 20,000-store mark with ample headroom for growth across markets in the years to come. Shifting to China. As Laxman shared, China's revenue in the quarter and on a full-year basis grew by double digits driven by strength in our new stores and comparable store sales growth of 5%. Importantly, China's average weekly sales grew quarter-over-quarter, in line with our guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth. Comparable store sales growth of 5% was driven by strong transaction growth of 8% over the prior year, reflecting the strong brand affinity we create with locally relevant food and beverage and the consistent experience our partners deliver with every visit, differentiating us in the market. We continue to see long-term growth in China with significant opportunities in dayparts, digital offerings, and store format, and accordingly, continue to make investments for the future of our partners, stores, and local community. Notably, in the quarter, as Laxman shared, we opened the Coffee Innovation Park, our largest roasting plant outside of the U.S., demonstrating our unwavering commitment to our business in China. Operating margin for the International segment was 15.2% in Q4, expanding 70 basis points over the prior year, driven by sales leverage partially offset by digital investments. We are pleased with our margin, reflecting the strength of business and enabling us to unlock capital to reinvest back in the business to fuel growth. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue was $486 million in Q4, essentially flat over the prior year, in line with our expectations. This was driven largely by at-home coffee, while probably holding the number one share position in the category at 16.1%, as well as the number one position in ready-to-drink achieving our highest share in two years. Our fall launch in conjunction with our North America coffee partnership drove our performance resulting in the segment growing better than overall category. Segment's operating margin was 55.8% in Q4, up an impressive 520 basis points from prior year and exceeding our expectations, driven by ongoing strong performance in the North America coffee partnership. This segment continues to be highly margin accretive to our business and we're excited by the significant profit growth we're seeing in this channel. Shifting to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Our guidance accounts for the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment as we see it today. Additionally, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation. First, let me start with the foundation of our growth, comparable sales growth. We expect fiscal year 2024 global comp growth to be 5% to 7%. While this is a change from our prior year global comp guidance of 7% to 9%, our comp range, coupled with our strong new store performance and momentum in our licensed business, drives a broader and more durable growth narrative supporting our attractive consolidated revenue growth. For color, our fiscal year 2024 U.S. comparable store sales are expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7% as our business continues to have substantial headroom spurred by our leading innovation and technology, increasing customer loyalty and strong digital engagement as evidenced by the U.S. finishing fiscal year 2023 with strong performance of 9% comp growth. Another positive driver of our fiscal year 2024, 5% to 7% global comp growth is the performance in China, with comp expected to be in the range of 4% to 6% in Q2 through Q4, with a higher comp in Q1 as we lap prior year mobility restrictions. Such growth is fueled by our increasing digital capability, coupled with the local opportunity we see stemming from our relevant product innovation and purpose-designed stores, which are resonating with customers and driving engagement. Our new store performance, combined with our strong China comp guidance, will give another year of double-digit revenue growth in the market, delivering on our momentum. Next, in thinking of our global new store growth, we expect global new store growth of approximately 7%, with approximately 75% of the growth still coming from outside of the U.S. as we continue to focus on our strategic global expansion, reaching nearly 41,000 stores globally by the end of fiscal year 2024. We -- of the approximate 7% growth, we expect our U.S. store count to grow by approximately 4% in fiscal year 2024, driven by our dynamic portfolio format, expanding our white space opportunity. We anticipate China will continue its rapid growth of approximately 13% in fiscal year 2024, given the attractive unit economics of our new stores. We expect the remainder of our growth will be driven by the robust development in our other markets around the world that are leveraging the strength of our brand internationally and becoming more global. The combination of our global comp growth that I discussed a few minutes ago and our global store growth as well as continued growth in our licensed business, sets the foundation of our consolidated revenue growth. For fiscal year 2024, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to continue in the range of 10% to 12%, albeit at the low end of the range. This does not include any impact from foreign currency translation. We expect the foundational elements of our growth will be partially offset by an expected high single-digit revenue decline in our Channel Development segment largely related to the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee and broad optimization. Absent those impacts, Channel Development revenue is expected to be flat year-over-year. We're proud to reinforce yet another year of double-digit revenue growth at the low end of a 10% to 12% range, building on a very strong fiscal year 2023 performance, all of which reinforces the confidence we have in our business and opportunities we see ahead. Shifting to operating margin. We expect progressive margin expansion in fiscal year 2024 as we continue to deliver efficiency both in and out of our stores, inclusive of approximately $1 billion in incremental high-return, growth-oriented investments balanced across our partners, stores, and customers across wages, new store equipment and enhancements, digital and product innovation, and supply chain modernization. We will also continue our focus and discipline in unlocking strategic efficiencies across our business, and have multiple work streams underway to support approximately $1 billion in incremental leverage opportunity. These efficiencies, paired with sales leverage and strategic pricing, support continued investment in our business even as we expand margin and grow earnings over the long term. We will provide greater detail around our efficiency work streams in our strategy meeting later today. In addition, we expect our Channel Development segment to continue to be accretive to overall operating margin, with operating margin expanding to the high 40% to low 50% range from their favorable portfolio mix. Moving on to capital allocation. Through a very disciplined approach to capital allocation, our return on invested capital in fiscal year 2023 approach 25%, a meaningful improvement from prior year. Equally important, we expect this upward trajectory to continue in fiscal year 2024. We expect our CapEx in fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $3 billion, with over 85% of our CapEx directly invested in our global store portfolio. We also expect to continue our stable dividend approach and remain committed to targeting an approximate 50% dividend payout ratio, displaying our confidence in our long-term growth and attracting a broad investor base, which benefits all stakeholders. As one of the highest dividend payers among high-growth companies, we are proud to have recently commemorated our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase with a CAGR of 20% over such period. Our capital allocation strategy has positioned us well to be able to continue significant business investments while retaining financial flexibility and maintaining our BBB+ investment-grade credit rating. Regarding tax rates in fiscal year 2024, we expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the mid-20% range. This is higher than our fiscal year 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 23.6%, which benefited from certain discrete tax items that are not expected to reoccur in fiscal year 2024. In closing my guidance comments, we continue to expect fiscal year 2024 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the 15% to 20% range. Proudly, we expect our double-digit EPS growth will be a result of a balanced plan, compromised of both revenue growth and margin expansion. Overall, we are pleased with the durability of our business and strong foundation fiscal 2023 has set for fiscal year 2024, and our guidance is a product of our confidence in our continued long-term growth. We look forward to telling you more about our limitless opportunities in our afternoon strategy meeting. Before I close and turn it over to Tiffany, I want to thank the more than 450,000 partners who wear the green apron across the globe for their tireless contributions to create the experience that makes Starbucks such a meaningful place for all of our customers. It's because of you that I have such great confidence in the opportunity ahead. Tiffany? Thank you for the question. The way I'd look at the comp guidance is as we look at a very strong fiscal year 2023, and as we move into FY '24, our comp guidance of 5% to 7% on the global comp guidance range as well as for North America, we believe, reflects both a healthy as well as achievable comp guidance that supports not only the strength that we've seen and the momentum, but it supports the confidence we have in the business. I think what's important to think about is we've been talking about a more balanced approach to how we drive our earnings growth. And so, when we look at comp, it's part of a broader growth narrative. Where we look at comp, we're looking at the performance of our new stores and the performance of our licensed stores. And collectively, that's supporting the revenue growth range that I provided. That, coupled with progressive margin expansion, gives us a balanced approach to achieving the 15% to 20% earnings growth guidance, which we believe is attractive but also reflects the confidence that we have in the business and the momentum that we're seeing. David, I would start with saying our guidance on margin for next year is progressive margin expansion. And remember, on a full-year basis -- even with the strength we saw in Q4, on a full-year basis, we achieved 100 basis points of margin expansion, which we're incredibly pleased with. In the quarter, in Q4, we saw very strong margin expansion, particularly in North America, the 420 basis points that we spoke about, that as the benefits of the reinvention have begun to amplify. And so, we expected that would amplify in the back half of the year, and that's what happened. And so, when you look at the drivers of that 420 basis points, the largest driver of it, around 340 basis points or so, is leverage we saw in our store operating expense. And that's really driven by, what I'd say, is the sustained operational efficiencies from our reinvention. So, the investments we made are fueling growth, investments in our partners, in wages, in training, in our new store and equipment, and that's leading to a more stable environment overall, which is supporting that leverage. It's allowing us to be more efficient in how we serve the customer. So that's the biggest driver in the quarter. Next is sales leverage, followed by a strategic pricing. And that sales leverage really comes from the fact that in Q4, our fall launch resonated with customers, and we saw record demand really across the globe, but largely in our U.S. business, and that also fueled the margin expansion. And then that all helped to offset the investments we've made, including investments in G&A, investment in partner wages, as well as investment in G&A. Now when we look to FY '24, we will expect some of that momentum to continue. But I would say it's more important to look on a full-year basis, and we'll continue to see margin expand more in line with what we saw on the full-year basis. But again, continued margin expansion. And it's that combination of strength in our revenue, but also strength in our reinvention, which is delivering very tangible financial results. Lauren, I'll start by just saying, overall, our traffic continues to be strong and it's growing. So, when you look at the success of our performance in the quarter, particularly in the U.S., our highest-ever average weekly sales were driven by a combination of strength in traffic but also strength in overall ticket. And we saw a record number of customers coming into our stores and spending a record amount. Now those customers are both our rewards customers as well as our non-Starbucks Rewards customers. So, we're seeing growth in our customer base across the segments. And that's driving strong performance as each customer is spending more. And I think what's unique about our business, particularly over the past couple of years is we've evolved and adapted towards our changing consumer demands. And so, we're seeing total transactions growing overall, both in our comp stores, in our new stores as well as our licensed stores. And importantly, we're seeing units per transaction significantly higher. And that's driven by the growth we're seeing in drive-through as well as delivery, which has a higher attach rate or more group orders. And that's all leading to the stronger performance that we saw in the quarter and will fuel the momentum as we go forward. And in terms of traffic, when I think about FY '24, the comp guidance range that we provided includes continuing improvement in our traffic. So, our transactions per store per day improved this quarter versus last quarter and the year before. And we'll expect that improvement to continue in FY '24, as well as we'll continue to expect an improvement in ticket as we very purposely innovate around customization, more premium beverages as well as ensure we're able to continue to drive attach. And the combination of that will support our double-digit revenue growth that I guided to. The only thing I would add to that, Sharon, is that's all part of our reinvention. So, it's all about finding ways to be able to optimize the production environment so we can better support our partners in serving our customers. And to Laxman's point, we've seen tangible benefits in the quarter and actually throughout the year has driven improvements in our out-the-window time. We measure what good looks like, and we've made great improvements and there's more opportunity ahead. And that's helping us to not only more efficiently serve the customers, but it's what's leading to the margin expansion as well as the earnings growth that we're seeing. And we'll continue to further those, what I'd say, areas of focus in FY '24, specifically on staffing and scheduling as we continue to work on ensuring we have the right hours for our partners at their periods of preferences, which will create another level of stability in our store environment and greater engagement overall that will, again, help us in terms of the efficiency in serving our customers. So, we expect that momentum to continue. Brian, thank you for the question. Our CapEx will increase to around approximately $3 billion, and the majority of that, over 85%, will be focused on new store growth, increase in renovations. So, we're significantly increasing our renovations to about -- in the U.S., about 1,000 renovations next year. So, an increase in new stores globally, renovations, as well as equipment in the stores. But the larger percentage of it is really the new store growth globally as well as the renovation. The new equipment is equipment that we've spoken about, the rollout of further rollout of Negedice, for the rollout of Clover Vertica, some continuing work around refreshment and dispense. So, some of those opportunities around creating broader efficiencies to be able to create operational consistency across the stores. Then outside of that 85%, we'll be seeing supply chain modernization costs as well as some costs in China supporting an innovation and technology center. And so that's largely how the costs are made up. What we're encouraged by that is those tend to have very high return, they're very high growth-oriented investments. So, we expect to see improvement in our return on invested capital, much like what we saw this year where we achieved nearly 25% on our ROIC, given the very disciplined approach we took to investments last year. And we see this year as we increase our capital, our ability to continue to further that by making very disciplined choices in these high-return, growth-oriented investments."

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Laxman.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you, Tiffany, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. In a few moments, Rachel Ruggeri will walk you through the detailed results of the third quarter, and Belinda Wong would then join us for Q&A. To start, our strong third quarter results point to all-around momentum in the business. This quarter, we grew consolidated revenue by 12%, up 14% when excluding more than a 1% impact in foreign currency translation to a record $9.2 billion. Importantly, earnings growth of 19% outpaced revenue growth with margin expanding by 50 basis points to 17.4%. Our strong performance reflects the strengthened foundation of our business, resulting from the significant progress we are making against our reinvention plan. Since stepping into the role, I have now traveled to every region, working directly with partners. I left each interaction impressed by the differentiated global appeal of the Starbucks brand powered by innovation and anchored in our unique ability to deliver human connection. These experiences give me great confidence in the significant growth and margin opportunities in front of us, positioning us well to strengthen the brand and create outsized long-term shareholder value. It was this time last year when Howard and the team identified the must-win opportunities and investments for our foundational reinvention plan. While Rachel will walk you through detailed results, I will now outline the momentum we have from the quarter in five key priority areas while pointing out where we see further headroom. Our first priority, we will elevate the brand by running great stores. This comes to life in the strengthened execution in North America. Our North America team delivered record revenue in the quarter, with a growth of 11% underpinned by 7% comparable same-store sales growth, leading to the highest average weekly sales in our history. Our ticket growth was driven by pricing, customization and food attach. Additionally, we continue to see improvements in items sold per labor hour. Operationally, we are seeing evidence that we are executing better. Barista attrition, where we are already industry-leading has improved further by 11% year-over-year. Through scheduling and staffing improvements, we are beginning to increase the number of hours per partner in store, critical to running great stores and improving partner engagement while also improving productivity. Innovation in beverage and equipment continues to drive our business. In fact, our cold business reached 75% of U.S. beverage sales this past quarter. As the leader in premium coffee, we are particularly encouraged to see cold espresso beverages were up 13% year-over-year. Additionally, we continue to elevate the premium coffee experience in both cold and hot. For example, the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewer continues as planned, delivering a larger variety of high-quality hot coffee, including decaffeinated on demand. Our innovative equipment rollout remains on track, are faster and easier to use portable handheld cold form blenders continue to have an outsized impact for both the partner and customer experience. The cold foam blenders are now rolled out to all U.S. company-operated stores in time to meet the summer demand for Starbucks Refreshers' frozen beverages. The new blenders support the additional growth of cold foam, the fastest-growing customization at Starbucks. Modifiers such as cold foam now contribute to over $1 billion in revenue annually. The Mastrena 2 espresso machines and new warming ovens are also now in all U.S. company-operated stores. Taken all together, our equipment investments that we began last year are supporting labor efficiencies, allowing us to increase capacity during our busiest day parts. These investments are both elevating the Starbucks Experience and further differentiating us from competitors. In this past quarter in North America, we once again saw our unit volume outpace pre-COVID levels by double-digits with high attach rates across dayparts, the mornings as well as the afternoons. Also in thinking about dayparts, our Starbucks Refreshers platform, which skews towards an alternate location occasion has seen double-digit growth this past quarter in every daypart. With this success, we are leaning in even further with a systematic pipeline of innovation across dayparts. This includes this summer's launch of our Starbucks Refreshers frozen beverages, customization in our Oleato beverage platform as well as with our cold-pressed Cold Brew, which enters a testing phase across a few dozen stores this fourth quarter with a rollout across U.S. company-owned stores expected by the end of fiscal year 2024. Food is also fueling growth. This past quarter, we saw all-time high food attach and sales of breakfast sandwiches. As an attached business, food drove a higher ticket in the quarter, improving volume growth and contributing to the record average weekly sales. Overall, we are excited about the significant opportunity in food as we explore new, elevated and convenient food offerings. We will share more of this in time. We also continue to grow and diversify our store portfolio. We see significant headroom for new store growth in underpenetrated areas in the U.S., including smaller cities as well as new formats in larger metros. New stores and remodels are where we are first prioritizing our Siren System equipment rollout and we plan to move all stores to brand-forward digital menu boards over the next couple of years to further sharpen personalization and daypart activation. We are seeing strong growth in delivery. In fact, we are close to creating a $1 billion incremental leg in our delivery business from minimal presence a few years ago. And now we are operationally setting ourselves up for this channel in major markets, starting from a position of strength. As a second strategic priority, we're looking ahead at how we will further strengthen and differentiate our leadership position in digital. In the third quarter, we continued to grow our digital universe. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards customers grew to nearly 75 million globally, growing more than 25% in the quarter. This was driven by a record 90-day active user base of 31.4 million Starbucks Rewards customers in the U.S., an approximate 15% growth or 4 million new customers from the previous year. Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. drove 57% of tender for the second consecutive quarter, up over 3 percentage points from the prior year. In China, we hit the highest number of 90-day active users we have ever had at over 20 million Starbucks Rewards customers. This is further evidence of our brand strength, relevance and customer engagement in the market. Starbucks has had a long track record of industry-leading digital innovation. As we approach the fundamental platform transformation underway with AI, we intend to invest to lead in this area using a foundational Deep Brew capability as the launching pad. Our focus in these investments will remain on improving the partner experience while elevating the customer experience and delivering productivity gains. We are revamping our approach to further accelerate digital innovation, including order, including payment and delivery enhancements, in terms of speed and personalization, which we believe leads to greater habituation by our customers. This includes developments in the U.S. mobile app user experience as well. Additionally, we plan to make significant investments in China to further enhance our digital capabilities in the market. Our third priority is global growth. As a company with over 100 million customer occasions each week, more than 37,000 stores and operating in 86 markets around the world, the runway for global growth is limitless. For the quarter, we again saw double-digit top line growth across the International segment. The segment delivered record system sales for the second consecutive quarter as well as the highest revenue and operating margin since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, we continue to see double-digit growth in the company-owned markets of Japan and the U.K., while the geographic license partners across the rest of the world all reported very strong performance. Our international store growth was 10% year-over-year. New stores are bringing attractive unit economics for the business while we benefit from strong growth in returns on invested capital in these markets. Turning to China. I am encouraged by our performance in the quarter. I had the opportunity to spend time in the market recently. I can now fully appreciate the extraordinary strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand, which is known as Xingbake locally. Looking at our third quarter results, our China revenue grew 51% from the prior year or up 60% when excluding a 9% impact of foreign currency translation. Additionally, we sequentially grew our revenue 8% from the prior quarter or up 10% when excluding a 2% impact of foreign currency translation, underscoring the robust long-term health of our business. Despite these early days in our recovery journey, stores that opened in fiscal year 2019 or earlier achieved full sales recovery in the routine morning daypart while other dayparts reported sequential monthly improvement. A strong recovery in the third quarter was amplified by the many distinctive competitive advantage that set us apart in China. The first and foremost advantages are in comparable partners who honor the heritage of our company, bring sophisticated appreciation for our high quality coffee and passion for delivering the Starbucks Experience in ways that are relevant to our Chinese customers. Our second advantage is our vertically integrated operations. We start with a locally relevant and increasingly greener store footprint. Our distinctively designed stores across formats celebrate the Chinese culture in a unique Xingbake manner, reflecting local arts, crafts and calligraphy. In the fall, we plan to open our Coffee Innovation Park, our single largest and most sustainable manufacturing investment outside of the U.S. This next-generation facility with state-of-the-art supply chain operations will also include a unique customer immersion center. Third, our locally relevant innovation in China for over 20 years has won over customers in what has historically been a tea-drinking culture. Today, we have nearly 6,500 stores and another nearly 2,400 points of customer connection through our We Proudly Serve program in China. And yet, there is so much more opportunity ahead in underpenetrated areas within this market. Some growth facts to think about. The average person in China drinks 12 cups of coffee each year. That significantly lower coffee consumption than in Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, where we first entered the market and now have nearly 1,100 stores. And we still have more room to grow in Shanghai. Compare this also to Japan where our per capita is 200 cups versus the 12 cups in China and the U.S., where the per capita is closer to 380. We are still in our early days in China, one of the largest consumer markets. With our locally-based investments in R&D and locally relevant offerings like our Dragon dumplings, which had an amazing quarter. We have built a brand that is highly relevant for China, in China. And we believe our unique approach has us well positioned to play the long game and win. Finally, another advantage in China is digital. This will be further demonstrated with highly digital supply chains we run and in the way we engage our customers. We are reshaping our business models, leaning into the remarkable loyalty of our Starbucks Rewards members as well as convenience offerings, including delivery and curbside for our On-The-Go business. A comment on our international business beyond the U.S. and China. We have seen very strong growth and strong unit economics in these markets. It is becoming an important third leg for us. Looking outside the stores in the third quarter, our Channel Development segment revenue was $449 million, down 6% year-over-year, while delivering operating margin of 46.3%, up 630 basis points year-over-year, reflecting SKU rationalization as well as the shifts taking place with a more on-the-go customer. We continue to see the opportunity for growth in channel-through innovation, as evidenced by the highly successful ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink introduced last quarter and the Grab and Go series launched in Japan in partnership with Suntory. We saw unprecedented sales during the first month of the launch in Japan, just as we did with our cream cheese lattes in China. Our fourth strategic priority is fueling productivity. We think of our business as a theater in the front and a factory in the back. We have a clear opportunity to maximize efficiencies and effectiveness while reducing waste by focusing on a vast opportunity in stores and also above stores. We have focused on meaningful improvements in staffing and scheduling to ensure that we have the right combination of the right partners in the right roles with the right hours to fuel both engagement and productivity. We also closed the third quarter on target with our waste reduction goals as we strive to make operations as efficient as possible while preserving the Starbucks Experience. This is just the beginning of the productivity journey at Starbucks. We have broadened the areas beyond our initial reinvention plan to include our end-to-end supply chain, direct and indirect procurement, how we design and build stores as well as opportunities across technology and our supporting processes. Arthur Valdez, Jr., who joined us recently as the Chief Supply Chain Officer, brings three decades of supply chain and logistics leadership to Starbucks and will be critical in these efforts. Along with sales leverage, what I could see in opportunities with future productivity gains gives me real confidence in long-term progressive margin expansion. Finally, the DNA of Starbucks is nothing without our culture. This is inherent to the company and something I was quick to learn through my immersion and experience working in stores. Our fifth strategic priority is reinvigorating our culture of human connection. We will measure our success on our business performance through the lens of humanity, just as we always have. And that requires us to reinvigorate our culture. Our partners are the heart of our business for me. We will continue to invest in the overall partner experience through compensation and benefits as well as through in-store improvements. At Starbucks, we strive to be a different kind of company, but we do recognize that we are operating in a different kind of world. It is through that lens we have spent the last several months rolling out a new unifying mission for the company, new promises for all our stakeholders and soon, a new set of values that will reground the culture of Starbucks in our heritage and a more modernized workplace. Before I turn the call over to Rachel, I want to leave you with this. It is an honor to be driving such a stellar branded company in one of its best chapters. While we continue to navigate in an environment with a heightened level of macro uncertainty around the world, we will execute with discipline and rigor on our priorities. After all, Starbucks is a strong, resilient brand delivering to customers what the world needs most right now, human connection. As I look at the runway in front of us, the possibilities to deliver that connection are truly limitless. What I see is a durable iconic business with multiple paths available for us to deliver on our long-term revenue growth of 10% to 12% and earnings growth of 15% to 20%. I look forward to discussing our strategies and plans for fiscal year 2024 and beyond in greater detail in November in an extended investor call organized in a hybrid media format. We would share more details in the coming weeks. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rachel to talk more about our remarkable third quarter financial performance of the quarter. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our Q3 performance, which beat our expectations as our innovation and our brand continues to resonate with our customers around the world, fueling demand across our stores and digitally. Our U.S. business delivered record breaking performance on many fronts, and our China business continued to recover in line with our expectations. It's clear we have abundant opportunity ahead. Our overall performance was bolstered by the progress we're making against our strategies, specifically our reinvention plan and it's unfolding into tangible financial results. As a reminder, when we set guidance at the beginning of the year, we said that the benefits from our reinvention plan would amplify at the back half of this fiscal year, and that is exactly what we're seeing, highlighting our ability to effectively reinvest in our business for the benefit of all stakeholders. Our Q3 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.2 billion, up 12% from the prior year or up 14% when excluding more than 1% impact of foreign currency translation. The strength of the brand, loyalty of our customers and innovative products fueled strong sales resulting in double-digit consolidated comparable store sales growth of 10%. In addition to the 10% comparable store sales growth, revenue also benefited from 7% net new company-operated store growth globally year-over-year as well as continued momentum in our global licensed market. Q3 consolidated operating margin expanded 50 basis points from the prior year to 17.4%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by sales leverage, pricing and productivity improvement from increased efficiency in our U.S. stores. Margin expansion was partially offset by investments in store partners as well as higher G&A costs in support of reinvention. Q3 EPS was $1, up 19% from the prior year, driven by strong performance across our business segments, demonstrating the power of a broad global portfolio. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q3. North America delivered another record quarter of revenue with $6.7 billion in Q3, up 11% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales, consisting of 6% and 1% growth in average ticket and transactions, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% year-over-year. Our results were further strengthened by the continued momentum from our licensed store business. Our U.S. business delivered 7% comparable store sales growth in Q3, primarily driven by solid ticket performance with 6% growth, which benefited from a combination of pricing, food attach and customization. Our customers have relatively adopted the practice of customizing their beverages, allowing for a more personalized and differentiated experience while contributing to a growing higher-margin ticket with abundant opportunity ahead. In Q3, over 60% of beverages were customized, representing a 9% growth when compared to just five years ago. Cold Foam, for example, continues to be a customization favorite. This quarter's all-time high food attach was driven by two of every five customers attaching food with their orders, up over 25% from just five years ago, driven by our delicious breakfast sandwiches leading to an all-time high ticket in the quarter. Transaction comparable sales growth in the quarter was 1%, which combined with record ticket drove the highest average weekly sales in our company's history, surpassing the all-time high set during holiday in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. We are seeing more customers come into our stores with customer counts up 5% year-over-year, in line with the record high set in Q1 of this fiscal year. Our growing tech enabled convenience capabilities are driving our customers to engage more deeply with Starbucks as evidenced by the growth in customization, attach and mix shift towards more premium beverages, leading to record demand and incremental higher-margin revenue. Another proof point of our continued demand is the ongoing success of our Starbucks Rewards program, which ended the quarter achieving records on many fronts, a record number of active members, spend per member and total member spend. These records alone reflect the stickiness of our business, but we are most pleased by the consistency of our customer connection stores, which highlights customer satisfaction and the delivery of the Starbucks Experience. U.S. licensed stores revenue continued its momentum this quarter, up 21% from the prior year with strength across the portfolio and vending food (ph) from increases in post-COVID travel, especially return of business travel, which benefits from Starbucks Connect, our digital offering, now rolled out across all major U.S. airports. North America's operating margin was 21.8% in Q3, contracting 40 basis points from the prior year as expected, primarily driven by the timing of productivity focused labor investments as part of our reinvention plan. For color, the reinvention investments included partner wages and benefits as well as an increase in targeted partner training. The contraction was partially offset by favorable impacts of pricing coupled with labor productivity and sales leverage largely from the ramping benefits of the reinvention plan. Moving on to International. In the quarter, the segment delivered $2 billion in revenue, the highest revenue since Q4 of fiscal year 2021, up 24% from the prior year or up 30% when excluding more than 5% impact from foreign currency translation. Our revenue growth reflects double-digit growth in all major markets, including China, which benefited from lapping prior year mobility restrictions. The growth is attributable to a 24% increase in comparable store sales, which was driven by 21% transaction growth as customers continued returning to our stores, largely in China as well, as remarkable digital engagement through the increasing Starbucks Rewards member base. In addition, the International segment delivered 11% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year, with China contributing a significant portion of store growth as we continue to invest ahead of the curve in China, supporting our long-term ambitions for the market. Excluding China, our international markets combined continued their strong momentum with revenue growing 11% year-over-year in Q3 or up 14% when excluding a 3 percentage impact from foreign currency translation. The meaningful growth was a byproduct of our successful innovation and digital engagement across various markets. Excluding China, International had 8% store growth year-over-year and approximately 35% of our new stores year-to-date were drive-through, resulting in approximately 15% of total store count having the drive-through channel furthering our ability to create new occasions and serve new customers globally. Shifting to China. China had a strong quarter, delivering their highest beverage sales for Q3 over the last five years, underpinned by comparable store sales growth of 46% in Q3, in line with our expectations. Comp growth was driven by strong transactions, which benefited from the lapping prior year Q3 mobility restrictions. As the market continues to recover, we're pleased with the consistency of demand fueled by new product innovation, increasing digital capability, record sales of our Dragon Dumpling Festival food and an acceleration of new store openings amounting to nearly three stores per day. Average weekly sales in China grew quarter-over-quarter and we expect this to continue into Q4 with average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits, resulting in similar sized comp growth for the quarter. With the current demand and the long-term opportunity we see in China, we continue to invest in our stores, partners and communities. And we'll have our largest roasting plant outside of the U.S., the Coffee Innovation Park opening this fall. Our unwavering investments have contributed to our healthy recovery and performance, positioning us well for the long term. Operating margin for the International segment was 19% in Q3, expanding an impressive 660 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage from lapping prior year mobility restrictions in China, partially offset by investments in digital and partner wages as well as inflationary pressures. Shifting to Channel Development. The segment's revenue contracted 6% year-over-year to $449 million in Q3, driven largely by at-home coffee while proudly holding the number one share position at 15.1%. Despite the softening of revenue, the segment remained strong due to the breadth and depth of the portfolio. We are particularly proud of our North American coffee partnership, which continued to see category-leading sales and share growth outpacing the total category. Our innovation continues to distinguish us while benefiting the segment overall with strong performance. A perfect example of this is the award-winning ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink that Laxman mentioned earlier. The segment's operating margin was 46.3% in Q3, up a resounding 630 basis points from prior year, driven by strength in the North America coffee partnership and sales mix shift. As previously shared, operating margin has returned to the segment's normal mid-40s range, a testament of our strong partnerships and the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Now moving to guidance for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Given we're in the final quarter of our fiscal year with clear visibility into full year results, combined with the momentum we've built, the pace of reinvention plan unfolding and the strength of our global portfolio, we have the confidence to move our full year earnings growth from the plans we shared in November of the low end of the 15% to 20% growth range to a growth of 16% to 17% for full year fiscal year 2023. Despite the macroeconomic environment variables, we are poised to move our earnings growth guidance as it reflects the strength of our brand globally and the long-term durability that we are building through our reinvention plan. As it relates to our remaining guidance, we are pleased to reaffirm full year guidance on all other measures. As a reminder, that includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, global comp growth near the high end of 7% to 9% and solid margin expansion. Store growth, capital spend and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged from what we shared previously. As a reminder, we expect an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points on fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings, respectively. With that, let me provide further detail around our Q4. First, in regard to International. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand year-over-year but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China's average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter-over-quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits in Q4, with similar sized comp growth as the market is lapping government stimulus for customers and favorable discounting from prior year coupled with the timing of difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth. We continue to expect a low to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis, consistent with our prior guidance as well as record-breaking year of net new store development. Finally, as it relates to Channel Development, we expect revenue pressures to continue in Q4, driven largely by the at-home coffee business as customer behavior shift with revenue expected to be largely flat to prior year. However, we expect margins will continue to be above the mid-40s range, driven by seasonality, leveling to a strong mid-40s margin business for the full year. In summary, here are my key takeaways from my discussion today. Our momentum is in full swing and our strong brand, successful product innovations and financial and operational performance across the globe is a testament to our focus and our discipline. Our reinvention plan investments are unfolding and providing tangible returns throughout our business. As a result of our solid performance, our full year fiscal year 2023 guidance including revenue has been reiterated and we are confident to move our earnings growth to 16% to 17% for full year fiscal 2023. Finally, I want to say thank you to our partners around the globe for showing up every day and making customer's day brighter by extending active kindness. It's because of you that the future is truly limitless. With that, we'll open the call to Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays. Please state your question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. I had one question and then just one clarification to Laxman's comments. The question is just on the U.S. comp and traffic. It looks like the traffic was modestly positive this quarter, slowing a little bit from last quarter. And I think it's safe to say that there's going to be some slowing in the menu pricing in forward quarters, and therefore, the average ticket. So with the comp slowing and the average ticket likely to slow, I'm just wondering your confidence in the current algorithm for that 7% to 9% comp looking into next year. And the clarification is just Laxman, I think you mentioned that you would update long-term guidance when you report the fiscal fourth quarter. But with that said, I think you did mention the 10% to 12% revenue growth long term and 15% to 20% EPS growth. So is that safe to say that those are levels you're comfortable with as we look out into future years or all things are on the table as you offer your initial guidance next quarter?\nLaxman Narasimhan: Well, there were several questions in there so let me just break this up. There was a question on the third quarter. There was a question about our expectations for the balance of the year. And then there was a question about the -- what I've said earlier about my confidence and the multiple paths to achieving the 10% to 12% growth as well as the 15% to 20% earnings growth, and I'll comment on all three. So let me first start with Q3. Q3 for us was a very strong quarter, as Rachel mentioned as well. It's in line with our expectations. Our comps were consistent every month. We came off a lap in Q2, which was the impact of Omicron, and so we had a 7% comp, very consistent month over bond. The comp in Q3 was lapping a 9% comp from last year, so the 16% comp on a two year basis. And so if you look at this, it's really the strength of the brand, the actions and pricing we took but also the growing levels of customization and the levels of food attach that Rachel mentioned as well. And that is what led to the average weekly sales in Q3 continuing to break records. Now your question on transactions. Transactions in Q3 grew year-over-year across all dayparts. Traffic is below 2019 levels but units per store are above the 2019 average coming from higher food attach. So the food growth along with more customization and judicious price increases led to this record weekly sales that you saw in the quarter. So transactions, as I said, have grown year-over-year across all dayparts. We also had a strong increase in ticket. There's a sort of balance between the pricing, which is very judicious, but also customization and increase in the number of units. Delivery sales doubled in Q3 compared to a year ago, most of which is incremental occasions for our customers. So that's Q3. Let me just highlight something about our loyal customers because that, in some ways, gives you a sense of the strength of the brand. Our [indiscernible] active Starbucks Rewards members have grown 4 million in number year-over-year. They come in more frequently, they buy more. And interestingly enough, as we've seen our sizes, we actually see the growth of our largest sizes over our smaller sizes. So we're not seeing the down trading in our customer base. Our stored value credit, the balance of the card is also great sequentially. That\u2019s how we exit Q3. As you look at the balance of the year, we feel that, first of all, the annualization of the pricing actions will continue. We don\u2019t have any lagging significant comp impacts from the previous year. And we do expect pricing trends to moderate as we go into the final quarter, as you said, but we do expect to end the year in line with the comp expectations of 7% to 9% growth that we had set. Now in terms of answering your question about the long term, the \u2013 what I have seen in both top line as well as in the earnings growth gives me real confidence in the fact that what we\u2019ve guided to previously, the 10% to 12% revenue growth and the earnings growth of 15% to 20%, we have multiple paths to getting to that. So that just really signals the resilience of the business, the durability of the brand and the multiple paths we see, both in terms of top line as well as earnings growth, which I\u2019m happy to elaborate on.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please state your question.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi. Good afternoon. I was curious about the comments on the number of hours per partner. Can you give us kind of some color around where that is now and where you'd like that to be in the U.S.? How long you think it takes to get there? And kind of what the associated productivity improvements would be? I assume that's throughput related but would love some color on that.\nLaxman Narasimhan: So we're feeling very good about the progress we are making in this area. Our foundational reinvention plan that we announced last year is essential to the improvements that we're seeing now. We're making very good progress on it. There are meaningful improvements in the store environment as well as the productivity gains that we're making. Our equipment rollout is on track. Our peaks are growing faster than the rest of the dayparts. And we're making strong progress on the scheduling and staffing basis. If you look on the retail team, barista turnover is down, as I said, 9% reduction versus previous year, a 2% reduction versus just the second quarter. And what you see is the combination of investments as well as the scheduling improvements that we're making, the economic proposition, the take-home pay to our baristas has improved by 20% year-over-year and we have more improvements coming. And you're going to see us make improvements month-over-month in terms of improvements that we're making. I mean, we're going to ensure that we continue to increase these average hours through better staffing and scheduling but also work to accommodate their preferences, including the many that we attract to a keen on a part-time schedule. So this is progress that we're making week over week, month over month, and there's more to come next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Charles, TD Cowen. Please state your question.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thanks. It's a two-part question on China. Belinda, it's hard to ignore the amount of discount activity in China by competitive coffee shops, that one competitor indicated earlier today will persist for a number of years. And so curious if you could talk about new strategies in place for Starbucks to help protect traffic without degrading the brand's premium status. And then my other question is either for Rachel or Laxman, but you mentioned margin headroom a couple of times. Amid that volatile China macro, what are the offsets if the model China's performance weakens? The 10-Q, I know, called out a sequential increase in North America productivity improvements from 2Q so maybe that's perhaps an area where there's more to grow or perhaps there's another area that I'm not thinking about that allows for some cushion in the model if we were to see China macro become a little bit more uncertain.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Got it. I'll get Belinda to take the first question, Rachel to take the second, and then I'll come in with some summary comments at the end. Belinda?\nBelinda Wong: Great. Thank you for your question, Andrew. First of all, I want to say that there's no noticeable impact to our sales performance in Q3. In fact, we're very -- I'm very happy with our Q3 performance and the sequential improvement that we achieved. We have been and will continue to stay focused and disciplined in our discount investment to optimize and deliver incremental return. On the competition topic, we welcome competition. They actually expand the coffee market and accelerate adoption and vacancy of coffee consumption. Different brands bring in different value propositions and occasions, and I just want to talk about our value propositions. We're in the human connection business. Since day one 24 years ago, when we entered China, we have been focusing on delivering a premium experience defined by the quality of our coffee and the emotional experience we've built with our customers and our partners that can't be replicated anywhere else. And our China business has strategically built to serve a diverse range of customer needs and occasions, physical and digital, fast and slow. And the unique business model and capabilities we have built that Lex has mentioned gives us distinctive competitive advantages. So we'll double down on our investment in our product innovation store experience, digitalization in our people to create even more distinctive advantages to capture the limitless opportunities in China in the future. Thank you. We're playing the long game.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Yeah. And Andrew, I would just follow that up with as we look at the performance in China, we're encouraged by the healthy margins that we're seeing today. And even as we see a shift more towards digital, which does have a lower margin percentage overall, it's driving more revenue. And that's no better way to drive margin expansion than through sales leverage, so we're encouraged by what we're seeing today. In addition to that, the team has been very judicious about creating operational efficiencies so the margin opportunity in China continues to be healthy. That said, if we do see that there are challenges in the future, we've structured our guidance such that it allows us room, which is one of the reasons why we're very intentional and being more directive around qualitative language on margins, saying this year would be solid margin expansion and the future would be progressive, which will allow us to continue to navigate the business and continue to invest where needed so that we can deliver on that 15% to 20% earnings growth that we've guided to.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Well, let me just close with a couple of observations. I was in the China market for an extended period in this quarter. And I got to actually work with our partners and stores. I got to spend time in our supply chain. I got to spend time in our support centers, including looking at our teams that are leading what we do in digital. And I have to tell you, I've been going to China, studying China, advising on China, running business with China for 20 years. And this is a very unique business. It's been a business that's been built with love, and it's remarkable in terms of the passion our partners have. I was very impressed. I think it is still early days. I mean, when you start looking at the headroom you have, and as Belinda said, the headroom is large. So as people come into the market, they're essentially driving a conversion of tea to coffee, which of course, remember, for 20 years, we've been doing and we've got to 12 cups per capita. The numbers, by the way, significantly higher in Shanghai, but it's still much lower than a tea drinking country like Japan, which has had a history of coffee house culture over time. So the headroom is really large. If you look at what we also do with our brand, don't forget, we have these -- we proudly serve a Starbucks points of customer connection. In addition, our ready-to-drink partnership with is also growing significantly. And we're also available for coffee at home, so our brand is being built across multiple channels and the investments we're making in digital are very strong. With the investments we're making to more vertically integrate our supply chain, it gives a greater flexibility in China and also greater productivity. So I think in addition to that, your other question on productivity, as I look at what I see with regard to the opportunities we have both in the stores and out of our stores, and that, by the way, cuts across all the whole business, we have further productivity options, which just gave us confidence on margin in terms of the progressive margin improvement that we have made. So early days in China, market going to expand and further opportunities for us to get productivity.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question, please. Thank you.\nBrian Harbour: Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask just about the point on kind of supply chain and procurement. I think you guys have been pretty clear on the labor side, what the opportunity is there, what you're doing. Could you elaborate though just more on the supply chain side and where you see the most opportunity there? How that factors into where you think margins can go?\nLaxman Narasimhan: Great. I'll take that. As I look at what we've been working on over the last six months or so, it's very clear that the investments we're making in our stores is yielding the kind of productivity that you would see, the efficiency as well as the throughput that we get. But what is interesting is if you look end to end, we have opportunities pretty much everywhere, both in terms of what we buy, how we buy it, how we flow products to stores, the services that we provide to our business, the technology investments that we're making, we have opportunities everywhere. And I think that\u2019s part of the reason why you see we\u2019ve added Arthur Valdez to the team. And just an example, the availability of record sandwiches went up over the course of the last quarter. And what you see as a consequence of that is the attach rates went up as a result of it. And so I think that those are just examples of the kind of improvements we\u2019re seeing. Clearly, we\u2019re seeing benefits, as you know, with regard to freight and the cost of it. And the ability for us to rethink how we do what we do is large. And so there is opportunity there for us in terms of bringing automation in, flowing products better, buying better and frankly, developing a supply base that can also keep up with the kind of scale and growth plans that we have.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. I had a question on transaction growth and what you've seen in your Rewards membership. And I'm wondering if there's an insight there over time, since 2019, you've had over 80% increase in your active Rewards membership. It's 15% higher than a year ago. And you noted that transactions were up 1% in the quarter and down versus four years ago. So it looks like maybe frequency is down. Maybe the consumer is using you differently, consolidating orders, certainly bolstering the check by having more items per order. But are you seeing any sort of solves from a marketing standpoint? You have very good visibility into what your consumers are doing. You have over half of your orders, you know your consumer and you see what they're doing and the frequency they're coming. So I'm wondering about the tools you see from a consumer side versus some of the more operational stuff you've been talking about as ways to unlock growth. Thanks.\nLaxman Narasimhan: I think first of all, let me just clarify something. In your question, I think you suggested -- you made a couple of comments about our Starbucks Rewards members. Let me just give you -- let me just address that. We have more of them, so we had a 4 million growth year-over-year. It's a 15% growth. Our Starbucks Rewards members come in more frequently. So they're not coming in less frequently, they come in more frequently. They buy more after joining the program, right? And as I said, they're also choosing larger sizes as they come in. The investments we have made in marketing and what we're doing with digital, in particular, what it tells you is that we are even further increasing the pace at which we are bringing innovation and changes in terms of what we do. We have a whole list of benefits that we could bring. And we're taking up the agility in the company in terms of the investments we make, which will help us make this even bigger and stronger. So that's the way I would address your question about the Starbucks Rewards members. It's a key area of growth. The other thing you should be aware of is as we have scaled this, we have scaled this to connect, which is all our licensed stores. And I think 40% of our licensed stores today have connect, and we're seeing growth in our license business as well as a consequence of that. Finally, we're scaling this globally. You're seeing us take it to our geographic partners the Starbucks Digital Solutions. There is very strong adoption. And you see the kind of results you see, which our geographic license partners are announcing or are sharing with us. I mean, very strong results, and Starbucks Digital Solutions is extremely capable of delivering that. In China, we're seeing real growth there, too. And in fact, that is where we're making a big investment as well in digital because we see that as a way not just to strengthen our relationship but also to drive results through what we do with digital. So I think overall, this is a big area. It's a big area of focus for me. And it's part of the second big priority for us around strengthening and scaling digital. I\u2019ll make a last comment. We have a fundamentally amazing capability called Deep Brew inside the company. It\u2019s where we have made investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I think the ability for us to be at the vanguard of this and to early adopt what we do in this area furthermore, given all the innovations that are going on, and the re-platforming that\u2019s going on just gives me greater confidence in what we do in digital. This will be a key area of growth for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. I was hoping that if you could address the biggest opportunities to kind of regrow same-store transactions versus 2019? I mean, what those -- I guess, as you see kind of the bigger opportunities to be, whether in daypart or specific type of customer. And secondly, with same-store traffic up 1%, do you feel like you are specifically addressing peak hour throughput? In other words, is the factory part of Starbucks, as you would call it, properly set up? I mean, is the engine specifically running such that you can achieve all those peak hour transactions, especially where mobile orders might be coming in at a very short amount of time. Thank you.\nLaxman Narasimhan: I think, John, thank you for the question. Let me first start with your peak question. We're doing definitely better than what we did before because of the investments that we are making, but we still have further headroom. And I think as we make more investments as we sort of further refine how we think about scheduling and staffing, how we ensure that we get the flows right in our store, we will have the ability to take that up even further. So the peak day parts are actually growing and growing really well. Now to answer your question about opportunities, there's opportunity pretty much across the board. If I look at beverage and beverage innovation, terrific, strong innovation coming, more to come. If I look at dayparts, we have opportunities in the afternoon daypart. And our Starbucks Refreshers is a way for us to attack that. And as you know, we have -- it's a big and sizable business, but it doesn't yet fully meet the full needs of what we could do in the afternoon. If I look at food attach, it\u2019s at the highest level we\u2019ve had, but we have the ability for us to continue to elevate and innovate in food in order for us to further grab the opportunity that we have there. Delivery is an opportunity that, as I said, it\u2019s just early days. I mean, we\u2019ve also built a $1 billion lag. And that\u2019s just the U.S. If I look at China, too, it\u2019s growing enormously. So we have a leg there too in terms of what we can do with delivery. And furthermore, I said earlier that we actually have an opportunity with regard to the net store growth in the U.S. There\u2019s real headroom for us to also locate our stores where we see customer growth, smaller towns, different geographies. And we\u2019re clearly looking at all of it, not just with our own stores but also with licensed stores. So John, it\u2019s a pretty rich set of areas as I look at growth and what we could get that is available for us, and this is just North America.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please state your question.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to come back to North America operating margins. Could you maybe give us a sense of some of the drivers of North America operating margins going forward, maybe in order of magnitude? Do you see a path back to, if not, exceeding pre-pandemic levels? And then I guess, within that, do you feel like the mix of drive-throughs maybe heavier on drive-throughs these days versus where you were pre-pandemic? Does that help push the operating margins back up and above pre-pandemic levels? Thank you.\nRachel Ruggeri: Hi, Peter. This is Rachel. Thank you for the question. We've been encouraged by the performance we've seen in North America, both on the top line and on the bottom line. And year-to-date in North America, we're sitting at about 19.9% (ph) margin with about 40 basis points of expansion, and that's driven by a combination of sales leverage, pricing, the benefits from the reinvention plan showing up in productivity, which is helping to offset some of the investments we've made and we see opportunity to continue to expand margin over the long term as the benefits of the reinvention continue to amplify. And so I would look at that as really the reinvention is a significant driver of our opportunity in terms of margin expansion. Through reinvention, we're unlocking capacity to be able to serve demand that leads to sales leverage. And in addition to that, we're creating efficiency and resiliency in the middle of the business that's also supporting margin expansion. So I look at it more about what we've already seen progress today with reinvention, what we would expect to see going forward. And that leads us to solid margin expansion at the company level this year and progressive margin expansion in the future, which of course, will be driven in large part by North America.\nLaxman Narasimhan: I just want to say one thing. I think we're at the top of the hour but there are a few more questions online. And so we're going to go over and take those questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nSara Senatore: Okay. Thank you. A question and then maybe a point of clarification. I know, Rachel, you talked about the high end of the 7% to 9% same-store sales guide for the full year. But there's a lot going on, still some reopening tailwinds perhaps in China. Certainly, I think in the past, you've talked about even in other markets with more travel. So kind of being at the high end of that range, I guess I'm trying to think through kind of the ability, especially insofar as the first half in the U.S. was -- looks like it will be substantially higher than the second half. So trying to just make sure I'm understanding how you're thinking about the ongoing comp. And then the question I have, Laxman, you mentioned unit growth. I think in the past, when Starbucks has accelerated unit growth, there have been periods where it's coincided with slower traffic and ultimately kind of a need to rationalize the store base or reset it. What are the guardrails in place to change that this time around to make sure the unit growth doesn't conflict with continued traffic growth in your existing stores?\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Thanks, Sara. I'll take the first question around comp. And when we look at the balance of the year related to comp, we just expect the momentum in the business to continue. So when you think about in North America in this current quarter, we were encouraged by the fact that our growth in comp was a combination of transaction growth. So we saw transactions grow above prior year in every single daypart. And that was coupled with an elevated ticket. And that was a combination of not only strategic pricing but a balanced contribution from increased customization as well as record attach. That drove strong growth in the quarter that, I would say, from a revenue standpoint, we have fundamentals from a revenue perspective that are broad. And we would expect that to continue, that momentum to continue as we look at the balance of the year and going on a full year basis. So that will continue to be fueled through innovation as well as through continued growth in our digital customer rewards membership and our increasing capability around convenience, including growth in digital. So we see all of that as signs to help support the 7% to 9% comp range that we've guided on a full year basis. Now when you think about outside of North America, we'd say we expect our recovery to sustain in China, and that was through the guidance I gave around a low to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis as well as contribution from International and the momentum we're seeing. So we think across the board, the momentum we're seeing, the recovery in China, coupled with the strong performance we're seeing in North America gives us the confidence to be able to maintain the 7% to 9% comp range on a full year basis for North America and then at the high end of the range for total company.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Sara, to your question about our store network and how we see it, I am not concerned. I mean, I think there's a very small number of stores that you would normally consider, that we would consider in the normal course of business that we would look at and say we may have a challenge with them. But there's nothing in there that concerns me. What I'm looking at more from the standpoint of net store growth are the opportunities we have to further enhance our presence in many markets where we are underpenetrated but also exposed in some of our core markets, multiple formats. I think we've referenced this before as purpose-driven formats in terms of what we can bring into markets in order to meet various needs that customers have.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Joshua Long with Stephens. Please state your question.\nJoshua Long: Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. A couple of times in your prepared commentary, you referenced somewhat would sound like to be normalizing demand within the at-home coffee channel within Channel Development. So just curious if you could unpack that a little bit. I'm just curious if you're seeing shifts within the portfolio on that side or if that's kind of an ongoing shift back into kind of retail brick-and-mortar as we get back to kind of return to office or just additionally, any sort of commentary you can provide there in terms of how you're attacking that and capturing share as the chips continue to unfold.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Right. We have very strong share in out-of-home coffee. I think we're tied for #1 so we feel good about that. At the same time, what you are seeing with the customer is the customer is becoming more on-the-go. And what you are seeing with that is if you stop looking at channels where we have products like we have with our North American coffee partnership or frankly, our stores or our licensed stores, we're clearly benefiting from more from customers on the go. So you see some of that shift take place. But at-home coffee, our shares are very strong. Go ahead, please.\nRachel Ruggeri: But I would add that we are seeing a balance in the portfolio. So that's one of the things we're encouraged by is that while we are seeing consumer behavior shift some, we're seeing an increase in our ready-to-drink both domestically and internationally. And that's helping to support the margin expansion we saw in this quarter and the mid-40s margin that we're guiding to on a full year basis. So I would say in this case, it's the strength of the diversified portfolio that's working to our advantage.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please state your question.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Just a question on the Siren System in the United States. How many stores have the Siren System today? And is the number on track with your internal expectations? And what kind of uplift in productivity margin is this initial rollout hinting at?\nLaxman Narasimhan: Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Yeah. From a Siren System standpoint, we're in the -- just the testing phase today. We're on track to be able to launch in conjunction with our renovations in new stores next year. And next year, we expect to be less than 10% of our stores will have the Siren System, reaching about 40% of our stores by the year 2026. And so we're encouraged by the progress we're seeing, we're seeing good results, and we do expect it will help lead to margin expansion in the future. It will be one of the many, what I'd say, equipment investments we're making as well as the investments we're making in the staffing and scheduling within our stores as well as the overall operational excellence focus that the team has. The combination of all of that in North America will lead to a more stabilized production environment, which will help drive margin expansion well into the future. And so we're encouraged by what we're seeing today and we're looking forward to furthering the launch.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Just one thing I'd add to is our pipeline of equipment innovation is very strong. And the way we manage the portfolio, the way we manage the pipeline is very strong. And if you look at some of the commitments that we have made around investments like the portable cold foam blender, it's one of the fastest rollouts in our history in terms of how it's reached all our stores. So when we have them ready, when we do the renovations, when we have new stores built in automatically, they are actually getting the Siren System. And I feel very good about the way we are managing the portfolio of investments that we are making in this area.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please state your question.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good afternoon. I have a follow-up question on the commentary related to the longer-term targets. I know we're going to get more details in November on this. But I think the comments were that you have multiple paths to deliver both the revenue and the earnings targets. And I wanted to focus in on the revenue part of that. I guess if you continue to grow at the rate you're growing from a unit growth perspective, I think you would need to maintain that comp outlook that you gave previously to get to the revenue guidance, unless I'm missing something. So I guess the question is, are you signaling that maybe the unit growth element could change and the comp element could change and you could still get there? I guess, maybe any clarification on that front would be helpful.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Great. Let me take this point on the top line. First of all, Starbucks is an iconic brand with a very strong appeal and durability. If we just look in the last year, the affinity of our brand has strengthened, right? The brand has ranged across consumer segments, across geographies, across occasions. So to your question on top line, we have a historically high number of customers who visit our stores. But it's also in many of the markets around the world, even as China recovers. We have a strong pipeline of innovation across beverage, across food and equipment, and there are even more opportunities across the world with different formats, as I mentioned earlier, with dayparts and a focus on dayparts and how we can bring more innovation, particularly on the daypart side and with new business models like delivery. We built this billion-dollar lag, and it's only now beginning operationally refocused on that and saying, how do we ensure that we continue to support that kind of delivery with an operating model that would actually help. I mentioned earlier that we have terrific capabilities in digital as well as in artificial intelligence and machine learning that we're just unleashing with even more agility in terms of how we strengthen and scale with digital. And it's not just our stores but it's also in the Connect stores, and it's at Starbucks digital solutions across the world. We have strengthened pricing capabilities. And as we make these investments, we're going to get even better in terms of revenue management, building on the great work that's already been done in terms of managing mix, in terms of managing sizing and in managing customization. We have a lobby that is further opportunity for us in terms of how we grow. So I think just in terms of that, there's real opportunity. In terms of net store growth, as I mentioned earlier, we do have even more headroom in new store builds, both in the U.S. as well as internationally. Our China number is the milestone to even get greater penetration. And some of the opportunities we see and the unit economics that we see in Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa is real. And we have a range of formats where we can deliver this third place experience but also deliver experiential convenience powered by digital in an omnichannel way. So I look at its brand, I look at its consumer appeal, I look at its durability, I look at its strength, I look at its range, it feels very good to me that we will get to a revenue growth of 10% to 12%, and by the way, the earnings growth of 15% to 20% over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nZachary Fadem: Hey. Good afternoon. So following up on the long-term algo. If your comps were to slow to a mid-single digit level for whatever reason, would you say that your 15% to 20% EPS is still on the table? And if so, could you talk about what margin and other levers that keep you confident?\nA \u2013 Laxman Narasimhan: So thank you for your question. As I said earlier, we see significant margin improvement opportunities at work that will come to productivity. We\u2019ll set the appropriate details of this at a later point. But I can just tell you this, as I look at the investments we\u2019re making in store, but importantly, what we see about the store. We have opportunities. So I feel very good about the 15% to 20% earnings growth.\nOperator: Thank you. That was the last question. I will now turn the call over to Laxman Narasimhan for closing remarks.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you all for joining us on this third quarter 2023 earnings call. I deeply appreciate it, and I look forward to seeing you all in November. Until then, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great evening.",

            "name": "Laxman Narasimhan",
            "content": "Thank you, Tiffany, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. In a few moments, Rachel Ruggeri will walk you through the detailed results of the third quarter, and Belinda Wong would then join us for Q&A. To start, our strong third quarter results point to all-around momentum in the business. This quarter, we grew consolidated revenue by 12%, up 14% when excluding more than a 1% impact in foreign currency translation to a record $9.2 billion. Importantly, earnings growth of 19% outpaced revenue growth with margin expanding by 50 basis points to 17.4%. Our strong performance reflects the strengthened foundation of our business, resulting from the significant progress we are making against our reinvention plan. Since stepping into the role, I have now traveled to every region, working directly with partners. I left each interaction impressed by the differentiated global appeal of the Starbucks brand powered by innovation and anchored in our unique ability to deliver human connection. These experiences give me great confidence in the significant growth and margin opportunities in front of us, positioning us well to strengthen the brand and create outsized long-term shareholder value. It was this time last year when Howard and the team identified the must-win opportunities and investments for our foundational reinvention plan. While Rachel will walk you through detailed results, I will now outline the momentum we have from the quarter in five key priority areas while pointing out where we see further headroom. Our first priority, we will elevate the brand by running great stores. This comes to life in the strengthened execution in North America. Our North America team delivered record revenue in the quarter, with a growth of 11% underpinned by 7% comparable same-store sales growth, leading to the highest average weekly sales in our history. Our ticket growth was driven by pricing, customization and food attach. Additionally, we continue to see improvements in items sold per labor hour. Operationally, we are seeing evidence that we are executing better. Barista attrition, where we are already industry-leading has improved further by 11% year-over-year. Through scheduling and staffing improvements, we are beginning to increase the number of hours per partner in store, critical to running great stores and improving partner engagement while also improving productivity. Innovation in beverage and equipment continues to drive our business. In fact, our cold business reached 75% of U.S. beverage sales this past quarter. As the leader in premium coffee, we are particularly encouraged to see cold espresso beverages were up 13% year-over-year. Additionally, we continue to elevate the premium coffee experience in both cold and hot. For example, the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewer continues as planned, delivering a larger variety of high-quality hot coffee, including decaffeinated on demand. Our innovative equipment rollout remains on track, are faster and easier to use portable handheld cold form blenders continue to have an outsized impact for both the partner and customer experience. The cold foam blenders are now rolled out to all U.S. company-operated stores in time to meet the summer demand for Starbucks Refreshers' frozen beverages. The new blenders support the additional growth of cold foam, the fastest-growing customization at Starbucks. Modifiers such as cold foam now contribute to over $1 billion in revenue annually. The Mastrena 2 espresso machines and new warming ovens are also now in all U.S. company-operated stores. Taken all together, our equipment investments that we began last year are supporting labor efficiencies, allowing us to increase capacity during our busiest day parts. These investments are both elevating the Starbucks Experience and further differentiating us from competitors. In this past quarter in North America, we once again saw our unit volume outpace pre-COVID levels by double-digits with high attach rates across dayparts, the mornings as well as the afternoons. Also in thinking about dayparts, our Starbucks Refreshers platform, which skews towards an alternate location occasion has seen double-digit growth this past quarter in every daypart. With this success, we are leaning in even further with a systematic pipeline of innovation across dayparts. This includes this summer's launch of our Starbucks Refreshers frozen beverages, customization in our Oleato beverage platform as well as with our cold-pressed Cold Brew, which enters a testing phase across a few dozen stores this fourth quarter with a rollout across U.S. company-owned stores expected by the end of fiscal year 2024. Food is also fueling growth. This past quarter, we saw all-time high food attach and sales of breakfast sandwiches. As an attached business, food drove a higher ticket in the quarter, improving volume growth and contributing to the record average weekly sales. Overall, we are excited about the significant opportunity in food as we explore new, elevated and convenient food offerings. We will share more of this in time. We also continue to grow and diversify our store portfolio. We see significant headroom for new store growth in underpenetrated areas in the U.S., including smaller cities as well as new formats in larger metros. New stores and remodels are where we are first prioritizing our Siren System equipment rollout and we plan to move all stores to brand-forward digital menu boards over the next couple of years to further sharpen personalization and daypart activation. We are seeing strong growth in delivery. In fact, we are close to creating a $1 billion incremental leg in our delivery business from minimal presence a few years ago. And now we are operationally setting ourselves up for this channel in major markets, starting from a position of strength. As a second strategic priority, we're looking ahead at how we will further strengthen and differentiate our leadership position in digital. In the third quarter, we continued to grow our digital universe. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards customers grew to nearly 75 million globally, growing more than 25% in the quarter. This was driven by a record 90-day active user base of 31.4 million Starbucks Rewards customers in the U.S., an approximate 15% growth or 4 million new customers from the previous year. Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. drove 57% of tender for the second consecutive quarter, up over 3 percentage points from the prior year. In China, we hit the highest number of 90-day active users we have ever had at over 20 million Starbucks Rewards customers. This is further evidence of our brand strength, relevance and customer engagement in the market. Starbucks has had a long track record of industry-leading digital innovation. As we approach the fundamental platform transformation underway with AI, we intend to invest to lead in this area using a foundational Deep Brew capability as the launching pad. Our focus in these investments will remain on improving the partner experience while elevating the customer experience and delivering productivity gains. We are revamping our approach to further accelerate digital innovation, including order, including payment and delivery enhancements, in terms of speed and personalization, which we believe leads to greater habituation by our customers. This includes developments in the U.S. mobile app user experience as well. Additionally, we plan to make significant investments in China to further enhance our digital capabilities in the market. Our third priority is global growth. As a company with over 100 million customer occasions each week, more than 37,000 stores and operating in 86 markets around the world, the runway for global growth is limitless. For the quarter, we again saw double-digit top line growth across the International segment. The segment delivered record system sales for the second consecutive quarter as well as the highest revenue and operating margin since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, we continue to see double-digit growth in the company-owned markets of Japan and the U.K., while the geographic license partners across the rest of the world all reported very strong performance. Our international store growth was 10% year-over-year. New stores are bringing attractive unit economics for the business while we benefit from strong growth in returns on invested capital in these markets. Turning to China. I am encouraged by our performance in the quarter. I had the opportunity to spend time in the market recently. I can now fully appreciate the extraordinary strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand, which is known as Xingbake locally. Looking at our third quarter results, our China revenue grew 51% from the prior year or up 60% when excluding a 9% impact of foreign currency translation. Additionally, we sequentially grew our revenue 8% from the prior quarter or up 10% when excluding a 2% impact of foreign currency translation, underscoring the robust long-term health of our business. Despite these early days in our recovery journey, stores that opened in fiscal year 2019 or earlier achieved full sales recovery in the routine morning daypart while other dayparts reported sequential monthly improvement. A strong recovery in the third quarter was amplified by the many distinctive competitive advantage that set us apart in China. The first and foremost advantages are in comparable partners who honor the heritage of our company, bring sophisticated appreciation for our high quality coffee and passion for delivering the Starbucks Experience in ways that are relevant to our Chinese customers. Our second advantage is our vertically integrated operations. We start with a locally relevant and increasingly greener store footprint. Our distinctively designed stores across formats celebrate the Chinese culture in a unique Xingbake manner, reflecting local arts, crafts and calligraphy. In the fall, we plan to open our Coffee Innovation Park, our single largest and most sustainable manufacturing investment outside of the U.S. This next-generation facility with state-of-the-art supply chain operations will also include a unique customer immersion center. Third, our locally relevant innovation in China for over 20 years has won over customers in what has historically been a tea-drinking culture. Today, we have nearly 6,500 stores and another nearly 2,400 points of customer connection through our We Proudly Serve program in China. And yet, there is so much more opportunity ahead in underpenetrated areas within this market. Some growth facts to think about. The average person in China drinks 12 cups of coffee each year. That significantly lower coffee consumption than in Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, where we first entered the market and now have nearly 1,100 stores. And we still have more room to grow in Shanghai. Compare this also to Japan where our per capita is 200 cups versus the 12 cups in China and the U.S., where the per capita is closer to 380. We are still in our early days in China, one of the largest consumer markets. With our locally-based investments in R&D and locally relevant offerings like our Dragon dumplings, which had an amazing quarter. We have built a brand that is highly relevant for China, in China. And we believe our unique approach has us well positioned to play the long game and win. Finally, another advantage in China is digital. This will be further demonstrated with highly digital supply chains we run and in the way we engage our customers. We are reshaping our business models, leaning into the remarkable loyalty of our Starbucks Rewards members as well as convenience offerings, including delivery and curbside for our On-The-Go business. A comment on our international business beyond the U.S. and China. We have seen very strong growth and strong unit economics in these markets. It is becoming an important third leg for us. Looking outside the stores in the third quarter, our Channel Development segment revenue was $449 million, down 6% year-over-year, while delivering operating margin of 46.3%, up 630 basis points year-over-year, reflecting SKU rationalization as well as the shifts taking place with a more on-the-go customer. We continue to see the opportunity for growth in channel-through innovation, as evidenced by the highly successful ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink introduced last quarter and the Grab and Go series launched in Japan in partnership with Suntory. We saw unprecedented sales during the first month of the launch in Japan, just as we did with our cream cheese lattes in China. Our fourth strategic priority is fueling productivity. We think of our business as a theater in the front and a factory in the back. We have a clear opportunity to maximize efficiencies and effectiveness while reducing waste by focusing on a vast opportunity in stores and also above stores. We have focused on meaningful improvements in staffing and scheduling to ensure that we have the right combination of the right partners in the right roles with the right hours to fuel both engagement and productivity. We also closed the third quarter on target with our waste reduction goals as we strive to make operations as efficient as possible while preserving the Starbucks Experience. This is just the beginning of the productivity journey at Starbucks. We have broadened the areas beyond our initial reinvention plan to include our end-to-end supply chain, direct and indirect procurement, how we design and build stores as well as opportunities across technology and our supporting processes. Arthur Valdez, Jr., who joined us recently as the Chief Supply Chain Officer, brings three decades of supply chain and logistics leadership to Starbucks and will be critical in these efforts. Along with sales leverage, what I could see in opportunities with future productivity gains gives me real confidence in long-term progressive margin expansion. Finally, the DNA of Starbucks is nothing without our culture. This is inherent to the company and something I was quick to learn through my immersion and experience working in stores. Our fifth strategic priority is reinvigorating our culture of human connection. We will measure our success on our business performance through the lens of humanity, just as we always have. And that requires us to reinvigorate our culture. Our partners are the heart of our business for me. We will continue to invest in the overall partner experience through compensation and benefits as well as through in-store improvements. At Starbucks, we strive to be a different kind of company, but we do recognize that we are operating in a different kind of world. It is through that lens we have spent the last several months rolling out a new unifying mission for the company, new promises for all our stakeholders and soon, a new set of values that will reground the culture of Starbucks in our heritage and a more modernized workplace. Before I turn the call over to Rachel, I want to leave you with this. It is an honor to be driving such a stellar branded company in one of its best chapters. While we continue to navigate in an environment with a heightened level of macro uncertainty around the world, we will execute with discipline and rigor on our priorities. After all, Starbucks is a strong, resilient brand delivering to customers what the world needs most right now, human connection. As I look at the runway in front of us, the possibilities to deliver that connection are truly limitless. What I see is a durable iconic business with multiple paths available for us to deliver on our long-term revenue growth of 10% to 12% and earnings growth of 15% to 20%. I look forward to discussing our strategies and plans for fiscal year 2024 and beyond in greater detail in November in an extended investor call organized in a hybrid media format. We would share more details in the coming weeks. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rachel to talk more about our remarkable third quarter financial performance of the quarter. Rachel? Well, there were several questions in there so let me just break this up. There was a question on the third quarter. There was a question about our expectations for the balance of the year. And then there was a question about the -- what I've said earlier about my confidence and the multiple paths to achieving the 10% to 12% growth as well as the 15% to 20% earnings growth, and I'll comment on all three. So let me first start with Q3. Q3 for us was a very strong quarter, as Rachel mentioned as well. It's in line with our expectations. Our comps were consistent every month. We came off a lap in Q2, which was the impact of Omicron, and so we had a 7% comp, very consistent month over bond. The comp in Q3 was lapping a 9% comp from last year, so the 16% comp on a two year basis. And so if you look at this, it's really the strength of the brand, the actions and pricing we took but also the growing levels of customization and the levels of food attach that Rachel mentioned as well. And that is what led to the average weekly sales in Q3 continuing to break records. Now your question on transactions. Transactions in Q3 grew year-over-year across all dayparts. Traffic is below 2019 levels but units per store are above the 2019 average coming from higher food attach. So the food growth along with more customization and judicious price increases led to this record weekly sales that you saw in the quarter. So transactions, as I said, have grown year-over-year across all dayparts. We also had a strong increase in ticket. There's a sort of balance between the pricing, which is very judicious, but also customization and increase in the number of units. Delivery sales doubled in Q3 compared to a year ago, most of which is incremental occasions for our customers. So that's Q3. Let me just highlight something about our loyal customers because that, in some ways, gives you a sense of the strength of the brand. Our [indiscernible] active Starbucks Rewards members have grown 4 million in number year-over-year. They come in more frequently, they buy more. And interestingly enough, as we've seen our sizes, we actually see the growth of our largest sizes over our smaller sizes. So we're not seeing the down trading in our customer base. Our stored value credit, the balance of the card is also great sequentially. That's how we exit Q3. As you look at the balance of the year, we feel that, first of all, the annualization of the pricing actions will continue. We don't have any lagging significant comp impacts from the previous year. And we do expect pricing trends to moderate as we go into the final quarter, as you said, but we do expect to end the year in line with the comp expectations of 7% to 9% growth that we had set. Now in terms of answering your question about the long term, the \u2013 what I have seen in both top line as well as in the earnings growth gives me real confidence in the fact that what we've guided to previously, the 10% to 12% revenue growth and the earnings growth of 15% to 20%, we have multiple paths to getting to that. So that just really signals the resilience of the business, the durability of the brand and the multiple paths we see, both in terms of top line as well as earnings growth, which I'm happy to elaborate on. So we're feeling very good about the progress we are making in this area. Our foundational reinvention plan that we announced last year is essential to the improvements that we're seeing now. We're making very good progress on it. There are meaningful improvements in the store environment as well as the productivity gains that we're making. Our equipment rollout is on track. Our peaks are growing faster than the rest of the dayparts. And we're making strong progress on the scheduling and staffing basis. If you look on the retail team, barista turnover is down, as I said, 9% reduction versus previous year, a 2% reduction versus just the second quarter. And what you see is the combination of investments as well as the scheduling improvements that we're making, the economic proposition, the take-home pay to our baristas has improved by 20% year-over-year and we have more improvements coming. And you're going to see us make improvements month-over-month in terms of improvements that we're making. I mean, we're going to ensure that we continue to increase these average hours through better staffing and scheduling but also work to accommodate their preferences, including the many that we attract to a keen on a part-time schedule. So this is progress that we're making week over week, month over month, and there's more to come next year. Got it. I'll get Belinda to take the first question, Rachel to take the second, and then I'll come in with some summary comments at the end. Belinda? Rachel? Well, let me just close with a couple of observations. I was in the China market for an extended period in this quarter. And I got to actually work with our partners and stores. I got to spend time in our supply chain. I got to spend time in our support centers, including looking at our teams that are leading what we do in digital. And I have to tell you, I've been going to China, studying China, advising on China, running business with China for 20 years. And this is a very unique business. It's been a business that's been built with love, and it's remarkable in terms of the passion our partners have. I was very impressed. I think it is still early days. I mean, when you start looking at the headroom you have, and as Belinda said, the headroom is large. So as people come into the market, they're essentially driving a conversion of tea to coffee, which of course, remember, for 20 years, we've been doing and we've got to 12 cups per capita. The numbers, by the way, significantly higher in Shanghai, but it's still much lower than a tea drinking country like Japan, which has had a history of coffee house culture over time. So the headroom is really large. If you look at what we also do with our brand, don't forget, we have these -- we proudly serve a Starbucks points of customer connection. In addition, our ready-to-drink partnership with is also growing significantly. And we're also available for coffee at home, so our brand is being built across multiple channels and the investments we're making in digital are very strong. With the investments we're making to more vertically integrate our supply chain, it gives a greater flexibility in China and also greater productivity. So I think in addition to that, your other question on productivity, as I look at what I see with regard to the opportunities we have both in the stores and out of our stores, and that, by the way, cuts across all the whole business, we have further productivity options, which just gave us confidence on margin in terms of the progressive margin improvement that we have made. So early days in China, market going to expand and further opportunities for us to get productivity. Great. I'll take that. As I look at what we've been working on over the last six months or so, it's very clear that the investments we're making in our stores is yielding the kind of productivity that you would see, the efficiency as well as the throughput that we get. But what is interesting is if you look end to end, we have opportunities pretty much everywhere, both in terms of what we buy, how we buy it, how we flow products to stores, the services that we provide to our business, the technology investments that we're making, we have opportunities everywhere. And I think that's part of the reason why you see we've added Arthur Valdez to the team. And just an example, the availability of record sandwiches went up over the course of the last quarter. And what you see as a consequence of that is the attach rates went up as a result of it. And so I think that those are just examples of the kind of improvements we're seeing. Clearly, we're seeing benefits, as you know, with regard to freight and the cost of it. And the ability for us to rethink how we do what we do is large. And so there is opportunity there for us in terms of bringing automation in, flowing products better, buying better and frankly, developing a supply base that can also keep up with the kind of scale and growth plans that we have. I think first of all, let me just clarify something. In your question, I think you suggested -- you made a couple of comments about our Starbucks Rewards members. Let me just give you -- let me just address that. We have more of them, so we had a 4 million growth year-over-year. It's a 15% growth. Our Starbucks Rewards members come in more frequently. So they're not coming in less frequently, they come in more frequently. They buy more after joining the program, right? And as I said, they're also choosing larger sizes as they come in. The investments we have made in marketing and what we're doing with digital, in particular, what it tells you is that we are even further increasing the pace at which we are bringing innovation and changes in terms of what we do. We have a whole list of benefits that we could bring. And we're taking up the agility in the company in terms of the investments we make, which will help us make this even bigger and stronger. So that's the way I would address your question about the Starbucks Rewards members. It's a key area of growth. The other thing you should be aware of is as we have scaled this, we have scaled this to connect, which is all our licensed stores. And I think 40% of our licensed stores today have connect, and we're seeing growth in our license business as well as a consequence of that. Finally, we're scaling this globally. You're seeing us take it to our geographic partners the Starbucks Digital Solutions. There is very strong adoption. And you see the kind of results you see, which our geographic license partners are announcing or are sharing with us. I mean, very strong results, and Starbucks Digital Solutions is extremely capable of delivering that. In China, we're seeing real growth there, too. And in fact, that is where we're making a big investment as well in digital because we see that as a way not just to strengthen our relationship but also to drive results through what we do with digital. So I think overall, this is a big area. It's a big area of focus for me. And it's part of the second big priority for us around strengthening and scaling digital. I'll make a last comment. We have a fundamentally amazing capability called Deep Brew inside the company. It's where we have made investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I think the ability for us to be at the vanguard of this and to early adopt what we do in this area furthermore, given all the innovations that are going on, and the re-platforming that's going on just gives me greater confidence in what we do in digital. This will be a key area of growth for us. I think, John, thank you for the question. Let me first start with your peak question. We're doing definitely better than what we did before because of the investments that we are making, but we still have further headroom. And I think as we make more investments as we sort of further refine how we think about scheduling and staffing, how we ensure that we get the flows right in our store, we will have the ability to take that up even further. So the peak day parts are actually growing and growing really well. Now to answer your question about opportunities, there's opportunity pretty much across the board. If I look at beverage and beverage innovation, terrific, strong innovation coming, more to come. If I look at dayparts, we have opportunities in the afternoon daypart. And our Starbucks Refreshers is a way for us to attack that. And as you know, we have -- it's a big and sizable business, but it doesn't yet fully meet the full needs of what we could do in the afternoon. If I look at food attach, it's at the highest level we've had, but we have the ability for us to continue to elevate and innovate in food in order for us to further grab the opportunity that we have there. Delivery is an opportunity that, as I said, it's just early days. I mean, we've also built a $1 billion lag. And that's just the U.S. If I look at China, too, it's growing enormously. So we have a leg there too in terms of what we can do with delivery. And furthermore, I said earlier that we actually have an opportunity with regard to the net store growth in the U.S. There's real headroom for us to also locate our stores where we see customer growth, smaller towns, different geographies. And we're clearly looking at all of it, not just with our own stores but also with licensed stores. So John, it's a pretty rich set of areas as I look at growth and what we could get that is available for us, and this is just North America. I just want to say one thing. I think we're at the top of the hour but there are a few more questions online. And so we're going to go over and take those questions. Sara, to your question about our store network and how we see it, I am not concerned. I mean, I think there's a very small number of stores that you would normally consider, that we would consider in the normal course of business that we would look at and say we may have a challenge with them. But there's nothing in there that concerns me. What I'm looking at more from the standpoint of net store growth are the opportunities we have to further enhance our presence in many markets where we are underpenetrated but also exposed in some of our core markets, multiple formats. I think we've referenced this before as purpose-driven formats in terms of what we can bring into markets in order to meet various needs that customers have. Right. We have very strong share in out-of-home coffee. I think we're tied for #1 so we feel good about that. At the same time, what you are seeing with the customer is the customer is becoming more on-the-go. And what you are seeing with that is if you stop looking at channels where we have products like we have with our North American coffee partnership or frankly, our stores or our licensed stores, we're clearly benefiting from more from customers on the go. So you see some of that shift take place. But at-home coffee, our shares are very strong. Go ahead, please. Rachel? Just one thing I'd add to is our pipeline of equipment innovation is very strong. And the way we manage the portfolio, the way we manage the pipeline is very strong. And if you look at some of the commitments that we have made around investments like the portable cold foam blender, it's one of the fastest rollouts in our history in terms of how it's reached all our stores. So when we have them ready, when we do the renovations, when we have new stores built in automatically, they are actually getting the Siren System. And I feel very good about the way we are managing the portfolio of investments that we are making in this area. Great. Let me take this point on the top line. First of all, Starbucks is an iconic brand with a very strong appeal and durability. If we just look in the last year, the affinity of our brand has strengthened, right? The brand has ranged across consumer segments, across geographies, across occasions. So to your question on top line, we have a historically high number of customers who visit our stores. But it's also in many of the markets around the world, even as China recovers. We have a strong pipeline of innovation across beverage, across food and equipment, and there are even more opportunities across the world with different formats, as I mentioned earlier, with dayparts and a focus on dayparts and how we can bring more innovation, particularly on the daypart side and with new business models like delivery. We built this billion-dollar lag, and it's only now beginning operationally refocused on that and saying, how do we ensure that we continue to support that kind of delivery with an operating model that would actually help. I mentioned earlier that we have terrific capabilities in digital as well as in artificial intelligence and machine learning that we're just unleashing with even more agility in terms of how we strengthen and scale with digital. And it's not just our stores but it's also in the Connect stores, and it's at Starbucks digital solutions across the world. We have strengthened pricing capabilities. And as we make these investments, we're going to get even better in terms of revenue management, building on the great work that's already been done in terms of managing mix, in terms of managing sizing and in managing customization. We have a lobby that is further opportunity for us in terms of how we grow. So I think just in terms of that, there's real opportunity. In terms of net store growth, as I mentioned earlier, we do have even more headroom in new store builds, both in the U.S. as well as internationally. Our China number is the milestone to even get greater penetration. And some of the opportunities we see and the unit economics that we see in Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa is real. And we have a range of formats where we can deliver this third place experience but also deliver experiential convenience powered by digital in an omnichannel way. So I look at its brand, I look at its consumer appeal, I look at its durability, I look at its strength, I look at its range, it feels very good to me that we will get to a revenue growth of 10% to 12%, and by the way, the earnings growth of 15% to 20% over time. Thank you all for joining us on this third quarter 2023 earnings call. I deeply appreciate it, and I look forward to seeing you all in November. Until then, thank you."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our Q3 performance, which beat our expectations as our innovation and our brand continues to resonate with our customers around the world, fueling demand across our stores and digitally. Our U.S. business delivered record breaking performance on many fronts, and our China business continued to recover in line with our expectations. It's clear we have abundant opportunity ahead. Our overall performance was bolstered by the progress we're making against our strategies, specifically our reinvention plan and it's unfolding into tangible financial results. As a reminder, when we set guidance at the beginning of the year, we said that the benefits from our reinvention plan would amplify at the back half of this fiscal year, and that is exactly what we're seeing, highlighting our ability to effectively reinvest in our business for the benefit of all stakeholders. Our Q3 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.2 billion, up 12% from the prior year or up 14% when excluding more than 1% impact of foreign currency translation. The strength of the brand, loyalty of our customers and innovative products fueled strong sales resulting in double-digit consolidated comparable store sales growth of 10%. In addition to the 10% comparable store sales growth, revenue also benefited from 7% net new company-operated store growth globally year-over-year as well as continued momentum in our global licensed market. Q3 consolidated operating margin expanded 50 basis points from the prior year to 17.4%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by sales leverage, pricing and productivity improvement from increased efficiency in our U.S. stores. Margin expansion was partially offset by investments in store partners as well as higher G&A costs in support of reinvention. Q3 EPS was $1, up 19% from the prior year, driven by strong performance across our business segments, demonstrating the power of a broad global portfolio. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q3. North America delivered another record quarter of revenue with $6.7 billion in Q3, up 11% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales, consisting of 6% and 1% growth in average ticket and transactions, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% year-over-year. Our results were further strengthened by the continued momentum from our licensed store business. Our U.S. business delivered 7% comparable store sales growth in Q3, primarily driven by solid ticket performance with 6% growth, which benefited from a combination of pricing, food attach and customization. Our customers have relatively adopted the practice of customizing their beverages, allowing for a more personalized and differentiated experience while contributing to a growing higher-margin ticket with abundant opportunity ahead. In Q3, over 60% of beverages were customized, representing a 9% growth when compared to just five years ago. Cold Foam, for example, continues to be a customization favorite. This quarter's all-time high food attach was driven by two of every five customers attaching food with their orders, up over 25% from just five years ago, driven by our delicious breakfast sandwiches leading to an all-time high ticket in the quarter. Transaction comparable sales growth in the quarter was 1%, which combined with record ticket drove the highest average weekly sales in our company's history, surpassing the all-time high set during holiday in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. We are seeing more customers come into our stores with customer counts up 5% year-over-year, in line with the record high set in Q1 of this fiscal year. Our growing tech enabled convenience capabilities are driving our customers to engage more deeply with Starbucks as evidenced by the growth in customization, attach and mix shift towards more premium beverages, leading to record demand and incremental higher-margin revenue. Another proof point of our continued demand is the ongoing success of our Starbucks Rewards program, which ended the quarter achieving records on many fronts, a record number of active members, spend per member and total member spend. These records alone reflect the stickiness of our business, but we are most pleased by the consistency of our customer connection stores, which highlights customer satisfaction and the delivery of the Starbucks Experience. U.S. licensed stores revenue continued its momentum this quarter, up 21% from the prior year with strength across the portfolio and vending food (ph) from increases in post-COVID travel, especially return of business travel, which benefits from Starbucks Connect, our digital offering, now rolled out across all major U.S. airports. North America's operating margin was 21.8% in Q3, contracting 40 basis points from the prior year as expected, primarily driven by the timing of productivity focused labor investments as part of our reinvention plan. For color, the reinvention investments included partner wages and benefits as well as an increase in targeted partner training. The contraction was partially offset by favorable impacts of pricing coupled with labor productivity and sales leverage largely from the ramping benefits of the reinvention plan. Moving on to International. In the quarter, the segment delivered $2 billion in revenue, the highest revenue since Q4 of fiscal year 2021, up 24% from the prior year or up 30% when excluding more than 5% impact from foreign currency translation. Our revenue growth reflects double-digit growth in all major markets, including China, which benefited from lapping prior year mobility restrictions. The growth is attributable to a 24% increase in comparable store sales, which was driven by 21% transaction growth as customers continued returning to our stores, largely in China as well, as remarkable digital engagement through the increasing Starbucks Rewards member base. In addition, the International segment delivered 11% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year, with China contributing a significant portion of store growth as we continue to invest ahead of the curve in China, supporting our long-term ambitions for the market. Excluding China, our international markets combined continued their strong momentum with revenue growing 11% year-over-year in Q3 or up 14% when excluding a 3 percentage impact from foreign currency translation. The meaningful growth was a byproduct of our successful innovation and digital engagement across various markets. Excluding China, International had 8% store growth year-over-year and approximately 35% of our new stores year-to-date were drive-through, resulting in approximately 15% of total store count having the drive-through channel furthering our ability to create new occasions and serve new customers globally. Shifting to China. China had a strong quarter, delivering their highest beverage sales for Q3 over the last five years, underpinned by comparable store sales growth of 46% in Q3, in line with our expectations. Comp growth was driven by strong transactions, which benefited from the lapping prior year Q3 mobility restrictions. As the market continues to recover, we're pleased with the consistency of demand fueled by new product innovation, increasing digital capability, record sales of our Dragon Dumpling Festival food and an acceleration of new store openings amounting to nearly three stores per day. Average weekly sales in China grew quarter-over-quarter and we expect this to continue into Q4 with average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits, resulting in similar sized comp growth for the quarter. With the current demand and the long-term opportunity we see in China, we continue to invest in our stores, partners and communities. And we'll have our largest roasting plant outside of the U.S., the Coffee Innovation Park opening this fall. Our unwavering investments have contributed to our healthy recovery and performance, positioning us well for the long term. Operating margin for the International segment was 19% in Q3, expanding an impressive 660 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage from lapping prior year mobility restrictions in China, partially offset by investments in digital and partner wages as well as inflationary pressures. Shifting to Channel Development. The segment's revenue contracted 6% year-over-year to $449 million in Q3, driven largely by at-home coffee while proudly holding the number one share position at 15.1%. Despite the softening of revenue, the segment remained strong due to the breadth and depth of the portfolio. We are particularly proud of our North American coffee partnership, which continued to see category-leading sales and share growth outpacing the total category. Our innovation continues to distinguish us while benefiting the segment overall with strong performance. A perfect example of this is the award-winning ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink that Laxman mentioned earlier. The segment's operating margin was 46.3% in Q3, up a resounding 630 basis points from prior year, driven by strength in the North America coffee partnership and sales mix shift. As previously shared, operating margin has returned to the segment's normal mid-40s range, a testament of our strong partnerships and the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Now moving to guidance for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Given we're in the final quarter of our fiscal year with clear visibility into full year results, combined with the momentum we've built, the pace of reinvention plan unfolding and the strength of our global portfolio, we have the confidence to move our full year earnings growth from the plans we shared in November of the low end of the 15% to 20% growth range to a growth of 16% to 17% for full year fiscal year 2023. Despite the macroeconomic environment variables, we are poised to move our earnings growth guidance as it reflects the strength of our brand globally and the long-term durability that we are building through our reinvention plan. As it relates to our remaining guidance, we are pleased to reaffirm full year guidance on all other measures. As a reminder, that includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, global comp growth near the high end of 7% to 9% and solid margin expansion. Store growth, capital spend and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged from what we shared previously. As a reminder, we expect an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points on fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings, respectively. With that, let me provide further detail around our Q4. First, in regard to International. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand year-over-year but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China's average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter-over-quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits in Q4, with similar sized comp growth as the market is lapping government stimulus for customers and favorable discounting from prior year coupled with the timing of difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth. We continue to expect a low to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis, consistent with our prior guidance as well as record-breaking year of net new store development. Finally, as it relates to Channel Development, we expect revenue pressures to continue in Q4, driven largely by the at-home coffee business as customer behavior shift with revenue expected to be largely flat to prior year. However, we expect margins will continue to be above the mid-40s range, driven by seasonality, leveling to a strong mid-40s margin business for the full year. In summary, here are my key takeaways from my discussion today. Our momentum is in full swing and our strong brand, successful product innovations and financial and operational performance across the globe is a testament to our focus and our discipline. Our reinvention plan investments are unfolding and providing tangible returns throughout our business. As a result of our solid performance, our full year fiscal year 2023 guidance including revenue has been reiterated and we are confident to move our earnings growth to 16% to 17% for full year fiscal 2023. Finally, I want to say thank you to our partners around the globe for showing up every day and making customer's day brighter by extending active kindness. It's because of you that the future is truly limitless. With that, we'll open the call to Q&A. Operator? Yeah. And Andrew, I would just follow that up with as we look at the performance in China, we're encouraged by the healthy margins that we're seeing today. And even as we see a shift more towards digital, which does have a lower margin percentage overall, it's driving more revenue. And that's no better way to drive margin expansion than through sales leverage, so we're encouraged by what we're seeing today. In addition to that, the team has been very judicious about creating operational efficiencies so the margin opportunity in China continues to be healthy. That said, if we do see that there are challenges in the future, we've structured our guidance such that it allows us room, which is one of the reasons why we're very intentional and being more directive around qualitative language on margins, saying this year would be solid margin expansion and the future would be progressive, which will allow us to continue to navigate the business and continue to invest where needed so that we can deliver on that 15% to 20% earnings growth that we've guided to. Hi, Peter. This is Rachel. Thank you for the question. We've been encouraged by the performance we've seen in North America, both on the top line and on the bottom line. And year-to-date in North America, we're sitting at about 19.9% (ph) margin with about 40 basis points of expansion, and that's driven by a combination of sales leverage, pricing, the benefits from the reinvention plan showing up in productivity, which is helping to offset some of the investments we've made and we see opportunity to continue to expand margin over the long term as the benefits of the reinvention continue to amplify. And so I would look at that as really the reinvention is a significant driver of our opportunity in terms of margin expansion. Through reinvention, we're unlocking capacity to be able to serve demand that leads to sales leverage. And in addition to that, we're creating efficiency and resiliency in the middle of the business that's also supporting margin expansion. So I look at it more about what we've already seen progress today with reinvention, what we would expect to see going forward. And that leads us to solid margin expansion at the company level this year and progressive margin expansion in the future, which of course, will be driven in large part by North America. Sure. Thanks, Sara. I'll take the first question around comp. And when we look at the balance of the year related to comp, we just expect the momentum in the business to continue. So when you think about in North America in this current quarter, we were encouraged by the fact that our growth in comp was a combination of transaction growth. So we saw transactions grow above prior year in every single daypart. And that was coupled with an elevated ticket. And that was a combination of not only strategic pricing but a balanced contribution from increased customization as well as record attach. That drove strong growth in the quarter that, I would say, from a revenue standpoint, we have fundamentals from a revenue perspective that are broad. And we would expect that to continue, that momentum to continue as we look at the balance of the year and going on a full year basis. So that will continue to be fueled through innovation as well as through continued growth in our digital customer rewards membership and our increasing capability around convenience, including growth in digital. So we see all of that as signs to help support the 7% to 9% comp range that we've guided on a full year basis. Now when you think about outside of North America, we'd say we expect our recovery to sustain in China, and that was through the guidance I gave around a low to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis as well as contribution from International and the momentum we're seeing. So we think across the board, the momentum we're seeing, the recovery in China, coupled with the strong performance we're seeing in North America gives us the confidence to be able to maintain the 7% to 9% comp range on a full year basis for North America and then at the high end of the range for total company. But I would add that we are seeing a balance in the portfolio. So that's one of the things we're encouraged by is that while we are seeing consumer behavior shift some, we're seeing an increase in our ready-to-drink both domestically and internationally. And that's helping to support the margin expansion we saw in this quarter and the mid-40s margin that we're guiding to on a full year basis. So I would say in this case, it's the strength of the diversified portfolio that's working to our advantage. Yeah. From a Siren System standpoint, we're in the -- just the testing phase today. We're on track to be able to launch in conjunction with our renovations in new stores next year. And next year, we expect to be less than 10% of our stores will have the Siren System, reaching about 40% of our stores by the year 2026. And so we're encouraged by the progress we're seeing, we're seeing good results, and we do expect it will help lead to margin expansion in the future. It will be one of the many, what I'd say, equipment investments we're making as well as the investments we're making in the staffing and scheduling within our stores as well as the overall operational excellence focus that the team has. The combination of all of that in North America will lead to a more stabilized production environment, which will help drive margin expansion well into the future. And so we're encouraged by what we're seeing today and we're looking forward to furthering the launch."

            "content": "Great. Thank you for your question, Andrew. First of all, I want to say that there's no noticeable impact to our sales performance in Q3. In fact, we're very -- I'm very happy with our Q3 performance and the sequential improvement that we achieved. We have been and will continue to stay focused and disciplined in our discount investment to optimize and deliver incremental return. On the competition topic, we welcome competition. They actually expand the coffee market and accelerate adoption and vacancy of coffee consumption. Different brands bring in different value propositions and occasions, and I just want to talk about our value propositions. We're in the human connection business. Since day one 24 years ago, when we entered China, we have been focusing on delivering a premium experience defined by the quality of our coffee and the emotional experience we've built with our customers and our partners that can't be replicated anywhere else. And our China business has strategically built to serve a diverse range of customer needs and occasions, physical and digital, fast and slow. And the unique business model and capabilities we have built that Lex has mentioned gives us distinctive competitive advantages. So we'll double down on our investment in our product innovation store experience, digitalization in our people to create even more distinctive advantages to capture the limitless opportunities in China in the future. Thank you. We're playing the long game."

Now before I turn the call over to Laxman, I want to mention that our prepared remarks for today's call will run approximately 40 minutes, which is longer than what we planned for future calls. But we thought it would be beneficial to give Laxman, ample time to provide his observations as our new CEO.  And now with that, I'll turn the call over to Laxman.\nLaxman Narasimhan : Thank you, Tiffany, and good afternoon, everyone. It's both a great privilege and responsibility to serve as Starbucks CEO. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our Starbucks partners, I'd like to thank Howard Schultz for his leadership of the company over the last year. Howard's return in April of 2022, and came at a pivotal moment for the company and with great personal and family sacrifice. And I want to personally thank Howard for his over 40 years of ingenuity, creativity, service and enduring love for our company and the iconic Starbucks brand and for his willingness to always lean in, in service of our partners and customers. Since joining in September, the company has given me a uniquely designed program to fully immerse myself in all aspects of our business. The program involves spending time in our stores, distribution centers, roasting plants, support centers and on our own coffee farm in Costa Rica. And I have traveled to meet our partners and business leaders in several international markets across Asia, Latin America and Europe. While Howard formally ran the company through the second quarter, my emotion exposed me to all aspects of day-to-day leadership responsibilities and well-prepared made transition into the CEO role on March 20, a few days ahead of our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. I have learned about the company through the eyes of our founder, customers, farmers, partners and the community and through listing meetings with our shareholders. Perhaps most importantly, I've been actively listening and learning from our partners, working side-by-side to earn my Barista certification and developing the deepest level of respect for coffee and Barista craft. In my time with the company, I have also been working closely with the executive leadership team. I have been impressed with the great progress and forward momentum of the company, and I am optimistic about our long-term growth headroom and the margin improvement potential. We also see great opportunity to further strengthen the business, elevate the brand and do everything we can do to make this a great place for partners to work. We will continue to build our Reinvention Plan with additional opportunities, and we will update you with these additional plans in due course. Let me start with this call by sharing my overarching observations, the progress and momentum from our Reinvention and the opportunities ahead for Starbucks. Rachel will then walk you through the details of our second quarter fiscal year 2023 performance. We will then open the call for Q&A. What you can take away today is confirmation that we are well positioned to continue to unlock value for all our stakeholders. My first observation is that Starbucks is uniquely in the business of human connection. Since our earliest days, we have been a brand that brings people together from the vantage points of serving customers in stores and in drive-thru windows. Many are coming to us for connection with others. There is no doubt, Starbucks has conventionally been the mainstay meet-up spot. At the same time, nearly 2/3 of U.S. consumers are by themselves when seeking a beverage or food occasion. As a world in a crisis of disconnection, where loneliness, division and polarization have become far too common, the everyday ritual of coffee is a powerful way to make connection happen with others and with yourself. Starbucks delivers connection no matter how you visit us, in stores, drive-thrus or digitally, we are there to provide this connection, any place, any time. That brings me to my second observation. Our performance is strong, but our health could be stronger. I've worked side by side with our partners in our stores and have experienced firsthand how our stores and our operations are still evolving to meet the demands of our customers. There is more work to do to tailor our stores on the demand that we see, advance our technology, enhance how we innovate our equipment and also more fundamentally, how we get back to focusing on fundamental operations and executing better, a priority that is evident with my deep engagement over the last several months across supply chain, technology, reinvention, store development, store operations, marketing and product. Take, for example, the Siren System that we showcased at Investor Day. This is one example of how we can continue to do more to better support our stores and in turn our partners. It is also about the operating processes that we have in our stores and how we make them even more robust. To strengthen our health, we need to think of our business as having theaters at the front with a factory in the back. Our theaters are aware our store partners are focusing on their craft and delivering an elevated experience to our customers. To simplify the store partner experience and drive greater productivity within and beyond the store level, we see significant efficiencies in our supply chain, support systems and processes. This is what I mean by our opportunity to strengthen our factory in the back. Let me give you a few examples. Today, our store deliveries involve a high-touch one-size-fits-all model. We are out of stock in more items than we would like. Through segmentation and a format-specific approach, we will be able to lower costs while creating a better experience for our partners and ultimately for our customers. We also have abundant opportunities to optimize what we buy across several areas as well as opportunities in how we buy it. Currently, we have over 1,500 cup and lid combinations across our network. As we streamline, we will create a portfolio of fewer, more sustainable and less costly cups while further simplifying operations in our stores. All of these opportunities will deliver top line growth and margin expansion and create long-term value. My third observation is that we are a company that strives to be different, and we are now operating in a different kind of world. One thing that has stood out to me here at Starbucks is our culture. Since my first it has been clear that Starbucks' cultures like that of no other company. There is a strong partner-first mentality that is both top down and bottom up. At the same time, the world in which we operate is evolving. There is clear opportunity to build stronger capabilities, drive even deeper engagement and adapt a global mindset. With that in mind, as a leadership team, we fully acknowledge the need to evolve and modernize our brand, our business, our capabilities and our culture to meet the needs of an ever-changing world. We are, therefore, refounding the company. And as part of that, we are getting back to its basics. You already know about our Reinvention. We've also just recently introduced a new mission in set of promises as a contemporary expression of our mutual success. Our mission is this. With every cup, with every conversation, with every community we nurture the limitless possibilities of human connection. The rollout of this work across the globe is well underway. It is driving conversations at all levels within the company and is being met with overwhelmingly positive reception. As we evolve, what differentiates us will remain. We will modernize, yes, and we will straight through to who we are at our core, much like our promises say. We are a company that at its best works to build bridges to a better future for our partners. At our best, we uplift the every day for our customers. At our best, we ensure the future of coffee for all. At our best, we make positive contributions to our communities. And at our best with the environment, we give back more than we take. And as a result, we generate enduring long-term returns for our shareholders. These have been my three overarching observations. We are in the business of human connection. Our performance is strong, but our health can be stronger, enable the fearless in the front by strengthening the factories in the back, and we continue to strive to be a different kind of company that is now operating in a different kind of world. Through this lens, we will be disciplined in delivering against what has been limiting us in our journey towards the limitless future. We are seeing great progress in the work underway with our Reinvention Plan and the capacity for much more. We've only just scratched the surface of what we can accomplish with this iconic brand and company. We see significant growth headroom and the opportunity to further separate Starbucks from others. We also see opportunities to expand margins while continuing to invest in the business for the long term. With that, let me turn to our second quarter performance. The company exceeded expectations in Q2 fiscal year 2023 by nearly all measures, delivering strong results across the broader Starbucks portfolio. Our performance, including continued success in the U.S. and international markets as well as the recovery we've been seeing in China can be attributed to the strength of the global brand, relevant innovation in our product and stores and powerful execution by our partners. Let me first start globally and then with both America and the U.S. Our Q2 revenue was $8.7 billion, up 14% for the prior year and up 17%, excluding more than 2% impact of foreign currency translation. North America delivered revenue growth of 17% in Q2, growing to $6.4 billion. We captured a remarkable 11% comp growth globally with 12% comp growth in both North America and the U.S. for the second quarter, driven by mid-single-digit growth balanced between transactions and ticket. Our North America growth comes on top of 12% comp growth in the prior year. We expect this demand to continue as we push the envelope with innovation. A recent example is the highly successful launch of Oleato, an innovation Howard identified and is personally led for us. In fact, we have already reached an audience of 5 billion people since our announcement of the February global launch, Starbucks Oleato beverages, making this one of the top 5 product launches in the last 5 years in terms of brand awareness and excitement. The new innovative beverage platform is currently available in 650 stores across three markets: Italy, Japan and the U.S. Given the success we are seeing, we look forward to bringing this exciting new offering to more stores and more markets around the world this year. Scaled profitable innovation is one of the things that was our performance and is a continued area of focus. Our performance is the result of a near perfect intersection of three things: one, our successful innovative beverages suggests our Pistachio Cream Cold Brew, that inspires the expanded use of Two, our food portfolio, which resulted in record sales of our egg bytes and breakfast sandwiches. And three, our attractive convenience capabilities, Mobile Order & Pay, drive-thru and delivery, we saw sequential improvement and now accounts for 74% of Q2 U.S. company-owned revenue. You can expect us to lean strongly on purposeful innovation to further capture the tremendous opportunity, both in what we do and in how we do it. Speaking of convenience channels, our 90-day active Starbucks Awards membership added more than 400, 000 members in the quarter in the U.S., bringing our total membership to 30.8 million members. In addition, we've increased membership by 4 million year-over-year in the U.S. representing 15% growth. Rewards and members account for 57% of U.S. company-operated revenue in Q2, which marks the highest contribution on record and represents growth of 3% on a year-over-year basis. We are excited about our growth in active Rewards members as it's a contributing factor and consistent demand. We have been at vanguard in this area, and you can expect us to further invest and lead. An example of that investment is Starbucks Connect, which is now in over 1/3 of our U.S. licensed stores, giving our customers even more opportunities to engage with our brand. With such a diverse portfolio across our U.S. license locations, such as hotels, airports and other retailers, coupled with increasing offerings of convenience, we were able to capture further demand evidenced by revenue in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year supporting our strategy to meet and serve our customers wherever they are. Moving on to Reinvention. We are making great progress. The investments we made in our partners, stores and technology are already producing a return whether through productivity gains or partner satisfaction. We are pleased with the multifaceted progress to date. For example, Barista turnover reduced by over 9% from a high in March Q2 fiscal year 2022, leading to fewer newer highs per store. We've been able to increase the average hours per Barista per week by 4% year-over-year, a metric we know is one of the many meaningful inputs in achieving the desired compensation of our partners. Clearly, partners scheduling is a real opportunity for us, and we are laser-focused on it. Additionally, items per labor hour, a metric which reached a record high in December 2022, continued strong pace into and throughout Q2 despite seasonal trends. This demonstrates increased productivity in the midst of strong volumes, all by partner engagement and customer connection scores stabilized. The rollout of handheld cold foam blenders supporting customization demand commenced in the quarter with completion targeted for third quarter, just in time to support our summer demand as the desire for cold foam customization continues to grow. The Clover Vertica brewers also began to roll out in this quarter, and we'll be in nearly 40% of our company-operated stores across the U. S. by the end of this fiscal year. The vertical offers our customers our freshest Clover brewed coffee, while driving efficiencies in time and waste across our network. This is yet another example of how innovation amplifies what we do best, in this case, coffee served even better. The ultimate proof point of innovation and the progress against our Reinvention is our Q2 margin in North America of 19.2%, a 200 basis point expansion year-over-year. We have more to do to reinvent our business. Though we have further opportunity ahead, we are proud to see that our strategies are working and momentum is building. Moving on to International. We are pleased with the strength and growth across our broader portfolio. Q2 revenue was $1.9 billion, up 9% from the prior year and up 19% excluding 10% impact of foreign currency translation, representing our third highest quarterly revenue due largely to China's faster-than-expected recovery. We also achieved the highest ever quarterly system sales internationally, and we delivered a company-operated 7% comp, driven by transaction growth, spotlighting demand. Strong comps were also captured across the regions outside of China with markets like Japan and the UK, both posting double-digit comps for the eighth consecutive quarter. We're very pleased to see our International store strategy is working. In the quarter, our net new stores grew by 363, representing 8% growth year-over-year. As we look ahead to the end of the fiscal year, we will reach 20, 000 stores across the International segment on pace with a growth strategy we outlined at Investor Day. We expect China to remain on track to achieve our 13% net new store growth target for this year. Additionally, Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin American markets, are also expected to contribute meaningfully, becoming an area of further emphasis and a more significant contributor to our overall global growth. Moving on to China. Q2 marked a significant turning point when we finally began to emerge on three years of unprecedented COVID disruptions, embarking on the recovery journey that we have envisioned. We saw a robust recovery in Q2, reinforcing the resilience of our partners, the strength of our brand and the close relationships that we have built with our customers. We experienced faster-than-expected recovery, closing the quarter with nearly $800 million in revenue, up 3% from the prior year and up 11% excluding the 8% impact of foreign currency translation. Comp growth of 3% marked the first positive comp since the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. Importantly, we accelerated our store development in the quarter, opening 153 net new stores, more than doubling the net new stores in the previous quarter. We now operate over 6,200 stores across 244 cities, keeping us on track to meet our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025. Our bold decision to continue opening new stores over the past three years, despite COVID disruptions in mobility restrictions, is paying off as they continue to deliver returns and profitability. Further accelerating recovery is our rapidly expanding omnichannel business. Starbucks Delivers achieved 21% year-on-year growth to make up 23% of the sales mix, while overall mobile ordering reached 47% of sales, 4% over the prior year. Delivery demand remained robust even after consumer mobility has recovered demonstrating that it is highly incremental and interwoven into our customers' lifestyles. Our attractive portfolio supports the increasing demand, putting us in a position of strength to capture opportunity as China transitions due to the next phase of recovery. While we don't expect a straight-line recovery, we are confident in our long-term opportunity. We look forward to serving our customers with the elevated experience only Starbucks can deliver. Now let me wrap up the segment performance with Channel Development. Our Starbucks brand and successful partnerships continue to fuel the success of our channel development business with revenues of over $480 million in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Our U.S. at-home coffee continues to resonate with customers as are winning the seasons with our well-received promotions and product launches. In terms of ready-to-drink, Starbucks has outgrown the category in sales growth, for two consecutive quarters and remain the #1 brand in the U.S. To continue this trend, we launched a much anticipated pink drink and Paradise drink, which have already been met with overwhelming excitement. Before I pass the call over to Rachel, I want to again extend my gratitude to our partners, our leadership team and to Howard for the significant progress we have made as a company this past year. I also want to reinforce my confidence in our Reinvention, the work underway to refound our business, brand and culture and our position to fully realize the limitless potential of Starbucks. For our long-term sustainable growth, we will look to discover ways to first further elevate the brand by getting the basics right, operating our stores well and with a beverage-forward food attached focus for renovation. Second, build on our leadership position in digital by scaling and introducing new and relevant customer experiences. Third, evolve to a more global presence for our business and for our brand. Fourth, work to become less wasteful and move with greater speed. And fifth, and critically reinvigorate our culture around what it means to be a partner at Starbucks. With a Reinvention Plan driving progress against our business goals, a contemporized mission and a brand differentiated human connection, our momentum is strengthening the business overall. Our focus on delivering elevated experiences will continue to set us apart. As I look to close my remarks for the call, I want to reaffirm our guidance for the year, reflecting my optimism for our future even while recognizing we are operating in a challenging environment. I have great confidence in our leadership team and our partners as we carry on this journey together. We continue to build our plans for the medium to long term to recognize our limitless long-term growth potential. I could not be more excited, nor more grateful for the opportunity to build upon Starbucks' iconic legacy and shepherd in a new era for the company. With that, I'll now turn it over to Rachel to discuss our Q2 fiscal year 2023 results in greater detail. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Laxman, and welcome to your first Starbucks earnings call, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm so proud to discuss our outstanding Q2 performance, underscoring strength in both top line and margin globally. We delivered double-digit comp in all company-operated markets, excluding China, as well as positive comp in China driven by better-than-expected recovery and saw continued strength in our licensed markets. This momentum was made possible by the investments we are making in our stores and partners and allowed us to continue unlocking capital to reinvest in our business. As a result, our business and brand remains strong. As we begin on this next step in our journey, I'm confident that our execution against our Reinvention Plan and broader strategies will progress us into our new era. Our Q2 consolidated revenues reached $8.7 billion, slightly above our Q1 level and up 14% from the prior year and up 17%, excluding more than 2 percentage impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue growth was primarily driven by 11% comparable stores sales growth, 6% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year as well as continued momentum in our global license to market. This is remarkable performance on every level, but specifically given the seasonality pressures we typically experience in Q2. Q2 consolidated operating margin expanded 130 basis points from the prior year to 14.3%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by sales leverage, including better-than-expected recovery in China, pricing, productivity improvement and lapping prior year COVID-related pay. The margin expansion was partially offset by investments in store partners, higher G&A costs in support of Reinvention and inflation. Q2 EPS was $0.74 up 25% from the prior year. In addition to our strong global performance and better-than-expected recovery in China, this also includes an approximately $0.03 of onetime benefit from Starbucks Rewards redemption tier changes in North America, which reduced the related liabilities. I will now provide segment highlights for Q2. North America delivered revenue of $6.4 billion in Q2, another quarterly record and up 17% from the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by a 12% increase in comparable store sales consisting of 6% and 5% growth in transactions and average ticket, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% year-over-year, further strengthened by the continued momentum of our licensed store business. The segment's outstanding performance was led by the U.S., posting 12% comp in Q2 with transaction and ticket equally contributing to the growth, also bolstered by lapping the Omicron variant of COVID in the prior year. Remarkably, store traffic has surpassed pre-pandemic levels in our busiest dayparts. And even with higher levels of beverage customization and complexity, we were able to serve the surge in traffic as we unlocked incremental store capacity through Reinvention. Starbucks Rewards tender reached a record 57% of U.S. company-operated sales in the quarter showcasing customer loyalty and connection and indicating a successful launch of the changes to our Star redemption tiers. We also continue to expand our store footprint across the U.S., reaching over 9,300 stores where stores opened in the last few years, driving nearly 50% cash-on-cash returns despite the inflationary environment. As part of our development strategy, we are committed to enhancing sustainability through greener stores with the program saving almost $60 million in annual operating costs in the U.S. alone through water savings and energy reduction when compared to historic store practices. Our runway of growth coupled with store-level cash returns and commitment to sustainability is exceptional for a company of our scale, contributing meaningfully to our robust capital position and ability to continue reinvesting in our business. U.S. licensed stores revenue sustained its momentum this quarter, up 25% from the prior year with strength across the portfolio and further supported by the rollout of Starbucks Connect as Laxman spoke about earlier, broadening our opportunity to reach our customers through our expanding network of stores. North America's operating margin was 19.2% in Q2, expanding 200 basis points from the prior year primarily driven by pricing, sales leverage, productivity improvement and lapping prior year COVID-related pay, partially offset by store partner investments and inflation. As you heard at the top of the call, we are already seeing our Reinvention Plan come to life, whether it's through improved partner turnover and engagement, a better customer experience or productivity, our amplifying efforts field margin growth in the quarter. A margin benefit of approximately 60 basis points was also captured in the quarter due to the reevaluation of our Starbucks Rewards liability, which will not occur in the balance of the year. Moving on to International. The segment delivered revenue of $1.9 billion in the quarter, also a Q2 record and up 9% from the prior year. When excluding a 10% impact from foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue grew 19%, reflecting double-digit growth in all major markets, including China. The growth was driven by strength across our licensed businesses, a 10% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year and a 7% increase in comparable store sales from transactions. Our international markets across the globe continue to demonstrate strong momentum. Excluding China, the segment's Q2 revenue grew 14% from the prior year or up 25% when excluding an 11% impact of foreign currency translation. Once again, our international markets, excluding China, collectively achieved double-digit comp growth, driven largely by transactions. Let me highlight the incredible performance of Japan this quarter, our third largest market globally, which surpassed 1,800 stores and delivered their eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp in Q2, as Laxman mentioned earlier. The market also upleveled its Star Rewards program through introduction of a multi-tier redemption system designed to offer more customer choices and elevate the program economics. Subsequent to the quarter in April, Japan also became the third global market to introduce Oleato beverages, offering the innovative lineup at more than 60 of their select stores included the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo. While our performance in this market, a market that embraces innovation appears promising. Shifting to China. China posted comp growth of 3% in Q2, meaningfully exceeding our expectations, including 30% comp growth in March as we began lapping heightened mobility restrictions in the prior year. From the early weeks of January, when China emerged from peak infections and mobility restrictions were lifted in different cities, we saw a broad-based recovery across all trade zones, dayparts and city tiers. This was fueled by a strong rebound in traffic as customers returned physically to our stores to enjoy moments of reconnection. Starbucks Rewards active members rebounded to 17.8 million by the end of Q2 and hit a new record high by the first week of Q3. The sharp immediate rebound in traffic demonstrated the strength of our brand and the relationships we\u2019ve built with customers, as well as our strong operating muscle to capture the pent-up demand, all of which drove rapid improvement in average weekly sales in Q2. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, the speed of recovery in terms of average weekly sales will moderate after the faster-than-expected rebound achieved in Q2. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we will continue to face uncertainties such as changes in customer behaviors and the pace of international travel recovery as COVID in China enters a new endemic phase. Nevertheless, we feel confident Starbucks is well positioned for this next phase of recovery. Operating margin for the International segment was 17% in Q2, expanding 390 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage across markets, but specifically driven by the better-than-expected recovery in China partially offset by higher store partner wages and benefits. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 4% from the prior year to $481 million in Q2, in line with our expectations, driven primarily by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance. Global channel development extends customer occasions beyond our stores to amplify and diversify the Starbucks presence around the world. Our newer at-home platforms, including Starbucks Fine Espresso and Starbucks Creamers, continued to drive growth for the Global Coffee Alliance. We remain the market leader in global ready-to-drink categories with North America coffee partnership outgrowing the category and continuing to gain share for the past two quarters in a row. The North American coffee partnership saw share gains across platforms, and we're excited about our robust pipeline of innovations. To name a few, we launched Frappuccino mini cans in late March to bring a perfect size treat to our consumers. We're also elevating our portfolio with bottled Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink, which were inspired by popular handcrafted beverages in our stores and just hit store shelves in April. The segment's operating margin was 35.6% in Q2, down 710 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to impairment charges against certain manufacturing assets and mix shift. Excluding the impairment, the segment's margin was nearly 40% for the quarter, and we continue to expect channel development margin to normalize in the mid-40s range towards the end of the year. Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2023. As Laxman discussed, we are reaffirming our guidance for the fiscal year, balancing our incredible momentum and optimism with the economic uncertainties we continue to face around the world.  Let me provide some additional insights on our outlook. First, in the U.S., a meaningful part of the 12% comp in the quarter reflected a lap of Omicron in the earlier part of the quarter which was incorporated into our original guidance for Q2. U.S. comp has normalized as anticipated in March and into Q3 with expected annual comp continuing to be in the guidance range of 7% to 9%. Second, similar to comp, our Q2 North America margin also benefited from lapping a sizable amount of COVID pay in relation to Omicron accounting for 120 basis points of year-over-year expansion as well as Starbucks Rewards tier change impact of 60 basis points, which are not expected to recur in the balance of the year. Third, as I discussed earlier, we expect China's average weekly sales to sequentially grow in Q3 and Q4, but at a more moderate pace. Acknowledging the uncertain environment we expect China comp to improve in the back half of the year, driven in large part by the lap of mobility restrictions in Q3 of the prior year, coupled with the continued recovery, leading to low to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis. Lastly, although China's Q2 margin was also stronger than expected, it benefited from the timing of certain investments. As we continue to ramp our operations in the balance of the year, we plan to resume investments required to drive sustainable growth over the long term. Further, here are some points of clarification on guidance. Regarding the shape of margin, we continue to expect sequential margin improvement in both Q3 and Q4. We expect Q3 margin near the prior year level with Q4 expanding meaningfully over prior year as we lap the significant investments in wages and benefits. Note the quarterly margin shape in Q3 and Q4 is not expected to mirror the prior year.  We also expect EPS to step up in the second half of the fiscal year, improving sequentially in Q3 and Q4. We expect year-over-year EPS growth in Q3 to be meaningfully lower than our fiscal year guidance range of 15% to 20% with Q4 year-over-year EPS growth slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Our guidance continues to include the impacts of significant investments related to our Reinvention Plan as well as inflationary pressures, which are moderating. We continue to expect our G&A growth to be outsized in fiscal year 2023. A large portion of the G&A growth will reflect critical technology investments, which we believe will fuel our Reinvention and business growth. Importantly, as we conclude the first half of the fiscal year, our global performance is closely tracking to our original expectations as the significant unexpected headwinds in China were offset by strong performance in the U. S. and the rest of the world. While we continue to navigate our path to recovery in China, coupled with the heightened level of macro uncertainty around the world, we are confident that the Reinvention investments we are making in our partners, stores and customers will continue to guide our growth, delivering on our original fiscal 2023 outlook. Lastly, despite the current interest rate environment, our balance sheet remains very healthy supported by our strong cash flows and a measured financial policy targeting leverage below 3x lease-adjusted debt to EBITDA. We are in an enviable position to continue to invest in our business, deliver on our shareholder return commitments and retain financial flexibility in the face of current economic uncertainty. In summary, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. One, our global business and brand remains strong, demonstrated by both top line and margin performance in Q2. We are brewing on all cylinders across our building blocks of growth, namely strong comp, propelled by digital engagement, unrivaled innovation and engaged partners, store growth anchored by best-in-class cash returns and margin uplifted by Reinvention as it continues to gain traction. Two, our fiscal year guidance remains unchanged, balancing our optimism with the economic uncertainties around the world. And finally, our new era is coming to life as we continue unlocking capacity and driving capital returns through reinvention. The investments being fused into our business is centering us on our core while increasing differentiation and building resiliency to help us realize our limitless future. Before I close, I want to express my deep appreciation for our partners around the world, especially our Green Apron partners for the critical role they played in achieving our success this quarter, our future rests on the shoulders of many, and it's our collective unwavering commitment to serve our partners, customers and all of those from farm to cup in the best way possible to allow Starbucks to deliver on our limitless possibilities. With that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe : The question is on the U.S. staffing environment, specifically the store-level partners. It seems like that's where some of the biggest opportunity might -- really remain for this company going forward. I don't think I need to review second half of '21, Great Resignation, your own specific challenges with labor. Obviously, a lot of news that was probably bigger than some of the labor issues even at the stores themselves. I was really wondering where that left us in terms of staffing levels, hiring practices, training and retention, how you view the overall quality of the labor force. And I guess really importantly, how the current staffing and partner environment is being reflected in terms of overall customer service, in terms of the customer satisfaction and speed. So if we can just spend a couple of minutes as you see the current staffing environment and the opportunity may be over the next year? \nLaxman Narasimhan : Hey, John, thank you for your question. Firstly, I will give a bit of an overview, and then I'll call on Frank and Sara to provide their perspectives. Firstly, Starbucks continues to be a brand with a very strong employee value proposition, and we are able to attract a lot of applicants for the jobs that we have open. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing growing stabilization in what we see in our front line. As I mentioned, we are seeing lower levels of attrition and greater stabilization in our retail talent. Additionally, as you look at the improvements that we are making in our scheduling processes, we're able to deliver an average hours per week to our partners 4% higher at this point in time. That, of course, does matter because it does have an implication on the compensation that they have. There are clearly more things in the pipeline as well. And Frank, I'd love for you to give your comments on how you see the environment there.\nFrank Britt: Yes. It is clearly an acute labor market environment, and we are mindful of that. We have continued, however, to build on Laxman's points to distinguish yourself as a preferred employer of choice for frontline workforces. And we view that through the lens of how do we create value for the partner as we continue to partner and building the company together. Specifically in scheduling, we see scheduling as a significant opportunity as we continue to contour hours by store and by daypart, and ultimately, in serves with getting our partners what their needs are relative to the shifts they would like to see week-to-week as well as the hours they need week-to-week and service of their goals professionally and otherwise. But then finally, I would say that we have a very robust agenda to continue programmatically improving the partner experience. We can unpack some of the specifics on that. But this is part of the ongoing agenda for reinvention. We feel pleased with our progress, but we feel like there's a significant opportunity to continue to create even more opportunities for them in their careers.\nLaxman Narasimhan : Sara, any comments from your time in stores?\nSara Trilling : I would just give one overlay. In addition to what's already been discussed we've put a tremendous amount of effort over the last quarter in bringing our teams together in formats that allow them to celebrate our mission, to build capability and it's paying off in terms of their engagement with the company. So that's one. In fact, just last week and this week, we've got partners gathering to focus at the store level all around connection and driving a different level of customer connection and customer service. I would also say that the investments that we've made in really the core of our business notably coffee and the way that we're celebrating our Black Apron partners, we're investing in partners going to origin and just more training to build competency around craft is also another area that's driving engagement with our partners at the store level. And lastly, community, which is something that our partners care deeply about. We wrapped up our April month of service. And again, that was a great way to help our partners feel connected to something bigger and with mission and values at the heart of it.\nLaxman Narasimhan : If I can add one more thing. I think we're seeing a strong pickup in the program of tipping that we have scaled across our store network.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore : I just wanted to ask about the strength of the quarter, maybe in the context of comments -- other comments about both the near-term and long-term outlook. So it sounds like there was significant upside to your own expectations for the quarter and objectively very strong. But you're not raising full year guidance, which makes me wonder if maybe your reinvestment path is going to be higher than you had previously anticipated just because some of the things Rachel mentioned, the COVID relapse, I think, would have been embedded in the outlook initially. And maybe in that same vein, Laxman's view that you're reinventing or refounding the brand, not something I would typically associate with the brand that's putting up the kind of performance that we saw in the second quarter. So if you could just contextualize the strength of the quarter in your full year outlook and also the view about the sort of the brand going forward?\nLaxman Narasimhan : Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri : Sure. Thanks, Sara. The way I'd look at it is we were incredibly pleased with the performance in Q2. But when you think about, as I shared in my prepared remarks, we benefited from the lap of Omicron as well as the onetime adjustment from the Star liability. That was expected. So we expected that, and that was driven in the comp that we saw in the quarter in North America as well as broadly. But in addition to that, while we recovered better than what we expected in China, when we look out towards the balance of the year, we expect our average weekly sales in China to continue and increase to improve sequentially quarter-over-quarter, but at a more moderate pace than what we saw in Q2. We've already seen it start to moderate. And that's really driven by the fact that there's still some uncertainty in the overall environment from a recovery standpoint when you look at things like consumer behavior as well as recovery in key segments like our international travel. So when we take all of that into account, when we look at our guidance for the full year, we believe reaffirming our guidance allows us to continue to convey the momentum, but also for the confidence we have while still navigating a rather uncertain environment globally.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein : Great. Just looking out beyond this year, Rachel or Laxman, I'm just wondering how you think about the operating margins in the coming years, maybe framing it relative to pre-COVID levels back in the day, high teens were the norm. I'm just wondering whether that's still a realistic target? And if so, maybe by when or perhaps Laxman, that's just no longer the focus or it's just not necessarily attainable based on the outsized inflation and ongoing investments you're making in the business. Just wondering how you think about the top versus the bottom line balance there?\nLaxman Narasimhan : I think in terms of guidance on this call, our focus is entirely in this year. So we are confirming our guidance for this year. I think as I mentioned earlier, as I've gone through the emersion and I've worked in various spots of the company. There's no question what we see is we see headroom in terms of our top line. We also see opportunities for us to improve margins over time gave a couple of examples in the prepared remarks about things that were apparent. We can buy different and we can buy better. Our end-to-end supply chain is significant opportunities to reduce cost and improve availability. We can enhance our tech stack, both to lower cost and then actually reinvested back in the tech stack to support the large digital push that we are making. Our stores need to better reflect what is needed to meet the evolved demand from where they were initially designed. Our beverage innovation is strong, food could use more work. And our innovation could be more purposeful and targeted. And these are the kinds of opportunities that I mentioned are the opportunities in the factory in the back. We also have opportunities in the theater in the front. So I think as you look at it, clearly, there's top line headroom, and there's opportunities to sequentially improve margins. But in this call, we are focused entirely on confirming our guidance for this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Palmer, Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer : Wanted to get your texture on the China market and your message there. Your four-year trend versus pre-COVID levels, you\u2019re 24% below where China same-store sales would have been in this last quarter. And just doing the math on your commentary for the year, would appear that your same-store sales would still be roughly that amount below pre-COVID level. So the recovery would be kind of stalling out if we just assumed that low- to mid-single-digit comp for the year. So I know you said a lot about China, but I'm wondering what is the thought process behind that sort of sales? And what color can you get behind it?\nLaxman Narasimhan : Rachel and then -- I'll call in Belinda for some commentary. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri : Thanks, David. I think as we look at the remainder of the year for China, as I had shared previously, we expect that our average weekly sales will continue to improve sequentially quarter-over-quarter. We also expect that our comp will improve, especially as we lap the mobility restrictions from prior year. But when you think about the overall environment, while we're encouraged by the fact that we're seeing strong traffic in afternoon dayparts as well as on our weekends, which just speaks to a customer need to connect. There's still a lot happening in terms of the overall environment as it relates to recovery. And so when we put all of that together and we think about that, when we look to the balance of the year, we expect it to continue to improve but at a more moderate pace relative to what we saw in Q2. And that's what brings us to the full year guidance range of a low- to mid-single-digit comp, which I think when you look at that, does reflect momentum, but it also reflects confidence, especially when you look at last year, we ended the year with a negative 24% comp on a full year basis and a negative 25 -- 9% even more recently in our last quarter. So that's how we're thinking about the recovery. We're very encouraged by many of the signs that we see, but there's a lot that we're navigating. And so we feel very good about the guidance we've given as we think about the back half of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Belinda.\nBelinda Wong : Thank you. I'll just provide some colors on our recovery. China has finally turned a new chapter from pandemic to endemic. And Q2 marked the start of our solid and broad recovery and it\u2019s only the beginning. We see strong rebound in traffic as Rachel has said, back to our stores for reconnection and the third place experience our customers have long craved. And we are that sufficient for this moment because we are in a human connection business and our unique price and the type of experience cannot be replicated anywhere else. And we achieved 30% comp in March and the strong momentum continues in Q3. We are firing on all cylinders to accelerate our top line and bottom growth for balance of the year and beyond. And we will leverage our market-leading store portfolio to capture the pent-up demand for reconnection and we are ready to accelerate even faster new store growth in the second half of the year. Our evolving omnichannel capability, the strength of our delivery business, our mobile order and pay and e-commerce, all built in the past few years and ready to serve our customers for any occasion, anywhere and anytime, highly incremental and in fact our mobile order and pay business achieved the highest record sales and mix of 24% in Q2. We've built strong operating muscle and agility to innovate and execute. We have the ability to adapt further with speed to meet new customer needs with disciplined execution in stores. The enduring power and strength of the Starbucks brand and the deep connection we have with our customers and partners are all second to none. With that, our 60,000 partners in China are ready to capture the exciting growth ahead.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh : Great. I wanted to ask about the Siren System. Laxman, I think you mentioned it briefly, but really didn't provide a lot more color on it. I know this is something you guys talked about in great detail at the Investor Day in the fall. Just curious if you could give us an update on the testing and rollout of the system and the impact you're expecting going forward?\nLaxman Narasimhan : Thank you for your question. I feel very good about the progress that we're making on the equipment rollout as well as the testing that is underway on the Siren System. And as you see, some of the nearer-term equipment launches have happened and have landed on time. We have a very systematic approach to how we think about our equipment and the testing that we're doing. And I feel very good about the progress we are making on that system. So all systems go as far as we're concerned. Sara, I wonder whether you want to touch a little bit on some of the equipment launches that we've had so far.\nSara Trilling : Yes. Thank you. Happy to. I mean specific to Laxman, as you said, cold beverage as well as the food station, incubation tests that are complete and feasibility begins in Q3, right, for the rollout. And I think both of which these stations have already shown measurable impact on both productivity as well as throughput and testing. So we're quite bullish on them. And then overall, absolutely, we're already seeing the benefits of the investments that we've made in equipment. We're serving more customers during our busiest dayparts than we did pre-pandemic. And when I'm out in stores, I certainly hear firsthand from our partners how the equipment is making the work easier. And it's evident in speed with service. You can see it in our drive-thru times and you can also see it importantly in our productivity numbers. As we're thinking about summer and the weather is warming up around the country, some of the things that we've launched more recently called Blenders as well as at that station specifically make it easier to serve customers and enable the innovation that's going to be coming. The last piece I'd call out that we're really excited about as it relates to our core, again, coffee is Clover Vertica. We all know waste and throughput are going to be -- they're going to benefit favorably. But I think more importantly, we're putting coffee at the center, and our partners are incredibly enthusiastic about the offering that we'll give to our customers and the pride, right, that they'll feel in terms of the quality in the cup. So very, very excited about that one as well.\nLaxman Narasimhan : Great. Frank, any comment?\nFrank Britt : Yes, Sara, you mentioned productivity. I think it's probably worth highlighting that while we typically see a decline in productivity during winter months due to seasonality and volume within our stores compared to last year, we've seen a sustainment of strong IPLH, our proxy for productivity. And I think this affirms to your point, Sara, the alchemy of partner changes in store workflow and equipment, all yielding tangible value and enduring value for our partners and for our customers.\nOperator: The last question comes from Lauren Silberman, Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman : Congrats, really strong U.S. comps and traffic. Can you help unpack where the growth is coming from? So is traffic primarily coming from new customers or existing customers, Rewards members or more occasional customers? And then can you just give us an update on where you're running with transactions per store per day?\nLaxman Narasimhan : Great. Let me start with Brady. I think I'd love for you to give your perspective on the questions.\nBrady Brewer : Sure. Yes. In the quarter, you saw in the U.S. business, an equal part in the comp between transaction comp and ticket comp. Of course, we are overlapping some bad weather last year, some Omicron surge. But really when we look under the surface of that, too, as Rachel shared in her opening remarks, record customer counts for the quarter when we look year-over-year, that we saw growth there. Transaction comps growing in our busiest dayparts. And when we get underneath the hood of that, it's really brand strength. We have growing affinity for the Starbucks brand. We saw some very good highs within the quarter for brand affinity. We look at the relevance of the innovation, so our Iced Shaken Espresso platform continuing to grow, our Refreshers platform continuing to grow, which just reinforces our cold customized plant-based beverage strategy is just yielding continued growth. You heard Laxman talk about Pistachio Cream Cold Brew. We launched Oleato in the quarter. So there's so much for customers to be excited about and giving them a reason to come to Starbucks.  And then lastly, I would just say the execution. You see our Starbucks Rewards membership rewarding Starbucks for that with more of their visits. Now 57% of U.S. transactions are from our Rewards members. And what they're telling us is, as you heard me say before, they are finding a beverage they can't get anywhere else. And so all of those things compile into a great force of momentum for Starbucks, and we continue to be a strong brand that's poised for growth in the future.\nRachel Ruggeri : And I would just add, Lauren, to that, that you had asked about TSDs. And we have seen our TSDs grow relative to pre-COVID levels. In fact, in our busiest daypart or morning daypart, we have surpassed our pre-COVID levels. And that's in large part due to the momentum we're seeing in our reinvention. We're able to unlock capacity and better serve our customers, and we're seeing that come to fruition in terms of our overall strength in TSDs which is also increasing in the early part of our afternoon. So we're encouraged by that. And that's leading to when Brady talked about the customer count, the growth we had in customer count, that's really across both our SR members as well as our non-SR members. So our overall customer count is increasing. Those customers are more engaged with our brand, and we see that in terms of unit growth as well as increasing transactions and then overall ticket leading to the high -- second highest average weekly sales that we've seen second only to last quarter, which was an all-time high. So we're incredibly encouraged by what we're seeing from an overall volume standpoint.\nLaxman Narasimhan : Thank you, Rachel. I'm very pleased with the results of this quarter, and we are clearly moving with momentum as a business. There's clearly further opportunities for us and for this wonderful brand. It's a privilege to lead it. I want to thank you all for joining us today for our second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. We appreciate your investment and your time.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we conclude today's conference call. All parties may now disconnect. Have a great evening.",

            "content": "Thank you. I'll just provide some colors on our recovery. China has finally turned a new chapter from pandemic to endemic. And Q2 marked the start of our solid and broad recovery and it's only the beginning. We see strong rebound in traffic as Rachel has said, back to our stores for reconnection and the third place experience our customers have long craved. And we are that sufficient for this moment because we are in a human connection business and our unique price and the type of experience cannot be replicated anywhere else. And we achieved 30% comp in March and the strong momentum continues in Q3. We are firing on all cylinders to accelerate our top line and bottom growth for balance of the year and beyond. And we will leverage our market-leading store portfolio to capture the pent-up demand for reconnection and we are ready to accelerate even faster new store growth in the second half of the year. Our evolving omnichannel capability, the strength of our delivery business, our mobile order and pay and e-commerce, all built in the past few years and ready to serve our customers for any occasion, anywhere and anytime, highly incremental and in fact our mobile order and pay business achieved the highest record sales and mix of 24% in Q2. We've built strong operating muscle and agility to innovate and execute. We have the ability to adapt further with speed to meet new customer needs with disciplined execution in stores. The enduring power and strength of the Starbucks brand and the deep connection we have with our customers and partners are all second to none. With that, our 60,000 partners in China are ready to capture the exciting growth ahead."

            "content": "Yes. It is clearly an acute labor market environment, and we are mindful of that. We have continued, however, to build on Laxman's points to distinguish yourself as a preferred employer of choice for frontline workforces. And we view that through the lens of how do we create value for the partner as we continue to partner and building the company together. Specifically in scheduling, we see scheduling as a significant opportunity as we continue to contour hours by store and by daypart, and ultimately, in serves with getting our partners what their needs are relative to the shifts they would like to see week-to-week as well as the hours they need week-to-week and service of their goals professionally and otherwise. But then finally, I would say that we have a very robust agenda to continue programmatically improving the partner experience. We can unpack some of the specifics on that. But this is part of the ongoing agenda for reinvention. We feel pleased with our progress, but we feel like there's a significant opportunity to continue to create even more opportunities for them in their careers. Yes, Sara, you mentioned productivity. I think it's probably worth highlighting that while we typically see a decline in productivity during winter months due to seasonality and volume within our stores compared to last year, we've seen a sustainment of strong IPLH, our proxy for productivity.

            "name": "Laxman Narasimhan",
            "content": "Thank you, Tiffany, and good afternoon, everyone. It's both a great privilege and responsibility to serve as Starbucks CEO. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our Starbucks partners, I'd like to thank Howard Schultz for his leadership of the company over the last year. Howard's return in April of 2022, and came at a pivotal moment for the company and with great personal and family sacrifice. And I want to personally thank Howard for his over 40 years of ingenuity, creativity, service and enduring love for our company and the iconic Starbucks brand and for his willingness to always lean in, in service of our partners and customers. Since joining in September, the company has given me a uniquely designed program to fully immerse myself in all aspects of our business. The program involves spending time in our stores, distribution centers, roasting plants, support centers and on our own coffee farm in Costa Rica. And I have traveled to meet our partners and business leaders in several international markets across Asia, Latin America and Europe. While Howard formally ran the company through the second quarter, my emotion exposed me to all aspects of day-to-day leadership responsibilities and well-prepared made transition into the CEO role on March 20, a few days ahead of our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. I have learned about the company through the eyes of our founder, customers, farmers, partners and the community and through listing meetings with our shareholders. Perhaps most importantly, I've been actively listening and learning from our partners, working side-by-side to earn my Barista certification and developing the deepest level of respect for coffee and Barista craft. In my time with the company, I have also been working closely with the executive leadership team. I have been impressed with the great progress and forward momentum of the company, and I am optimistic about our long-term growth headroom and the margin improvement potential. We also see great opportunity to further strengthen the business, elevate the brand and do everything we can do to make this a great place for partners to work. We will continue to build our Reinvention Plan with additional opportunities, and we will update you with these additional plans in due course. Let me start with this call by sharing my overarching observations, the progress and momentum from our Reinvention and the opportunities ahead for Starbucks. Rachel will then walk you through the details of our second quarter fiscal year 2023 performance. We will then open the call for Q&A. What you can take away today is confirmation that we are well positioned to continue to unlock value for all our stakeholders. My first observation is that Starbucks is uniquely in the business of human connection. Since our earliest days, we have been a brand that brings people together from the vantage points of serving customers in stores and in drive-thru windows. Many are coming to us for connection with others. There is no doubt, Starbucks has conventionally been the mainstay meet-up spot. At the same time, nearly 2/3 of U.S. consumers are by themselves when seeking a beverage or food occasion. As a world in a crisis of disconnection, where loneliness, division and polarization have become far too common, the everyday ritual of coffee is a powerful way to make connection happen with others and with yourself. Starbucks delivers connection no matter how you visit us, in stores, drive-thrus or digitally, we are there to provide this connection, any place, any time. That brings me to my second observation. Our performance is strong, but our health could be stronger. I've worked side by side with our partners in our stores and have experienced firsthand how our stores and our operations are still evolving to meet the demands of our customers. There is more work to do to tailor our stores on the demand that we see, advance our technology, enhance how we innovate our equipment and also more fundamentally, how we get back to focusing on fundamental operations and executing better, a priority that is evident with my deep engagement over the last several months across supply chain, technology, reinvention, store development, store operations, marketing and product. Take, for example, the Siren System that we showcased at Investor Day. This is one example of how we can continue to do more to better support our stores and in turn our partners. It is also about the operating processes that we have in our stores and how we make them even more robust. To strengthen our health, we need to think of our business as having theaters at the front with a factory in the back. Our theaters are aware our store partners are focusing on their craft and delivering an elevated experience to our customers. To simplify the store partner experience and drive greater productivity within and beyond the store level, we see significant efficiencies in our supply chain, support systems and processes. This is what I mean by our opportunity to strengthen our factory in the back. Let me give you a few examples. Today, our store deliveries involve a high-touch one-size-fits-all model. We are out of stock in more items than we would like. Through segmentation and a format-specific approach, we will be able to lower costs while creating a better experience for our partners and ultimately for our customers. We also have abundant opportunities to optimize what we buy across several areas as well as opportunities in how we buy it. Currently, we have over 1,500 cup and lid combinations across our network. As we streamline, we will create a portfolio of fewer, more sustainable and less costly cups while further simplifying operations in our stores. All of these opportunities will deliver top line growth and margin expansion and create long-term value. My third observation is that we are a company that strives to be different, and we are now operating in a different kind of world. One thing that has stood out to me here at Starbucks is our culture. Since my first it has been clear that Starbucks' cultures like that of no other company. There is a strong partner-first mentality that is both top down and bottom up. At the same time, the world in which we operate is evolving. There is clear opportunity to build stronger capabilities, drive even deeper engagement and adapt a global mindset. With that in mind, as a leadership team, we fully acknowledge the need to evolve and modernize our brand, our business, our capabilities and our culture to meet the needs of an ever-changing world. We are, therefore, refounding the company. And as part of that, we are getting back to its basics. You already know about our Reinvention. We've also just recently introduced a new mission in set of promises as a contemporary expression of our mutual success. Our mission is this. With every cup, with every conversation, with every community we nurture the limitless possibilities of human connection. The rollout of this work across the globe is well underway. It is driving conversations at all levels within the company and is being met with overwhelmingly positive reception. As we evolve, what differentiates us will remain. We will modernize, yes, and we will straight through to who we are at our core, much like our promises say. We are a company that at its best works to build bridges to a better future for our partners. At our best, we uplift the every day for our customers. At our best, we ensure the future of coffee for all. At our best, we make positive contributions to our communities. And at our best with the environment, we give back more than we take. And as a result, we generate enduring long-term returns for our shareholders. These have been my three overarching observations. We are in the business of human connection. Our performance is strong, but our health can be stronger, enable the fearless in the front by strengthening the factories in the back, and we continue to strive to be a different kind of company that is now operating in a different kind of world. Through this lens, we will be disciplined in delivering against what has been limiting us in our journey towards the limitless future. We are seeing great progress in the work underway with our Reinvention Plan and the capacity for much more. We've only just scratched the surface of what we can accomplish with this iconic brand and company. We see significant growth headroom and the opportunity to further separate Starbucks from others. We also see opportunities to expand margins while continuing to invest in the business for the long term. With that, let me turn to our second quarter performance. The company exceeded expectations in Q2 fiscal year 2023 by nearly all measures, delivering strong results across the broader Starbucks portfolio. Our performance, including continued success in the U.S. and international markets as well as the recovery we've been seeing in China can be attributed to the strength of the global brand, relevant innovation in our product and stores and powerful execution by our partners. Let me first start globally and then with both America and the U.S. Our Q2 revenue was $8.7 billion, up 14% for the prior year and up 17%, excluding more than 2% impact of foreign currency translation. North America delivered revenue growth of 17% in Q2, growing to $6.4 billion. We captured a remarkable 11% comp growth globally with 12% comp growth in both North America and the U.S. for the second quarter, driven by mid-single-digit growth balanced between transactions and ticket. Our North America growth comes on top of 12% comp growth in the prior year. We expect this demand to continue as we push the envelope with innovation. A recent example is the highly successful launch of Oleato, an innovation Howard identified and is personally led for us. In fact, we have already reached an audience of 5 billion people since our announcement of the February global launch, Starbucks Oleato beverages, making this one of the top 5 product launches in the last 5 years in terms of brand awareness and excitement. The new innovative beverage platform is currently available in 650 stores across three markets: Italy, Japan and the U.S. Given the success we are seeing, we look forward to bringing this exciting new offering to more stores and more markets around the world this year. Scaled profitable innovation is one of the things that was our performance and is a continued area of focus. Our performance is the result of a near perfect intersection of three things: one, our successful innovative beverages suggests our Pistachio Cream Cold Brew, that inspires the expanded use of Two, our food portfolio, which resulted in record sales of our egg bytes and breakfast sandwiches. And three, our attractive convenience capabilities, Mobile Order & Pay, drive-thru and delivery, we saw sequential improvement and now accounts for 74% of Q2 U.S. company-owned revenue. You can expect us to lean strongly on purposeful innovation to further capture the tremendous opportunity, both in what we do and in how we do it. Speaking of convenience channels, our 90-day active Starbucks Awards membership added more than 400, 000 members in the quarter in the U.S., bringing our total membership to 30.8 million members. In addition, we've increased membership by 4 million year-over-year in the U.S. representing 15% growth. Rewards and members account for 57% of U.S. company-operated revenue in Q2, which marks the highest contribution on record and represents growth of 3% on a year-over-year basis. We are excited about our growth in active Rewards members as it's a contributing factor and consistent demand. We have been at vanguard in this area, and you can expect us to further invest and lead. An example of that investment is Starbucks Connect, which is now in over 1/3 of our U.S. licensed stores, giving our customers even more opportunities to engage with our brand. With such a diverse portfolio across our U.S. license locations, such as hotels, airports and other retailers, coupled with increasing offerings of convenience, we were able to capture further demand evidenced by revenue in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year supporting our strategy to meet and serve our customers wherever they are. Moving on to Reinvention. We are making great progress. The investments we made in our partners, stores and technology are already producing a return whether through productivity gains or partner satisfaction. We are pleased with the multifaceted progress to date. For example, Barista turnover reduced by over 9% from a high in March Q2 fiscal year 2022, leading to fewer newer highs per store. We've been able to increase the average hours per Barista per week by 4% year-over-year, a metric we know is one of the many meaningful inputs in achieving the desired compensation of our partners. Clearly, partners scheduling is a real opportunity for us, and we are laser-focused on it. Additionally, items per labor hour, a metric which reached a record high in December 2022, continued strong pace into and throughout Q2 despite seasonal trends. This demonstrates increased productivity in the midst of strong volumes, all by partner engagement and customer connection scores stabilized. The rollout of handheld cold foam blenders supporting customization demand commenced in the quarter with completion targeted for third quarter, just in time to support our summer demand as the desire for cold foam customization continues to grow. The Clover Vertica brewers also began to roll out in this quarter, and we'll be in nearly 40% of our company-operated stores across the U. S. by the end of this fiscal year. The vertical offers our customers our freshest Clover brewed coffee, while driving efficiencies in time and waste across our network. This is yet another example of how innovation amplifies what we do best, in this case, coffee served even better. The ultimate proof point of innovation and the progress against our Reinvention is our Q2 margin in North America of 19.2%, a 200 basis point expansion year-over-year. We have more to do to reinvent our business. Though we have further opportunity ahead, we are proud to see that our strategies are working and momentum is building. Moving on to International. We are pleased with the strength and growth across our broader portfolio. Q2 revenue was $1.9 billion, up 9% from the prior year and up 19% excluding 10% impact of foreign currency translation, representing our third highest quarterly revenue due largely to China's faster-than-expected recovery. We also achieved the highest ever quarterly system sales internationally, and we delivered a company-operated 7% comp, driven by transaction growth, spotlighting demand. Strong comps were also captured across the regions outside of China with markets like Japan and the UK, both posting double-digit comps for the eighth consecutive quarter. We're very pleased to see our International store strategy is working. In the quarter, our net new stores grew by 363, representing 8% growth year-over-year. As we look ahead to the end of the fiscal year, we will reach 20, 000 stores across the International segment on pace with a growth strategy we outlined at Investor Day. We expect China to remain on track to achieve our 13% net new store growth target for this year. Additionally, Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin American markets, are also expected to contribute meaningfully, becoming an area of further emphasis and a more significant contributor to our overall global growth. Moving on to China. Q2 marked a significant turning point when we finally began to emerge on three years of unprecedented COVID disruptions, embarking on the recovery journey that we have envisioned. We saw a robust recovery in Q2, reinforcing the resilience of our partners, the strength of our brand and the close relationships that we have built with our customers. We experienced faster-than-expected recovery, closing the quarter with nearly $800 million in revenue, up 3% from the prior year and up 11% excluding the 8% impact of foreign currency translation. Comp growth of 3% marked the first positive comp since the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. Importantly, we accelerated our store development in the quarter, opening 153 net new stores, more than doubling the net new stores in the previous quarter. We now operate over 6,200 stores across 244 cities, keeping us on track to meet our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025. Our bold decision to continue opening new stores over the past three years, despite COVID disruptions in mobility restrictions, is paying off as they continue to deliver returns and profitability. Further accelerating recovery is our rapidly expanding omnichannel business. Starbucks Delivers achieved 21% year-on-year growth to make up 23% of the sales mix, while overall mobile ordering reached 47% of sales, 4% over the prior year. Delivery demand remained robust even after consumer mobility has recovered demonstrating that it is highly incremental and interwoven into our customers' lifestyles. Our attractive portfolio supports the increasing demand, putting us in a position of strength to capture opportunity as China transitions due to the next phase of recovery. While we don't expect a straight-line recovery, we are confident in our long-term opportunity. We look forward to serving our customers with the elevated experience only Starbucks can deliver. Now let me wrap up the segment performance with Channel Development. Our Starbucks brand and successful partnerships continue to fuel the success of our channel development business with revenues of over $480 million in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Our U.S. at-home coffee continues to resonate with customers as are winning the seasons with our well-received promotions and product launches. In terms of ready-to-drink, Starbucks has outgrown the category in sales growth, for two consecutive quarters and remain the #1 brand in the U.S. To continue this trend, we launched a much anticipated pink drink and Paradise drink, which have already been met with overwhelming excitement. Before I pass the call over to Rachel, I want to again extend my gratitude to our partners, our leadership team and to Howard for the significant progress we have made as a company this past year. I also want to reinforce my confidence in our Reinvention, the work underway to refound our business, brand and culture and our position to fully realize the limitless potential of Starbucks. For our long-term sustainable growth, we will look to discover ways to first further elevate the brand by getting the basics right, operating our stores well and with a beverage-forward food attached focus for renovation. Second, build on our leadership position in digital by scaling and introducing new and relevant customer experiences. Third, evolve to a more global presence for our business and for our brand. Fourth, work to become less wasteful and move with greater speed. And fifth, and critically reinvigorate our culture around what it means to be a partner at Starbucks. With a Reinvention Plan driving progress against our business goals, a contemporized mission and a brand differentiated human connection, our momentum is strengthening the business overall. Our focus on delivering elevated experiences will continue to set us apart. As I look to close my remarks for the call, I want to reaffirm our guidance for the year, reflecting my optimism for our future even while recognizing we are operating in a challenging environment. I have great confidence in our leadership team and our partners as we carry on this journey together. We continue to build our plans for the medium to long term to recognize our limitless long-term growth potential. I could not be more excited, nor more grateful for the opportunity to build upon Starbucks' iconic legacy and shepherd in a new era for the company. With that, I'll now turn it over to Rachel to discuss our Q2 fiscal year 2023 results in greater detail. Rachel? Hey, John, thank you for your question. Firstly, I will give a bit of an overview, and then I'll call on Frank and Sara to provide their perspectives. Firstly, Starbucks continues to be a brand with a very strong employee value proposition, and we are able to attract a lot of applicants for the jobs that we have open. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing growing stabilization in what we see in our front line. As I mentioned, we are seeing lower levels of attrition and greater stabilization in our retail talent. Additionally, as you look at the improvements that we are making in our scheduling processes, we're able to deliver an average hours per week to our partners 4% higher at this point in time. That, of course, does matter because it does have an implication on the compensation that they have. There are clearly more things in the pipeline as well. And Frank, I'd love for you to give your comments on how you see the environment there. Sara, any comments from your time in stores? If I can add one more thing. I think we're seeing a strong pickup in the program of tipping that we have scaled across our store network. Rachel? I think in terms of guidance on this call, our focus is entirely in this year. So we are confirming our guidance for this year. I think as I mentioned earlier, as I've gone through the emersion and I've worked in various spots of the company. There's no question what we see is we see headroom in terms of our top line. We also see opportunities for us to improve margins over time gave a couple of examples in the prepared remarks about things that were apparent. We can buy different and we can buy better. Our end-to-end supply chain is significant opportunities to reduce cost and improve availability. We can enhance our tech stack, both to lower cost and then actually reinvested back in the tech stack to support the large digital push that we are making. Our stores need to better reflect what is needed to meet the evolved demand from where they were initially designed. Our beverage innovation is strong, food could use more work. And our innovation could be more purposeful and targeted. And these are the kinds of opportunities that I mentioned are the opportunities in the factory in the back. We also have opportunities in the theater in the front. So I think as you look at it, clearly, there's top line headroom, and there's opportunities to sequentially improve margins. But in this call, we are focused entirely on confirming our guidance for this year. Rachel and then -- I'll call in Belinda for some commentary. Rachel? Thank you for your question. I feel very good about the progress that we're making on the equipment rollout as well as the testing that is underway on the Siren System. And as you see, some of the nearer-term equipment launches have happened and have landed on time. We have a very systematic approach to how we think about our equipment and the testing that we're doing. And I feel very good about the progress we are making on that system. So all systems go as far as we're concerned. Sara, I wonder whether you want to touch a little bit on some of the equipment launches that we've had so far. Great. Frank, any comment? Great. Let me start with Brady. I think I'd love for you to give your perspective on the questions. Thank you, Rachel. I'm very pleased with the results of this quarter, and we are clearly moving with momentum as a business. There's clearly further opportunities for us and for this wonderful brand. It's a privilege to lead it. I want to thank you all for joining us today for our second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. We appreciate your investment and your time."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Laxman, and welcome to your first Starbucks earnings call, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm so proud to discuss our outstanding Q2 performance, underscoring strength in both top line and margin globally. We delivered double-digit comp in all company-operated markets, excluding China, as well as positive comp in China driven by better-than-expected recovery and saw continued strength in our licensed markets. This momentum was made possible by the investments we are making in our stores and partners and allowed us to continue unlocking capital to reinvest in our business. As a result, our business and brand remains strong. As we begin on this next step in our journey, I'm confident that our execution against our Reinvention Plan and broader strategies will progress us into our new era. Our Q2 consolidated revenues reached $8.7 billion, slightly above our Q1 level and up 14% from the prior year and up 17%, excluding more than 2 percentage impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue growth was primarily driven by 11% comparable stores sales growth, 6% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year as well as continued momentum in our global license to market. This is remarkable performance on every level, but specifically given the seasonality pressures we typically experience in Q2. Q2 consolidated operating margin expanded 130 basis points from the prior year to 14.3%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by sales leverage, including better-than-expected recovery in China, pricing, productivity improvement and lapping prior year COVID-related pay. The margin expansion was partially offset by investments in store partners, higher G&A costs in support of Reinvention and inflation. Q2 EPS was $0.74 up 25% from the prior year. In addition to our strong global performance and better-than-expected recovery in China, this also includes an approximately $0.03 of onetime benefit from Starbucks Rewards redemption tier changes in North America, which reduced the related liabilities. I will now provide segment highlights for Q2. North America delivered revenue of $6.4 billion in Q2, another quarterly record and up 17% from the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by a 12% increase in comparable store sales consisting of 6% and 5% growth in transactions and average ticket, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% year-over-year, further strengthened by the continued momentum of our licensed store business. The segment's outstanding performance was led by the U.S., posting 12% comp in Q2 with transaction and ticket equally contributing to the growth, also bolstered by lapping the Omicron variant of COVID in the prior year. Remarkably, store traffic has surpassed pre-pandemic levels in our busiest dayparts. And even with higher levels of beverage customization and complexity, we were able to serve the surge in traffic as we unlocked incremental store capacity through Reinvention. Starbucks Rewards tender reached a record 57% of U.S. company-operated sales in the quarter showcasing customer loyalty and connection and indicating a successful launch of the changes to our Star redemption tiers. We also continue to expand our store footprint across the U.S., reaching over 9,300 stores where stores opened in the last few years, driving nearly 50% cash-on-cash returns despite the inflationary environment. As part of our development strategy, we are committed to enhancing sustainability through greener stores with the program saving almost $60 million in annual operating costs in the U.S. alone through water savings and energy reduction when compared to historic store practices. Our runway of growth coupled with store-level cash returns and commitment to sustainability is exceptional for a company of our scale, contributing meaningfully to our robust capital position and ability to continue reinvesting in our business. U.S. licensed stores revenue sustained its momentum this quarter, up 25% from the prior year with strength across the portfolio and further supported by the rollout of Starbucks Connect as Laxman spoke about earlier, broadening our opportunity to reach our customers through our expanding network of stores. North America's operating margin was 19.2% in Q2, expanding 200 basis points from the prior year primarily driven by pricing, sales leverage, productivity improvement and lapping prior year COVID-related pay, partially offset by store partner investments and inflation. As you heard at the top of the call, we are already seeing our Reinvention Plan come to life, whether it's through improved partner turnover and engagement, a better customer experience or productivity, our amplifying efforts field margin growth in the quarter. A margin benefit of approximately 60 basis points was also captured in the quarter due to the reevaluation of our Starbucks Rewards liability, which will not occur in the balance of the year. Moving on to International. The segment delivered revenue of $1.9 billion in the quarter, also a Q2 record and up 9% from the prior year. When excluding a 10% impact from foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue grew 19%, reflecting double-digit growth in all major markets, including China. The growth was driven by strength across our licensed businesses, a 10% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year and a 7% increase in comparable store sales from transactions. Our international markets across the globe continue to demonstrate strong momentum. Excluding China, the segment's Q2 revenue grew 14% from the prior year or up 25% when excluding an 11% impact of foreign currency translation. Once again, our international markets, excluding China, collectively achieved double-digit comp growth, driven largely by transactions. Let me highlight the incredible performance of Japan this quarter, our third largest market globally, which surpassed 1,800 stores and delivered their eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp in Q2, as Laxman mentioned earlier. The market also upleveled its Star Rewards program through introduction of a multi-tier redemption system designed to offer more customer choices and elevate the program economics. Subsequent to the quarter in April, Japan also became the third global market to introduce Oleato beverages, offering the innovative lineup at more than 60 of their select stores included the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo. While our performance in this market, a market that embraces innovation appears promising. Shifting to China. China posted comp growth of 3% in Q2, meaningfully exceeding our expectations, including 30% comp growth in March as we began lapping heightened mobility restrictions in the prior year. From the early weeks of January, when China emerged from peak infections and mobility restrictions were lifted in different cities, we saw a broad-based recovery across all trade zones, dayparts and city tiers. This was fueled by a strong rebound in traffic as customers returned physically to our stores to enjoy moments of reconnection. Starbucks Rewards active members rebounded to 17.8 million by the end of Q2 and hit a new record high by the first week of Q3. The sharp immediate rebound in traffic demonstrated the strength of our brand and the relationships we've built with customers, as well as our strong operating muscle to capture the pent-up demand, all of which drove rapid improvement in average weekly sales in Q2. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, the speed of recovery in terms of average weekly sales will moderate after the faster-than-expected rebound achieved in Q2. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we will continue to face uncertainties such as changes in customer behaviors and the pace of international travel recovery as COVID in China enters a new endemic phase. Nevertheless, we feel confident Starbucks is well positioned for this next phase of recovery. Operating margin for the International segment was 17% in Q2, expanding 390 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage across markets, but specifically driven by the better-than-expected recovery in China partially offset by higher store partner wages and benefits. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 4% from the prior year to $481 million in Q2, in line with our expectations, driven primarily by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance. Global channel development extends customer occasions beyond our stores to amplify and diversify the Starbucks presence around the world. Our newer at-home platforms, including Starbucks Fine Espresso and Starbucks Creamers, continued to drive growth for the Global Coffee Alliance. We remain the market leader in global ready-to-drink categories with North America coffee partnership outgrowing the category and continuing to gain share for the past two quarters in a row. The North American coffee partnership saw share gains across platforms, and we're excited about our robust pipeline of innovations. To name a few, we launched Frappuccino mini cans in late March to bring a perfect size treat to our consumers. We're also elevating our portfolio with bottled Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink, which were inspired by popular handcrafted beverages in our stores and just hit store shelves in April. The segment's operating margin was 35.6% in Q2, down 710 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to impairment charges against certain manufacturing assets and mix shift. Excluding the impairment, the segment's margin was nearly 40% for the quarter, and we continue to expect channel development margin to normalize in the mid-40s range towards the end of the year. Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2023. As Laxman discussed, we are reaffirming our guidance for the fiscal year, balancing our incredible momentum and optimism with the economic uncertainties we continue to face around the world.  Let me provide some additional insights on our outlook. First, in the U.S., a meaningful part of the 12% comp in the quarter reflected a lap of Omicron in the earlier part of the quarter which was incorporated into our original guidance for Q2. U.S. comp has normalized as anticipated in March and into Q3 with expected annual comp continuing to be in the guidance range of 7% to 9%. Second, similar to comp, our Q2 North America margin also benefited from lapping a sizable amount of COVID pay in relation to Omicron accounting for 120 basis points of year-over-year expansion as well as Starbucks Rewards tier change impact of 60 basis points, which are not expected to recur in the balance of the year. Third, as I discussed earlier, we expect China's average weekly sales to sequentially grow in Q3 and Q4, but at a more moderate pace. Acknowledging the uncertain environment we expect China comp to improve in the back half of the year, driven in large part by the lap of mobility restrictions in Q3 of the prior year, coupled with the continued recovery, leading to low to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis. Lastly, although China's Q2 margin was also stronger than expected, it benefited from the timing of certain investments. As we continue to ramp our operations in the balance of the year, we plan to resume investments required to drive sustainable growth over the long term. Further, here are some points of clarification on guidance. Regarding the shape of margin, we continue to expect sequential margin improvement in both Q3 and Q4. We expect Q3 margin near the prior year level with Q4 expanding meaningfully over prior year as we lap the significant investments in wages and benefits. Note the quarterly margin shape in Q3 and Q4 is not expected to mirror the prior year.  We also expect EPS to step up in the second half of the fiscal year, improving sequentially in Q3 and Q4. We expect year-over-year EPS growth in Q3 to be meaningfully lower than our fiscal year guidance range of 15% to 20% with Q4 year-over-year EPS growth slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Our guidance continues to include the impacts of significant investments related to our Reinvention Plan as well as inflationary pressures, which are moderating. We continue to expect our G&A growth to be outsized in fiscal year 2023. A large portion of the G&A growth will reflect critical technology investments, which we believe will fuel our Reinvention and business growth. Importantly, as we conclude the first half of the fiscal year, our global performance is closely tracking to our original expectations as the significant unexpected headwinds in China were offset by strong performance in the U. S. and the rest of the world. While we continue to navigate our path to recovery in China, coupled with the heightened level of macro uncertainty around the world, we are confident that the Reinvention investments we are making in our partners, stores and customers will continue to guide our growth, delivering on our original fiscal 2023 outlook. Lastly, despite the current interest rate environment, our balance sheet remains very healthy supported by our strong cash flows and a measured financial policy targeting leverage below 3x lease-adjusted debt to EBITDA. We are in an enviable position to continue to invest in our business, deliver on our shareholder return commitments and retain financial flexibility in the face of current economic uncertainty. In summary, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. One, our global business and brand remains strong, demonstrated by both top line and margin performance in Q2. We are brewing on all cylinders across our building blocks of growth, namely strong comp, propelled by digital engagement, unrivaled innovation and engaged partners, store growth anchored by best-in-class cash returns and margin uplifted by Reinvention as it continues to gain traction. Two, our fiscal year guidance remains unchanged, balancing our optimism with the economic uncertainties around the world. And finally, our new era is coming to life as we continue unlocking capacity and driving capital returns through reinvention. The investments being fused into our business is centering us on our core while increasing differentiation and building resiliency to help us realize our limitless future. Before I close, I want to express my deep appreciation for our partners around the world, especially our Green Apron partners for the critical role they played in achieving our success this quarter, our future rests on the shoulders of many, and it's our collective unwavering commitment to serve our partners, customers and all of those from farm to cup in the best way possible to allow Starbucks to deliver on our limitless possibilities. With that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator? Sure. Thanks, Sara. The way I'd look at it is we were incredibly pleased with the performance in Q2. But when you think about, as I shared in my prepared remarks, we benefited from the lap of Omicron as well as the onetime adjustment from the Star liability. That was expected. So we expected that, and that was driven in the comp that we saw in the quarter in North America as well as broadly. But in addition to that, while we recovered better than what we expected in China, when we look out towards the balance of the year, we expect our average weekly sales in China to continue and increase to improve sequentially quarter-over-quarter, but at a more moderate pace than what we saw in Q2. We've already seen it start to moderate. And that's really driven by the fact that there's still some uncertainty in the overall environment from a recovery standpoint when you look at things like consumer behavior as well as recovery in key segments like our international travel. So when we take all of that into account, when we look at our guidance for the full year, we believe reaffirming our guidance allows us to continue to convey the momentum, but also for the confidence we have while still navigating a rather uncertain environment globally. Thanks, David. I think as we look at the remainder of the year for China, as I had shared previously, we expect that our average weekly sales will continue to improve sequentially quarter-over-quarter. We also expect that our comp will improve, especially as we lap the mobility restrictions from prior year. But when you think about the overall environment, while we're encouraged by the fact that we're seeing strong traffic in afternoon dayparts as well as on our weekends, which just speaks to a customer need to connect. There's still a lot happening in terms of the overall environment as it relates to recovery. And so when we put all of that together and we think about that, when we look to the balance of the year, we expect it to continue to improve but at a more moderate pace relative to what we saw in Q2. And that's what brings us to the full year guidance range of a low- to mid-single-digit comp, which I think when you look at that, does reflect momentum, but it also reflects confidence, especially when you look at last year, we ended the year with a negative 24% comp on a full year basis and a negative 25 -- 9% even more recently in our last quarter. So that's how we're thinking about the recovery. We're very encouraged by many of the signs that we see, but there's a lot that we're navigating. And so we feel very good about the guidance we've given as we think about the back half of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Belinda. And I would just add, Lauren, to that, that you had asked about TSDs. And we have seen our TSDs grow relative to pre-COVID levels. In fact, in our busiest daypart or morning daypart, we have surpassed our pre-COVID levels. And that's in large part due to the momentum we're seeing in our reinvention. We're able to unlock capacity and better serve our customers, and we're seeing that come to fruition in terms of our overall strength in TSDs which is also increasing in the early part of our afternoon. So we're encouraged by that. And that's leading to when Brady talked about the customer count, the growth we had in customer count, that's really across both our SR members as well as our non-SR members. So our overall customer count is increasing. Those customers are more engaged with our brand, and we see that in terms of unit growth as well as increasing transactions and then overall ticket leading to the high -- second highest average weekly sales that we've seen second only to last quarter, which was an all-time high. So we're incredibly encouraged by what we're seeing from an overall volume standpoint."

            "name": "Sara Trilling",
            "content": "I would just give one overlay. In addition to what's already been discussed we've put a tremendous amount of effort over the last quarter in bringing our teams together in formats that allow them to celebrate our mission, to build capability and it's paying off in terms of their engagement with the company. So that's one. In fact, just last week and this week, we've got partners gathering to focus at the store level all around connection and driving a different level of customer connection and customer service. I would also say that the investments that we've made in really the core of our business notably coffee and the way that we're celebrating our Black Apron partners, we're investing in partners going to origin and just more training to build competency around craft is also another area that's driving engagement with our partners at the store level. And lastly, community, which is something that our partners care deeply about. We wrapped up our April month of service. And again, that was a great way to help our partners feel connected to something bigger and with mission and values at the heart of it. Yes. Thank you. Happy to. I mean specific to Laxman, as you said, cold beverage as well as the food station, incubation tests that are complete and feasibility begins in Q3, right, for the rollout. And I think both of which these stations have already shown measurable impact on both productivity as well as throughput and testing. So we're quite bullish on them. And then overall, absolutely, we're already seeing the benefits of the investments that we've made in equipment. We're serving more customers during our busiest dayparts than we did pre-pandemic. And when I'm out in stores, I certainly hear firsthand from our partners how the equipment is making the work easier. And it's evident in speed with service. You can see it in our drive-thru times and you can also see it importantly in our productivity numbers. As we're thinking about summer and the weather is warming up around the country, some of the things that we've launched more recently called Blenders as well as at that station specifically make it easier to serve customers and enable the innovation that's going to be coming. The last piece I'd call out that we're really excited about as it relates to our core, again, coffee is Clover Vertica. We all know waste and throughput are going to be -- they're going to benefit favorably. But I think more importantly, we're putting coffee at the center, and our partners are incredibly enthusiastic about the offering that we'll give to our customers and the pride, right, that they'll feel in terms of the quality in the cup. So very, very excited about that one as well."

        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Brady Brewer",
            "content": "Sure. Yes. In the quarter, you saw in the U.S. business, an equal part in the comp between transaction comp and ticket comp. Of course, we are overlapping some bad weather last year, some Omicron surge. But really when we look under the surface of that, too, as Rachel shared in her opening remarks, record customer counts for the quarter when we look year-over-year, that we saw growth there. Transaction comps growing in our busiest dayparts. And when we get underneath the hood of that, it's really brand strength. We have growing affinity for the Starbucks brand. We saw some very good highs within the quarter for brand affinity. We look at the relevance of the innovation, so our Iced Shaken Espresso platform continuing to grow, our Refreshers platform continuing to grow, which just reinforces our cold customized plant-based beverage strategy is just yielding continued growth. You heard Laxman talk about Pistachio Cream Cold Brew. We launched Oleato in the quarter. So there's so much for customers to be excited about and giving them a reason to come to Starbucks.  And then lastly, I would just say the execution. You see our Starbucks Rewards membership rewarding Starbucks for that with more of their visits. Now 57% of U.S. transactions are from our Rewards members. And what they're telling us is, as you heard me say before, they are finding a beverage they can't get anywhere else. And so all of those things compile into a great force of momentum for Starbucks, and we continue to be a strong brand that's poised for growth in the future."

Howard.\nHoward Schultz: Thank you, Tiffany. I did not expect that. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to comment on the strong financial and operating results Starbucks reported today, highlighted by record quarterly sales of $8.7 billion, up 8% over last year, up 12%, excluding foreign exchange, a stunning 10% comp growth in the U.S. and North America, 5% comp growth globally. And except for China, very strong sales and comp growth in every international market we are in. We posted strong results despite challenging global consumer and inflationary environments, a softer quarter for retail overall and an unprecedented COVID-related headwinds that unfolded in China. Credit belongs to our partners around the world who continue to successfully satisfy record demand in our stores while delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers. In China, COVID-related mobility restrictions and a spike in COVID infections following the end of zero COVID resulted in comp sales of minus 29% for the quarter, 4x worse than what we expected. Weak sales combined with the cost to support the health, the safety and well-being of our partners, our first priority, negatively impacted total company earnings by $0.06, resulting in Q1 EPS of $0.75 per share. Despite short-term headwinds, we are confident that the end of Zero COVID marks the beginning of China's emergence from three years of pandemic, puts the country on a path to reintroducing normalcy and routine back into people's lives and positions the country to resume pre-COVID levels of consumer, social and economic growth. We also believe at the end of Zero COVID will enable renewed consumer activity in China and recovery of our business in the back half of fiscal 2023. Our view is informed by patterns of post-COVID behaviors we have seen in countries around the world as consumer activity accelerates as years of pent-up demand is released. Today, our stores in China are again open without restriction and our partners are back at work. Many have been infected and recovered from COVID. Noteworthy is that we saw a meaningful sequential improvement in sales and traffic as we move through January as people began resuming aspects of their pre-COVID lives, including gradually returning to our stores. More on China shortly. Our performance in Q1 underscores the success of the investments we are making in our people in extending our global leadership around everything coffee and in relevant innovation that together are driving sales and transaction growth around the world. Starbucks is more relevant globally today than ever before in our history, ideally positioning us to successfully execute our ambitious growth agenda and have roughly 45,000 stores delivering best-in-class returns around the world by the end of fiscal 2025. On today's call, I will highlight the drivers of our performance in Q1 and provide an update on the progress of our reinvention initiatives. I will then provide granular details specifically around the shape of our business in China and shine a bright light on the positive correlation between increases in consumer activity in China and the recovery of our business. Next, Brady will detail the beverage, food, mobile, digital and store innovation that drove record demand for Starbucks Coffee in every market outside of China in Q1. And he will speak to our record holiday performance, the strong growth in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership sequentially and year-over-year and the extraordinary record of $3.3 billion loaded on cards and gifted in the U.S. We entered Q1 with roughly $2 billion globally waiting to be spent in our stores, increased Starbucks Rewards membership and card loads serve as both a current annuity and the future driver of our business. And then finally, Rachel will highlight our Q1 financial and operating performance and speak to the confidence we have in our full-year 2023 guidance despite the significant impact from China, and we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Let me begin with North America. The record demand for Starbucks Coffee in North America, we've reported on our Q4 call accelerated in Q1 and through holiday. Despite the difficult operating environment that most retailers, particularly brick-and-mortar retailers experienced in the quarter. Average weekly sales in the U.S. company-operated stores reached a record high in Q1, exceeding the prior record set in Q4 of fiscal '22. This is -- this next line, I think, is just -- even when I read it, I'm surprised, with eight of the 10 highest sales days in our history recorded in the quarter. Consistently strong demand drove revenues up 14% to a quarterly record of $6.6 billion and a comp sale of 10% over last year. And Q1 momentum has continued in Q2. Active Starbucks Rewards membership in the U.S. exiting Q1 totaled over 30 million members, up four million members or 15% over last year and up 6% sequentially. Loyal Starbucks Reward members drove a record 56% of tender, up 3% from last year, reflecting increased customer engagement throughout our system. Our convenience channels, Mobile Order & Pay, drive-through and delivery continue to fuel our business, delivering 72% of U.S. revenue in Q1. We continue to add high returning drive-throughs that attract new customers, expand our footprint and drive new customer occasions. Our over 6,600 store U.S. license business posted similar strong results with 32% revenue growth and double-digit comps across all operating segments. What's interesting to me is while grocery retailers are representative segment within our licensed business experienced traffic and spend related headwinds across their store base in Q1, their Starbucks business proved to be the bright spot bringing incremental traffic into their stores and driving sales for us as well. We continued to roll out Starbucks Connect enabling licensed stores to offer all Starbucks Mobile Order & Pay and Rewards benefits, expanding the value offering we provide our customers and licensees and enabling us to capture demand across our broader store portfolio. Starbucks Connect is proving to be highly incremental, and we see great upside for it. Cross-functional teams continue to successfully execute against our reinvention initiatives and our reinvention investments are having a measurable positive impact on our business, evidenced by an 8% improvement in U.S. hourly retail partner turnover. Improved turnover correlates to more stable store environments, elimination of new hire-related costs, particularly training and measurable improvements in productivity, speed of service and partner customer experience scores that we're already seeing. Our Q1 performance demonstrates that our reinvention plan investments are the right investments that we are making and are delivering results and creating shareholder value, providing us with tremendous confidence in the revenue, margin and EPS expectations that we shared at our Investor Day. Let me turn to international. Outside of China, the momentum we saw in our International segment exiting Q4 continued in Q1. Excluding China and foreign currency translation, revenues for the quarter are up 25% and comps were up 11%, fueled by recovery consumption in Japan and a rebound in tourism activity across our EMEA markets, following the lift of COVID restrictions. One great example is Alshaya. Alshaya is our license partner in the Middle East for the last 23 years and among our largest international licensees with over 1,800 stores across 13 markets. They reported their strongest quarter with the Starbucks brand ever in Q1. We added 370 new stores in international in Q1 and now operate 18,700 stores across 84 markets, 43% company-operated and 57% licensed. Strong growth in our international license business reflects the outside returns the Starbucks brand delivers to our licensees, driving increased investment by our licensees in our business and growing customer engagement with our Starbucks brand around the world. Turning to channel development. The Starbucks brand relevant innovation and seasonal moments are resonating with our customers and driving sales and occasions around the world, resulting in a 15% increase in channel revenues in Q1 over last year to $478 million. We continue to hold the #1 dollar share in U.S. at-home coffee and in Q1 outpaced dollar sales growth in North America ready-to-drink category overall, again demonstrating the unique power of the Starbucks brand. In China, Starbucks received the ready-to-drink new product launch of the Year award for the introduction of Bottled Frappuccino Oat Latte. We will continue to delight our customers with exciting new beverage innovation in the months ahead, including with the launch of Starbucks ready-to-drink Pink Drink inspired by the overwhelming success of Pink Drinks served in our retail stores and certain to become a customer favorite, especially with our young customers and our Gen Z audience. Let me begin the discussion around China by saying that Starbucks has been in China now for over 24 years, and that our confidence in the future of Starbucks business in China and our aspirations for the market and our partners has never been greater. We exited Q1 with almost 6,100 Starbucks stores across 240 cities, and our newest class of stores continue despite the challenges we've had to achieve best-in-class returns and profitability. And we remain on plan to have 9,000 stores in China by the end of 2025. Our belief in China is based on our leadership position in the market, our relationship with our partners and the trust that we have among our Chinese customers and the market and our brand position. Since 2020, our Starbucks China team has been navigating the most acute COVID-related mobility restrictions and disruptions anywhere in the world, while at the same time, developing the flexibility to execute under any COVID scenario. By leading in together in service of their customers and fellow partners, our China team has navigated every challenge obstacle and volatility that COVID had put in their way, building more capability, flexibility and operating muscle with each unexpected test. That flexibility and operating muscle, coupled with deliberate investments that we've made throughout the pandemic, supported our business in Q1 and will increasingly drive efficiency, productivity, profitability and shareholder value and enable us to deliver an even more relevant and elevated Starbucks experience to our partners and our customers in the years ahead. As I shared on our last call, our recovery in China gained momentum in Q4 of 2022 despite severe mobility restrictions in many of our larger cities. We saw sequential improvement in all key operating metrics driven by the success of mobile and digital technology investments and expanded delivery capabilities built during COVID that made it easier for our customers to engage with us and better enable us to serve them. The direct positive correlation we saw between increased consumer activity in China and sales in our stores and the speed and consistency with which our business was accelerating, gave us great confidence moving through the quarter. However, in September, a new wave of COVID spiked resulting in further increased mobility restrictions, new mobile, digital and delivery capabilities enabled us to partially offset the reduction in store traffic in September. However, in early December, Zero COVID was lifted and COVID infection spiked across China, resulting in a dramatic decline in consumer activity across the country and causing the most severe COVID disruptions any retailer had encountered. For us, at its peak, nearly 1,800 Starbucks stores were closed during that month. As a result, comps in Q1 declined 29% with a 42% comp decline in December alone. But like consumers everywhere, our customers in China are creating a full return to familiar pre-COVID routines and lifestyles and huge consumer demand in China is waiting to be unleashed. Early indications are that it is beginning to happen in our largest cities now with many Chinese recovered from COVID, people returning to work, border and travel restrictions lifted, mall traffic and retail store activity on the rise and consumers reintroducing social activity back into their daily lives. We saw the strongest level of sustained customer activity we've seen in years in the run-up to and during Chinese New Year festivities. As Rachel would share, we are expecting the second half of fiscal 2023 in China to be stronger than the first half but uncertainties remain and the better part of valor is to remain cautious around precisely when our recovery in China will take full flight. However, when it does, pattern recognition, the return on pre-COVID routines and the adoption of new post-COVID routines will become self-evident in China, and customers will flock to Starbucks stores to enjoy moments of reconnection their favorite Starbucks beverages and the premium Starbucks experience our partners in China deliver. And Q1 headwinds will shift to tailwinds. We've seen this pattern repeat in markets around the world, including the United States. Despite the challenges and the uncertainties of the last three years, Starbucks' commitment to China and to our partners and business in China has never wavered. Almost 25 years after entering the market, I remain more confident than ever that we are still only in the early chapters of our growth story in China, and I'm looking forward to being with our China partners for the first time in years when I visit the country this Spring. Laxman's immersion continues to go spectacularly well. He and I engage daily as he absorbs more about our company and business and he wins the hearts and minds of Starbucks partners everywhere. Only weeks from now, Lax will take full control of the company and together with our leadership team, bring reinvention to life, guide Starbucks into a new era of growth and begin writing the next chapters of our storied history. I cannot be more confident that Lax is the right CEO at the right time for Starbucks. And Starbucks Coffee Company domestically and around the world is in great hands with him as the CEO. This -- my last earnings call is very special for me and a powerful emotional reminder of the intersection of my life at Starbucks. It was 1983, walking the beautiful streets of Milan at the inspiration for what Starbucks could one day be and made first struck me. 40 years later, I'm not sure where the years have gone. 40 years later, we have over 36,000 stores around the world, serving over 100 million customers each week. Along the way, we have created opportunity, cared for and improve the lives of millions of Starbucks partners and made progress against my goal of creating a different kind of company, a company steeped in humanity, humility and respect, where everyone is welcome, and we embrace the belief that our differences make us better and stronger. And a company unlike any company, my father ever got a chance to work for, but there's much more opportunity and much more work ahead. Finally, while Starbucks has launched many successful coffee beverages over the years, my Starbucks journey will come full circle when I return to Milan later this month to introduce something much bigger than any new promotion or beverage. While I was in Italy last summer, I discovered an enduring, transformative new category and platform for the company, unlike anything I had ever experienced. The word I would use to describe it without giving too much away is alchemy. We won't unveil details today, but it will be a game changer, so standby. Many people have asked me if my final earnings call as Starbucks CEO is bitter sweet, it really isn't. Starbucks business and brand, the quality of our coffee, the relevance of the Starbucks partner and customer experiences have defined us since our founding in 1971 and have never been better or stronger. And our future has never been brighter. It will be my pleasure to take a front row seat as Laxman leads Starbucks into and through the exciting new era of growth ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady.\nBrady Brewer: Thank you, Howard. I know I speak for so many when I say thank you for your relentless pursuit of elevating the Starbucks customer and partner experience. Your leadership to our reinvention has us well positioned to continue advancing towards our biggest aspirations with Laxman and our strengthened leadership team. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm incredibly proud of our strong Q1 performance across all markets. Today, I'll focus on what we saw in the U.S. this quarter. In addition to the strong customer demand for Starbucks overall, our results benefited from last year's strategic pricing actions and increased food attached with record sales for both Sous Vide Egg Bites and breakfast sandwiches. Our product portfolio and innovations continue to resonate with customers, especially our cold, customized beverage innovation. Beverage sales increased 13%, led by our strength in the espresso category, with featured holiday beverages like the Caramel Brul\u00e9e Latte and sugar cookie almond milk latte contributing to growth. Customized beverages continue to be a differentiator with customers all year long. Modifier sales were up 28% year-over-year in our U.S. company-operated stores, showing that customers are visiting Starbucks for beverages customized to their preferences that they cannot find anywhere else. The strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand continued to accelerate this holiday season as we surpassed, as Howard said, 30 million active Starbucks Rewards members, we drove record-breaking mobile order usage at 27% of transactions in the U.S. company-operated stores, and we reached an all-time high in the population of our weekly total active customer base. We also saw more than $3.3 billion loaded on Starbucks cards in the U.S., exceeding last year's record results and setting a new record. In fact, our gifting business was so strong that the unit sales of Starbucks Cards were greater than the next four brands of gift cards combined. This not only drives new Starbucks Rewards registrations, but it also drives our business in Q2 as evidenced by the high 56% Starbucks Reward tender that we saw in our U.S. company-operated stores at the end of the quarter. Said another way, during the holiday season, Starbucks truly becomes the currency of kindness and it drives our business. At the heart of Starbucks is uplifting human connection. This is a core part of our reinvention, and we accelerated our reinvention investments in the quarter, driving continued improvement in our industry-leading partner retention. We're also committed to elevating the customer experience. And within the quarter, we launched our first Starbucks rewards -- Reward Together partnership with Delta Airlines, which offers members of both Delta SkyMiles and Starbucks Rewards, new ways to earn rewards. On December 8, we also launched the Starbucks Rewards Odyssey experience in beta to select members. Odyssey members have been invited to partake in multiple Odyssey journeys driving increased engagement and loyalty from our members and now ownership in their loyalty experience. We also announced the national expansion of our partnership with DoorDash, which alongside Uber Eats also provides us the ability to serve customers in a convenient way and enjoy Starbucks wherever they are. And we announced changes to our Starbucks Rewards redemption tiers, which not only supports critical program growth and discount efficiencies, but it also allows us to add increasing value relevant to our members by making popular items like cold coffee, more attainable, the changes that our members have praised. Finally, we're furthering the value delivered to our SR members by bringing them coffeehouse culture and content through a new series in the Starbucks app called the Starbucks Daily, which will launch with [indiscernible] this month. In short, Starbucks is an incredibly strong brand and one that is poised for growth. I'll now turn it over to Rachel.\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am very proud of what we achieved in Q1 with nearly every business contributing to our strong performance. The remarkable strength in nearly all major markets and channels across the globe led to outperformance across our metrics when excluding the headwinds in China. Our Q1 consolidated revenues of $8.7 billion were another record quarterly high, up 8% from the prior year or 12% when excluding an approximately 3% impact of foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was primarily driven by 5% comparable store sales growth, 5% net new store growth over the past 12 months, impressive momentum in our U.S. and international licensed stores as well as our channel development businesses. When excluding China and the impact from foreign currency translation, revenues in all three of our reporting segments continued to expand double-digit, demonstrating the demand of our diverse portfolio and power of our innovation as we focus on our new era of growth. Q1 consolidated operating margin contracted 60 basis points from the prior year to 14.5%, primarily driven by investments in growth in labor, part of which represent the reinvention plan, inflation and deleverage in China. The contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets outside of China. The deleverage in China was more significant than expected, while other margin drivers were largely in line with our original guidance. Q1 EPS was $0.75, up 4% from the prior year, including an approximate $0.06 dilutive impact from the headwinds in China relative to our original expectations. Although we anticipated China's recovery to be nonlinear, the headwinds in Q1 were larger than our prior estimate by approximately $0.06 due to the unforeseen changes in COVID restriction and infection spikes. The significant strength across our global portfolio, however, largely offset the impacts from China's performance, keeping us on track to achieve our fiscal 2023 growth targets, as I'll discuss in a moment. First, I'll provide segment highlights for Q1. North America delivered another quarter of all-time record revenue in Q1 of $6.6 billion, up 14% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 10% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 9% increase in average ticket, net new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months and very strong growth in our U.S. licensed store business. Our U.S. company-operated stores had a record revenue quarter with 10% comp growth in Q1, fueled by strength in digital, innovation, and record holiday performance as both Howard and Brady shared. In addition to the continued strength in ticket, the number of unique customers grew 10%, setting another all-time record and further expanding our reach. Let me also highlight the very strong performance of U.S. licensed stores this quarter, which posted revenue growth in excess of 30% and 15% system comp growth over the prior year Q1 with strength across the portfolio. Performance was particularly strong in retail and travel as pre-COVID behavior normalcy returns, with U.S. licensed store revenue indexing at roughly a 140% of pre-pandemic levels. Grocery also experienced strong growth, powered by the continued rollout of Starbucks Connect despite the overall decline in customer traffic across the rest of grocery store industry. North America's operating margin was 18.6% in Q1, contracting 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to previously committed investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and benefits as well as inflationary headwinds, partially offset by pricing and sales leverage. While Q1 operating margin declined sequentially from Q4 fiscal 2022, driven primarily by seasonal sales mix shift, we gained productivity through reinvention, including improved partner retention and equipment rollouts, paving the way for progressive margin expansion in the latter half of fiscal 2023 and years to come. Moving to international. The segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q1, down 10% from the prior year or up 2% when excluding a nearly 13% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was driven by sustained momentum across all major markets outside of China as well as an 8% increase in total store count over the past 12 months. The growth was partially offset by a 13% decline in comparable store sales, including a 29% decline in China. Although China posted a comp decline of 29% in Q1, the heaviest decline of 42% was experienced in December with pressure carrying into Q2, all of which was well below our original estimates, as mentioned in my opening. Just to give you a little color, at its peak, nearly 1,800 stores or close to 30% of our portfolio were temporarily closed due to sharp fall in traffic and labor shortage because of partners falling sick to COVID. Outside of China and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our diverse international markets across the globe continued to outperform in Q1. Once again, these markets together achieved double-digit comp growth, driven primarily by transactions. Their revenue grew 25% in the quarter when excluding a 17% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation with successful holiday campaigns across all regions. Operating margins for the International segment was 14.3% in Q1, down 400 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by deleverage in China, but partially offset by strong sales leverage across other global markets and the resulting business mix. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 15% to $478 million in Q1, driven by double-digit growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our global ready-to-drink businesses. Within the Global Coffee Alliance, newer platforms continue to be key drivers of growth, including Starbucks by Nespresso and Starbucks Creamers. Our ready-to-drink lineups are fueled by core platforms in our international markets and robust innovations in the pipeline. Sustainability was also top of mind for the segment, trailblazing recyclable, multi-serve iced coffee bottle made from recyclable plastic. The segment's operating margin was 47.4% in Q1, up 350 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by strength in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. Let me take a few minutes to go deeper on the implications to our business from the challenges we're facing in China. In January, China's comparable sales growth was a decline of approximately 15%, which was an improvement from a decline of 42% in December. While we're seeing early positive signs of momentum rebuilding, headwinds related to COVID still exist in the market and are expected to impact the full Q2. As a result, we anticipate the negative impact on the operating income in Q2 to be comparable to or greater than Q1. Although we previously projected China recovery as early as Q3 of this fiscal year, we do not have clear line of sight into the timing of recovery and believe China's contribution as a percentage of our fiscal 2023 consolidated operating income to be lower than our original guidance assumed. However, our long-term opportunity in China is very strong. We expect the market to see meaningful sales rebound once recovery is in full swing. Until then, we continue to stay focused on the long-term growth opportunities that China will deliver while weathering the short-term and transitory challenges. Now even with that backdrop and taking into account the uncertainty of China's recovery timing, our fiscal 2023 guidance remains unchanged. As a few point of clarification on guidance, in China, we now expect negative comps to continue through the second quarter, followed by improvement in the balance of the year. Another point of clarification is that China store growth remains unchanged as we execute our strategy to expand in new cities. Also, our guidance continues to include the impacts of significant investments related to our reinvention plan and inflationary pressures which largely remain comparable to what we had originally anticipated. Lastly, our guidance reflects the latest projection of foreign currency translation with approximate two and three percentage point unfavorable impacts on fiscal 2023 revenue and earnings growth, respectively. This reflects an improvement of approximately one percentage point on both revenue and earnings growth relative to our previous expectations. Additionally, in terms of quarterly shape, operating margin is expected to decline sequentially in Q2, near prior year level driven primarily by the COVID-related headwinds in China. We still expect margins to expand in the back half of the year, improving sequentially in Q3 and Q4 as sales leverage, pricing, productivity gains from reinvention as well as recovery in China begin to contribute to positive margin expansion as the year progresses. We continue to expect the quarterly EPS shape to roughly mirror the shape of operating margin with a sequential decline in Q2 and a meaningful step up in the second half of the fiscal year. Lastly, we also remain committed to returning approximately $20 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2025 between share repurchases and dividends. Our repurchase program resumed in Q1 of this fiscal year and will accelerate as reinvention gains ground. Since the inception of our dividend program, 51 quarters ago, our annual dividend growth has averaged greater than 20%, and our dividend payout rates near the top percentile of growth companies of our size and our scale, which is an exceptional complement to our long-term EPS growth target as high as 15% to 20%. In summary, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. First, our business and our brand are strong and strengthening every day as demonstrated by the record sales in Q1. Next, our Q1 performance serves as proof point that we are progressing nicely against our strategy, inclusive of our reinvention plan and delivering the results we projected. And finally, we will continue to innovate in the critical areas of digital, product and stores as our new era of growth is just beginning to unlock, and we are excited about what lies ahead, including welcoming Laxman as CEO this spring and on our second quarterly earnings call. Now before I close, I want to express my sincere gratitude for a hard work of our Starbucks Green Apron partners across the globe, including those in China who serve our customers in a way that only Starbucks knows how. Also, with this being Howard's last earnings call, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank Howard for his vision to create a company that is truly different, where value is created for all. I know that I speak for many of us when I say we will honor your legacy while taking the company to the next level, all in making you, our partners, and our shareholders proud. With that, we'll open the call to Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. And congratulations, Howard, on your final call.\nHoward Schultz: Thank you.\nBrady Brewer: Thanks, Jeff.\nJeffrey Bernstein: My question is just on -- as I think about the U.S. comp clearly strong, up 10%. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the traffic you're seeing today versus maybe pre-COVID. I think we all recognize that the sales are well above pre-COVID levels in total. But clearly, the average check has been the driver of that. I'm just wondering if you can -- how you get comfortable with the fact that the brand is as strong as ever, whether you're able to look at the number of beverages sold. Maybe that's a better indicator or how you think about the business, again, when you strip out obviously the outsized menu pricing that's been taken. And just as an aside, Howard, I think everyone was looking up Alchemy real quick since you made mention, I'm just wondering what specifically we're talking about as the definition seems to be transformation of matter? Would love to get any kind of incremental color you want to give? Thank you.\nHoward Schultz: [Indiscernible]. Rachel, you want to take the comp question, maybe, Sara, can help you as well.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Let me start with that. Thanks, Jeffrey for the question. In response to your question around traffic, our 10% comp, as you know, was largely driven by ticket. Our transactions, transactions per store per day, which is how we measure the health of our business are still below pre-COVID levels and actually slightly below prior-year. But what's important is we saw our traffic, TSDs as well as our units and overall ticket grow in our highest demand period. So our morning daypart and our midday, which is up till about 1'o clock saw a year-over-year increase of both transactions and units as well as ticket. In addition to that, those dayparts are also in line with 2019 levels. So why that gives us encouragement is our reinvention plan is squarely rooted at creating capacity in our busiest dayparts. So as we start to move along our reinvention plan, it's going to help us increase that capacity while creating a better experience for our partners and our customers. So that gives us a lot of confidence that our growth objectives and our ambitions for this year and beyond are well suited.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.\nHoward Schultz: Next question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please state your question. Sara, your line is open.\nSara Senatore: Sorry, hi, can you hear me now?\nOperator: Yes, go ahead please.\nSara Senatore: Okay, thank you. I was wondering, Rachel, if you could just talk briefly, you mentioned China was a $0.06 headwind. So ex that, certainly, earnings would have actually been better than we were thinking. Could you just talk maybe in order of magnitude where internally you might have seen surprise? Is it the fact that U.S. comps came in a bit higher than your long-term guide has been? Is it from the other -- is it from the other geographies or segments. I just am trying to understand kind of how to think about that. And a related question, I think you said last year, China was about 25% of what it normally would be. Are you able to give us any kind of gauge of what it might look like this year, given its slower to ramp than maybe you had anticipated?\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Thanks, Sara. In terms of the question around Q1 and what drove our business outside of the headwinds in China. So if you took headwinds out, to your point, we would have been above expectations. It's a combination of things. It's stronger performance in our U.S. business, which is inclusive of our U.S. license. So our U.S. company operated as well as our U.S. license. It's also growth across our international markets. So excluding China, we had tremendous growth across our markets, which really speaks to the diversity of the depth and diversity of our portfolio. We also had tremendous growth in our channels business. In addition to that, we saw some favorability in terms of foreign exchange, smaller, but that was also a combination. So it was all of those factors together, that would have given us a stronger Q1 than what we had originally expected. Now when you think about that as it pertains to the balance of the year, we're able to reaffirm our guidance because even though we're seeing headwinds in China, and we continue to believe we'll have strong momentum across the other businesses. You can imagine there are a lot of other factors at play continuing inflationary pressures, economic challenges. So the combination of all of that gives us confidence that reaffirming our guidance is right given the position we're in today.\nHoward Schultz: Rachel, I wonder if Michael can just give us a little bit more color on how strong the international was across the board.\nMichael Conway: Yes. Thank you. To the question, I would say definitely our markets outside of China performed even better than we thought. Just to note a year-ago, most of our markets we would have said is fully recovered. And so what we're seeing now with this 25% growth is growth over growth and performance over performance. And we were also expecting in some markets to see the economy inflation slow demand and it hasn't. So as Howard talked about the tailwind, we are seeing a true tailwind and continued recovery coming out of the pandemic in all of these markets. Just for example, Latin America, we're seeing revenue growth of over 50%; EMEA, over 20%; U.K., which is a company-operated market, is having double-digit comp growth; Asia-Pacific, over 20% revenue growth, and we actually crossed 5,000 stores across that region. And then Japan, which is our third largest company-operated market is also continuing with significant growth. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of strong revenue growth, driven by not only product but actually digital. Within Japan, we are rolling out the digital flywheel, Mobile Order & Pay is fully penetrated. We've doubled our sales of Mobile Order & Pay over the last quarter. And we just introduced multi-tier redemption, which has shown success in the U.S. We're seeing a significant improvement here as well. So as we think about going forward in these markets, we see more tailwind. The international travel is just starting to come back as they start to go to other markets as well, we're going to see further tailwind going forward.\nRachel Ruggeri: And just to answer your other question, Sara, last year, we had expected China to be about 25% of the total company operating income, which is generally where it landed, we'll expect maybe closer to 50% based on what we know today.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks and congratulations, Howard. Two big picture questions that often come up with long-term investors. I don't know if this is quite the forum, but maybe a quick comment on each. One would be how you're thinking about the brand and how it would do in a recession? Should we have one? Why would go perhaps better than 2007 and 2008. And then secondly, I think we can all agree that Zero COVID is the biggest factor with China. But any sort of metrics that make you feel confident that the brand would have a full recovery, people ask about competition in China? And any sort of metrics around brand scores or anything that gives you confidence that you'll have a full recovery would be helpful. Thanks.\nHoward Schultz: David, thank you. Belinda is on the call, and she's sitting, I believe, in Shanghai, and I think she'd be best suited to answer your question regarding China recovery, the situation that she's seeing on the ground. So Belinda, can you respond to that first. And then Brady will talk about the brand.\nBelinda Wong: Yes. Thank you, Howard. Hi, thank you for the question. Starbucks brand relevance remains as strong as ever, and we're best positioned to capture the growth opportunities ahead. Our latest brand tracker shows Starbucks remains Chinese customers' first choice in the away-from-home coffee category. Also, Starbucks is the brand leader in terms of brand affinity, visitation and frequency. And despite all the COVID disruptions we faced in Q1, our customer connection score also reached another record high in Q1. So our strong operating muscle and the strong relationships that we have with our customers and our partners and the strength of our brand, really, we are best positioned and so ready to recover and accelerate the growth of our business. And I would say that there's no other competitor that can match the competitive advantages that we have, the quality of our coffee, our brand strength, our connection, our unique third place and our omnichannel capabilities, our national footprint and the digital ecosystem and supply chain excellence that we have built. Thank you.\nHoward Schultz: Brady, do you want to go to brand?\nBrady Brewer: Yes. As we think about weathering a recession in the U.S., it really comes down to two words for us, and that is momentum and innovation. And I'd say that when I say momentum, it's about relevance and resilience. And as we think about relevance, if we look at the last quarter, we have more customers in total population than ever in the U.S. They're very highly engaged. If we look at share of wallet and spend, 56% of our transactions were from our reward members. And just as Belinda said, in China, our U.S. customers see Starbucks as their first choice for coffee with leading affinities. So from a brand standpoint, we're in a very strong position. When we look at resilience, last quarter, we saw not only ticket growth but transaction growth, even in the face of the macroeconomic headwinds. So in terms of momentum, we see that carrying into the quarter ahead and the year ahead. And then I'd say innovation, as I mentioned, so product, we see continued strength in our future innovation road map and our existing strategy around cold, customized and plant-based beverages, and it comes down to beverages that customers love that they truly can only find at Starbucks. And that was true throughout the pandemic, and it's true right now. With digital, our digital platforms have been very sticky with customers. And we're just making those better as you look at things like Odyssey and Reward together. And then earlier in the presentation, Rachel shared about equipment, it's just making the job more efficient for our partners, unlocking even greater quality and more customization. So if you take that momentum and that innovation, it just reinforces that we're a very strong brand right now, looking ahead, despite any economic headwinds, we're still poised for growth.\nHoward Schultz: I would just add one thing that I think we both said in our prepared remarks, but I think it's worth repeating. At a time when people are generally trading down, and there's a lot of discounting going on, we had the highest average ticket, I believe, in our history in the month of December. And so we don't see ourselves in a situation where we need to discount heavily, and we don't see a situation where our customers are trading down. And I think the strategic advantage we have, which we talked about in the last call is customization and how our customers are creating their own proprietary beverage and that adds to the ticket and obviously adds to the value perception that customers believe they're getting at Starbucks.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you very much. Obviously, three years for the China consumer dealing with COVID is a very, very long time. And there's at least some concern that consumers' behavior maybe slightly beyond the short-term, it may be affected in terms of how people kind of interact and gather and what have you. So I wanted you to kind of comment on what you think about that? Or if you think you'll be busier than even ever. And if there's any types of leading indicators or green shoots, maybe talk about Macau or talk about Hong Kong or maybe even some markets, small markets or big ones within China that have largely dealt with this last COVID wave, again, not just looking at the aggregate numbers, but specific end market numbers where you can talk about how the consumer now that the infection is going to be over for them for quite some time is now using your brand. Thank you so much.\nHoward Schultz: Again, I'll yield to Belinda. But before I do, I think between myself and Rachel, we've been very clear that we want to take a very conservative view, especially in the near-term. In the back half of the year is where we see the return to some level of normalcy. Listen, we don't have line of sight, and I don't think anyone does on how quick things are going to respond. We just have pattern recognition for many other markets. And also, Belinda has shared with us, and we've seen the numbers of what's happened to the run-up and during Chinese New Year, which was quite robust. And so I think, John, I think we're going to be very careful, very sensitive. We are going to be on the ground in China and see for ourselves in the next month or two. And we have been very directly involved with our Chinese team trying to support them, but they've been under a lot of pressure. We just don't know. So Belinda, I think you should just give your color and what you believe is going to happen from your perspective.\nBelinda Wong: Thank you, Howard. Yes, I'd love to give some colors on what's going on in China right now. What we're seeing is that we're seeing very encouraging recovery momentum starting January, with strong sequential weekly improvement as Howard has said, and fantastic traffic during Chinese New Year holiday, and that traffic really is covering all cities, all dayparts and all trade zones. That's including transportation and tourism, and that's the trade zones that we've been suffering quite a bit in the last three years. So that's revised again. But bear in mind, and like what Howard just said, we're still in the very early stages of our recovery journey and then the country has just opened up. So we do have short-term uncertainties, and we need to be cautious and the recovery may remain nonlinear. But on the ground here, I'm happy to report that people are going back to work at their offices. You see foot traffic recovering and ramping up in commercial areas. You see people going back to cinemas to watch movies, and there's just a lot more social activities and gatherings, right, starting to and domestic trips and now starting with international as well. So -- but most importantly, we're seeing customers coming back to our stores. They're returning to our stores to enjoy the Starbucks Experience. And I want to say that all our stores are open and can operate fully now without any restrictions on operations or operating hours, and we can now fully reengage meaningfully and consistently without any disruptions with our customers and our SR members to drive visit in frequency and deliver our best Starbucks experience. We can now go full steam with our new store development, and we can continue to maximize our omnichannel capability and opportunities to be a part of our customer new regular routine post-COVID. So all are very promising signs. And I just want to end by saying Starbucks is best positioned to capture the future growth opportunities ahead in China. And I'm so confident and more confident than ever of delivering the plan and strategies we shared during Investor Day and achieve 9,000 stores by 2025. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Howard, best wishes on your next chapter and congrats on all that you've accomplished in Starbucks.\nHoward Schultz: Thank you.\nAndrew Charles: Rachel, just given that China is a 100% company operated business, I wanted to learn about how we should think about the reopening -- the operating leverage of the reopening. Is it fair to say that when you return to 2019 China sales volumes that you -- that would allow you to get back to 2019 China store level margins? Or is it wrong to think that margins can rebound above this level when you get back to 2019 volumes, just given the inroads you've made with digital and other efficiencies in the business. And what I'm really trying to get at here is that if the China sales recovery gets back to 2019 levels, does this allow you to return to the prior long-term operating margin target of 17% to 18%? Thanks.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. What I'd say, Andrew, is that we do expect to have margin expansion in China, and that will be driven by the recovery as well as the growth we're seeing beyond recovery. But in terms of a margin expectation, we would expect margin to actually be different than what we saw in 2019 as you see the growth in digital. Just to give you an example, in 2019, digital was about 10% of overall sales in the market. It's now closer to 50%. So that has a different margin structure to it. We know it leads to more overall dollars in overall volume, but it does change the margin structure. But despite that, when you take China and where we're expecting from a recovery standpoint, both this year and beyond, that leads us to the solid margin expansion we're talking about for total company this year as well as the progressive margin expansion that we spoke about at Investor Day. So it will be one part of the whole collective that will allow us to have that expansion over the long-term.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please state your question.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks. And Howard, I echo the congrats as well. I wanted to ask about the labor dynamic in China. I know you guys indicated tonight that there was some staffing challenges with the surge in COVID. But just trying to think in the months and quarters ahead, do you expect to see any staffing shortages. I know you've built a lot of stores since pre-COVID. Just trying to understand the staffing situation in that market and the ability to meet demand when it does return?\nHoward Schultz: Belinda?\nBelinda Wong: Yes. Thank you for the question. The labor shortage from December was mainly because of our partners with COVID infections and there are all -- they have all returned back to work. We do not have any labor shortage issue, and we're ready to rock and roll in hiring more people to get ready for our new store opening. So and I just wanted to highlight the fact that we have been taking care of our partners in the last three years and this year and in the last quarter, you could see that we have all-time low turnover rate and people are staying with us. And so far, I don't see any issue at all with our hiring or our people staying with Starbucks. So thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about Starbucks Rewards. So you continue to grow double-digits even at 30 million-plus members. How much opportunity do you think exists for further growth? And what are the barriers to transition non-rewards to reward members? And then just related, I know that you guys are planning to change the redemption value in the rewards program for the first time in a few years. Can you just talk about the reasons for the changes? Thank you very much.\nBrady Brewer: Great. Yes. Thank you very much, Lauren. I appreciate the question. We do see continued opportunity. If we just look at this past year, our SR membership base grew 15% in the U.S. and globally, we're seeing significant growth across our different markets as well. So we see not only that, but it's about 56% of transactions in the quarter. So we see a lot of headroom and relevance for the program. Part of that was accelerated with our launch and starts for everyone a couple of years ago when we lowered the barrier and complexity to enter the program. And we've seen that be a continued contributor over the last couple of years since we launched it. So that takes us to the more than 30 million members we have today. It's not only 15% growth over a year, 6% growth in that membership in the U.S. just quarter-over-quarter. So we see lots of reasons to be optimistic about the opportunity, and we're seeing that prove out in the numbers. In terms of the changes that we just made. Within Starbucks Rewards, we really look at that program as offering two things, both product and experiential benefits. And so we're really looking at both sides of the equation. The experiential benefits that you've seen us out of the quarter were things like reward together, the Starbucks Odyssey program and other special events, whether it's the opening of the Empire State Building and offering members the first chance to go and see a store like that. So we really try and add experiential benefits to the program to make people feel genuinely valued for being their Starbucks customer. On the product side, what you've heard are changes related to our reward redemption tiers. And the purpose of that is a couple of things. From an economic perspective, the redemption tiers and the changes we're making there better align the cost of product redemptions to our current pricing. And by making that change, it will create discount efficiency, which helps us to continue to grow the program while effectively managing margins. So that's the two dimensions we look at it on. We see just lots of opportunity left. We have an incredible road map ahead. So we're just going to keep driving the program and I think our customers will have a lot to celebrate in the years ahead.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please state your question.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Thank you and congratulations again, Howard. I want to expand a question that was asked earlier regarding the staffing level, but now expanded and maybe focus on the U.S. situation. So the labor market is still relatively tight. So can you share some update on the level of employee retention, turnover and staffing versus 2019. And perhaps if you can also comment on the evolution of the sentiment on partners and the connection scores now that you're unfolding your level of investment?\nHoward Schultz: Frank Britt?\nFrank Britt: Yes. Thank you for the question. As a fundamental part of the reinvention agenda, as you know, is labor stability, lowering turnover and increasing throughput. And we are pleased with the traction we are starting to see in retention specifically. We've improved hourly partner retention rates by over 5% versus prior year same period. We've improved over 8% versus the highest turnover period, which was in Q2 of '22 and this reduces the time and the investment required for additional new hires and it helps stabilize operations, and we're now running in a pre-COVID level relative to the stores being open. As far as the labor market at large, as you well know, the sector does face challenges relative to capacity and talent and the record low unemployment, 3.5%. However, we continue to see and experience strong and consistent overall applicant flow to support our store hiring with the typical seasonality. Our data continues to show that we are the employer of choice in retail at top tier, including the 100 percentile relative to benefits. And finally, we see lots of opportunities to continue to make Starbucks the best job in retail. And we have a very robust master plan as part of the reinvention agenda to make sure we can deliver on that brand promise to our partners in the same way we do with our customers.\nHoward Schultz: Thanks Frank.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jon Tower with Citigroup. Please state your question.\nJon Tower: Thanks for taking the question. And best wishes to Howard on what's next. Curious if you could just two things. First, talk about any incremental pricing that might be planned for fiscal '23, particularly in the U.S., given that inflation while moving lower, in aggregate is still pretty sticky. Wondering your thoughts on pricing has changed? Then secondly, if you could dig into the progress the company has made on testing the Siren system in the U.S. and when investors can expect any sort of initial feedback on expected returns and say, the impact on stores going forward?\nHoward Schultz: Rachel will take the first part, and then Sara Trilling, who runs U.S. retail will take the second.\nSara Trilling: Sure.\nHoward Schultz: Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Yes. Thanks, Jon. So in terms of incremental pricing, our comp and our revenue in North America right now, largely in our U.S. business is benefiting from pricing that was taken in back half of last year. So we're benefiting from the annualization of that pricing. As we comp that this year, we'll start to see our pricing levels normalize more to historical level ranges than what we had seen previously. And typically, our pricing had been taken in line with inflationary pressures. So given that we're seeing inflation, we're still seeing inflation elevated relative to prior years below FY '22, but we're starting to see it soften slightly. So we don't have expectations that we'll have to further that pricing increase. And instead, what we'll see is, we'll start to see pricing normalize to more historical levels by the back half of the year.\nHoward Schultz: Thank you. Sara?\nSara Trilling: Yes, absolutely. So thank you for the question. So we're continuing to roll out equipment innovations to help make the work easier for our partners, and of course drive efficiency and ultimately enable partners to better serve our customers and do it with grace. I mean no more are we in a position to roll out single pieces of equipment over a multi-year time horizon. No way, no thanks. It just can't happen given the unbelievable demand that we're seeing in our business. And so, so far, we've deployed handheld order points in 54% of our stores, cold beverage labelers in 81% [indiscernible] espresso stations 94% and the new warming ovens in 90% of our stores. So all the sides kind of those handheld order points, which are very, very useful in drive throughs are going to be rolled out fully this year. And we're seeing the benefits of that across the board. Our drive-through window times, as example, are up, as is our Mobile Order & Pay uptime, just two examples of that. I think in Q1, we completed our automated ordering for food and lobby, which removed task time and freed up energy to again focus on customers. And we've got more in the hopper. We're really just getting started as we look to reinvention to continue to drive throughput in our stores. And in close, I'd just say, we've seen all-time highs in productivity.\nRachel Ruggeri: The one thing I would add, just to finalize your question is that the Siren system is expected to be more of a '24, '25 implementation rollout. So we'll start to see the returns there, which are part of what drove our growth ambitions over the longer-term is supported by further equipment rollout in terms of that level of efficiency and productivity.\nOperator: Thank you. The last question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nBrian Harbour: Yes. Thank you. Maybe just to finish, I'll ask about channel development briefly. You've obviously seen quite strong growth there, quite good margins as well. How much do you expect that to continue? How does that kind of factor into your outlook for this year?\nHoward Schultz: Michael?\nMichael Conway: Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes. We did have a very strong performance in this quarter. From a top-line perspective, we had 15% growth that was driven by global our Coffee Alliance, our at-home coffee, where we maintained the number one share. But there was some pricing in that, and we think that's going to moderate through the course of the year. Also, we had strong North American coffee partnership performance in the quarter. Some of that also had some one-to-time benefit as we were standing up a new Coleman. So that will benefit us going forward, but we won't expect some of that to continue. So what I would say is that we benefited from a number of kind of seasonal and onetime factors. We do remain optimistic about the growth and the profile and we'll probably settle into what we have seen in the past. We have a lot of great things coming. We're launching our new Pink Drink, which we talked about at the Investor Day, which should help our ready-to-drink business and our at-home coffee business continues to be strong as we are maintaining number one share.\nRachel Ruggeri: And if I would just add, we continue to believe that channel development will be a mid-40s margin business, which is really strong, and that's what helps us in terms of being able to reaffirm our guidance on a full-year basis.\nOperator: Thank you.\nHoward Schultz: I'd just add last word.\nTiffany Willis: You do.\nHoward Schultz: Someone told me a week ago, this was my 108th not consecutive, but earnings conference call. I don't know if that's an award or not. But as many people on the phone that I've learned -- I've known many, many years, thank you for your friendship and support of Starbucks. This past year has been a gift for me. And I leave, I think, with the company, with the win that it's back with his tremendous leadership team. And Laxman, I'm thrilled that you're here. So thank you all very, very much. Really appreciate the opportunity, and thank you again for your friendship and support. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Starbucks' first quarter fiscal year 2023 conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Belinda Wong",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Howard. Hi, thank you for the question. Starbucks brand relevance remains as strong as ever, and we're best positioned to capture the growth opportunities ahead. Our latest brand tracker shows Starbucks remains Chinese customers' first choice in the away-from-home coffee category. Also, Starbucks is the brand leader in terms of brand affinity, visitation and frequency. And despite all the COVID disruptions we faced in Q1, our customer connection score also reached another record high in Q1. So our strong operating muscle and the strong relationships that we have with our customers and our partners and the strength of our brand, really, we are best positioned and so ready to recover and accelerate the growth of our business. And I would say that there's no other competitor that can match the competitive advantages that we have, the quality of our coffee, our brand strength, our connection, our unique third place and our omnichannel capabilities, our national footprint and the digital ecosystem and supply chain excellence that we have built. Thank you. Thank you, Howard. Yes, I'd love to give some colors on what's going on in China right now. What we're seeing is that we're seeing very encouraging recovery momentum starting January, with strong sequential weekly improvement as Howard has said, and fantastic traffic during Chinese New Year holiday, and that traffic really is covering all cities, all dayparts and all trade zones. That's including transportation and tourism, and that's the trade zones that we've been suffering quite a bit in the last three years. So that's revised again. But bear in mind, and like what Howard just said, we're still in the very early stages of our recovery journey and then the country has just opened up. So we do have short-term uncertainties, and we need to be cautious and the recovery may remain nonlinear. But on the ground here, I'm happy to report that people are going back to work at their offices. You see foot traffic recovering and ramping up in commercial areas. You see people going back to cinemas to watch movies, and there's just a lot more social activities and gatherings, right, starting to and domestic trips and now starting with international as well. So -- but most importantly, we're seeing customers coming back to our stores. They're returning to our stores to enjoy the Starbucks Experience. And I want to say that all our stores are open and can operate fully now without any restrictions on operations or operating hours, and we can now fully reengage meaningfully and consistently without any disruptions with our customers and our SR members to drive visit in frequency and deliver our best Starbucks experience. We can now go full steam with our new store development, and we can continue to maximize our omnichannel capability and opportunities to be a part of our customer new regular routine post-COVID. So all are very promising signs. And I just want to end by saying Starbucks is best positioned to capture the future growth opportunities ahead in China. And I'm so confident and more confident than ever of delivering the plan and strategies we shared during Investor Day and achieve 9,000 stores by 2025. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for the question. The labor shortage from December was mainly because of our partners with COVID infections and there are all -- they have all returned back to work. We do not have any labor shortage issue, and we're ready to rock and roll in hiring more people to get ready for our new store opening. So and I just wanted to highlight the fact that we have been taking care of our partners in the last three years and this year and in the last quarter, you could see that we have all-time low turnover rate and people are staying with us. And so far, I don't see any issue at all with our hiring or our people staying with Starbucks. So thank you."

            "name": "Howard Schultz",
            "content": "Thank you, Tiffany. I did not expect that. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to comment on the strong financial and operating results Starbucks reported today, highlighted by record quarterly sales of $8.7 billion, up 8% over last year, up 12%, excluding foreign exchange, a stunning 10% comp growth in the U.S. and North America, 5% comp growth globally. And except for China, very strong sales and comp growth in every international market we are in. We posted strong results despite challenging global consumer and inflationary environments, a softer quarter for retail overall and an unprecedented COVID-related headwinds that unfolded in China. Credit belongs to our partners around the world who continue to successfully satisfy record demand in our stores while delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers. In China, COVID-related mobility restrictions and a spike in COVID infections following the end of zero COVID resulted in comp sales of minus 29% for the quarter, 4x worse than what we expected. Weak sales combined with the cost to support the health, the safety and well-being of our partners, our first priority, negatively impacted total company earnings by $0.06, resulting in Q1 EPS of $0.75 per share. Despite short-term headwinds, we are confident that the end of Zero COVID marks the beginning of China's emergence from three years of pandemic, puts the country on a path to reintroducing normalcy and routine back into people's lives and positions the country to resume pre-COVID levels of consumer, social and economic growth. We also believe at the end of Zero COVID will enable renewed consumer activity in China and recovery of our business in the back half of fiscal 2023. Our view is informed by patterns of post-COVID behaviors we have seen in countries around the world as consumer activity accelerates as years of pent-up demand is released. Today, our stores in China are again open without restriction and our partners are back at work. Many have been infected and recovered from COVID. Noteworthy is that we saw a meaningful sequential improvement in sales and traffic as we move through January as people began resuming aspects of their pre-COVID lives, including gradually returning to our stores. More on China shortly. Our performance in Q1 underscores the success of the investments we are making in our people in extending our global leadership around everything coffee and in relevant innovation that together are driving sales and transaction growth around the world. Starbucks is more relevant globally today than ever before in our history, ideally positioning us to successfully execute our ambitious growth agenda and have roughly 45,000 stores delivering best-in-class returns around the world by the end of fiscal 2025. On today's call, I will highlight the drivers of our performance in Q1 and provide an update on the progress of our reinvention initiatives. I will then provide granular details specifically around the shape of our business in China and shine a bright light on the positive correlation between increases in consumer activity in China and the recovery of our business. Next, Brady will detail the beverage, food, mobile, digital and store innovation that drove record demand for Starbucks Coffee in every market outside of China in Q1. And he will speak to our record holiday performance, the strong growth in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership sequentially and year-over-year and the extraordinary record of $3.3 billion loaded on cards and gifted in the U.S. We entered Q1 with roughly $2 billion globally waiting to be spent in our stores, increased Starbucks Rewards membership and card loads serve as both a current annuity and the future driver of our business. And then finally, Rachel will highlight our Q1 financial and operating performance and speak to the confidence we have in our full-year 2023 guidance despite the significant impact from China, and we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Let me begin with North America. The record demand for Starbucks Coffee in North America, we've reported on our Q4 call accelerated in Q1 and through holiday. Despite the difficult operating environment that most retailers, particularly brick-and-mortar retailers experienced in the quarter. Average weekly sales in the U.S. company-operated stores reached a record high in Q1, exceeding the prior record set in Q4 of fiscal '22. This is -- this next line, I think, is just -- even when I read it, I'm surprised, with eight of the 10 highest sales days in our history recorded in the quarter. Consistently strong demand drove revenues up 14% to a quarterly record of $6.6 billion and a comp sale of 10% over last year. And Q1 momentum has continued in Q2. Active Starbucks Rewards membership in the U.S. exiting Q1 totaled over 30 million members, up four million members or 15% over last year and up 6% sequentially. Loyal Starbucks Reward members drove a record 56% of tender, up 3% from last year, reflecting increased customer engagement throughout our system. Our convenience channels, Mobile Order & Pay, drive-through and delivery continue to fuel our business, delivering 72% of U.S. revenue in Q1. We continue to add high returning drive-throughs that attract new customers, expand our footprint and drive new customer occasions. Our over 6,600 store U.S. license business posted similar strong results with 32% revenue growth and double-digit comps across all operating segments. What's interesting to me is while grocery retailers are representative segment within our licensed business experienced traffic and spend related headwinds across their store base in Q1, their Starbucks business proved to be the bright spot bringing incremental traffic into their stores and driving sales for us as well. We continued to roll out Starbucks Connect enabling licensed stores to offer all Starbucks Mobile Order & Pay and Rewards benefits, expanding the value offering we provide our customers and licensees and enabling us to capture demand across our broader store portfolio. Starbucks Connect is proving to be highly incremental, and we see great upside for it. Cross-functional teams continue to successfully execute against our reinvention initiatives and our reinvention investments are having a measurable positive impact on our business, evidenced by an 8% improvement in U.S. hourly retail partner turnover. Improved turnover correlates to more stable store environments, elimination of new hire-related costs, particularly training and measurable improvements in productivity, speed of service and partner customer experience scores that we're already seeing. Our Q1 performance demonstrates that our reinvention plan investments are the right investments that we are making and are delivering results and creating shareholder value, providing us with tremendous confidence in the revenue, margin and EPS expectations that we shared at our Investor Day. Let me turn to international. Outside of China, the momentum we saw in our International segment exiting Q4 continued in Q1. Excluding China and foreign currency translation, revenues for the quarter are up 25% and comps were up 11%, fueled by recovery consumption in Japan and a rebound in tourism activity across our EMEA markets, following the lift of COVID restrictions. One great example is Alshaya. Alshaya is our license partner in the Middle East for the last 23 years and among our largest international licensees with over 1,800 stores across 13 markets. They reported their strongest quarter with the Starbucks brand ever in Q1. We added 370 new stores in international in Q1 and now operate 18,700 stores across 84 markets, 43% company-operated and 57% licensed. Strong growth in our international license business reflects the outside returns the Starbucks brand delivers to our licensees, driving increased investment by our licensees in our business and growing customer engagement with our Starbucks brand around the world. Turning to channel development. The Starbucks brand relevant innovation and seasonal moments are resonating with our customers and driving sales and occasions around the world, resulting in a 15% increase in channel revenues in Q1 over last year to $478 million. We continue to hold the #1 dollar share in U.S. at-home coffee and in Q1 outpaced dollar sales growth in North America ready-to-drink category overall, again demonstrating the unique power of the Starbucks brand. In China, Starbucks received the ready-to-drink new product launch of the Year award for the introduction of Bottled Frappuccino Oat Latte. We will continue to delight our customers with exciting new beverage innovation in the months ahead, including with the launch of Starbucks ready-to-drink Pink Drink inspired by the overwhelming success of Pink Drinks served in our retail stores and certain to become a customer favorite, especially with our young customers and our Gen Z audience. Let me begin the discussion around China by saying that Starbucks has been in China now for over 24 years, and that our confidence in the future of Starbucks business in China and our aspirations for the market and our partners has never been greater. We exited Q1 with almost 6,100 Starbucks stores across 240 cities, and our newest class of stores continue despite the challenges we've had to achieve best-in-class returns and profitability. And we remain on plan to have 9,000 stores in China by the end of 2025. Our belief in China is based on our leadership position in the market, our relationship with our partners and the trust that we have among our Chinese customers and the market and our brand position. Since 2020, our Starbucks China team has been navigating the most acute COVID-related mobility restrictions and disruptions anywhere in the world, while at the same time, developing the flexibility to execute under any COVID scenario. By leading in together in service of their customers and fellow partners, our China team has navigated every challenge obstacle and volatility that COVID had put in their way, building more capability, flexibility and operating muscle with each unexpected test. That flexibility and operating muscle, coupled with deliberate investments that we've made throughout the pandemic, supported our business in Q1 and will increasingly drive efficiency, productivity, profitability and shareholder value and enable us to deliver an even more relevant and elevated Starbucks experience to our partners and our customers in the years ahead. As I shared on our last call, our recovery in China gained momentum in Q4 of 2022 despite severe mobility restrictions in many of our larger cities. We saw sequential improvement in all key operating metrics driven by the success of mobile and digital technology investments and expanded delivery capabilities built during COVID that made it easier for our customers to engage with us and better enable us to serve them. The direct positive correlation we saw between increased consumer activity in China and sales in our stores and the speed and consistency with which our business was accelerating, gave us great confidence moving through the quarter. However, in September, a new wave of COVID spiked resulting in further increased mobility restrictions, new mobile, digital and delivery capabilities enabled us to partially offset the reduction in store traffic in September. However, in early December, Zero COVID was lifted and COVID infection spiked across China, resulting in a dramatic decline in consumer activity across the country and causing the most severe COVID disruptions any retailer had encountered. For us, at its peak, nearly 1,800 Starbucks stores were closed during that month. As a result, comps in Q1 declined 29% with a 42% comp decline in December alone. But like consumers everywhere, our customers in China are creating a full return to familiar pre-COVID routines and lifestyles and huge consumer demand in China is waiting to be unleashed. Early indications are that it is beginning to happen in our largest cities now with many Chinese recovered from COVID, people returning to work, border and travel restrictions lifted, mall traffic and retail store activity on the rise and consumers reintroducing social activity back into their daily lives. We saw the strongest level of sustained customer activity we've seen in years in the run-up to and during Chinese New Year festivities. As Rachel would share, we are expecting the second half of fiscal 2023 in China to be stronger than the first half but uncertainties remain and the better part of valor is to remain cautious around precisely when our recovery in China will take full flight. However, when it does, pattern recognition, the return on pre-COVID routines and the adoption of new post-COVID routines will become self-evident in China, and customers will flock to Starbucks stores to enjoy moments of reconnection their favorite Starbucks beverages and the premium Starbucks experience our partners in China deliver. And Q1 headwinds will shift to tailwinds. We've seen this pattern repeat in markets around the world, including the United States. Despite the challenges and the uncertainties of the last three years, Starbucks' commitment to China and to our partners and business in China has never wavered. Almost 25 years after entering the market, I remain more confident than ever that we are still only in the early chapters of our growth story in China, and I'm looking forward to being with our China partners for the first time in years when I visit the country this Spring. Laxman's immersion continues to go spectacularly well. He and I engage daily as he absorbs more about our company and business and he wins the hearts and minds of Starbucks partners everywhere. Only weeks from now, Lax will take full control of the company and together with our leadership team, bring reinvention to life, guide Starbucks into a new era of growth and begin writing the next chapters of our storied history. I cannot be more confident that Lax is the right CEO at the right time for Starbucks. And Starbucks Coffee Company domestically and around the world is in great hands with him as the CEO. This -- my last earnings call is very special for me and a powerful emotional reminder of the intersection of my life at Starbucks. It was 1983, walking the beautiful streets of Milan at the inspiration for what Starbucks could one day be and made first struck me. 40 years later, I'm not sure where the years have gone. 40 years later, we have over 36,000 stores around the world, serving over 100 million customers each week. Along the way, we have created opportunity, cared for and improve the lives of millions of Starbucks partners and made progress against my goal of creating a different kind of company, a company steeped in humanity, humility and respect, where everyone is welcome, and we embrace the belief that our differences make us better and stronger. And a company unlike any company, my father ever got a chance to work for, but there's much more opportunity and much more work ahead. Finally, while Starbucks has launched many successful coffee beverages over the years, my Starbucks journey will come full circle when I return to Milan later this month to introduce something much bigger than any new promotion or beverage. While I was in Italy last summer, I discovered an enduring, transformative new category and platform for the company, unlike anything I had ever experienced. The word I would use to describe it without giving too much away is alchemy. We won't unveil details today, but it will be a game changer, so standby. Many people have asked me if my final earnings call as Starbucks CEO is bitter sweet, it really isn't. Starbucks business and brand, the quality of our coffee, the relevance of the Starbucks partner and customer experiences have defined us since our founding in 1971 and have never been better or stronger. And our future has never been brighter. It will be my pleasure to take a front row seat as Laxman leads Starbucks into and through the exciting new era of growth ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady. Thank you. [Indiscernible]. Rachel, you want to take the comp question, maybe, Sara, can help you as well. Next question. Rachel, I wonder if Michael can just give us a little bit more color on how strong the international was across the board. David, thank you. Belinda is on the call, and she's sitting, I believe, in Shanghai, and I think she'd be best suited to answer your question regarding China recovery, the situation that she's seeing on the ground. So Belinda, can you respond to that first. And then Brady will talk about the brand. Brady, do you want to go to brand? I would just add one thing that I think we both said in our prepared remarks, but I think it's worth repeating. At a time when people are generally trading down, and there's a lot of discounting going on, we had the highest average ticket, I believe, in our history in the month of December. And so we don't see ourselves in a situation where we need to discount heavily, and we don't see a situation where our customers are trading down. And I think the strategic advantage we have, which we talked about in the last call is customization and how our customers are creating their own proprietary beverage and that adds to the ticket and obviously adds to the value perception that customers believe they're getting at Starbucks. Again, I'll yield to Belinda. But before I do, I think between myself and Rachel, we've been very clear that we want to take a very conservative view, especially in the near-term. In the back half of the year is where we see the return to some level of normalcy. Listen, we don't have line of sight, and I don't think anyone does on how quick things are going to respond. We just have pattern recognition for many other markets. And also, Belinda has shared with us, and we've seen the numbers of what's happened to the run-up and during Chinese New Year, which was quite robust. And so I think, John, I think we're going to be very careful, very sensitive. We are going to be on the ground in China and see for ourselves in the next month or two. And we have been very directly involved with our Chinese team trying to support them, but they've been under a lot of pressure. We just don't know. So Belinda, I think you should just give your color and what you believe is going to happen from your perspective. Thank you. Belinda? Frank Britt? Thanks Frank. Rachel will take the first part, and then Sara Trilling, who runs U.S. retail will take the second. Rachel? Thank you. Sara? Michael? I'd just add last word. Someone told me a week ago, this was my 108th not consecutive, but earnings conference call. I don't know if that's an award or not. But as many people on the phone that I've learned -- I've known many, many years, thank you for your friendship and support of Starbucks. This past year has been a gift for me. And I leave, I think, with the company, with the win that it's back with his tremendous leadership team. And Laxman, I'm thrilled that you're here. So thank you all very, very much. Really appreciate the opportunity, and thank you again for your friendship and support. Thank you."

Just to note a year-ago, most of our markets we would have said is fully recovered. And so what we're seeing now with this 25% growth is growth over growth and performance over performance. And we were also expecting in some markets to see the economy inflation slow demand and it hasn't. So as Howard talked about the tailwind, we are seeing a true tailwind and continued recovery coming out of the pandemic in all of these markets. Just for example, Latin America, we're seeing revenue growth of over 50%; EMEA, over 20%; U.K., which is a company-operated market, is having double-digit comp growth; Asia-Pacific, over 20% revenue growth, and we actually crossed 5,000 stores across that region. And then Japan, which is our third largest company-operated market is also continuing with significant growth. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of strong revenue growth, driven by not only product but actually digital. Within Japan, we are rolling out the digital flywheel, Mobile Order & Pay is fully penetrated. We've doubled our sales of Mobile Order & Pay over the last quarter. And we just introduced multi-tier redemption, which has shown success in the U.S. We're seeing a significant improvement here as well. So as we think about going forward in these markets, we see more tailwind. The international travel is just starting to come back as they start to go to other markets as well, we're going to see further tailwind going forward. Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes. We did have a very strong performance in this quarter. From a top-line perspective, we had 15% growth that was driven by global our Coffee Alliance, our at-home coffee, where we maintained the number one share. But there was some pricing in that, and we think that's going to moderate through the course of the year. Also, we had strong North American coffee partnership performance in the quarter. Some of that also had some one-to-time benefit as we were standing up a new Coleman. So that will benefit us going forward, but we won't expect some of that to continue. So what I would say is that we benefited from a number of kind of seasonal and onetime factors. We do remain optimistic about the growth and the profile and we'll probably settle into what we have seen in the past. We have a lot of great things coming. We're launching our new Pink Drink, which we talked about at the Investor Day, which should help our ready-to-drink business and our at-home coffee business continues to be strong as we are maintaining number one share."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am very proud of what we achieved in Q1 with nearly every business contributing to our strong performance. The remarkable strength in nearly all major markets and channels across the globe led to outperformance across our metrics when excluding the headwinds in China. Our Q1 consolidated revenues of $8.7 billion were another record quarterly high, up 8% from the prior year or 12% when excluding an approximately 3% impact of foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was primarily driven by 5% comparable store sales growth, 5% net new store growth over the past 12 months, impressive momentum in our U.S. and international licensed stores as well as our channel development businesses. When excluding China and the impact from foreign currency translation, revenues in all three of our reporting segments continued to expand double-digit, demonstrating the demand of our diverse portfolio and power of our innovation as we focus on our new era of growth. Q1 consolidated operating margin contracted 60 basis points from the prior year to 14.5%, primarily driven by investments in growth in labor, part of which represent the reinvention plan, inflation and deleverage in China. The contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets outside of China. The deleverage in China was more significant than expected, while other margin drivers were largely in line with our original guidance. Q1 EPS was $0.75, up 4% from the prior year, including an approximate $0.06 dilutive impact from the headwinds in China relative to our original expectations. Although we anticipated China's recovery to be nonlinear, the headwinds in Q1 were larger than our prior estimate by approximately $0.06 due to the unforeseen changes in COVID restriction and infection spikes. The significant strength across our global portfolio, however, largely offset the impacts from China's performance, keeping us on track to achieve our fiscal 2023 growth targets, as I'll discuss in a moment. First, I'll provide segment highlights for Q1. North America delivered another quarter of all-time record revenue in Q1 of $6.6 billion, up 14% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 10% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 9% increase in average ticket, net new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months and very strong growth in our U.S. licensed store business. Our U.S. company-operated stores had a record revenue quarter with 10% comp growth in Q1, fueled by strength in digital, innovation, and record holiday performance as both Howard and Brady shared. In addition to the continued strength in ticket, the number of unique customers grew 10%, setting another all-time record and further expanding our reach. Let me also highlight the very strong performance of U.S. licensed stores this quarter, which posted revenue growth in excess of 30% and 15% system comp growth over the prior year Q1 with strength across the portfolio. Performance was particularly strong in retail and travel as pre-COVID behavior normalcy returns, with U.S. licensed store revenue indexing at roughly a 140% of pre-pandemic levels. Grocery also experienced strong growth, powered by the continued rollout of Starbucks Connect despite the overall decline in customer traffic across the rest of grocery store industry. North America's operating margin was 18.6% in Q1, contracting 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to previously committed investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and benefits as well as inflationary headwinds, partially offset by pricing and sales leverage. While Q1 operating margin declined sequentially from Q4 fiscal 2022, driven primarily by seasonal sales mix shift, we gained productivity through reinvention, including improved partner retention and equipment rollouts, paving the way for progressive margin expansion in the latter half of fiscal 2023 and years to come. Moving to international. The segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q1, down 10% from the prior year or up 2% when excluding a nearly 13% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was driven by sustained momentum across all major markets outside of China as well as an 8% increase in total store count over the past 12 months. The growth was partially offset by a 13% decline in comparable store sales, including a 29% decline in China. Although China posted a comp decline of 29% in Q1, the heaviest decline of 42% was experienced in December with pressure carrying into Q2, all of which was well below our original estimates, as mentioned in my opening. Just to give you a little color, at its peak, nearly 1,800 stores or close to 30% of our portfolio were temporarily closed due to sharp fall in traffic and labor shortage because of partners falling sick to COVID. Outside of China and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our diverse international markets across the globe continued to outperform in Q1. Once again, these markets together achieved double-digit comp growth, driven primarily by transactions. Their revenue grew 25% in the quarter when excluding a 17% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation with successful holiday campaigns across all regions. Operating margins for the International segment was 14.3% in Q1, down 400 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by deleverage in China, but partially offset by strong sales leverage across other global markets and the resulting business mix. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 15% to $478 million in Q1, driven by double-digit growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our global ready-to-drink businesses. Within the Global Coffee Alliance, newer platforms continue to be key drivers of growth, including Starbucks by Nespresso and Starbucks Creamers. Our ready-to-drink lineups are fueled by core platforms in our international markets and robust innovations in the pipeline. Sustainability was also top of mind for the segment, trailblazing recyclable, multi-serve iced coffee bottle made from recyclable plastic. The segment's operating margin was 47.4% in Q1, up 350 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by strength in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. Let me take a few minutes to go deeper on the implications to our business from the challenges we're facing in China. In January, China's comparable sales growth was a decline of approximately 15%, which was an improvement from a decline of 42% in December. While we're seeing early positive signs of momentum rebuilding, headwinds related to COVID still exist in the market and are expected to impact the full Q2. As a result, we anticipate the negative impact on the operating income in Q2 to be comparable to or greater than Q1. Although we previously projected China recovery as early as Q3 of this fiscal year, we do not have clear line of sight into the timing of recovery and believe China's contribution as a percentage of our fiscal 2023 consolidated operating income to be lower than our original guidance assumed. However, our long-term opportunity in China is very strong. We expect the market to see meaningful sales rebound once recovery is in full swing. Until then, we continue to stay focused on the long-term growth opportunities that China will deliver while weathering the short-term and transitory challenges. Now even with that backdrop and taking into account the uncertainty of China's recovery timing, our fiscal 2023 guidance remains unchanged. As a few point of clarification on guidance, in China, we now expect negative comps to continue through the second quarter, followed by improvement in the balance of the year. Another point of clarification is that China store growth remains unchanged as we execute our strategy to expand in new cities. Also, our guidance continues to include the impacts of significant investments related to our reinvention plan and inflationary pressures which largely remain comparable to what we had originally anticipated. Lastly, our guidance reflects the latest projection of foreign currency translation with approximate two and three percentage point unfavorable impacts on fiscal 2023 revenue and earnings growth, respectively. This reflects an improvement of approximately one percentage point on both revenue and earnings growth relative to our previous expectations. Additionally, in terms of quarterly shape, operating margin is expected to decline sequentially in Q2, near prior year level driven primarily by the COVID-related headwinds in China. We still expect margins to expand in the back half of the year, improving sequentially in Q3 and Q4 as sales leverage, pricing, productivity gains from reinvention as well as recovery in China begin to contribute to positive margin expansion as the year progresses. We continue to expect the quarterly EPS shape to roughly mirror the shape of operating margin with a sequential decline in Q2 and a meaningful step up in the second half of the fiscal year. Lastly, we also remain committed to returning approximately $20 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2025 between share repurchases and dividends. Our repurchase program resumed in Q1 of this fiscal year and will accelerate as reinvention gains ground. Since the inception of our dividend program, 51 quarters ago, our annual dividend growth has averaged greater than 20%, and our dividend payout rates near the top percentile of growth companies of our size and our scale, which is an exceptional complement to our long-term EPS growth target as high as 15% to 20%. In summary, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. First, our business and our brand are strong and strengthening every day as demonstrated by the record sales in Q1. Next, our Q1 performance serves as proof point that we are progressing nicely against our strategy, inclusive of our reinvention plan and delivering the results we projected. And finally, we will continue to innovate in the critical areas of digital, product and stores as our new era of growth is just beginning to unlock, and we are excited about what lies ahead, including welcoming Laxman as CEO this spring and on our second quarterly earnings call. Now before I close, I want to express my sincere gratitude for a hard work of our Starbucks Green Apron partners across the globe, including those in China who serve our customers in a way that only Starbucks knows how. Also, with this being Howard's last earnings call, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank Howard for his vision to create a company that is truly different, where value is created for all. I know that I speak for many of us when I say we will honor your legacy while taking the company to the next level, all in making you, our partners, and our shareholders proud. With that, we'll open the call to Q&A. Operator? Sure. Let me start with that. Thanks, Jeffrey for the question. In response to your question around traffic, our 10% comp, as you know, was largely driven by ticket. Our transactions, transactions per store per day, which is how we measure the health of our business are still below pre-COVID levels and actually slightly below prior-year. But what's important is we saw our traffic, TSDs as well as our units and overall ticket grow in our highest demand period. So our morning daypart and our midday, which is up till about 1'o clock saw a year-over-year increase of both transactions and units as well as ticket. In addition to that, those dayparts are also in line with 2019 levels. So why that gives us encouragement is our reinvention plan is squarely rooted at creating capacity in our busiest dayparts. So as we start to move along our reinvention plan, it's going to help us increase that capacity while creating a better experience for our partners and our customers. So that gives us a lot of confidence that our growth objectives and our ambitions for this year and beyond are well suited. Sure. Thanks, Sara. In terms of the question around Q1 and what drove our business outside of the headwinds in China. So if you took headwinds out, to your point, we would have been above expectations. It's a combination of things. It's stronger performance in our U.S. business, which is inclusive of our U.S. license. So our U.S. company operated as well as our U.S. license. It's also growth across our international markets. So excluding China, we had tremendous growth across our markets, which really speaks to the diversity of the depth and diversity of our portfolio. We also had tremendous growth in our channels business. In addition to that, we saw some favorability in terms of foreign exchange, smaller, but that was also a combination. So it was all of those factors together, that would have given us a stronger Q1 than what we had originally expected. Now when you think about that as it pertains to the balance of the year, we're able to reaffirm our guidance because even though we're seeing headwinds in China, and we continue to believe we'll have strong momentum across the other businesses. You can imagine there are a lot of other factors at play continuing inflationary pressures, economic challenges. So the combination of all of that gives us confidence that reaffirming our guidance is right given the position we're in today. And just to answer your other question, Sara, last year, we had expected China to be about 25% of the total company operating income, which is generally where it landed, we'll expect maybe closer to 50% based on what we know today. Sure. What I'd say, Andrew, is that we do expect to have margin expansion in China, and that will be driven by the recovery as well as the growth we're seeing beyond recovery. But in terms of a margin expectation, we would expect margin to actually be different than what we saw in 2019 as you see the growth in digital. Just to give you an example, in 2019, digital was about 10% of overall sales in the market. It's now closer to 50%. So that has a different margin structure to it. We know it leads to more overall dollars in overall volume, but it does change the margin structure. But despite that, when you take China and where we're expecting from a recovery standpoint, both this year and beyond, that leads us to the solid margin expansion we're talking about for total company this year as well as the progressive margin expansion that we spoke about at Investor Day. So it will be one part of the whole collective that will allow us to have that expansion over the long-term. Yes. Thanks, Jon. So in terms of incremental pricing, our comp and our revenue in North America right now, largely in our U.S. business is benefiting from pricing that was taken in back half of last year. So we're benefiting from the annualization of that pricing. As we comp that this year, we'll start to see our pricing levels normalize more to historical level ranges than what we had seen previously. And typically, our pricing had been taken in line with inflationary pressures. So given that we're seeing inflation, we're still seeing inflation elevated relative to prior years below FY '22, but we're starting to see it soften slightly. So we don't have expectations that we'll have to further that pricing increase. And instead, what we'll see is, we'll start to see pricing normalize to more historical levels by the back half of the year. The one thing I would add, just to finalize your question is that the Siren system is expected to be more of a '24, '25 implementation rollout. So we'll start to see the returns there, which are part of what drove our growth ambitions over the longer-term is supported by further equipment rollout in terms of that level of efficiency and productivity. And if I would just add, we continue to believe that channel development will be a mid-40s margin business, which is really strong, and that's what helps us in terms of being able to reaffirm our guidance on a full-year basis."

            "name": "Sara Trilling",
            "content": "Sure. Yes, absolutely. So thank you for the question. So we're continuing to roll out equipment innovations to help make the work easier for our partners, and of course drive efficiency and ultimately enable partners to better serve our customers and do it with grace. I mean no more are we in a position to roll out single pieces of equipment over a multi-year time horizon. No way, no thanks. It just can't happen given the unbelievable demand that we're seeing in our business. And so, so far, we've deployed handheld order points in 54% of our stores, cold beverage labelers in 81% [indiscernible] espresso stations 94% and the new warming ovens in 90% of our stores. So all the sides kind of those handheld order points, which are very, very useful in drive throughs are going to be rolled out fully this year. And we're seeing the benefits of that across the board. Our drive-through window times, as example, are up, as is our Mobile Order & Pay uptime, just two examples of that. I think in Q1, we completed our automated ordering for food and lobby, which removed task time and freed up energy to again focus on customers. And we've got more in the hopper. We're really just getting started as we look to reinvention to continue to drive throughput in our stores. And in close, I'd just say, we've seen all-time highs in productivity."

            "name": "Brady Brewer",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard. I know I speak for so many when I say thank you for your relentless pursuit of elevating the Starbucks customer and partner experience. Your leadership to our reinvention has us well positioned to continue advancing towards our biggest aspirations with Laxman and our strengthened leadership team. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm incredibly proud of our strong Q1 performance across all markets. Today, I'll focus on what we saw in the U.S. this quarter. In addition to the strong customer demand for Starbucks overall, our results benefited from last year's strategic pricing actions and increased food attached with record sales for both Sous Vide Egg Bites and breakfast sandwiches. Our product portfolio and innovations continue to resonate with customers, especially our cold, customized beverage innovation. Beverage sales increased 13%, led by our strength in the espresso category, with featured holiday beverages like the Caramel Brule\u0301e Latte and sugar cookie almond milk latte contributing to growth. Customized beverages continue to be a differentiator with customers all year long. Modifier sales were up 28% year-over-year in our U.S. company-operated stores, showing that customers are visiting Starbucks for beverages customized to their preferences that they cannot find anywhere else. The strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand continued to accelerate this holiday season as we surpassed, as Howard said, 30 million active Starbucks Rewards members, we drove record-breaking mobile order usage at 27% of transactions in the U.S. company-operated stores, and we reached an all-time high in the population of our weekly total active customer base. We also saw more than $3.3 billion loaded on Starbucks cards in the U.S., exceeding last year's record results and setting a new record. In fact, our gifting business was so strong that the unit sales of Starbucks Cards were greater than the next four brands of gift cards combined. This not only drives new Starbucks Rewards registrations, but it also drives our business in Q2 as evidenced by the high 56% Starbucks Reward tender that we saw in our U.S. company-operated stores at the end of the quarter. Said another way, during the holiday season, Starbucks truly becomes the currency of kindness and it drives our business. At the heart of Starbucks is uplifting human connection. This is a core part of our reinvention, and we accelerated our reinvention investments in the quarter, driving continued improvement in our industry-leading partner retention. We're also committed to elevating the customer experience. And within the quarter, we launched our first Starbucks rewards -- Reward Together partnership with Delta Airlines, which offers members of both Delta SkyMiles and Starbucks Rewards, new ways to earn rewards. On December 8, we also launched the Starbucks Rewards Odyssey experience in beta to select members. Odyssey members have been invited to partake in multiple Odyssey journeys driving increased engagement and loyalty from our members and now ownership in their loyalty experience. We also announced the national expansion of our partnership with DoorDash, which alongside Uber Eats also provides us the ability to serve customers in a convenient way and enjoy Starbucks wherever they are. And we announced changes to our Starbucks Rewards redemption tiers, which not only supports critical program growth and discount efficiencies, but it also allows us to add increasing value relevant to our members by making popular items like cold coffee, more attainable, the changes that our members have praised. Finally, we're furthering the value delivered to our SR members by bringing them coffeehouse culture and content through a new series in the Starbucks app called the Starbucks Daily, which will launch with [indiscernible] this month. In short, Starbucks is an incredibly strong brand and one that is poised for growth. I'll now turn it over to Rachel. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. As we think about weathering a recession in the U.S., it really comes down to two words for us, and that is momentum and innovation. And I'd say that when I say momentum, it's about relevance and resilience. And as we think about relevance, if we look at the last quarter, we have more customers in total population than ever in the U.S. They're very highly engaged. If we look at share of wallet and spend, 56% of our transactions were from our reward members. And just as Belinda said, in China, our U.S. customers see Starbucks as their first choice for coffee with leading affinities. So from a brand standpoint, we're in a very strong position. When we look at resilience, last quarter, we saw not only ticket growth but transaction growth, even in the face of the macroeconomic headwinds. So in terms of momentum, we see that carrying into the quarter ahead and the year ahead. And then I'd say innovation, as I mentioned, so product, we see continued strength in our future innovation road map and our existing strategy around cold, customized and plant-based beverages, and it comes down to beverages that customers love that they truly can only find at Starbucks. And that was true throughout the pandemic, and it's true right now. With digital, our digital platforms have been very sticky with customers. And we're just making those better as you look at things like Odyssey and Reward together. And then earlier in the presentation, Rachel shared about equipment, it's just making the job more efficient for our partners, unlocking even greater quality and more customization. So if you take that momentum and that innovation, it just reinforces that we're a very strong brand right now, looking ahead, despite any economic headwinds, we're still poised for growth. Great. Yes. Thank you very much, Lauren. I appreciate the question. We do see continued opportunity. If we just look at this past year, our SR membership base grew 15% in the U.S. and globally, we're seeing significant growth across our different markets as well. So we see not only that, but it's about 56% of transactions in the quarter. So we see a lot of headroom and relevance for the program. Part of that was accelerated with our launch and starts for everyone a couple of years ago when we lowered the barrier and complexity to enter the program. And we've seen that be a continued contributor over the last couple of years since we launched it. So that takes us to the more than 30 million members we have today. It's not only 15% growth over a year, 6% growth in that membership in the U.S. just quarter-over-quarter. So we see lots of reasons to be optimistic about the opportunity, and we're seeing that prove out in the numbers. In terms of the changes that we just made. Within Starbucks Rewards, we really look at that program as offering two things, both product and experiential benefits. And so we're really looking at both sides of the equation. The experiential benefits that you've seen us out of the quarter were things like reward together, the Starbucks Odyssey program and other special events, whether it's the opening of the Empire State Building and offering members the first chance to go and see a store like that. So we really try and add experiential benefits to the program to make people feel genuinely valued for being their Starbucks customer. On the product side, what you've heard are changes related to our reward redemption tiers. And the purpose of that is a couple of things. From an economic perspective, the redemption tiers and the changes we're making there better align the cost of product redemptions to our current pricing. And by making that change, it will create discount efficiency, which helps us to continue to grow the program while effectively managing margins. So that's the two dimensions we look at it on. We see just lots of opportunity left. We have an incredible road map ahead. So we're just going to keep driving the program and I think our customers will have a lot to celebrate in the years ahead."

Starbucks is one of the world's great companies and most iconic brands. It really is a privilege to take on this role and I'm excited to be here and optimistic about the future. Since joining Starbucks last month, I've spent my time digging into the business, listening to partners and connecting with customers. These experiences and my learnings have helped me form a clear understanding of where we are and what we need to do differently moving forward. Everything I have seen and heard tells me we have significant strengths to build on. The brand is strong and enduring, we have deep coffee expertise, and we have a fantastic team of Green Apron partners. I look forward to sharing more about my plan to get back to Starbucks with you shortly, but first I'd like to turn it over to Rachel for a more detailed overview of our final Q4 and full fiscal year 2024 financial results. Rachel?\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you Brian, and welcome to your first Starbucks earnings call. And good afternoon everyone. As you saw in our press release last week, our traffic challenges persisted in Q4, resulting in pressures throughout our P&L from our top line to our bottom line. With that, I'll briefly discuss our Q4 and full year results and then turn the call over to Brian. In regards to Q4, our Q4 consolidated revenue was $9.1billion, down 3% from the prior year, driven by a 7% decline in comparable store sales, consisting of an 8% decrease in transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket, partially offset by 7% net new company operated store growth. The revenue decrease was primarily due to a 6% decline in U.S. comparable store sales, driven by a 10% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket, mainly from pricing. Traffic declined across all channels and day parts, with the most pronounced decline in the afternoon day part. In addition to the continued decline of non Starbucks rewards member visits, frequency also slowed across all SR member deciles in comparison to prior year and ultimately impacted spend. While active SR membership grew 4% year-over-year to $33.8 million, it remained flat to Q3 as our product innovation and offerings as well as promotions did not create sustained excitement or the stickiness we planned. Our Q4 results also reflected China comparable store sales decline of 14% driven by an 8% decline in average ticket and a 6% decline in comparable transactions, weighed down by intensified competition and a soft macro environment that impacted consumer spending. Although the market reached an all-time high of 23.5 million SR active members during the quarter with 2.2 million net new members versus prior year, comp declined due to non SR member traffic pressures, elevated discounting given the highly promotional environment and lower sales of high ticket items impacted by consumer sentiment. Shifting to margin. Our Q4 consolidated operating margin was 14.4% contracting 370 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by deleverage, investments in store partner wages and benefits as well as increased promotional activities. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and the in store operational efficiencies. In store, we were successful in getting increased hours per partner, which is contributing to low hourly partner turnover and reduced training costs. However, we have additional work to do to obtain the correct staffing. We also expect our throughput to be further optimized once the Siren Craft processes stabilizes across the company operated store portfolio. Outside the store, we remain focused on capturing additional end to end supply chain efficiencies. Collectively, in and out of store efficiency efforts have yielded savings of approximately 150 basis points in the quarter. Our G&A expenses were higher than expected and exceeded 7% of revenue in Q4, primarily due to unplanned and non reoccurring third party services and transition costs. Excluding these costs totaling approximately 50 basis points, G&A was 6.6% of revenue in Q4 and remained closer to 6% for the second half of fiscal year 2024 in line with expectations. We expect G&A to further decrease relative to revenue over time leading to sustained margin expansion. Q4 EPS was $0.80, down 24% from the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by a combination of traffic challenges and heightened investments, partially offset by our pricing and efficiency efforts. Moving to full fiscal year 2024, consolidated net revenues increased 1% to $36.2 billion in fiscal year 2024, driven by 7% net new company operated store growth offset by a 2% decline in comparable store sales. Full year consolidated operating margin was 15%, contracting 110 basis points from prior year, primarily driven by investments in store partner wages and benefits, deleverage and increased promotional activity. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and in store operational efficiencies. Our in store and out of store efficiency efforts collectively delivered roughly 250 basis points of margin improvement for the full year, which is nearly a billion of cost reductions throughout our P&L as aligned with our original plan. Full year EPS was $3.31, declining 6%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from higher effective tax rate. Shifting to our Outlook. As noted in our press release last week, given the company's CEO transition coupled with the current state of the business, our guidance is suspended for full fiscal year 2025. This allows ample opportunity to assess the business and solidify key strategies as we refocus our efforts on the turnaround, I would like to still briefly touch on our capital allocation priorities. As Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks last week, one of our top priorities includes reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffee house. To do so, we plan to reduce the number of our new stores and renovations in fiscal year 2025 to accommodate a redesign, while also unlocking capital to support our broader turnaround. We expect this shift coupled with efficiencies will help us balance our investments accordingly. We're working through the details of the impacts on key metrics including store growth, and we'll revert back with insight at a future date. In the meantime, I want to be clear that this shift in store growth strategy does not reflect and should not be interpreted as a statement on our long-term opportunity view or new store performance. In fact, we continue to see strong, highly incremental performance from our new stores. As a proof point, approximately 40% of our U.S. company operated stores had positive comp growth in full fiscal year 2024 with outsized contribution from our newer stores, especially in markets where store density remains low. We continue to see store growth opportunity, especially as we focus on continuing to create a welcoming coffeehouse and the store experience that both our Green Apron partners and our customers deserve. Also, last week we announced an annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 to $0.61 per share. This marks our 14th consecutive year of annual increase at a CAGR of approximately 20%, offering shareholders a sense of certainty during the turnaround and our confidence in our long-term growth. In summary, our results do not reflect the strength of our brand and what we're capable of. As a 20 plus year partner, I've seen what Starbucks is capable of when we focus on what we do best. It's because of that that I have confidence in our ability to turn around our business and I have the utmost confidence in our partners around the globe that together we can deliver. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Niccol: Thank you Rachel. Our financial results were very disappointing and it is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers and return to growth. Back to Starbucks is that fundamental change. We have to get back to what has always set Starbucks apart. A welcoming coffee house where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee handcrafted by our skilled baristas. Regardless of the consumer environment, we must be at our best to succeed. And right now, despite the hard work of our Green Apron partners, we aren't always at our best. I've heard that while people love Starbucks, some feel like we have drifted from our core. We've made it harder to be a customer than it should be and we focused our marketing too narrowly on Starbucks rewards members. I've spent my career understanding, building and stewarding brands and it's clear the Starbucks brand is iconic and loved. My experience tells me that when we get back to our core identity and consistently deliver a great experience, our customers will come back. Our problems are fixable. Most of what we need to do is in our control. So our path forward is clear and with our U.S. business being our priority, work is already underway. Some things will take some time as we test and learn, but we're moving quickly on the things we can. I want to share a few examples. We have to make it easier for our customers to get a cup of coffee. We are prioritizing work across the U.S. Business support a clear throughput with quality goal. We want to hand deliver a high quality handcrafted beverage to our cafe customers in four minutes or less and deliver orders on time for our mobile order and pay customers every time. We have work to do to achieve this consistently, but we've learned lessons from our success improving the drive-thru experience and reducing out the window times. Our throughput with quality aspiration and getting the core cafe experience right will drive everything we do and every decision we make. The moment our Barista hands a cup of coffee directly to the customer is our brand moment of truth. So let's talk about some of the changes we're making to do this. First, we're working to get staffing right in our stores. As Rachel shared, we've made significant progress to improve average hours per partner and partner turnover is at another low. Our efforts to get partners the hours and schedules they want are working. Now we need to make sure we have the right number of partners on the floor, particularly during our morning peak and shoulder hours. We are moving quickly to test and learn. We're also making a commitment to grow from within by identifying internal hires for 90% of our retail leadership roles and to rally our team behind our Back to Starbucks plan and help support strong leadership in every store we're planning to host a store manager conference in 2025. Second, we're making it easier for customers to enjoy brewed coffee their way. We plan to bring back condiment coffee bars in all our cafes by early 2025. It's a great customer experience and will help with speed of service. We also plan to complete the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewers in all our company operated locations by the end of fiscal year 25, providing customers more on demand choice in high quality brewed coffee. And we're evolving store routines to hand deliver brewed coffee to customers faster upon order. Third, to improve throughput quality and consistency, we will cut down our overly complex menu to align with our core identity as a coffee company. We will still offer customers great choice but will be focused on fewer, better offerings consistently crafted. Fourth, we will continue to scale our investment in Siren equipment and Siren Craft processes to improve the in store experience for our partners and customers. This work is a critical enabler in helping to achieve our four minute wait time aspiration. And finally, we'll bring order to mobile order and pay so it doesn't overwhelm our cafes. Today more than 30% of transactions are driven by mobile orders. At peak it can drive an influx of orders that can be difficult to sequence and quickly deliver to our customers. When it works well, it's great, but sometimes it can be a challenge for both customers and partners. So we're working to improve sequencing with a new algorithm that enables on time mobile order handoffs and supports our four minute throughput with quality being our goal for cafe customers. We're also placing common sense guardrails on mobile ordering that we think will improve the experience for all customers. And over the coming months, we plan to take steps to better separate mobile order pickup from the cafe experience. There are also some additional steps we're taking beyond a throughput with quality focus that we believe will resonate with our customers and partners. First, we are reimagining our pricing architecture, starting with non-dairy milk customizations. We know customization is an important part of the Starbucks experience and we want to make it easier for customers to order their beverage just the way they want while still feeling like it's worth it. So beginning with holiday launch on November 7th, we're eliminating the upcharge for non-dairy milks at North American cafes owned and operated by Starbucks. It's the most popular customization after an extra shot of Espresso. And once implemented, nearly half of customers that pay for a modifier could see a price reduction of 10% or more when they choose a non-dairy milk. We're also investing in our customers with an intent not to increase menu prices at company owned and operated stores in North America through fiscal year 2025. It's a great start, but we have more work to do to make our pricing architecture straightforward and logical. Next, we're reclaiming the third place so our cafes feel like the welcoming coffee house our customers remember. In the coming months, we intend to reintroduce more personal touches to elevate the cafe experience. For instance, we'll begin to prioritize serving coffee and ceramic mugs for customers who choose to enjoy their coffee in our cafes. We're also beginning to review and revise our cafe designs to bring back more comfortable seating and amenities and to ensure our stores are a place where customers want to sit, work and meet. We're beginning to revisit certain policies with our partners and customers being top of mind. Lastly, we're getting back to marketing Starbucks to all our customers. We've already made some changes, so first, we're focusing on coffee. Starbucks sources, roasts and crafts some of the finest quality coffee. I have always loved Starbucks coffee, but I haven't always fully appreciated the quality and care that goes into every cup. From the work of our agronomists to support tens of thousands of independent coffee farmers to our master roasters, our high quality equipment and our skilled baristas, our marketing needs to tell our coffee story and showcase our premium coffee beverages. Second, we're reducing the frequency of discount driven offers that have proven ineffective, diluted our premium positioning overburdened our baristas and detracted from a consistent customer experience. We're working to make every visit worth it for our customers with straightforward pricing, timely service and a more consistent, enjoyable cafe experience. Third, we need to broaden our marketing beyond our Starbucks rewards customers. Our newly launched campaign focuses on talking to all customers and elevates the Starbucks brand in a much more visible way through broad reach media like Linear TV. It reminds customers across age groups that Starbucks serves the best coffee. You've likely seen our new approach in practice already and you will see more of it throughout the holidays and into January. Our customers find worth through quality, consistency and a sense of value. I'm confident that even these early steps will begin to remind customers the Starbucks experience is all of these things. The U.S. is my near term priority, but our international business presents significant opportunities. Before discussing China in detail, I need to spend time there to better understand our operations and the market. All indications show me the competitive environment is extreme, the macro environment is tough, and we need to figure out how we grow in the market now and into the future. In the meantime, we continue to explore strategic partnerships that could help us grow in the long-term. Looking elsewhere, I've been pleasantly surprised to learn about significant international growth opportunities for the business beyond China. We'll spend more time and effort to capitalize on growth across other international markets in the coming years. As I mentioned last week, success comes from staying true to your identity, taking care of customers and your team, simplifying the business, delivering consistently high quality products and experiences, and telling your story. I'm confident we'll make it easier to be a customer and we'll encourage customers to visit more often. And I'm confident we'll set our partners up for success so they can deliver the great customer experience I know they want to provide. In doing so, we'll reinvigorate our brand, drive stronger financial returns and return Starbucks to growth. Thank you for your time and as we get back to Starbucks, we'll regularly share results driven by our work. And as we begin to see results from pilot projects and early initiatives, we'll share more about our long term plan. With that we will open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much, and welcome to Starbucks, Brian. Just a bigger picture question. Obviously, you met with baristas, presumably a lot over the past 50 days. I'm wondering what your key learnings have been in terms of maybe top requests or what areas you think are the greatest opportunities because presumably you're bringing it back to the basics at Starbucks, and you would think that handoff between barista and customer is the most important. So just wondering what your key takeaways were, and if I could just layer in another component there. It just seems like you had tremendous success at Chipotle implementing very similar initiatives. I'm just wondering what you think were some of your greatest wins at Chipotle with some initiatives that maybe could be applied at Starbucks. Thank you.\nBrian Niccol: Yes, thanks. And, terrific to be here at Starbucks and delighted to be talking about the business with all of you. So to answer your first question, yes, I had the opportunity, frankly to spend time with our baristas from the west coast, east coast, middle of the country, in the South. And one thing that was consistent that I got to start with is they love this brand, okay? They love serving craft coffee that they know we go the extra mile to ensure it's absolutely the best. And I had the opportunity to ask people over and over again, what is your favorite drink to prepare? And consistently, every barista came back to me with, what I love making the espresso drinks, the latte art, the flat whites, the cappuccinos, the lattes. These are things that literally, they shined when they answered the question. Now, as regard to, I also asked them, what do you think are some things we could be doing better? And right out of the gate, one of the things they said that would help the whole process is if we could get brewed coffee not to be going down the line and ending up down at the counter. And so that's why you heard me, in my prepared remarks here, talk about how we're going to bring back the coffee condiment bar, because both our customers are asking for it, and our baristas are saying it would help them deliver the speed of service that they want to provide. So that's one big piece of feedback I got. The second piece of feedback right there with the brewed coffee is take a hard look at the staffing both during peak and shoulder hours to ensure that we're setting the teams up for success all day long. And so we've looked at it, I'm happy to say we're already implementing some changes in a couple thousand stores, and we are going to be piloting some new approaches on how we set up the labor model so that our baristas have time to give not only great craft drinks, but also that hospitality and that human touch of handing off the drink to our customer at the counter and then also making sure that we're on time with the mobile order business. The other thing that they shared with me in some of the stores is they wanted their cafe dining room back. They like leading the coffee house. I think there's a moment of pride, of saying, this is my place. They know our customers by name. They have their regulars. They want to have a great seat for them. They want to have a great environment for them to enjoy, whether it's a moment for themselves or whether it's sharing a moment with others. And so I couldn't agree more, frankly, with a lot of their feedback. I'll touch on one more, which was, hey, is there any way to simplify the customization that we provide? Can we put in some guardrails on this so that it's not out of hand? Those were the big ones. To your question on similarities of Chipotle, what I would tell you is the similarities start with, you've got an employee/partner base at Starbucks that is hugely committed to the brand and hugely committed to doing the right thing for the business. And when you start with that kind of foundation, you're able to put in the right programs so that we can get the business turned around. So I would say that is one big similarity. The thing, obviously, that I've also just been really impressed by is just how special Starbucks is to so many people, both customers at all ages. And whether they're getting, just a brewed cup of coffee quickly or whether they're getting, a flat white. The brand means a lot to them and it means a lot to their communities. And, I take that as a lot of responsibility. So long answer to your question, but I wanted to make sure I was thorough. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. Thank you. And thank you for that color, Brian. I wanted to ask you getting a lot of questions comparisons to Chipotle. But one of the things that I think struck me at the time was that there were a lot of benefits that you were able to extract from reallocating resources. So reinvesting in some parts of the business and maybe finding things that were less productive elsewhere. And I guess I'm wondering, it sounds like maybe that's the case for Starbucks too. You talked about reducing upcharges for non-dairy milk which as an almond milk drinker I thank you for. But you're also promoting less and similarly maybe shifting to linear television but it sounds like perhaps away from other channels. So I wanted to see if that's the right interpretation including around scheduling perhaps which is maybe not more hours but different. And then just a quick question for Rachel. I think you mentioned some onetime charges in G&A, but I think they were included in the non-GAAP EPS. So just want to make sure I understand what kind of non recurring might actually be in Adjusted EPS. Thanks.\nBrian Niccol: So I'll start. To answer your question, look, I absolutely want to stop doing the things that aren't working and shifting those dollars to things that I believe will work. And in some cases we have to test and learn our way through that. But yes, look, I think to the company's credit they've already started some terrific work on supply chain and getting inefficiencies out of the supply chain that I think can support the business longer term. It's not just a onetime situation, it's an ongoing capability that we're building. And then, as it relates to like discounts and some of the shifting of marketing dollars and then what we're doing on the labor side of things, we may find it's going to require some additional hours because at the end of the day I want to make sure that the teams are staffed to win every transaction so that when somebody comes in they walk away saying they had a great experience time and time again. And I also want to have a scenario where our baristas feel like they have the ability to give a great experience. And I'm sure you've heard this over and over again, right? It's like the customer experience will not exceed that of the partner's experience. So we have to make sure, and we're going to test and learn our way through this, that we are setting up the right schedule, the right amount of hours with the right number of partners on the floor so that we can deliver these handcrafted drinks and hand them off to our customers in store and then also support our mobile order business as well as in some cases the drive thru business as well. So we're going to be smart about the investments. And I think also you saw in the past, when I find something that's working, we're going to do more of it. And so that is really what we're after. And I think collectively the team really buys into that approach. I'll hand it over to Rachel for the second piece.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sarah. What I would just say just to punctuate a bit of what Brian said is that broadly with our investments you can expect that we'll continue with efficiency efforts. We'll have ways to balance this. But I think it's important to note that in the near term we may see some incremental investments that will have an impact on our financials, but we do expect they'll be accretive, particularly as we balance that with increased transactions, so I'd look at it from that perspective. As it relates to the G&A we don't have a GAAP, non-GAAP situation with the transition cost. The cost that I spoke about, the non reoccurring one time are largely all related to transition in one way or another. We don't expect that that will repeat. When you think about G&A for next year, the one thing to remember is while we'll continue to focus on being as efficient as possible, we will be lapping lower performance based comp in fiscal year 2024. So that will have an impact on our G&A in fiscal year 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nBrian Harbour: Sure. Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks Brian for the thoughts and welcome. Just a menu question, the simplification that's going to happen. Do you have a sense for what that will be so far and roughly what the timing would be in the comment about guardrails around customization. I don't know if you want to say anything about that at this point. Then I guess, just more broadly, what do you think is the right pace of innovation at Starbucks typically?\nBrian Niccol: Yes. So to answer your first question, on guardrails for customization and menu simplification, we're actually in the middle of doing that work right now. There are some obvious things that are easy to say, let's get that off the menu. And then there are other things that we might have to test our way on the menu of how we exit them smartly. And then on the customization as far as guardrails go and by the way, the menu simplification is both in beverage and food. We're not just looking at beverage or just food. Then on the customization guardrails. Right now, if you go through the app, you'll notice that we offer up all kinds of customization, or it's the same customization page almost for everything that you order. Two things happen. One, it's complicated for the customer to get through it. And then two, we kind of incentivize people to customize drinks that probably aren't the best way to execute the drink. Not to mention it creates additional complexity for our partners to execute the drink. So we have some cleanup to do, is the way I would describe it. And then I also think we have some pricing architecture tied to guardrails to ensure that we end up with no surprises for, frankly, anybody on what was the price of what they just built, and then also that we can execute it consistently every time. So that's what we're after on those fronts. And what was your other question?\nBrian Harbour: Just product innovation. What do you --what's kind of the right pace?\nBrian Niccol: Yes, look, it's really interesting. I'm still getting up to speed on the innovation process at Starbucks, and what I'm happy to discover is they have a stage gate process. It hasn't been followed recently, and we're going to start using the process again. So innovation has been, I think, a core piece of the Starbucks proposition, and it's going to continue to be. But we are definitely not going to be moving at the speed you probably saw over the last two years. And part of that is we're just going to take a much more disciplined approach using the stage gate process so that what we roll out, we have a better understanding of how it's going to perform. The supply chain can support it, the baristas can execute it and, we'll make sure we're smart about how we then market it, so people are aware of it. So it's kind of the basics of how I would call it, like stage gate innovation. But what I was happy to discover is there is a process already at Starbucks. It just wasn't being used, and now we're going to reinstate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you very much. Brian you just mentioned food. I think for the first time in this call, food is nearly 25% of Starbucks sales. Food, from what I recall, is in 40% of transactions. So it is actually a pretty meaningful part of the Starbucks business. And there has been some discussion of kind of improving the baked goods, improving the sandwiches, improving the lobby, things around food warming cabinets that could be a significant enhancer to speed, especially if people were to order several different things. How would you prioritize food? Is that something that you think is a big, long-term growth opportunity for Starbucks, or is the answer do fewer things better and really focus on beverage first?\nBrian Niccol: Yes, thanks for the question, John. To answer your question, look, food is, I think, a key piece of the puzzle, and I think you're right. We have the opportunity to do fewer, better food executions. So, obviously I want to make sure that everybody understands the quality, the craft, the commitment we have to coffee. But I think we can also have the same commitment to quality and craftsmanship in our food to match the experience you get with our beverages. So we're doing work on that already. And I do think we're going to be much better at food if we do fewer things on the food front in a better quality fashion. So that's part of the process, and I think you'll see some of those changes evolving over the coming months.\nOperator: Thank you. Yes. And your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please state your question.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the store redesign work that you're doing. I was just curious if you could elaborate on what are some of the elements you're seeking in that, and what do you envision the benefits of the new design? And then maybe secondly, once you finalize that design, do you envision a big remodel cycle over the next several years or however you want to frame it with that? Thanks.\nBrian Niccol: Yes, thanks, David. Look, what we want to do is figure out how we can reduce the cost on our renovation program. And then as part of that, also create the experience where you've got a great coffee house chair or seat or vibe. And then at the same time, I want to separate, and we believe we need to separate the counter experience, meaning the in store experience, from the mobile order pickup experience. But regardless whether you walk in to just pick up your coffee and go, I want you to feel like you've walked into a special place and look, ideally, I was just saying this to our design team. I know we've got it right when people are questioning whether or not they want to order mobile, because maybe if I have a few minutes, I'd rather stay in the cafe and get that cafe experience from our barista, where it's handheld. So I have strong belief that we can make the cafe experience, frankly, really terrific and something special, really welcoming, warm space where you want to spend some time. And I think there's touches. Right. I mentioned just bringing back the ceramic mug. If you decide to stay in the cafe and have, your latte two, obviously, then the furniture that we have, the materials that we choose, I love. Our designers are talking about make sure we bring back the layers, the texture, the warmth. Those are the things that are really important. Operationally, what we're also after is clarity of where that barista handoff experience will happen. We're also after less than four minutes for POS to the handoff. And we're also after, if you order a brewed cup of coffee, it's a really fast experience because we're going to just hand it to you right at the point of sale, and then you can go to the coffee condiment bar and doctor up your coffee how you see fit. One of the other things we're going to be bringing back, too, is bringing the Sharpies back to our baristas. And it's going to give them the opportunity to put that additional human touch on every coffee experience as well. So there's a lot of. I think there's a lot of just simple things that go a long way of saying, what, this is a community place. This is a special place where people are here to connect. And I think we can do that in a really meaningful way. And then obviously on the mobile order side of things, I want to create a separate area where it's clear so your drink is ready, I can grab it. And if you need to be quick, you can be quick, and we'll be on time with it. And then obviously we still have the drive through business where we got to make sure we get the orders correctly out the window. And then to answer your question, David, on the renovation program, I think we're still working through what is the right schedule once we fully understand what the renovations are going to entail. But my hope is, over the coming years, we'll be able to touch everything and get back to having that community coffee house vibe.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please state your question.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thank you, Brian. One of the things that made Chipotle successful was the digital make line that helped provide capacity for traffic growth and creating production capacity. Sounds like something on your mind for Starbucks. I'm curious what your view is on the Siren system automated technology and if this is something you're looking to step on the gas to accelerate retrofitting the pace of this in excess of the 10% of store base per year that's currently in place would help you improve operations as well as the barista experience.\nBrian Niccol: Yes, thanks for the question. Obviously, the one thing that I'm really delighted about is this Siren Craft system, both the equipment and the process, I think is a key unlock for us to deliver on this four minutes or less on the In Cafe experience. And then also to set up the algorithm where we can allow mobile orders to have specific pickup times so that we're sequencing those mobile orders. What I'll tell you is we know we've got some bottlenecks out there, right, that we got to solve. And the good news is some of the bottlenecks require the full implementation. So the hot hold, the combi oven, the cold solution, the process, and then there are other stores where we don't have to quite go that far in order to achieve the throughput that we're after. But what I love about this is then we can we know when transactions get to a certain level or mix gets to a certain level. How we need to roll out the system accordingly. So what I would tell you is, look, what I want the organization rotating towards is how do we unlock throughput at less than four minutes in that store? If that store requires the full Siren Craft system, put it in. If it requires some pieces of it, put that in. If it just requires staffing and better deployment, we'll implement that. So I really, I think we need to rerotate ourselves to this idea of we are going to be a great coffee craft company that has now really good throughput and operational standards for how we'll perform for each of these access modes. And the good news is we got a great group of engineers, a great group of people that have clarity on how we solve any of these bottlenecks that we pop into or bump into. So that's the way you should think about it. I'm putting a full court press on solving four minutes is the point, and then how that cascades into our other access modes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Just to follow up on what you were just talking about with the back of the bar changes and trying to make the baristas life easier, service times better. Are you. And you mentioned CapEx changes, away from unit development and perhaps towards some of these changes with the Siren system or at least just the machines. Are we really going to see what they were describing to us a while ago with the Siren system and you're just going faster with that and more aggressively towards the stores that need it? Or are you envisioning something not more radical but different in that you were going to separate the bar in different ways to make that it's more fundamentally a departure from what we were hearing about. And then you mentioned the four minute service time goal. What is that service time today and where specifically are the biggest bottlenecks or pain points that are keeping you keeping that gap from four minutes. Thanks.\nBrian Niccol: Yes. So David, I think the big change here is having an operating standard around less than four minutes and there wasn't, I guess, clarity on that aspect. Instead we were just kind of working on pain points in isolation as opposed to what is the system solution to get the customer experience and the barista experience that we know we need to deliver. And so the less than four minutes actually comes from two things. One, talking to baristas and customers to find out what are their expectations. And one of the things I'm happy to discover is, before the business got as big as it is and had also mobile order and food and cold, etcetera. A lot of our partners, long time partners, are used to getting these handcrafted drinks done in about two and a half minutes. So we know it's feasible. To your point though, there is some additional bottlenecks that we have to deal with. So in some cases it's the food and that's where it's necessary to put in the combi oven, have the warming kit. In some cases it's the mix of cold and in some cases frankly it's the mix of mobile. And so we have to address these things throughout the system. And that's why I'm saying like putting everything against this idea of, what, we are not going to do something or said another way. We're going to be doing the things that enable less than four minutes at the counter. Then we're also going to be doing things that enable being on time and accurate every time for mobile order pickup. And it's also we're going to work towards getting less than four minutes in the drive thru window as well. So the good news is we've got the equipment, we just haven't over time used it as a system to serve against the need of less than four minutes. And so that's the big change. And when you, when you start to use that metric, you quickly discover where our stores have a real problem and we're going to go very aggressive against those first and where there are other stores that frankly don't have the transaction or the mix yet that weren't putting in all this equipment, but we should put in the processes, wire the place correctly so that as their transactions get close we can put it in and avoid ever having the bottlenecks. And then to just answer your question, we probably have about 50% of our stores or 50% of our transactions already happening less than four minutes. So we know it's very doable. And this is what I'm referring to. During peak, we know it's very doable. We just need to do it in all our stores in every transaction. So we're going to be maniacal about getting after it.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\nChristine Cho: Thank you for taking my question. So I know you're not ready to put specific numbers around it, but I was wondering if you can kind of talk about the major areas or buckets where you would need to kind of invest in, to kind of restore the traffic momentum as well as to improve the store infrastructure for your partners as well as guests. And also just to confirm that 1 billion per annum cost efficiency unlock program, is that something still you can leverage in the next few years? Thank you.\nBrian Niccol: I'm sorry, what was the last part of your question?\nChristine Cho: The 1 billion per annum cost efficiency unlocking.\nBrian Niccol: Yes, the productivity effort. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, you got it.\nChristine Cho: The productivity effort. Is that something?\nBrian Niccol: So yes, look, the things we're working on are kind of what I shared in my opening remarks, which I believe will drive transactions because it's going to address our partner experience as well as our customer experience. So I just spent a bunch of time talking about this, getting after the less than four minutes in the cafe, being on time and accurate in mobile order against certain time standards, getting the pricing architecture correct, broadening our reach beyond Starbucks rewards customers and then obviously creating that community house experience where people want to be in Starbucks, spend time in Starbucks, all those things will add up to I believe growth. And the good news is we've got some great assets and tools available to us, right? That rewards program is a valuable tool. It's not the only tool, but it's a valuable tool that I think we could make work harder for us if we put it in concert with marketing that has more broad reach. I think innovation, the capability this organization has on innovation is a powerful tool. We haven't used it correctly of late, but I think if we use it correctly with the stage gate process driven against the idea of these operating standards of less than four minutes and then also delivering on customer\u2019s expectations, innovation will be more powerful. So it is one of those things where as we get the foundation reset, I believe there's a lot of additional catalysts for growth in the business. And, if you're asking me how do I add it all up, I don't have an answer for you yet. What I can tell you it adds up to is more growth, it adds up to a turnaround and it adds up to growth. So that's what we're going to spend our time on. And then on the last piece of productivity, the billion dollars, I mean the good news is the team, especially the supply chain team has done a tremendous job of just being much smarter about how we I think work with our vendors and partners as well as the right way to bring then these products to market. It's powerful when you have the right product, the right place at the right time. It just becomes so much more efficient for everybody involved, both the supplier to all the way to our partner in store that has to deliver on. So Rachel, if you want to add anything to that.\nRachel Ruggeri: The only thing that I would add Christine, is just to say that while we'll continue to focus on efficiencies, the target that we've shared previously will be part of as we think about reassessing the business and looking at the right near term and longer term strategies as part of our Back to Starbucks plan, we'll look at the optimal level of efficiencies. But what you can expect is we will continue to Brian's point, we have so much opportunity across the end-to-end supply chain as we optimize throughout the store and even as we manage spend. And so we'll continue to be focused on that. I wouldn't be as focused on the billion dollars. I would just be focused on the fact that we will continue forward with efficiencies and we'll do that as a way to help offset some of the investments we'll be making. And in the future those efficiencies will help us not only support incremental investments, but they'll lead to margin expansion and earnings growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi. Please state your question.\nJon Tower: Great, thanks for taking the questions and Brian, congrats and I wish you guys all the best of luck getting this going in the right direction. Again, maybe just first when you're talking about the menu simplification and even just the simple idea of not charging for non-dairy modifiers, any way to quantify the dollar amount that that's contributing to revenue today? And then I guess my broader question for you Brian, just looking at the brand from a high level, do you feel like it's a bit over distributed today? Specifically when I look at the U.S. you have a large chunk of U.S. company stores, but then you have a fairly large footprint of licensed stores. And when you're talking about going through all these initiatives, how can you apply that not only to your customers, your current company store base, but also to the licensed stores so that the customer gets a similar experience of venues?\nBrian Niccol: Yes. Thanks John. The look I will tell you I am pleasantly surprised to see how the license business in the U.S. performs. I had the opportunity to spend some time with the guys at Target and I will tell you they are hugely supportive of the idea of getting back to Starbucks and I think they're going to want to give people the back to Starbucks experience that we're after. So I'm hugely optimistic. Even when I think about the airports and such, there's a huge opportunity for us, I think, to simplify some of the execution there so that we can get people the great throughput that they want so they can get on their way. So from what I can tell, everybody seems to be very excited about this idea of throughput with quality, this broader idea of just getting back to Starbucks. So I think this will carry not only in our license stores, but I think they'll carry it as it's their own, which I think is really important. And then what was the other part of your question?\nJon Tower: It was on the menu simplification, putting numbers around that or even just on the non-dairy modifier.\nBrian Niccol: Yes. So look, we're early days into the menu simplification, but there's definitely room for us, I think, to eliminate some products frankly, that add complexity, have a lot of waste and really don't add a whole lot to the experience. And so we're going to have to be, it's going to be, in some cases it's tough because everybody has their one favorite thing that maybe is on the long tail of this. But we got to clear the way so that we can get to the big movers that people really interact with time and time again. And then on the customization, like the alt milk look, I've just seen time and time again when people start the process of their beverage, the price is, I think warranted given the caliber of the coffee or the drink that you're getting. Where we sometimes I think get twisted is in all the different customizations that we offer up and then the complexity of the customization that people take us up on. And I think a lot of it is unnecessary. And I think when we simplify that aspect of it and then charge for the things that we should be charging for and maybe not charging for the things that don't really need to be charged for, I think everybody's going to walk away feeling a lot better about ultimately their personal beverage that they've created. So the numbers specifically, we're still working through some of that. Obviously we got a pretty good idea of what the alt milk implication is. But I'm confident it's the right investment in the business to get people to re-engage with the brand accordingly. So I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Rachel.\nRachel Ruggeri: Yes, I would just say as you think about the investments we're making, which are going to be important to returning Starbucks to growth, just when you think about the shape of the year, you could expect that the first half of the year is where we'll be making the investment. So we'd expect that the back half of the year will be stronger as the investments and our strategies start to take hold. So that's the way I think about it. I think there'll be a more near term impact as we make some of these investments. But we expect that the traffic will return and that we'll see customers coming back into the stores and that will help to balance so that we see gradual momentum in the back half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please state your question.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks for taking the question, Brian. I did want to ask again about the Siren system. This has been around for about two years now and I think the pushback in terms of broader development or expansion of the Siren system has been the too disruptive to the stores unless it's a remodel store or a new store. So I guess as you see it with fresh eyes, what do you see as the hurdle to a broader implementation of the Siren system? Is it that disruptive or is it just something that you're going to have to work through given the ultimate benefit of the system itself? Thank you.\nBrian Niccol: Yes, thanks. Well, look, one of the things that we definitely have to fix is when we do renovations, we can't have stores closed for, two weeks or three weeks or whatever it is that is too disruptive. So the team knows that they're working on how we fix that. But that almost has nothing to do with the Siren system. That's just in general principle on renovations. The Siren system. I would say part of the reason why I think we've maybe took a not the most direct path on this is because we haven't had clarity of what problem we were trying to solve. And the problem we are solving now is getting to great experiences. If you really think about it, right. We've got three access modes. Okay. Or sorry, four access modes, if you include delivery, right? You got in cafe, you got mobile order pay, you got drive thru and you got delivery. All right, so there's four access modes common. And now we're in three lines of business, right? Hot, cold and food. And we have not had operating standards for time of service that we want to provide for each of those elements. So that's the problem we need to solve. And the good news is, even though it wasn't, I guess envisioned initially, a lot of the equipment and process solves bottlenecks that were kind of considered one off issues. But when you put the whole thing together and you realize like, oh, this store is operating at such a transaction level, it's got such a food mix, it's got such a cold mix, it's got such a mobile order, you got to put the entire system in in order to achieve these operating standards of the excellence as it relates to the customer experience. So I would tell you, part of the reason why I think we've zigged and zagged on that Siren Craft system is because we didn't have clarity of what problem we were trying to solve. And now I think we've got clarity, which is we're all about great throughput for the access modes that our customers want to experience Starbucks. And I think I'm optimistic that we can roll this out accordingly. And the places where, you got the full scale bottleneck, they're going to be the first places that we implement this coupled with I want to touch the stores to bring back that coffee house experience. And look, the challenge or the problem for us to solve is I don't want the store closed for, weeks and we got to figure out how we can do it for less. So. And I think these things are all very solvable. So that hopefully that answers your question on the Siren Craft system. And more importantly, what's the problem we're trying to solve? And the problem we're trying to solve is I want to give a great customer experience from a time standpoint to go with the great craft quality, coffee drink experience, food experience you're getting.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you and congrats. Brian, I wanted to ask about value. You talked about the pricing architecture, no plans to increase prices, removing the upcharge on non-dairy. How would you assess Starbucks value perceptions and to what extent you see that as a driver of current headwinds and then relatedly, how are you thinking about the architecture of the rewards program and opportunity there? Thank you.\nBrian Niccol: Yes. So, look, I think, like I said, I think we have a real opportunity in simplifying the pricing experience, Right? Because you start off with a price for a latte or whatever you start with, and then the next thing you start customizing. And right now everything has a kind of a different price. And, whether it's one pump, four pumps, frankly, I'm still wrapping my head around how the whole system works. And that's part of the reason why I know we have to simplify it. What I have found is when you get simplification in place on pricing, people understand, okay, this is what I'm paying and this is what I'm getting. And right now, I think we're surprising people a little bit on what they're paying through the customization process, and we got to fix that. But look, if you actually look at just a brewed cup of coffee and you understood the commitment we have to the agriculture of that coffee bean, to the moment that that coffee bean roasts, to the moment that coffee bean makes its way to our store, we use equipment like Clover Vertica. It's freshly ground, freshly brewed. I'm highly confident it's probably the best cup of coffee you can get. And we're going to make it a lot easier for people to get access to it. And I think when people discover that with a great environment, I think we're back to people saying, hey, this is really worth it. And that's what we got to work on. That's what we got to prove to our customer. And I think the combination of what I've outlined is going to do just that. And I think the good news is we don't have to wait. We can start that process. And that's why you see us doing things like bringing in the coffee condiment bar, not charging for all dairy. Okay, you're going to continue to see us make those moves that we can, and then you'll see us continue to test and learn our way into some of the other things that we need to take our time on and be smart about.\nOperator: Thank you. That was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Brian Nicol for closing remarks.\nBrian Niccol: All right, well, thank you, everybody. It was great to hear some familiar voices and, thank you for the kind words. Obviously, I just want to reiterate, I believe Starbucks is one of those great special companies and brands, and it's a real pleasure and honor to have the opportunity to be in this role. And thank you for your time and your questions. I'll just reiterate a few things. Obviously Q4, the fiscal year, they were disappointing, but, fundamentally we're changing our strategy. Okay. And we have a clear path on how we're going to get back to Starbucks. And hopefully what you've heard from us is we're already taking steps to start driving this idea of throughput with quality, getting the staffing right in our stores, making movement on our pricing architecture and bringing, I think some order to mobile orders while we also reclaim the third place and overhaul our marketing. So a lot of work is happening. I think it's been clearly communicated to the organization. Hopefully you have a clear understanding of what we're focused on. And I'm confident this early work will start to stabilize the business. We'll make it easier and quicker for our customers to get a great cup of coffee. We'll make our cafes more enjoyable. And I think that's going to help bring customers back into our stores. And most importantly, I think our barista is going to be really proud of the store that they work in and the experience that they provide. So as I said at the top of the call, I'm very optimistic. Despite the near term challenges, I believe we have significant strengths, a strong, enduring brand. We have a clear plan, we're going to be moving quickly. There's a lot of important work ahead of us. And look, I look forward to updating each and every one of our results as we go. And I'm confident we're going to return Starbucks to growth. So with that, thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Starbucks fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Niccol",
            "content": "Thank you Tiffany and good afternoon and thank you for joining today. Starbucks is one of the world's great companies and most iconic brands. It really is a privilege to take on this role and I'm excited to be here and optimistic about the future. Since joining Starbucks last month, I've spent my time digging into the business, listening to partners and connecting with customers. These experiences and my learnings have helped me form a clear understanding of where we are and what we need to do differently moving forward. Everything I have seen and heard tells me we have significant strengths to build on. The brand is strong and enduring, we have deep coffee expertise, and we have a fantastic team of Green Apron partners. I look forward to sharing more about my plan to get back to Starbucks with you shortly, but first I'd like to turn it over to Rachel for a more detailed overview of our final Q4 and full fiscal year 2024 financial results. Rachel? Thank you Rachel. Our financial results were very disappointing and it is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers and return to growth. Back to Starbucks is that fundamental change. We have to get back to what has always set Starbucks apart. A welcoming coffee house where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee handcrafted by our skilled baristas. Regardless of the consumer environment, we must be at our best to succeed. And right now, despite the hard work of our Green Apron partners, we aren't always at our best. I've heard that while people love Starbucks, some feel like we have drifted from our core. We've made it harder to be a customer than it should be and we focused our marketing too narrowly on Starbucks rewards members. I've spent my career understanding, building and stewarding brands and it's clear the Starbucks brand is iconic and loved. My experience tells me that when we get back to our core identity and consistently deliver a great experience, our customers will come back. Our problems are fixable. Most of what we need to do is in our control. So our path forward is clear and with our U.S. business being our priority, work is already underway. Some things will take some time as we test and learn, but we're moving quickly on the things we can. I want to share a few examples. We have to make it easier for our customers to get a cup of coffee. We are prioritizing work across the U.S. Business support a clear throughput with quality goal. We want to hand deliver a high quality handcrafted beverage to our cafe customers in four minutes or less and deliver orders on time for our mobile order and pay customers every time. We have work to do to achieve this consistently, but we've learned lessons from our success improving the drive-thru experience and reducing out the window times. Our throughput with quality aspiration and getting the core cafe experience right will drive everything we do and every decision we make. The moment our Barista hands a cup of coffee directly to the customer is our brand moment of truth. So let's talk about some of the changes we're making to do this. First, we're working to get staffing right in our stores. As Rachel shared, we've made significant progress to improve average hours per partner and partner turnover is at another low. Our efforts to get partners the hours and schedules they want are working. Now we need to make sure we have the right number of partners on the floor, particularly during our morning peak and shoulder hours. We are moving quickly to test and learn. We're also making a commitment to grow from within by identifying internal hires for 90% of our retail leadership roles and to rally our team behind our Back to Starbucks plan and help support strong leadership in every store we're planning to host a store manager conference in 2025. Second, we're making it easier for customers to enjoy brewed coffee their way. We plan to bring back condiment coffee bars in all our cafes by early 2025. It's a great customer experience and will help with speed of service. We also plan to complete the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewers in all our company operated locations by the end of fiscal year 25, providing customers more on demand choice in high quality brewed coffee. And we're evolving store routines to hand deliver brewed coffee to customers faster upon order. Third, to improve throughput quality and consistency, we will cut down our overly complex menu to align with our core identity as a coffee company. We will still offer customers great choice but will be focused on fewer, better offerings consistently crafted. Fourth, we will continue to scale our investment in Siren equipment and Siren Craft processes to improve the in store experience for our partners and customers. This work is a critical enabler in helping to achieve our four minute wait time aspiration. And finally, we'll bring order to mobile order and pay so it doesn't overwhelm our cafes. Today more than 30% of transactions are driven by mobile orders. At peak it can drive an influx of orders that can be difficult to sequence and quickly deliver to our customers. When it works well, it's great, but sometimes it can be a challenge for both customers and partners. So we're working to improve sequencing with a new algorithm that enables on time mobile order handoffs and supports our four minute throughput with quality being our goal for cafe customers. We're also placing common sense guardrails on mobile ordering that we think will improve the experience for all customers. And over the coming months, we plan to take steps to better separate mobile order pickup from the cafe experience. There are also some additional steps we're taking beyond a throughput with quality focus that we believe will resonate with our customers and partners. First, we are reimagining our pricing architecture, starting with non-dairy milk customizations. We know customization is an important part of the Starbucks experience and we want to make it easier for customers to order their beverage just the way they want while still feeling like it's worth it. So beginning with holiday launch on November 7th, we're eliminating the upcharge for non-dairy milks at North American cafes owned and operated by Starbucks. It's the most popular customization after an extra shot of Espresso. And once implemented, nearly half of customers that pay for a modifier could see a price reduction of 10% or more when they choose a non-dairy milk. We're also investing in our customers with an intent not to increase menu prices at company owned and operated stores in North America through fiscal year 2025. It's a great start, but we have more work to do to make our pricing architecture straightforward and logical. Next, we're reclaiming the third place so our cafes feel like the welcoming coffee house our customers remember. In the coming months, we intend to reintroduce more personal touches to elevate the cafe experience. For instance, we'll begin to prioritize serving coffee and ceramic mugs for customers who choose to enjoy their coffee in our cafes. We're also beginning to review and revise our cafe designs to bring back more comfortable seating and amenities and to ensure our stores are a place where customers want to sit, work and meet. We're beginning to revisit certain policies with our partners and customers being top of mind. Lastly, we're getting back to marketing Starbucks to all our customers. We've already made some changes, so first, we're focusing on coffee. Starbucks sources, roasts and crafts some of the finest quality coffee. I have always loved Starbucks coffee, but I haven't always fully appreciated the quality and care that goes into every cup. From the work of our agronomists to support tens of thousands of independent coffee farmers to our master roasters, our high quality equipment and our skilled baristas, our marketing needs to tell our coffee story and showcase our premium coffee beverages. Second, we're reducing the frequency of discount driven offers that have proven ineffective, diluted our premium positioning overburdened our baristas and detracted from a consistent customer experience. We're working to make every visit worth it for our customers with straightforward pricing, timely service and a more consistent, enjoyable cafe experience. Third, we need to broaden our marketing beyond our Starbucks rewards customers. Our newly launched campaign focuses on talking to all customers and elevates the Starbucks brand in a much more visible way through broad reach media like Linear TV. It reminds customers across age groups that Starbucks serves the best coffee. You've likely seen our new approach in practice already and you will see more of it throughout the holidays and into January. Our customers find worth through quality, consistency and a sense of value. I'm confident that even these early steps will begin to remind customers the Starbucks experience is all of these things. The U.S. is my near term priority, but our international business presents significant opportunities. Before discussing China in detail, I need to spend time there to better understand our operations and the market. All indications show me the competitive environment is extreme, the macro environment is tough, and we need to figure out how we grow in the market now and into the future. In the meantime, we continue to explore strategic partnerships that could help us grow in the long-term. Looking elsewhere, I've been pleasantly surprised to learn about significant international growth opportunities for the business beyond China. We'll spend more time and effort to capitalize on growth across other international markets in the coming years. As I mentioned last week, success comes from staying true to your identity, taking care of customers and your team, simplifying the business, delivering consistently high quality products and experiences, and telling your story. I'm confident we'll make it easier to be a customer and we'll encourage customers to visit more often. And I'm confident we'll set our partners up for success so they can deliver the great customer experience I know they want to provide. In doing so, we'll reinvigorate our brand, drive stronger financial returns and return Starbucks to growth. Thank you for your time and as we get back to Starbucks, we'll regularly share results driven by our work. And as we begin to see results from pilot projects and early initiatives, we'll share more about our long term plan. With that we will open the call for questions. Operator? Yes, thanks. And, terrific to be here at Starbucks and delighted to be talking about the business with all of you. So to answer your first question, yes, I had the opportunity, frankly to spend time with our baristas from the west coast, east coast, middle of the country, in the South. And one thing that was consistent that I got to start with is they love this brand, okay? They love serving craft coffee that they know we go the extra mile to ensure it's absolutely the best. And I had the opportunity to ask people over and over again, what is your favorite drink to prepare? And consistently, every barista came back to me with, what I love making the espresso drinks, the latte art, the flat whites, the cappuccinos, the lattes. These are things that literally, they shined when they answered the question. Now, as regard to, I also asked them, what do you think are some things we could be doing better? And right out of the gate, one of the things they said that would help the whole process is if we could get brewed coffee not to be going down the line and ending up down at the counter. And so that's why you heard me, in my prepared remarks here, talk about how we're going to bring back the coffee condiment bar, because both our customers are asking for it, and our baristas are saying it would help them deliver the speed of service that they want to provide. So that's one big piece of feedback I got. The second piece of feedback right there with the brewed coffee is take a hard look at the staffing both during peak and shoulder hours to ensure that we're setting the teams up for success all day long. And so we've looked at it, I'm happy to say we're already implementing some changes in a couple thousand stores, and we are going to be piloting some new approaches on how we set up the labor model so that our baristas have time to give not only great craft drinks, but also that hospitality and that human touch of handing off the drink to our customer at the counter and then also making sure that we're on time with the mobile order business. The other thing that they shared with me in some of the stores is they wanted their cafe dining room back. They like leading the coffee house. I think there's a moment of pride, of saying, this is my place. They know our customers by name. They have their regulars. They want to have a great seat for them. They want to have a great environment for them to enjoy, whether it's a moment for themselves or whether it's sharing a moment with others. And so I couldn't agree more, frankly, with a lot of their feedback. I'll touch on one more, which was, hey, is there any way to simplify the customization that we provide? Can we put in some guardrails on this so that it's not out of hand? Those were the big ones. To your question on similarities of Chipotle, what I would tell you is the similarities start with, you've got an employee/partner base at Starbucks that is hugely committed to the brand and hugely committed to doing the right thing for the business. And when you start with that kind of foundation, you're able to put in the right programs so that we can get the business turned around. So I would say that is one big similarity. The thing, obviously, that I've also just been really impressed by is just how special Starbucks is to so many people, both customers at all ages. And whether they're getting, just a brewed cup of coffee quickly or whether they're getting, a flat white. The brand means a lot to them and it means a lot to their communities. And, I take that as a lot of responsibility. So long answer to your question, but I wanted to make sure I was thorough. So thanks for the question. So I'll start. To answer your question, look, I absolutely want to stop doing the things that aren't working and shifting those dollars to things that I believe will work. And in some cases we have to test and learn our way through that. But yes, look, I think to the company's credit they've already started some terrific work on supply chain and getting inefficiencies out of the supply chain that I think can support the business longer term. It's not just a onetime situation, it's an ongoing capability that we're building. And then, as it relates to like discounts and some of the shifting of marketing dollars and then what we're doing on the labor side of things, we may find it's going to require some additional hours because at the end of the day I want to make sure that the teams are staffed to win every transaction so that when somebody comes in they walk away saying they had a great experience time and time again. And I also want to have a scenario where our baristas feel like they have the ability to give a great experience. And I'm sure you've heard this over and over again, right? It's like the customer experience will not exceed that of the partner's experience. So we have to make sure, and we're going to test and learn our way through this, that we are setting up the right schedule, the right amount of hours with the right number of partners on the floor so that we can deliver these handcrafted drinks and hand them off to our customers in store and then also support our mobile order business as well as in some cases the drive thru business as well. So we're going to be smart about the investments. And I think also you saw in the past, when I find something that's working, we're going to do more of it. And so that is really what we're after. And I think collectively the team really buys into that approach. I'll hand it over to Rachel for the second piece. Yes. So to answer your first question, on guardrails for customization and menu simplification, we're actually in the middle of doing that work right now. There are some obvious things that are easy to say, let's get that off the menu. And then there are other things that we might have to test our way on the menu of how we exit them smartly. And then on the customization as far as guardrails go and by the way, the menu simplification is both in beverage and food. We're not just looking at beverage or just food. Then on the customization guardrails. Right now, if you go through the app, you'll notice that we offer up all kinds of customization, or it's the same customization page almost for everything that you order. Two things happen. One, it's complicated for the customer to get through it. And then two, we kind of incentivize people to customize drinks that probably aren't the best way to execute the drink. Not to mention it creates additional complexity for our partners to execute the drink. So we have some cleanup to do, is the way I would describe it. And then I also think we have some pricing architecture tied to guardrails to ensure that we end up with no surprises for, frankly, anybody on what was the price of what they just built, and then also that we can execute it consistently every time. So that's what we're after on those fronts. And what was your other question? Yes, look, it's really interesting. I'm still getting up to speed on the innovation process at Starbucks, and what I'm happy to discover is they have a stage gate process. It hasn't been followed recently, and we're going to start using the process again. So innovation has been, I think, a core piece of the Starbucks proposition, and it's going to continue to be. But we are definitely not going to be moving at the speed you probably saw over the last two years. And part of that is we're just going to take a much more disciplined approach using the stage gate process so that what we roll out, we have a better understanding of how it's going to perform. The supply chain can support it, the baristas can execute it and, we'll make sure we're smart about how we then market it, so people are aware of it. So it's kind of the basics of how I would call it, like stage gate innovation. But what I was happy to discover is there is a process already at Starbucks. It just wasn't being used, and now we're going to reinstate it. Yes, thanks for the question, John. To answer your question, look, food is, I think, a key piece of the puzzle, and I think you're right. We have the opportunity to do fewer, better food executions. So, obviously I want to make sure that everybody understands the quality, the craft, the commitment we have to coffee. But I think we can also have the same commitment to quality and craftsmanship in our food to match the experience you get with our beverages. So we're doing work on that already. And I do think we're going to be much better at food if we do fewer things on the food front in a better quality fashion. So that's part of the process, and I think you'll see some of those changes evolving over the coming months. Yes, thanks, David. Look, what we want to do is figure out how we can reduce the cost on our renovation program. And then as part of that, also create the experience where you've got a great coffee house chair or seat or vibe. And then at the same time, I want to separate, and we believe we need to separate the counter experience, meaning the in store experience, from the mobile order pickup experience. But regardless whether you walk in to just pick up your coffee and go, I want you to feel like you've walked into a special place and look, ideally, I was just saying this to our design team. I know we've got it right when people are questioning whether or not they want to order mobile, because maybe if I have a few minutes, I'd rather stay in the cafe and get that cafe experience from our barista, where it's handheld. So I have strong belief that we can make the cafe experience, frankly, really terrific and something special, really welcoming, warm space where you want to spend some time. And I think there's touches. Right. I mentioned just bringing back the ceramic mug. If you decide to stay in the cafe and have, your latte two, obviously, then the furniture that we have, the materials that we choose, I love. Our designers are talking about make sure we bring back the layers, the texture, the warmth. Those are the things that are really important. Operationally, what we're also after is clarity of where that barista handoff experience will happen. We're also after less than four minutes for POS to the handoff. And we're also after, if you order a brewed cup of coffee, it's a really fast experience because we're going to just hand it to you right at the point of sale, and then you can go to the coffee condiment bar and doctor up your coffee how you see fit. One of the other things we're going to be bringing back, too, is bringing the Sharpies back to our baristas. And it's going to give them the opportunity to put that additional human touch on every coffee experience as well. So there's a lot of. I think there's a lot of just simple things that go a long way of saying, what, this is a community place. This is a special place where people are here to connect. And I think we can do that in a really meaningful way. And then obviously on the mobile order side of things, I want to create a separate area where it's clear so your drink is ready, I can grab it. And if you need to be quick, you can be quick, and we'll be on time with it. And then obviously we still have the drive through business where we got to make sure we get the orders correctly out the window. And then to answer your question, David, on the renovation program, I think we're still working through what is the right schedule once we fully understand what the renovations are going to entail. But my hope is, over the coming years, we'll be able to touch everything and get back to having that community coffee house vibe. Yes, thanks for the question. Obviously, the one thing that I'm really delighted about is this Siren Craft system, both the equipment and the process, I think is a key unlock for us to deliver on this four minutes or less on the In Cafe experience. And then also to set up the algorithm where we can allow mobile orders to have specific pickup times so that we're sequencing those mobile orders. What I'll tell you is we know we've got some bottlenecks out there, right, that we got to solve. And the good news is some of the bottlenecks require the full implementation. So the hot hold, the combi oven, the cold solution, the process, and then there are other stores where we don't have to quite go that far in order to achieve the throughput that we're after. But what I love about this is then we can we know when transactions get to a certain level or mix gets to a certain level. How we need to roll out the system accordingly. So what I would tell you is, look, what I want the organization rotating towards is how do we unlock throughput at less than four minutes in that store? If that store requires the full Siren Craft system, put it in. If it requires some pieces of it, put that in. If it just requires staffing and better deployment, we'll implement that. So I really, I think we need to rerotate ourselves to this idea of we are going to be a great coffee craft company that has now really good throughput and operational standards for how we'll perform for each of these access modes. And the good news is we got a great group of engineers, a great group of people that have clarity on how we solve any of these bottlenecks that we pop into or bump into. So that's the way you should think about it. I'm putting a full court press on solving four minutes is the point, and then how that cascades into our other access modes. Yes. So David, I think the big change here is having an operating standard around less than four minutes and there wasn't, I guess, clarity on that aspect. Instead we were just kind of working on pain points in isolation as opposed to what is the system solution to get the customer experience and the barista experience that we know we need to deliver. And so the less than four minutes actually comes from two things. One, talking to baristas and customers to find out what are their expectations. And one of the things I'm happy to discover is, before the business got as big as it is and had also mobile order and food and cold, etcetera. A lot of our partners, long time partners, are used to getting these handcrafted drinks done in about two and a half minutes. So we know it's feasible. To your point though, there is some additional bottlenecks that we have to deal with. So in some cases it's the food and that's where it's necessary to put in the combi oven, have the warming kit. In some cases it's the mix of cold and in some cases frankly it's the mix of mobile. And so we have to address these things throughout the system. And that's why I'm saying like putting everything against this idea of, what, we are not going to do something or said another way. We're going to be doing the things that enable less than four minutes at the counter. Then we're also going to be doing things that enable being on time and accurate every time for mobile order pickup. And it's also we're going to work towards getting less than four minutes in the drive thru window as well. So the good news is we've got the equipment, we just haven't over time used it as a system to serve against the need of less than four minutes. And so that's the big change. And when you, when you start to use that metric, you quickly discover where our stores have a real problem and we're going to go very aggressive against those first and where there are other stores that frankly don't have the transaction or the mix yet that weren't putting in all this equipment, but we should put in the processes, wire the place correctly so that as their transactions get close we can put it in and avoid ever having the bottlenecks. And then to just answer your question, we probably have about 50% of our stores or 50% of our transactions already happening less than four minutes. So we know it's very doable. And this is what I'm referring to. During peak, we know it's very doable. We just need to do it in all our stores in every transaction. So we're going to be maniacal about getting after it. I'm sorry, what was the last part of your question? Yes, the productivity effort. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, you got it. So yes, look, the things we're working on are kind of what I shared in my opening remarks, which I believe will drive transactions because it's going to address our partner experience as well as our customer experience. So I just spent a bunch of time talking about this, getting after the less than four minutes in the cafe, being on time and accurate in mobile order against certain time standards, getting the pricing architecture correct, broadening our reach beyond Starbucks rewards customers and then obviously creating that community house experience where people want to be in Starbucks, spend time in Starbucks, all those things will add up to I believe growth. And the good news is we've got some great assets and tools available to us, right? That rewards program is a valuable tool. It's not the only tool, but it's a valuable tool that I think we could make work harder for us if we put it in concert with marketing that has more broad reach. I think innovation, the capability this organization has on innovation is a powerful tool. We haven't used it correctly of late, but I think if we use it correctly with the stage gate process driven against the idea of these operating standards of less than four minutes and then also delivering on customer's expectations, innovation will be more powerful. So it is one of those things where as we get the foundation reset, I believe there's a lot of additional catalysts for growth in the business. And, if you're asking me how do I add it all up, I don't have an answer for you yet. What I can tell you it adds up to is more growth, it adds up to a turnaround and it adds up to growth. So that's what we're going to spend our time on. And then on the last piece of productivity, the billion dollars, I mean the good news is the team, especially the supply chain team has done a tremendous job of just being much smarter about how we I think work with our vendors and partners as well as the right way to bring then these products to market. It's powerful when you have the right product, the right place at the right time. It just becomes so much more efficient for everybody involved, both the supplier to all the way to our partner in store that has to deliver on. So Rachel, if you want to add anything to that. Yes. Thanks John. The look I will tell you I am pleasantly surprised to see how the license business in the U.S. performs. I had the opportunity to spend some time with the guys at Target and I will tell you they are hugely supportive of the idea of getting back to Starbucks and I think they're going to want to give people the back to Starbucks experience that we're after. So I'm hugely optimistic. Even when I think about the airports and such, there's a huge opportunity for us, I think, to simplify some of the execution there so that we can get people the great throughput that they want so they can get on their way. So from what I can tell, everybody seems to be very excited about this idea of throughput with quality, this broader idea of just getting back to Starbucks. So I think this will carry not only in our license stores, but I think they'll carry it as it's their own, which I think is really important. And then what was the other part of your question? Yes. So look, we're early days into the menu simplification, but there's definitely room for us, I think, to eliminate some products frankly, that add complexity, have a lot of waste and really don't add a whole lot to the experience. And so we're going to have to be, it's going to be, in some cases it's tough because everybody has their one favorite thing that maybe is on the long tail of this. But we got to clear the way so that we can get to the big movers that people really interact with time and time again. And then on the customization, like the alt milk look, I've just seen time and time again when people start the process of their beverage, the price is, I think warranted given the caliber of the coffee or the drink that you're getting. Where we sometimes I think get twisted is in all the different customizations that we offer up and then the complexity of the customization that people take us up on. And I think a lot of it is unnecessary. And I think when we simplify that aspect of it and then charge for the things that we should be charging for and maybe not charging for the things that don't really need to be charged for, I think everybody's going to walk away feeling a lot better about ultimately their personal beverage that they've created. So the numbers specifically, we're still working through some of that. Obviously we got a pretty good idea of what the alt milk implication is. But I'm confident it's the right investment in the business to get people to re-engage with the brand accordingly. So I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Rachel. Yes, thanks. Well, look, one of the things that we definitely have to fix is when we do renovations, we can't have stores closed for, two weeks or three weeks or whatever it is that is too disruptive. So the team knows that they're working on how we fix that. But that almost has nothing to do with the Siren system. That's just in general principle on renovations. The Siren system. I would say part of the reason why I think we've maybe took a not the most direct path on this is because we haven't had clarity of what problem we were trying to solve. And the problem we are solving now is getting to great experiences. If you really think about it, right. We've got three access modes. Okay. Or sorry, four access modes, if you include delivery, right? You got in cafe, you got mobile order pay, you got drive thru and you got delivery. All right, so there's four access modes common. And now we're in three lines of business, right? Hot, cold and food. And we have not had operating standards for time of service that we want to provide for each of those elements. So that's the problem we need to solve. And the good news is, even though it wasn't, I guess envisioned initially, a lot of the equipment and process solves bottlenecks that were kind of considered one off issues. But when you put the whole thing together and you realize like, oh, this store is operating at such a transaction level, it's got such a food mix, it's got such a cold mix, it's got such a mobile order, you got to put the entire system in in order to achieve these operating standards of the excellence as it relates to the customer experience. So I would tell you, part of the reason why I think we've zigged and zagged on that Siren Craft system is because we didn't have clarity of what problem we were trying to solve. And now I think we've got clarity, which is we're all about great throughput for the access modes that our customers want to experience Starbucks. And I think I'm optimistic that we can roll this out accordingly. And the places where, you got the full scale bottleneck, they're going to be the first places that we implement this coupled with I want to touch the stores to bring back that coffee house experience. And look, the challenge or the problem for us to solve is I don't want the store closed for, weeks and we got to figure out how we can do it for less. So. And I think these things are all very solvable. So that hopefully that answers your question on the Siren Craft system. And more importantly, what's the problem we're trying to solve? And the problem we're trying to solve is I want to give a great customer experience from a time standpoint to go with the great craft quality, coffee drink experience, food experience you're getting. Yes. So, look, I think, like I said, I think we have a real opportunity in simplifying the pricing experience, Right? Because you start off with a price for a latte or whatever you start with, and then the next thing you start customizing. And right now everything has a kind of a different price. And, whether it's one pump, four pumps, frankly, I'm still wrapping my head around how the whole system works. And that's part of the reason why I know we have to simplify it. What I have found is when you get simplification in place on pricing, people understand, okay, this is what I'm paying and this is what I'm getting. And right now, I think we're surprising people a little bit on what they're paying through the customization process, and we got to fix that. But look, if you actually look at just a brewed cup of coffee and you understood the commitment we have to the agriculture of that coffee bean, to the moment that that coffee bean roasts, to the moment that coffee bean makes its way to our store, we use equipment like Clover Vertica. It's freshly ground, freshly brewed. I'm highly confident it's probably the best cup of coffee you can get. And we're going to make it a lot easier for people to get access to it. And I think when people discover that with a great environment, I think we're back to people saying, hey, this is really worth it. And that's what we got to work on. That's what we got to prove to our customer. And I think the combination of what I've outlined is going to do just that. And I think the good news is we don't have to wait. We can start that process. And that's why you see us doing things like bringing in the coffee condiment bar, not charging for all dairy. Okay, you're going to continue to see us make those moves that we can, and then you'll see us continue to test and learn our way into some of the other things that we need to take our time on and be smart about. All right, well, thank you, everybody. It was great to hear some familiar voices and, thank you for the kind words. Obviously, I just want to reiterate, I believe Starbucks is one of those great special companies and brands, and it's a real pleasure and honor to have the opportunity to be in this role. And thank you for your time and your questions. I'll just reiterate a few things. Obviously Q4, the fiscal year, they were disappointing, but, fundamentally we're changing our strategy. Okay. And we have a clear path on how we're going to get back to Starbucks. And hopefully what you've heard from us is we're already taking steps to start driving this idea of throughput with quality, getting the staffing right in our stores, making movement on our pricing architecture and bringing, I think some order to mobile orders while we also reclaim the third place and overhaul our marketing. So a lot of work is happening. I think it's been clearly communicated to the organization. Hopefully you have a clear understanding of what we're focused on. And I'm confident this early work will start to stabilize the business. We'll make it easier and quicker for our customers to get a great cup of coffee. We'll make our cafes more enjoyable. And I think that's going to help bring customers back into our stores. And most importantly, I think our barista is going to be really proud of the store that they work in and the experience that they provide. So as I said at the top of the call, I'm very optimistic. Despite the near term challenges, I believe we have significant strengths, a strong, enduring brand. We have a clear plan, we're going to be moving quickly. There's a lot of important work ahead of us. And look, I look forward to updating each and every one of our results as we go. And I'm confident we're going to return Starbucks to growth. So with that, thank you and have a great day."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you Brian, and welcome to your first Starbucks earnings call. And good afternoon everyone. As you saw in our press release last week, our traffic challenges persisted in Q4, resulting in pressures throughout our P&L from our top line to our bottom line. With that, I'll briefly discuss our Q4 and full year results and then turn the call over to Brian. In regards to Q4, our Q4 consolidated revenue was $9.1billion, down 3% from the prior year, driven by a 7% decline in comparable store sales, consisting of an 8% decrease in transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket, partially offset by 7% net new company operated store growth. The revenue decrease was primarily due to a 6% decline in U.S. comparable store sales, driven by a 10% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket, mainly from pricing. Traffic declined across all channels and day parts, with the most pronounced decline in the afternoon day part. In addition to the continued decline of non Starbucks rewards member visits, frequency also slowed across all SR member deciles in comparison to prior year and ultimately impacted spend. While active SR membership grew 4% year-over-year to $33.8 million, it remained flat to Q3 as our product innovation and offerings as well as promotions did not create sustained excitement or the stickiness we planned. Our Q4 results also reflected China comparable store sales decline of 14% driven by an 8% decline in average ticket and a 6% decline in comparable transactions, weighed down by intensified competition and a soft macro environment that impacted consumer spending. Although the market reached an all-time high of 23.5 million SR active members during the quarter with 2.2 million net new members versus prior year, comp declined due to non SR member traffic pressures, elevated discounting given the highly promotional environment and lower sales of high ticket items impacted by consumer sentiment. Shifting to margin. Our Q4 consolidated operating margin was 14.4% contracting 370 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by deleverage, investments in store partner wages and benefits as well as increased promotional activities. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and the in store operational efficiencies. In store, we were successful in getting increased hours per partner, which is contributing to low hourly partner turnover and reduced training costs. However, we have additional work to do to obtain the correct staffing. We also expect our throughput to be further optimized once the Siren Craft processes stabilizes across the company operated store portfolio. Outside the store, we remain focused on capturing additional end to end supply chain efficiencies. Collectively, in and out of store efficiency efforts have yielded savings of approximately 150 basis points in the quarter. Our G&A expenses were higher than expected and exceeded 7% of revenue in Q4, primarily due to unplanned and non reoccurring third party services and transition costs. Excluding these costs totaling approximately 50 basis points, G&A was 6.6% of revenue in Q4 and remained closer to 6% for the second half of fiscal year 2024 in line with expectations. We expect G&A to further decrease relative to revenue over time leading to sustained margin expansion. Q4 EPS was $0.80, down 24% from the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by a combination of traffic challenges and heightened investments, partially offset by our pricing and efficiency efforts. Moving to full fiscal year 2024, consolidated net revenues increased 1% to $36.2 billion in fiscal year 2024, driven by 7% net new company operated store growth offset by a 2% decline in comparable store sales. Full year consolidated operating margin was 15%, contracting 110 basis points from prior year, primarily driven by investments in store partner wages and benefits, deleverage and increased promotional activity. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and in store operational efficiencies. Our in store and out of store efficiency efforts collectively delivered roughly 250 basis points of margin improvement for the full year, which is nearly a billion of cost reductions throughout our P&L as aligned with our original plan. Full year EPS was $3.31, declining 6%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from higher effective tax rate. Shifting to our Outlook. As noted in our press release last week, given the company's CEO transition coupled with the current state of the business, our guidance is suspended for full fiscal year 2025. This allows ample opportunity to assess the business and solidify key strategies as we refocus our efforts on the turnaround, I would like to still briefly touch on our capital allocation priorities. As Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks last week, one of our top priorities includes reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffee house. To do so, we plan to reduce the number of our new stores and renovations in fiscal year 2025 to accommodate a redesign, while also unlocking capital to support our broader turnaround. We expect this shift coupled with efficiencies will help us balance our investments accordingly. We're working through the details of the impacts on key metrics including store growth, and we'll revert back with insight at a future date. In the meantime, I want to be clear that this shift in store growth strategy does not reflect and should not be interpreted as a statement on our long-term opportunity view or new store performance. In fact, we continue to see strong, highly incremental performance from our new stores. As a proof point, approximately 40% of our U.S. company operated stores had positive comp growth in full fiscal year 2024 with outsized contribution from our newer stores, especially in markets where store density remains low. We continue to see store growth opportunity, especially as we focus on continuing to create a welcoming coffeehouse and the store experience that both our Green Apron partners and our customers deserve. Also, last week we announced an annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 to $0.61 per share. This marks our 14th consecutive year of annual increase at a CAGR of approximately 20%, offering shareholders a sense of certainty during the turnaround and our confidence in our long-term growth. In summary, our results do not reflect the strength of our brand and what we're capable of. As a 20 plus year partner, I've seen what Starbucks is capable of when we focus on what we do best. It's because of that that I have confidence in our ability to turn around our business and I have the utmost confidence in our partners around the globe that together we can deliver. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brian. Sure. Thanks for the question, Sarah. What I would just say just to punctuate a bit of what Brian said is that broadly with our investments you can expect that we'll continue with efficiency efforts. We'll have ways to balance this. But I think it's important to note that in the near term we may see some incremental investments that will have an impact on our financials, but we do expect they'll be accretive, particularly as we balance that with increased transactions, so I'd look at it from that perspective. As it relates to the G&A we don't have a GAAP, non-GAAP situation with the transition cost. The cost that I spoke about, the non reoccurring one time are largely all related to transition in one way or another. We don't expect that that will repeat. When you think about G&A for next year, the one thing to remember is while we'll continue to focus on being as efficient as possible, we will be lapping lower performance based comp in fiscal year 2024. So that will have an impact on our G&A in fiscal year 2025. The only thing that I would add Christine, is just to say that while we'll continue to focus on efficiencies, the target that we've shared previously will be part of as we think about reassessing the business and looking at the right near term and longer term strategies as part of our Back to Starbucks plan, we'll look at the optimal level of efficiencies. But what you can expect is we will continue to Brian's point, we have so much opportunity across the end-to-end supply chain as we optimize throughout the store and even as we manage spend. And so we'll continue to be focused on that. I wouldn't be as focused on the billion dollars. I would just be focused on the fact that we will continue forward with efficiencies and we'll do that as a way to help offset some of the investments we'll be making. And in the future those efficiencies will help us not only support incremental investments, but they'll lead to margin expansion and earnings growth. Yes, I would just say as you think about the investments we're making, which are going to be important to returning Starbucks to growth, just when you think about the shape of the year, you could expect that the first half of the year is where we'll be making the investment. So we'd expect that the back half of the year will be stronger as the investments and our strategies start to take hold. So that's the way I think about it. I think there'll be a more near term impact as we make some of these investments. But we expect that the traffic will return and that we'll see customers coming back into the stores and that will help to balance so that we see gradual momentum in the back half of the year."

I would like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Tiffany Willis, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Willis, you may now begin your conference.\nTiffany Willis: Thank you, Diego. Good afternoon and thank you everyone for joining us today to discuss Starbucks third quarter fiscal year 2024 results. Today's discussion will be led by Laxman Narasimhan, Chief Executive Officer; and Rachel Ruggeri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statement should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our latest annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. GAAP results in third quarter fiscal year 2024's comparative period includes several items related to strategic actions, including restructuring and impairment charges and other items. These items are excluded from our non-GAAP results. All numbers referenced on today's call are on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted or there is no non-GAAP adjustment related to the metric. As part of our non-GAAP results, revenue, operating margin and EPS growth metrics on today's call are measured in constant currency, whereby current period results are converted into United States dollars using the average monthly exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates for the current period, excluding related hedging activities. For non-GAAP financial measures mentioned in today's call, please refer to the earnings release and our website at investor.starbucks.com to find reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website through Friday, September 13, 2024. And lastly, for your planning purposes, please note that our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call has been tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, October 30, 2024. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Laxman.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you, Tiffany. And thank you for joining us this afternoon. Let me start by laying out our results for this quarter. Our Q3 total company revenue was $9.1 billion, up 1% year-over-year and 6% over Q2. Our global comparable store sales declined 3% year-over-year, driven by a negative 2% comp growth in North America and a negative 14% comp growth in China and partially offset by strong performance in Japan. Our global operating margins contracted by 70 basis points to 16.7% and overall earnings per share for the quarter was $0.93. Our total company results were in line with guidance, but international performance, particularly in China was challenged. We are not satisfied with the results, but our actions are making an impact. Leading business and operational indicators are trending in the right direction ahead of our financial results and our runway for improvement is long. We see green shoots in our US business driven by the three-part action plan outlined last quarter. First, meet and unlock capacity for new demand through a relentless focus and improvements to our US store operations and on elevating the experience we create for our partners and customers. Second, attract new customers and drive transaction growth by launching and integrating more exciting new products with relevant marketing, while maintaining our focus on core coffee forward offerings. And third, reach new customers and demonstrate our value by making sure customers believe that Starbucks experience is worth it every time. First, our largest opportunity, meet and unlock capacity for new demand. A relentless focus on improving operational execution across our nearly 10,000 US company operated stores is the cornerstone of our near-term plan. While it is early days of progress, our plan is working. If you walk away from today's call with one thought, let it be the significant changes and long-term upside potential taking place within our US stores and across our end-to-end supply-chain to unlock growth, enhance the customer experience and drive cost efficiencies. Within our stores, we've seen material positive momentum across core store health and performance metrics with notable improvements in partner scheduling and turnover, critical store issues and inventory management. Stores ranked in our top two operational performance quartiles reached a new high during the quarter, a 28% upwards shift from Q2, but we have more opportunity. Our focus on operational excellence, driven by a reinvention plan has led to a multi-second year-over-year improvement in out-of-the-window times, a nearly 50% reduction in calls received via customer contact center for my order took too long and Mobile Order & Pay and delivery uptime rates of 99%. These are key indicators of our work to drive growth by addressing customer wait times, product availability and the customer experience. This quarter, we also introduced Phase 1 of our Siren Craft systems, which includes several process and partner-driven enhancements to our US store operations. Changes include a new peak time play caller role, strategic investments in partner hours, training, new routines, simple enhancements to technology and an evolved beverage build process. Early deployment across 1,200 stores demonstrated a material incremental improvement across key performance, throughput, efficiency and reliability metrics. Encouraged by this, we fully deployed Siren Craft systems process improvements across our entire portfolio of US company operated stores this week. Later this quarter, we will begin rolling out a simple refit to our espresso machines, which we expect to improve espresso throughput by up to 15% without compromising quality. And with a minor software change in our store production systems, we have a similar ability to improve food throughput. When paired with Siren system equipment announced as part of our reinvention plan, these new processes become a forced multiplier that we expect to drive a true step-change improvement. Early assessments demonstrate the capability to drive a 10-second to 20-second wait time reduction and a resulting comp opportunity range of 1% to 1.5%. Leveraging our Deep Brew analytics platform, we have identified customer experience outlier stores, approximately 10% of our network and have developed targeted plans to address and improve them, including accelerated Siren system deployment. Similarly, we are accelerating the pace of our new-store builds and renovations with 580 net new builds and more than 800 renovations planned in North America for FY 2024. Store development efforts are focused on Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities where we see population growth and forecast both underserved demand and high incrementality. Increasingly, these new-store builds and renovations also include Siren system equipment. In line with prior guidance, we remain on track to deploy equipment in less than 10% of company operated stores by the end of FY 2024 and about 40% by the end of FY 2026. Building on our pilot, Starbucks and Gopuff have agreed to terms for an expanded relationship to open 100 delivery-only kitchens across the US. We're also accelerating the rollout of digital storyboards with target deployment across most US stores in the next two years, a year earlier than originally anticipated. Lastly, we are working on other ways to enhance the cafe experience. This includes new and expanded seating options that elevate many stores, while upholding a safe and inviting place for partners and customers. A key outcome of our operational efforts has been material and sustained improvements to the partner experience. Driven by precision partner-centric staffing and scheduling efforts, we ended the quarter with a new post-pandemic low partner turnover rate, the best shift completion rate in two years and a 13% improvement in average hours per partner, now the highest on record. These initiatives create more stability in our stores, provide more predictability for our partners and sustain our experienced flywheel. Looking beyond our stores, we continue to realize new efficiencies, cost savings and performance improvements across our end-to-end supply chain, thanks to strong support from our suppliers and we see even more headroom. We have a structured process to realize significant continued improvements across our end-to-end supply chain. We are ahead of plan on productivity. We expect our productivity to drive efficiency and unlock capital from areas that don't touch the customer. In turn, these savings will enable us to target investments that drive value for our customers beginning later in Q4, reigniting our North America flywheel for growth. We are early days on this journey, building both our strategic sourcing and revenue management capabilities. Our second priority is to drive demand through relevant product innovation with coffee at our core. We've seen meaningful improvement here as well. This quarter, we drove traffic into our stores through an engaging and innovative pipeline of products supported by integrated marketing campaigns. Cold share was up 1% year-over-year, representing 76% of our beverage mix through the quarter. Our newly formulated iced coffee received positive feedback. Our strength in Cold espresso innovation continued to drive the platform's growth, up 4% year-over-year. And we launched Starbuck's Milano Duetto whole bean coffee in Milan, ahead of a global launch this October. Beyond coffee, our new Summer-Berry Starbucks Refreshers beverages with Pearls drove the highest week one product launch in our history. Their success buoyed the entire Starbucks Refreshers beverage platform to an all-time high during the quarter. As mentioned in Q2, we continue to build out our 24-month product pipeline, while accelerating our pace of innovation. For example, recognize the growing appeal and opportunity created by the energy category, we launched a new hand-crafted iced energy beverages across our US stores in just three months compared to a normal 12 to 18. Looking forward, we believe our Q4 product offerings, including the return of pumpkin spice, combined with supporting marketing activities and offers, provides the right formula to drive customer interest, demand and deeper engagement with both new and existing customers. Our third and final near-term priority is to reach new customers and demonstrate the value we offer by ensuring the Starbucks experience is worth it every time. Recognizing the premium position of our brand, we've been measured in our use of offers. During this quarter, only 14% of our transactions were driven by offers compared to a competitor average of 29%. Of offer-driven transactions, 10% were star-based offers targeted to Starbucks Rewards members. Only 4% were driven by five -- by price-based offers. Our best offers are in the app. Together, offers and other integrated marketing activities when paired with exciting product innovation, successfully grew Starbucks Rewards membership, reactivated many lapsed Rewards members and drove customer traffic on promotional days and product launch weeks. Active US Starbucks Rewards members grew to 33.8 million during the quarter. Members across every decile increased the frequency of their visits. We're focused on the continued growth of the program because the average active member spends materially more annually and drives a higher life-time value for the business than a non-member. Research also tells us that the most inactive Starbucks Rewards members don't realize they've lapsed. This demonstrates a continued opportunity to drive return visits, active member growth and deeper customer loyalty. Looking forward, we will continue to use more targeted offers, coupled with select pricing actions funded by efficiency initiatives to drive traffic and conversion. We plan to leverage a mix of paid media, acquisition and retention offers, disruptive signage and partner education to drive transactions and increase the frequency of visits with a focus on product launches and continued Starbucks Rewards member growth. It's worth remembering the ubiquity of the Starbucks brand and our ability to intercept customers. For instance, our business is up 13% in airports and up 9% in hotels, pointing to these trends. Leveraging our brand and our ability to intercept customers while demonstrating value, not just in price but through a premium experience remains a sizable opportunity across our entire store portfolio. Moving on to digital. As part of our action plan, we made continued improvements to our Starbucks app, including wait time algorithm enhancements that have improved order-ready accuracy by nearly 50 percentage points. This combined with in-app offers helped drive a 10% year-over-year growth in Mobile Order & Pay revenue, a 7% year-over-year increase in MOP transactions. Looking deeper, our data shows that one in four non-Starbucks Rewards members want the ability to use Mobile Order & Pay. Nearly 80% of those customers don't want to join a Rewards program or create an account to do it. In response, we opened MOP for all to provide those customers the convenience they seek, while removing perceived barriers to entry. We believe these enhancements to the digital experience, coupled with more effortless ordering will continue to drive Starbucks Rewards membership over time with customers increasing frequency and spend. Once customers are in our digital ecosystem, they're more likely to remain engaged across channels and drive greater lifetime value. In summary, our plans are beginning to work. We are recovering our brand from its perceptions. We're rebuilding the operational foundation of our stores and supply-chain. We're reducing costs to support investments. We're sustaining partner experience improvements and we're working to make the Starbucks experience worth it every time. While it's early days, I'm confident in the trajectory of our US business and the operational improvements we're making. And I'm reassured by the impact our work is expected to deliver in FY 2025 and beyond. Looking outside the US, we continue to see weakness in parts of our international business and strength in others. Headwinds persist in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, parts of Europe, driven by widely discussed misperceptions about our brand. In some European markets, consumers are stretched. At the same time, we see significant strength in markets like Japan and parts of Latin America. China is one of our most notable international challenges and an area I'd like to talk about in more detail. The competitive market dynamics in China are reflected in our recent results. We continue to face a more cautious consumer spending and intensified competition. In the past year, unprecedented store expansion and a mass segment price war at the expense of comp and profitability have also caused significant disruptions to the operating environment. Still, we have made progress in important areas. Through Q3, metrics like average daily transactions, weekly sales and operating margin improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Starbucks Rewards members grew by 1.6 million to a record high 22 million active members and customer connection scores reached a new high, while partner turnover reached a new low. We've built an amazing business in China over the past 25 years, a business for China built by an outstanding local team. We've pioneered the growth of the premium coffee industry in market with our Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve brands and brand equity remains distinctive. We have incredibly committed and expert partners with an unmatched depth in coffee and craft. Our stores are distinctive and industry leading and our supply-chain is world class. New stores have expanded our presence to more than 900 county cities and continue to drive exceptional cash-on-cash returns and a payback of less than two years. We're looking beyond near-term challenges and towards long-term opportunities in the market. We built Starbucks in China around three principles. A great customer experience is grounded in a great partner experience. Our coffee will always be distinctive and high quality with low penetration relative to other markets, which provides continued headroom. Our beautiful stores will celebrate the culture and traditions of China and their local communities. Even in a challenging market, we have stayed true to these principles and our relative premium positioning. This is reflective in the competitive margins we have sustained in the face of price competition. Over the past 25 years, we've gone through different phases of growth in China and have relied on different strategic partnerships to grow our business and capabilities, like joint ventures and strategic partnerships in technology, real estate and supply-chain. As we look forward, we see higher growth and margin opportunities in China. We're building the next generation of Starbucks grounded in our premium brands and with a business that is even more digital, innovative and locally relevant. To do so, as our strategy evolves, we are in the early stages of exploring strategic partnerships to further enhance our competitive position to accelerate growth and innovate to win in the long term in China. We remain completely committed to our business and our partners in China for the next 25 years and beyond. The long-term opportunity for us is significant. Before I close, I would like to confirm that Elliott Management is a shareholder in our company and our conversations to date have been constructive. On the business, my continued confidence is rooted in the focus, energy and effort of our partners across the business and around the globe. Our growing culture of focused innovation and relentless execution continues to enhance our capabilities, operational muscle and executional discipline, driving forward our action plan and our long-term triple shot strategy, while helping return the business to sustainable algorithmic growth. And with that, I'll turn this over to Rachel.\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. As Laxman shared, we are seeing progress against our three-part action plans. Additionally, our efficiency efforts, which are tracking ahead of expectations, partially offset investments associated with the cautious consumer environment. With continued focus on our action plans, efficiency efforts and disciplined operational execution, we expect progress as we close out the year. With that, let me turn to our results. Our Q3 consolidated revenue was $9.1 billion, up 1% from the prior year, demonstrating sequential revenue growth quarter-over-quarter, consistent with what we guided. Revenue growth over the prior year was driven by 8% net new company-operated store growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in comparable store sales from a 5% decrease in transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket as we continue to navigate through a value-driven consumer environment. US led the average ticket increase of 4%, driven by pricing and multi-beverage orders. The increase in average ticket in the US reflects how our innovative products and thoughtful promotions resonated with customers in our quest to offer enhanced value, indicating that our action plans are starting to take hold. Shifting to transactions. US posted a comparable transaction decline of 6%, primarily driven by non-SR members. Across SR customers, as Laxman shared, we saw improved frequency across all deciles. Mobile Order & Pay in the US remained strong in the quarter with positive year-over-year total transaction growth of 7% as customers continue to value both the experience and convenience of the Mobile Order & Pay channel. As we open our app for all with MOP Guest Checkout, which launched earlier this month, we expect to create and deliver value across a broader population, expanding our universe of known customers to deepen engagement, driving increased frequency and spend. In addition to strong SR program growth in the US, we saw strong SR program growth in China. SR members grew to a record 22 million 90-day active members in China. And in June, we also enhanced the program through extending rewards and introducing new diamond tier, which provides exclusive benefits to our most loyal SR members. We're pleased with the SR member growth across both the US and China and expect to see the benefit from this growth in future quarters as new members provide a longer-term benefit. Shifting to margin. Our Q3 consolidated operating margin contracted 70 basis points from the prior year to 16.7%, primarily driven by increased promotional activities, investments in store partner wages and benefits as well as deleverage. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and our continued execution against reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, as well as out-of-store efficiencies, which primarily center around our supply-chain. As you've heard Laxman discuss, we're focused on improving operational execution and efficiencies, which is now more important than ever as we build resiliency in our business. Our efficiency efforts are built on creating sustainable improvements in our operations and end-to-end supply-chain, allowing us to both reinvest in our business and drive margin expansion. A testament to these efforts includes the achievement in excess of 200 basis points in year-over-year efficiency gains as of Q3 across both in-store and out-of-store areas, manifesting through our business in reduced store operating expenses and product and distribution costs respectively. Collectively, these line items represent approximately 85% of our annual spend. Our in-store focus, a combination of efficiencies and staffing and scheduling as well as enhancements in our store equipment and new store format design has fueled a reduction in partner turnover, creating greater stability in our stores. We believe that stability not only creates opportunity to nurture stronger connections with customers, but also increases productivity, which translated to roughly 110 basis-point improvement in store-operating expense in the quarter. Our efficiency focus also extends outside of the store as we've been taking a hard look across our supply-chain and other areas including G&A. As Laxman shared, we're working collaboratively with suppliers to identify opportunities to leverage our scale for cost reductions without compromising product quality or distribution timeliness, which led to meaningful savings in the quarter of approximately 100 basis points between rebates and rate savings. In addition, we believe our end-to-end supply-chain focus gives us the opportunity to increase inventory availability with the right products at the right time, enhancing the customer experience while reducing waste. As we've shared, G&A was elevated at more than 7% of revenue through Q2, as we have deliberately invested in resources to continue to grow our technology capability. We have, however, reduced G&A in Q3 and expect it to remain closer to 6% of revenue in the second half of this fiscal year as we balance investments for our long-term growth. When considering our progress this fiscal year, our in-store and out-of-store year-to-date efficiency efforts collectively amounted to nearly 300 basis points of margin improvement. Our significant efficiency runway, coupled with sales growth gives us confidence to drive margin expansion over time. Given this, we have ample opportunities to deliver above our initial goal of $3 billion, driving to $4 billion in efficiencies over the next four years. Q3 EPS was $0.93, down 6% from the prior year. The decline was driven largely by the cautious consumer environment, which in response drove increased promotions and marketing in the quarter, partially offset by our efficiency efforts. Additionally, our higher effective tax rate had a $0.03 unfavorable impact driven by fewer discrete items relative to the prior year. With segment results being discussed in detail in today's Q3 earnings release, I'll now touch on our capital allocation and financial resilience and then move into guidance. As a reminder, our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to drive financial flexibility, allowing us to continue to make the necessary investments in our business to drive long-term growth. Our new stores continue to be a meaningful part of our growth equation with approximately 85% of our CapEx allocated to our stores, both new stores and renovations. These high-return growth-oriented investments have superior economics, while adding incrementally to our business. Even with over 16,700 stores across the US and another 7,300 in China, we have abundant white space ahead, particularly as populations continue to move to more suburban and rural areas. Take a Tier-3 market in US, for example, a place like Japan, Missouri. A drive-through in that market boasts a year one ROI in excess of 65% with cash margins approaching 30% and a payback period of less than two years. Year-one AUVs reached approximately 2 million with opportunity ahead as we build out the trade area. Importantly, our new store revenue is highly incremental, adding an average of nearly 90% to the trade area attained by our world-class store development partners and their rigorous work that leverages AI-assisted strategic strike -- site selection process. We see that in China as well. Take a new county city, for example. We're in only about 900 of the nearly 3,000 across the market. Today, we see year-one ROI as high as 70% with cash margins averaging over 30% as we've successfully managed both store development and operating costs even in the current macroeconomic backdrop. We believe this is a great investment and accretive to shareholder value, building out the long-term opportunity. With our disciplined approach to capital allocation, underpinned by our strengthening store portfolio, we are reinforcing our financial resilience while remaining committed to our compelling dividend. We continue to target an earnings payout ratio of approximately 50% near the top end of growth companies of our size and scale, resulting in a significant portion of our earnings going directly back to our shareholders. And currently, we have maintained a leverage target below three times lease-adjusted EBITDA, ensuring a strong financial foundation and consistent with our investment-grade credit rating of BBB-plus, which allows us to continue to access capital efficiently. Collectively, our disciplined approach enables us to preserve both balance sheet strength and flexibility, positioning us to successfully navigate through the current macroeconomic environment. Moving to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. We are encouraged with our progress this quarter, and we're pleased to reaffirm all metrics of our full year 2024 guidance. Our confidence is underpinned by the result of our action plans, coupled with the continued efficiency unlocked both in and out of store. In summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, we are seeing progress against our action plans. Second, our efficiency efforts partially offset investments associated with the cautious consumer environment. Third, we believe our financial fortitude and disciplined capital allocation strategy positions us well for the long term. And last, our full year 2024 guidance remains intact. Before I close, I want to acknowledge all of our partners across the globe, working tirelessly each and every day to elevate the Starbucks experience in our stores, at our roasting plants and in our support centers. You are and always have been our superpower. Thank you, partners. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] In order to allow as many questions as possible, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question at a time. We will come back for follow-up questions as time allows. Your first question comes from Brian Harbour, Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon.\nLaxman Narasimhan: No, Brian.\nBrian Harbour: I wanted to ask a couple of things on kind of the margin and cost side. First of all, G&A, could you talk more about what actions were taken there? Do you still see that as kind of a source of leverage as we go into fiscal 2025? And then on the store side you're obviously generating quite a bit of efficiency. I think you alluded to reinvesting some of that. Where will that go? And then as we also kind of think to next year, is there some continued need for reinvestment, whether it's in labor or certain other things? Could you shed some more light on that?\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Thanks, Brian. Let me start with the G&A actions. So in the quarter, our G&A actually declined year-over-year by about 5%. And the drivers of that include performance-based compensation, so lower performance-based compensation, coupled with lapping over some foundation investments from the prior year. In addition to that, given the environment, we made some deliberate decisions to focus on cost efficiencies, which helped us offset some of the investments we've made in wages and benefits as well as the investments we've made in technology. We'll expect that to further into Q4. As we look to the out years, we will continue to drive leverage in our G&A as part of our overall efficiency focus and efforts. Now on the store side, you asked about reinvesting, where does that go? And as far as our in-store and out-of-store efficiencies, those investments largely this year have helped to support the promotional activities as well as the investments we've made in our partner wages and benefits. Now as we look towards next year, we'll continue on our path of efficiency efforts. Those efforts will help us to be able to unlock the capacity to be able to reinvest back into our business in a sundry of different areas, but it will also allow us to drive margin expansion. So, I think that answered all of your questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nSara Senatore: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the comp -- composition. So I think, Rachel, you mentioned average check benefited from multi-beverage orders, which I guess suggests that perhaps you're not seeing premiumization or customization anymore, but rather just increased group sizes? And then you also mentioned pricing. How much price you have year-over-year if you could give any color on that? And then the final piece, you talked about much lower promotional intensity or mix than what we see from some of your competitors. But I'm trying to understand how does that 14% compare perhaps to what Starbucks might have -- might have seen in the past? Thanks.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure, Sara. Thank you for the question. I'll start with the 4% check. So, in the US business, our transaction -- our ticket comp increased by 4%. And as I shared in my prepared remarks, that does include about 25% of it was related to beverage attach or multi-beverage orders in response to our promotional offers. So, it showed that our customers responded well to our offers. So, that's really the driver of it. We aren't seeing the customization and the personalization in the same way because our offers were much more targeted and driven around specific beverages as well as overall beverage attach. And so as a result of that, that drove the ticket in the quarter, but we were pleased with that because it shows that customers responded well to those offers. Now when we think about price year-over-year in that 4% ticket, I would say the remainder of the ticket, about 75% is really net price. That includes everything from pricing moves, including the increases that we took in California, coupled with the promotional offers. So, I'd say that's a net pricing impact on that 4%. And in terms of the promotional intensity, I'll turn it over to Laxman in a minute, but what I can say about the promotional environment is we've been very measured from a promotional standpoint given the fact that we have a premium positioning as our brand. And so the majority of our promotional efforts were focused on driving growth in our Starbucks Rewards membership because we know that those members tend to increase their value for us over the lifetime. It's a more efficient way for us to promote. And in the quarter, we were pleased with the fact that between the offers and the marketing activities, we were able to grow our Starbucks Rewards membership in the US as a result of that. We also saw traffic increase on days where we had offers as well as days where we had new product launches. So, that also gave us some encouragement just in terms of the effectiveness of our offers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Laxman.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Sara, just to build on the question that you asked in Rachel's response, the Starbucks brand is grounded in the idea that if you exceed the partner expectations, you will exceed the customer expectations. And it is in this experience that we deliver the premiumness of the brand. And when you look at the words worth it for the Starbucks experience, what we measure in our work and brand equity is not just about price, it is about the quality, the distinctive quality, the product customization that you mentioned, the consistency of the experience that we create both in stores and digitally, delivered at a price that customers believe is worth it when they come into the store to transact with us or when they transact with us across channels. Now one of the things that we have been very careful about is that given the premiumness of the brand, we've been very careful about the offers. And as Rachel said, it is at a lower intensity than it is for some of the other brands. What we've tried to do is focus on the Starbucks Rewards members. For our business, 60% of our revenue comes from the SR program and 40% comes from the non-SR program. And what we've found is that some of these offers that we have done, particularly for Starbucks Rewards members has helped drive engagement and incremental visits. We talked a bit about the fact that we've seen engagement go up in every decile of the Starbucks Rewards members. If I look at our non-SR customers, which is about 40% of it, what we've been working on is ensuring that we give them office to come in and become part of the SR program. Additionally, they have told us about a fourth of them tell us that they want the digital convenience, but they don't necessarily want to be part of the program. So, we've done things around how we open up the app for them to order and get the digital convenience. What we see over time is for the non-SR customers, we still have the opportunity to target price investments funded by the progress we're making in our efficiency program. And all the way brings it back to our three-part action plan in terms of what we're doing to continue to deliver the kind of premium experience Starbucks is about.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please state your question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. My question was on China. The headwinds, Laxman, as you mentioned, are seemingly large, the comps down 14%. I think you mentioned or just highlighted the ramp-in competition and the macro challenges and the price wars. But with that said, I know you mentioned exploring strategic partnerships and you've had partnerships in the past. Just curious if you could provide some more color. I know in the past, the Board has evaluated alternatives such as the licensing of China, similar to other multinational QSRs, which would kind of allow you to participate in the growth, but mitigate the volatility and reduce your capital needs. So, I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on that, whether that was kind of the reference you made earlier, maybe some of the pros and cons as you contemplate the potential for those strategic alternatives such as licensing? Any color would be great. Thank you.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Jeff, thanks so much. We've built a distinctive business in China with both the Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve brands that are relatively more premium relative to what we have in the market. And we've got 60,000 partners, 19,000 of them who are black aprons and coffee. And so the depth of coffee expertise we have is tremendous. Additionally, as we look at the really long term the potential in this business is amazing. I mean, we've essentially very early days given the per-caps we see in the headroom that it provides. So the stores, the brand, the partners, the supply-chain, the digital presence we have, all are distinctive advantages. But as you rightfully said, there's been quite a change in the competitive environment. And we've been very entrepreneurial. I mean, 25 years ago when [indiscernible] went to China, we've created a specialty coffee industry from pretty much nowhere. And we've been very entrepreneurial and we've looked at various ways of making that happen, including joint ventures and partnerships -- strategic partnerships in technology, real estate and supply-chain. We're frankly at the very early stages of this. And so I don't want to necessarily comment specifically on any one option versus another, but we're in the early stages and we recognize that what we want to be sure of is that we're -- we are further strengthening our advantage in this market because the long-term opportunity for us is significant. And we will update you as we as we -- as we make progress on this effort in terms of exploring these strategic partnerships.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please state your question.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you. I think you guys mentioned that traffic was down 6% in the US and the majority of that was due to the non-rewards customers, which makes up, call it, 40% of your business. That's a pretty substantial decline in that customer base -- probably a double-digit decline in that customer base. So, can you just talk a little bit about where you think these customers are going and why is it that there is such a steep decline in this customer count in just this segment? Thank you very much.\nLaxman Narasimhan: So first of all, I think we are operating in a challenging consumer environment. You see the impact of that in away from home consumption. If you look at our business at home for grocery stores with our brands, you're seeing volume increase, you're seeing share increase in a category that's in decline, but we're seeing volume increase at home. In our ready-to-drink business, we're seeing clearly that there has some challenges, but with the work that our joint-venture team is doing, we're seeing progress there. But away from home consumption, you see the impact of the challenging consumer environment. What we're focused on is what is it that we can do to control what we have. And so the Starbucks Rewards members, you see greater engagement, that is 60% of our revenue. Clearly, if you look at the sort of lower deciles of the Starbucks Rewards program, we see opportunity even there for them to increase their visitations. But if I look at what we're seeing with our non-SR customers, we still maintain the number one position in terms of coffee shops visited from the research that we do internally and for the equity work we've done. So, I think that this is a statement around the overall environment. We know that there are things that we can do in order to communicate value better to our non-SR customers, which is why we've opened up the app for all starting this quarter. And once they come in and once they see what's happening inside the convenience of the mobile auto-pay channel, they will get exposed to what we have inside the app. And we know that we have an opportunity as we look at the end-to-end efficiencies that we can get in our supply-chain that we can target price investments in those areas that will help them realize the price proposition that we have overall. If you really step back and look at us, we've been very disciplined over the last many years. We've taken less pricing than many, but we also recognize the environment we're operating in is challenged. And so, I think what you'll see us do is be measured in the way we do this and do it through the app and target price investments where appropriate, leveraging off the efficiency work that Rachel spoke about.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi. Please state your question.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess maybe first a clarification on the question. Rachel, you mentioned the $4 billion in savings. Just want to ensure that that's a gross or net number. And then I guess maybe going to the Siren stations that you've talked about, I know you're still on track to get 40% or less than 40% done in North America by the end of fiscal 2026. Can you talk about what you're seeing with respect to returns? And what's the impediment to accelerating that type of remodel schedule picking it up, say, instead of less than 40% by the end of 2026, picking that up to 50%, 60% or pulling forward more to current fiscal 2025, say.\nRachel Ruggeri: Jon, I'll start with on the $4 billion of savings over the next four years, that is a net number. So, we have obviously a larger gross number to ensure that we can deliver on that. So that's the way I think about the savings.\nLaxman Narasimhan: On your second question on the Siren Craft -- on the Siren systems and the equipment deployment, well, firstly, we've deployed the process improvements across all our stores in the US this week. This has been very well received, the inclusive of the new routines, the training, the beverage bills, the partner investments that we will see transaction impact with that. Now, we have matched our Siren system equipment rollouts with the renovations of store bills because of the returns that that gives us. But it's not stopping us from actually using those Siren system equipment in order for us to debottleneck these outlier stores. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with the work we've done with Deep Brew and the analytics that we have, there were 10% of our stores that have the highest customer service outages. For these 10% stores that is less than 1,000, right, there's work going on store by store. And what we're doing store by store is to look to see this combination of process improvements, how we run the stores as well as looking at a renovation cycle to potentially resequence them in order for us to bring the Siren systems in an accelerated fashion to help us debottleneck these stores. Now later this quarter, we're going to start rolling out a couple of things that will help us attack some of the bottleneck areas we see. For example, with this retrofit to our espresso machines, a same quality, higher throughput, we're going to see the rollout start to over 6,000 espresso-constrained stores starting next quarter. We're doing the same thing with some of the software changes we're making around food and how we drive throughput there. So, these are targeted sequenced efforts that will have high impact on those stores with the greatest constraints. You will see Clover Vertica being all stores by the end of financial year 2025. So, we're going at this, not just waiting for the whole system, but looking at portions of it that we can bring in in a more accelerated fashion in order for us to drive throughput in the stores.\nRachel Ruggeri: If I would just add one more point to that is, I think it's important to note that the Siren system, the equipment is a major overhaul to our overall stores, our engine. It requires quite a bit of CapEx as well as quite a bit of change management. So, we intentionally leverage the renovation and new store process because it allows us to optimize the costs while take advantage of downtime. So that's also an important note in terms of how we've been thoughtful about how we roll these systems out more broadly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please state your question. Sharon Zackfia, your line is open. Please unmute yourself. All right. We'll move on to the next question. And our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please state your question.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on the US business. A lot of encouraging commentary about some of the internal metrics you're seeing in the business there. But I was hoping maybe you could talk about how that's translating to sales performance and whether you're already starting to see sales responding to some of the progress you're making and maybe more specifically, if you expect the fourth quarter comp growth or transaction growth in the US or North America to be better than what you saw in the third quarter? Thanks.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Let me start with the three-part action plan that we had in place. The first one was fixing our stores. And I think that we're making strong progress here. And so if you just look at examples of MOP, the growth rate we had quarter-over-quarter, which was a -- sorry, year-over-year, which was a 10% growth. The uptime that we had in MOP, obviously, big improvements. So, that's an example of the kind of improvements that we're seeing. Our drive-throughs are more efficient. I mean, the multi-second improvements we've seen clearly translate as well into our ability to meet the demand that we have. The product innovations, we touched on some of those that we have and the impact of those, the Summer-Berry Refreshers, the highest sales we've ever had in the launch week leading to the refresher platform reaching 18% of sales. So, examples over there and also the work we're doing with our SR program, an increase in number and increasing the engagement of these. So, those are all the -- all the metrics that we have in terms of the kind of improvements that we're seeing against three-part action plan. As we look ahead into this quarter and we look at, for example, July, what you see in July is the fact that we are seeing shifts in routines in July. We normally see that from a seasonality perspective, but I think we've seen more pronouncements -- more pronounced changes in the routines in July in addition to some of the tech outages that have impacted people across industries. And so, we see the disruptions, for example, in the airport stores that I mentioned or the hospitality stores where we're seeing strong growth. And so what I would say to you is that our guidance does, at the end of the day, reflect the challenging consumer environment and what we expect the comps to be flat to low-single digit for the year. But what I expect is that these actions that we're putting in place will position us stronger to see growth in FY 2025.\nRachel Ruggeri: And just to remind that comp guidance range is a low-single-digit decline to flat.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please state your question.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, can you hear me now?\nRachel Ruggeri: Yes,\nLaxman Narasimhan: Yes, we can.\nSharon Zackfia: Okay, perfect. I felt like a Verizon commercial. I wanted to ask, I know you gave the kind of returns you're seeing in US new stores as well as in China. But I think with the weakness you're seeing in comps, it kind of begs the question of how committed you are to this kind of global rate of expansion in the 7% to 8% range for company-owned stores.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Well, I'll just make a comment and then hand it to Rachel specifically. So first of all, we're not chasing a number. We look at every project that we have, every site and we look at the incremental returns, the incrementality of the business that it brings and we're entirely driven by ROI. And we see the strong cash-on-cash returns in the US. Rachel spoke to the kind of cash-on-cash returns we're seeing in the Tier-2 and Tier-3 markets where the headroom is large for us. I mean, we're underpenetrated in those markets. And so if you look at the pipeline of real estate investments in the US, they've really targeted Tier-2, Tier-3 mostly. And the work we've done to Deep Brew to identify the sites, to ensure that we build, there's clearly work that's going into how we ensure that the returns we get in these sites are strong. In a very similar way in China, if you look at the cash-on-cash returns that we're getting in the lower-tier cities that we're expanding in, the cash returns are strong. So, we're not really chasing a number. We're chasing a return. And where we see incrementality, where we see returns, we will invest.\nRachel Ruggeri: The only thing I would add to that is just given the fact that we do see these strong returns and the incremental nature to our overall business, we see the vast opportunity. We have a very rigorous site selection process. We also have an ability to be able to monitor overall performance. And the combination of all of that allows us to strengthen our portfolio through the growth of new stores. So, we see it as an important part of our overall long-term growth algorithm. But I think what's important in what Laxman said is it really comes down to ensuring that we keep monitoring the overall economics. And as long as we see the kind of returns we see today, then it supports our long-term growth ambitions.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Please state your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. We generally have the perception that, the US is the leading market for Starbucks around the world. And certainly, it is in terms of total sales. But my question was as you look around the world in Latin America, in Europe, in Asia, and a lot of markets really are competitive and have challenging consumer environments, what have you. Is there anything that you can point to that are -- is being done particularly well in any of these markets from a food, from a service, from a beverage perspective that maybe can be some tangible leading indicators that we can start to get excited about as we think about fiscal 2025 and 2026 innovation past what you've already done? Thank you.\nLaxman Narasimhan: I'll just point to our business in Japan, it's been growing double-digits, a terrific round of innovation, a great execution in stores, strengthened digital presence and a brand that really celebrates the coffee house in Japan. I think if you look around the world, we have pockets of these pretty much everywhere. It may not necessarily be uniformly the case, but pretty much everywhere. We have examples of our brand, the experience that we deliver, the products that we bring to bear, the speed of innovation that we have. And by the way, even in pockets in China, we have amazing stories of these in the US too. So, I think that there is a broad set of examples that we constantly look at to learn from and find ways of scaling around the world and that's what we mean at the heart of truly going global, which is our third imperative in our triple shot strategy, it is a way for us to share best practices across the world.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\nChristine Cho: Yes, thank you. So, you've made some significant investments into staffing, scheduling and partner wage and benefits over the years and it does seem like it's making very good progress so far. But I was wondering if there are any major areas you see incremental opportunities. And just adding on to that, on one hand, you have the goals to improve the cost efficiencies and productivity. But on the other, you will continue to focus on partner and customer experience. So, just curious to your thoughts as to how you strike a balance here. Thank you.\nLaxman Narasimhan: I feel very good about the progress we are making on delivering a more stable partner experience in our stores in the US. I think if I just look at the average hours per partner, where we are, it's -- it's reached a real high -- a historic high. So, I feel good about that. I think part of what we are looking to continue to do is how we ensure we simplify in the stores, how we simplify our menus, how we simplify our beverage bills, how we simplify in our supply-chain, what happens upstream versus downstream and how we focus on training, how we ensure more consistency in the experiences that we deliver. And the Siren Craft system is a great example of this. Some of the stories we've heard as we've rolled this out over the course of -- over the last several weeks, including this week across all our network, is just what it's doing in terms of the partner reception and the positivity we hear from partners, including what they say about their ability to connect with customers and also deliver a more personal experience in stores. So, it's clearly -- this is the sort of thing that we have to do and just continue to make the right investments to deliver the right partner experience in order to exceed the customer expectations that I know a premium brand like ours is all about.\nOperator: Thank you. The last question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you. I wanted to go back and look at some of the products and the value strategies from April through July. There's -- you were very active with some of the new products and they would be something beyond the coffee core, they would be things that you would think would drive not just the strong trial that you say, but incremental traffic to your business. And I know you were going to dial up some value marketing, maybe you confirm if you felt like you did that. But I'm wondering what do you think worked particularly well, not just in the first trial week or two, but on a more sustaining basis from that in these initiatives, including the value and the new products? And in light of the traffic decline of 6%, I'm wondering what do you think we\u2019re really the offsets? Has there been some decline in the coffee core or is there a daypart, or how should we think about offsets to these things that you're doing? Thanks very much.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you, David. Let me just first start with coffee. Right? I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we've gone to one additional point on Cold. So, it's now 76%. Obviously, that's seasonal, but it's 76%. If you look at our espresso business, that's grown 4%. So, espresso drinks are up 4%. So, coffee has grown. And our distinctiveness is in coffee and I think you'll see that in the kind of innovations and new products we bring in, including the launch of Milano Duetto towards the end of this quarter. So, coffee is core to who we are, distinctive in terms of breadth of what we bring and the products will obviously have that. I think one of the things we did talk about was the fact that afternoons are an opportunity for us. And as we look at these new platforms of what we have launched, if I look at Pearls, for example, it was significantly ahead of what we thought it would be to the point where we ran out of supply. And I think that it wasn't a supply issue necessarily, but it was more, the demand was ahead of what we thought it would be. We had to pull back marketing, and my sense is that as you look at what we now have in our stores, they're back in stores with new products and it's a platform that we will continue to build over time. So, we're not just launching a product, we're launching platforms. The energy platform we've been in the energy business since 2007 with the launch of Doubleshot and Triple Shot Espresso. What we now have is we have a zero-calorie energy platform that we are scaling and it's building steadily and will be something that we're committed to over time. If you look at some of our food innovations like the Egg, Mozzarella, Pesto sandwich as an example, it's a terrific sandwich. And again, it's one that's going to join our core, but it's building systematically over time. We still have work to do on supply, around how we ensure stability and reliability of supply, particularly in food in order to get the kind of service that we're going to need across our 10,000 stores with the products that we launch. So, that's an opportunity, David, that I think we still have and the team is working very hard along with our suppliers in order to make that happen.\nOperator: Thank you. That was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Laxman Narasimhan for closing remarks. Thank you.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you all for the time today. If you take away one thing, let it be this. We are making real progress on our three-part plan. We are focused on what we can control in a consumer environment that can be best be described as complex. Our teams are moving to the urgency. I thank them for their efforts and for staying focused on what we can control. I have full confidence in the long-term potential of Starbucks worldwide. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Starbucks' Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Laxman Narasimhan",
            "content": "Thank you, Tiffany. And thank you for joining us this afternoon. Let me start by laying out our results for this quarter. Our Q3 total company revenue was $9.1 billion, up 1% year-over-year and 6% over Q2. Our global comparable store sales declined 3% year-over-year, driven by a negative 2% comp growth in North America and a negative 14% comp growth in China and partially offset by strong performance in Japan. Our global operating margins contracted by 70 basis points to 16.7% and overall earnings per share for the quarter was $0.93. Our total company results were in line with guidance, but international performance, particularly in China was challenged. We are not satisfied with the results, but our actions are making an impact. Leading business and operational indicators are trending in the right direction ahead of our financial results and our runway for improvement is long. We see green shoots in our US business driven by the three-part action plan outlined last quarter. First, meet and unlock capacity for new demand through a relentless focus and improvements to our US store operations and on elevating the experience we create for our partners and customers. Second, attract new customers and drive transaction growth by launching and integrating more exciting new products with relevant marketing, while maintaining our focus on core coffee forward offerings. And third, reach new customers and demonstrate our value by making sure customers believe that Starbucks experience is worth it every time. First, our largest opportunity, meet and unlock capacity for new demand. A relentless focus on improving operational execution across our nearly 10,000 US company operated stores is the cornerstone of our near-term plan. While it is early days of progress, our plan is working. If you walk away from today's call with one thought, let it be the significant changes and long-term upside potential taking place within our US stores and across our end-to-end supply-chain to unlock growth, enhance the customer experience and drive cost efficiencies. Within our stores, we've seen material positive momentum across core store health and performance metrics with notable improvements in partner scheduling and turnover, critical store issues and inventory management. Stores ranked in our top two operational performance quartiles reached a new high during the quarter, a 28% upwards shift from Q2, but we have more opportunity. Our focus on operational excellence, driven by a reinvention plan has led to a multi-second year-over-year improvement in out-of-the-window times, a nearly 50% reduction in calls received via customer contact center for my order took too long and Mobile Order & Pay and delivery uptime rates of 99%. These are key indicators of our work to drive growth by addressing customer wait times, product availability and the customer experience. This quarter, we also introduced Phase 1 of our Siren Craft systems, which includes several process and partner-driven enhancements to our US store operations. Changes include a new peak time play caller role, strategic investments in partner hours, training, new routines, simple enhancements to technology and an evolved beverage build process. Early deployment across 1,200 stores demonstrated a material incremental improvement across key performance, throughput, efficiency and reliability metrics. Encouraged by this, we fully deployed Siren Craft systems process improvements across our entire portfolio of US company operated stores this week. Later this quarter, we will begin rolling out a simple refit to our espresso machines, which we expect to improve espresso throughput by up to 15% without compromising quality. And with a minor software change in our store production systems, we have a similar ability to improve food throughput. When paired with Siren system equipment announced as part of our reinvention plan, these new processes become a forced multiplier that we expect to drive a true step-change improvement. Early assessments demonstrate the capability to drive a 10-second to 20-second wait time reduction and a resulting comp opportunity range of 1% to 1.5%. Leveraging our Deep Brew analytics platform, we have identified customer experience outlier stores, approximately 10% of our network and have developed targeted plans to address and improve them, including accelerated Siren system deployment. Similarly, we are accelerating the pace of our new-store builds and renovations with 580 net new builds and more than 800 renovations planned in North America for FY 2024. Store development efforts are focused on Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities where we see population growth and forecast both underserved demand and high incrementality. Increasingly, these new-store builds and renovations also include Siren system equipment. In line with prior guidance, we remain on track to deploy equipment in less than 10% of company operated stores by the end of FY 2024 and about 40% by the end of FY 2026. Building on our pilot, Starbucks and Gopuff have agreed to terms for an expanded relationship to open 100 delivery-only kitchens across the US. We're also accelerating the rollout of digital storyboards with target deployment across most US stores in the next two years, a year earlier than originally anticipated. Lastly, we are working on other ways to enhance the cafe experience. This includes new and expanded seating options that elevate many stores, while upholding a safe and inviting place for partners and customers. A key outcome of our operational efforts has been material and sustained improvements to the partner experience. Driven by precision partner-centric staffing and scheduling efforts, we ended the quarter with a new post-pandemic low partner turnover rate, the best shift completion rate in two years and a 13% improvement in average hours per partner, now the highest on record. These initiatives create more stability in our stores, provide more predictability for our partners and sustain our experienced flywheel. Looking beyond our stores, we continue to realize new efficiencies, cost savings and performance improvements across our end-to-end supply chain, thanks to strong support from our suppliers and we see even more headroom. We have a structured process to realize significant continued improvements across our end-to-end supply chain. We are ahead of plan on productivity. We expect our productivity to drive efficiency and unlock capital from areas that don't touch the customer. In turn, these savings will enable us to target investments that drive value for our customers beginning later in Q4, reigniting our North America flywheel for growth. We are early days on this journey, building both our strategic sourcing and revenue management capabilities. Our second priority is to drive demand through relevant product innovation with coffee at our core. We've seen meaningful improvement here as well. This quarter, we drove traffic into our stores through an engaging and innovative pipeline of products supported by integrated marketing campaigns. Cold share was up 1% year-over-year, representing 76% of our beverage mix through the quarter. Our newly formulated iced coffee received positive feedback. Our strength in Cold espresso innovation continued to drive the platform's growth, up 4% year-over-year. And we launched Starbuck's Milano Duetto whole bean coffee in Milan, ahead of a global launch this October. Beyond coffee, our new Summer-Berry Starbucks Refreshers beverages with Pearls drove the highest week one product launch in our history. Their success buoyed the entire Starbucks Refreshers beverage platform to an all-time high during the quarter. As mentioned in Q2, we continue to build out our 24-month product pipeline, while accelerating our pace of innovation. For example, recognize the growing appeal and opportunity created by the energy category, we launched a new hand-crafted iced energy beverages across our US stores in just three months compared to a normal 12 to 18. Looking forward, we believe our Q4 product offerings, including the return of pumpkin spice, combined with supporting marketing activities and offers, provides the right formula to drive customer interest, demand and deeper engagement with both new and existing customers. Our third and final near-term priority is to reach new customers and demonstrate the value we offer by ensuring the Starbucks experience is worth it every time. Recognizing the premium position of our brand, we've been measured in our use of offers. During this quarter, only 14% of our transactions were driven by offers compared to a competitor average of 29%. Of offer-driven transactions, 10% were star-based offers targeted to Starbucks Rewards members. Only 4% were driven by five -- by price-based offers. Our best offers are in the app. Together, offers and other integrated marketing activities when paired with exciting product innovation, successfully grew Starbucks Rewards membership, reactivated many lapsed Rewards members and drove customer traffic on promotional days and product launch weeks. Active US Starbucks Rewards members grew to 33.8 million during the quarter. Members across every decile increased the frequency of their visits. We're focused on the continued growth of the program because the average active member spends materially more annually and drives a higher life-time value for the business than a non-member. Research also tells us that the most inactive Starbucks Rewards members don't realize they've lapsed. This demonstrates a continued opportunity to drive return visits, active member growth and deeper customer loyalty. Looking forward, we will continue to use more targeted offers, coupled with select pricing actions funded by efficiency initiatives to drive traffic and conversion. We plan to leverage a mix of paid media, acquisition and retention offers, disruptive signage and partner education to drive transactions and increase the frequency of visits with a focus on product launches and continued Starbucks Rewards member growth. It's worth remembering the ubiquity of the Starbucks brand and our ability to intercept customers. For instance, our business is up 13% in airports and up 9% in hotels, pointing to these trends. Leveraging our brand and our ability to intercept customers while demonstrating value, not just in price but through a premium experience remains a sizable opportunity across our entire store portfolio. Moving on to digital. As part of our action plan, we made continued improvements to our Starbucks app, including wait time algorithm enhancements that have improved order-ready accuracy by nearly 50 percentage points. This combined with in-app offers helped drive a 10% year-over-year growth in Mobile Order & Pay revenue, a 7% year-over-year increase in MOP transactions. Looking deeper, our data shows that one in four non-Starbucks Rewards members want the ability to use Mobile Order & Pay. Nearly 80% of those customers don't want to join a Rewards program or create an account to do it. In response, we opened MOP for all to provide those customers the convenience they seek, while removing perceived barriers to entry. We believe these enhancements to the digital experience, coupled with more effortless ordering will continue to drive Starbucks Rewards membership over time with customers increasing frequency and spend. Once customers are in our digital ecosystem, they're more likely to remain engaged across channels and drive greater lifetime value. In summary, our plans are beginning to work. We are recovering our brand from its perceptions. We're rebuilding the operational foundation of our stores and supply-chain. We're reducing costs to support investments. We're sustaining partner experience improvements and we're working to make the Starbucks experience worth it every time. While it's early days, I'm confident in the trajectory of our US business and the operational improvements we're making. And I'm reassured by the impact our work is expected to deliver in FY 2025 and beyond. Looking outside the US, we continue to see weakness in parts of our international business and strength in others. Headwinds persist in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, parts of Europe, driven by widely discussed misperceptions about our brand. In some European markets, consumers are stretched. At the same time, we see significant strength in markets like Japan and parts of Latin America. China is one of our most notable international challenges and an area I'd like to talk about in more detail. The competitive market dynamics in China are reflected in our recent results. We continue to face a more cautious consumer spending and intensified competition. In the past year, unprecedented store expansion and a mass segment price war at the expense of comp and profitability have also caused significant disruptions to the operating environment. Still, we have made progress in important areas. Through Q3, metrics like average daily transactions, weekly sales and operating margin improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Starbucks Rewards members grew by 1.6 million to a record high 22 million active members and customer connection scores reached a new high, while partner turnover reached a new low. We've built an amazing business in China over the past 25 years, a business for China built by an outstanding local team. We've pioneered the growth of the premium coffee industry in market with our Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve brands and brand equity remains distinctive. We have incredibly committed and expert partners with an unmatched depth in coffee and craft. Our stores are distinctive and industry leading and our supply-chain is world class. New stores have expanded our presence to more than 900 county cities and continue to drive exceptional cash-on-cash returns and a payback of less than two years. We're looking beyond near-term challenges and towards long-term opportunities in the market. We built Starbucks in China around three principles. A great customer experience is grounded in a great partner experience. Our coffee will always be distinctive and high quality with low penetration relative to other markets, which provides continued headroom. Our beautiful stores will celebrate the culture and traditions of China and their local communities. Even in a challenging market, we have stayed true to these principles and our relative premium positioning. This is reflective in the competitive margins we have sustained in the face of price competition. Over the past 25 years, we've gone through different phases of growth in China and have relied on different strategic partnerships to grow our business and capabilities, like joint ventures and strategic partnerships in technology, real estate and supply-chain. As we look forward, we see higher growth and margin opportunities in China. We're building the next generation of Starbucks grounded in our premium brands and with a business that is even more digital, innovative and locally relevant. To do so, as our strategy evolves, we are in the early stages of exploring strategic partnerships to further enhance our competitive position to accelerate growth and innovate to win in the long term in China. We remain completely committed to our business and our partners in China for the next 25 years and beyond. The long-term opportunity for us is significant. Before I close, I would like to confirm that Elliott Management is a shareholder in our company and our conversations to date have been constructive. On the business, my continued confidence is rooted in the focus, energy and effort of our partners across the business and around the globe. Our growing culture of focused innovation and relentless execution continues to enhance our capabilities, operational muscle and executional discipline, driving forward our action plan and our long-term triple shot strategy, while helping return the business to sustainable algorithmic growth. And with that, I'll turn this over to Rachel. No, Brian. Sara, just to build on the question that you asked in Rachel's response, the Starbucks brand is grounded in the idea that if you exceed the partner expectations, you will exceed the customer expectations. And it is in this experience that we deliver the premiumness of the brand. And when you look at the words worth it for the Starbucks experience, what we measure in our work and brand equity is not just about price, it is about the quality, the distinctive quality, the product customization that you mentioned, the consistency of the experience that we create both in stores and digitally, delivered at a price that customers believe is worth it when they come into the store to transact with us or when they transact with us across channels. Now one of the things that we have been very careful about is that given the premiumness of the brand, we've been very careful about the offers. And as Rachel said, it is at a lower intensity than it is for some of the other brands. What we've tried to do is focus on the Starbucks Rewards members. For our business, 60% of our revenue comes from the SR program and 40% comes from the non-SR program. And what we've found is that some of these offers that we have done, particularly for Starbucks Rewards members has helped drive engagement and incremental visits. We talked a bit about the fact that we've seen engagement go up in every decile of the Starbucks Rewards members. If I look at our non-SR customers, which is about 40% of it, what we've been working on is ensuring that we give them office to come in and become part of the SR program. Additionally, they have told us about a fourth of them tell us that they want the digital convenience, but they don't necessarily want to be part of the program. So, we've done things around how we open up the app for them to order and get the digital convenience. What we see over time is for the non-SR customers, we still have the opportunity to target price investments funded by the progress we're making in our efficiency program. And all the way brings it back to our three-part action plan in terms of what we're doing to continue to deliver the kind of premium experience Starbucks is about. Jeff, thanks so much. We've built a distinctive business in China with both the Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve brands that are relatively more premium relative to what we have in the market. And we've got 60,000 partners, 19,000 of them who are black aprons and coffee. And so the depth of coffee expertise we have is tremendous. Additionally, as we look at the really long term the potential in this business is amazing. I mean, we've essentially very early days given the per-caps we see in the headroom that it provides. So the stores, the brand, the partners, the supply-chain, the digital presence we have, all are distinctive advantages. But as you rightfully said, there's been quite a change in the competitive environment. And we've been very entrepreneurial. I mean, 25 years ago when [indiscernible] went to China, we've created a specialty coffee industry from pretty much nowhere. And we've been very entrepreneurial and we've looked at various ways of making that happen, including joint ventures and partnerships -- strategic partnerships in technology, real estate and supply-chain. We're frankly at the very early stages of this. And so I don't want to necessarily comment specifically on any one option versus another, but we're in the early stages and we recognize that what we want to be sure of is that we're -- we are further strengthening our advantage in this market because the long-term opportunity for us is significant. And we will update you as we as we -- as we make progress on this effort in terms of exploring these strategic partnerships. So first of all, I think we are operating in a challenging consumer environment. You see the impact of that in away from home consumption. If you look at our business at home for grocery stores with our brands, you're seeing volume increase, you're seeing share increase in a category that's in decline, but we're seeing volume increase at home. In our ready-to-drink business, we're seeing clearly that there has some challenges, but with the work that our joint-venture team is doing, we're seeing progress there. But away from home consumption, you see the impact of the challenging consumer environment. What we're focused on is what is it that we can do to control what we have. And so the Starbucks Rewards members, you see greater engagement, that is 60% of our revenue. Clearly, if you look at the sort of lower deciles of the Starbucks Rewards program, we see opportunity even there for them to increase their visitations. But if I look at what we're seeing with our non-SR customers, we still maintain the number one position in terms of coffee shops visited from the research that we do internally and for the equity work we've done. So, I think that this is a statement around the overall environment. We know that there are things that we can do in order to communicate value better to our non-SR customers, which is why we've opened up the app for all starting this quarter. And once they come in and once they see what's happening inside the convenience of the mobile auto-pay channel, they will get exposed to what we have inside the app. And we know that we have an opportunity as we look at the end-to-end efficiencies that we can get in our supply-chain that we can target price investments in those areas that will help them realize the price proposition that we have overall. If you really step back and look at us, we've been very disciplined over the last many years. We've taken less pricing than many, but we also recognize the environment we're operating in is challenged. And so, I think what you'll see us do is be measured in the way we do this and do it through the app and target price investments where appropriate, leveraging off the efficiency work that Rachel spoke about. On your second question on the Siren Craft -- on the Siren systems and the equipment deployment, well, firstly, we've deployed the process improvements across all our stores in the US this week. This has been very well received, the inclusive of the new routines, the training, the beverage bills, the partner investments that we will see transaction impact with that. Now, we have matched our Siren system equipment rollouts with the renovations of store bills because of the returns that that gives us. But it's not stopping us from actually using those Siren system equipment in order for us to debottleneck these outlier stores. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with the work we've done with Deep Brew and the analytics that we have, there were 10% of our stores that have the highest customer service outages. For these 10% stores that is less than 1,000, right, there's work going on store by store. And what we're doing store by store is to look to see this combination of process improvements, how we run the stores as well as looking at a renovation cycle to potentially resequence them in order for us to bring the Siren systems in an accelerated fashion to help us debottleneck these stores. Now later this quarter, we're going to start rolling out a couple of things that will help us attack some of the bottleneck areas we see. For example, with this retrofit to our espresso machines, a same quality, higher throughput, we're going to see the rollout start to over 6,000 espresso-constrained stores starting next quarter. We're doing the same thing with some of the software changes we're making around food and how we drive throughput there. So, these are targeted sequenced efforts that will have high impact on those stores with the greatest constraints. You will see Clover Vertica being all stores by the end of financial year 2025. So, we're going at this, not just waiting for the whole system, but looking at portions of it that we can bring in in a more accelerated fashion in order for us to drive throughput in the stores. Let me start with the three-part action plan that we had in place. The first one was fixing our stores. And I think that we're making strong progress here. And so if you just look at examples of MOP, the growth rate we had quarter-over-quarter, which was a -- sorry, year-over-year, which was a 10% growth. The uptime that we had in MOP, obviously, big improvements. So, that's an example of the kind of improvements that we're seeing. Our drive-throughs are more efficient. I mean, the multi-second improvements we've seen clearly translate as well into our ability to meet the demand that we have. The product innovations, we touched on some of those that we have and the impact of those, the Summer-Berry Refreshers, the highest sales we've ever had in the launch week leading to the refresher platform reaching 18% of sales. So, examples over there and also the work we're doing with our SR program, an increase in number and increasing the engagement of these. So, those are all the -- all the metrics that we have in terms of the kind of improvements that we're seeing against three-part action plan. As we look ahead into this quarter and we look at, for example, July, what you see in July is the fact that we are seeing shifts in routines in July. We normally see that from a seasonality perspective, but I think we've seen more pronouncements -- more pronounced changes in the routines in July in addition to some of the tech outages that have impacted people across industries. And so, we see the disruptions, for example, in the airport stores that I mentioned or the hospitality stores where we're seeing strong growth. And so what I would say to you is that our guidance does, at the end of the day, reflect the challenging consumer environment and what we expect the comps to be flat to low-single digit for the year. But what I expect is that these actions that we're putting in place will position us stronger to see growth in FY 2025. Yes, we can. Well, I'll just make a comment and then hand it to Rachel specifically. So first of all, we're not chasing a number. We look at every project that we have, every site and we look at the incremental returns, the incrementality of the business that it brings and we're entirely driven by ROI. And we see the strong cash-on-cash returns in the US. Rachel spoke to the kind of cash-on-cash returns we're seeing in the Tier-2 and Tier-3 markets where the headroom is large for us. I mean, we're underpenetrated in those markets. And so if you look at the pipeline of real estate investments in the US, they've really targeted Tier-2, Tier-3 mostly. And the work we've done to Deep Brew to identify the sites, to ensure that we build, there's clearly work that's going into how we ensure that the returns we get in these sites are strong. In a very similar way in China, if you look at the cash-on-cash returns that we're getting in the lower-tier cities that we're expanding in, the cash returns are strong. So, we're not really chasing a number. We're chasing a return. And where we see incrementality, where we see returns, we will invest. I'll just point to our business in Japan, it's been growing double-digits, a terrific round of innovation, a great execution in stores, strengthened digital presence and a brand that really celebrates the coffee house in Japan. I think if you look around the world, we have pockets of these pretty much everywhere. It may not necessarily be uniformly the case, but pretty much everywhere. We have examples of our brand, the experience that we deliver, the products that we bring to bear, the speed of innovation that we have. And by the way, even in pockets in China, we have amazing stories of these in the US too. So, I think that there is a broad set of examples that we constantly look at to learn from and find ways of scaling around the world and that's what we mean at the heart of truly going global, which is our third imperative in our triple shot strategy, it is a way for us to share best practices across the world. I feel very good about the progress we are making on delivering a more stable partner experience in our stores in the US. I think if I just look at the average hours per partner, where we are, it's -- it's reached a real high -- a historic high. So, I feel good about that. I think part of what we are looking to continue to do is how we ensure we simplify in the stores, how we simplify our menus, how we simplify our beverage bills, how we simplify in our supply-chain, what happens upstream versus downstream and how we focus on training, how we ensure more consistency in the experiences that we deliver. And the Siren Craft system is a great example of this. Some of the stories we've heard as we've rolled this out over the course of -- over the last several weeks, including this week across all our network, is just what it's doing in terms of the partner reception and the positivity we hear from partners, including what they say about their ability to connect with customers and also deliver a more personal experience in stores. So, it's clearly -- this is the sort of thing that we have to do and just continue to make the right investments to deliver the right partner experience in order to exceed the customer expectations that I know a premium brand like ours is all about. Thank you, David. Let me just first start with coffee. Right? I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we've gone to one additional point on Cold. So, it's now 76%. Obviously, that's seasonal, but it's 76%. If you look at our espresso business, that's grown 4%. So, espresso drinks are up 4%. So, coffee has grown. And our distinctiveness is in coffee and I think you'll see that in the kind of innovations and new products we bring in, including the launch of Milano Duetto towards the end of this quarter. So, coffee is core to who we are, distinctive in terms of breadth of what we bring and the products will obviously have that. I think one of the things we did talk about was the fact that afternoons are an opportunity for us. And as we look at these new platforms of what we have launched, if I look at Pearls, for example, it was significantly ahead of what we thought it would be to the point where we ran out of supply. And I think that it wasn't a supply issue necessarily, but it was more, the demand was ahead of what we thought it would be. We had to pull back marketing, and my sense is that as you look at what we now have in our stores, they're back in stores with new products and it's a platform that we will continue to build over time. So, we're not just launching a product, we're launching platforms. The energy platform we've been in the energy business since 2007 with the launch of Doubleshot and Triple Shot Espresso. What we now have is we have a zero-calorie energy platform that we are scaling and it's building steadily and will be something that we're committed to over time. If you look at some of our food innovations like the Egg, Mozzarella, Pesto sandwich as an example, it's a terrific sandwich. And again, it's one that's going to join our core, but it's building systematically over time. We still have work to do on supply, around how we ensure stability and reliability of supply, particularly in food in order to get the kind of service that we're going to need across our 10,000 stores with the products that we launch. So, that's an opportunity, David, that I think we still have and the team is working very hard along with our suppliers in order to make that happen. Thank you all for the time today. If you take away one thing, let it be this. We are making real progress on our three-part plan. We are focused on what we can control in a consumer environment that can be best be described as complex. Our teams are moving to the urgency. I thank them for their efforts and for staying focused on what we can control. I have full confidence in the long-term potential of Starbucks worldwide. Thank you."

            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. As Laxman shared, we are seeing progress against our three-part action plans. Additionally, our efficiency efforts, which are tracking ahead of expectations, partially offset investments associated with the cautious consumer environment. With continued focus on our action plans, efficiency efforts and disciplined operational execution, we expect progress as we close out the year. With that, let me turn to our results. Our Q3 consolidated revenue was $9.1 billion, up 1% from the prior year, demonstrating sequential revenue growth quarter-over-quarter, consistent with what we guided. Revenue growth over the prior year was driven by 8% net new company-operated store growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in comparable store sales from a 5% decrease in transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket as we continue to navigate through a value-driven consumer environment. US led the average ticket increase of 4%, driven by pricing and multi-beverage orders. The increase in average ticket in the US reflects how our innovative products and thoughtful promotions resonated with customers in our quest to offer enhanced value, indicating that our action plans are starting to take hold. Shifting to transactions. US posted a comparable transaction decline of 6%, primarily driven by non-SR members. Across SR customers, as Laxman shared, we saw improved frequency across all deciles. Mobile Order & Pay in the US remained strong in the quarter with positive year-over-year total transaction growth of 7% as customers continue to value both the experience and convenience of the Mobile Order & Pay channel. As we open our app for all with MOP Guest Checkout, which launched earlier this month, we expect to create and deliver value across a broader population, expanding our universe of known customers to deepen engagement, driving increased frequency and spend. In addition to strong SR program growth in the US, we saw strong SR program growth in China. SR members grew to a record 22 million 90-day active members in China. And in June, we also enhanced the program through extending rewards and introducing new diamond tier, which provides exclusive benefits to our most loyal SR members. We're pleased with the SR member growth across both the US and China and expect to see the benefit from this growth in future quarters as new members provide a longer-term benefit. Shifting to margin. Our Q3 consolidated operating margin contracted 70 basis points from the prior year to 16.7%, primarily driven by increased promotional activities, investments in store partner wages and benefits as well as deleverage. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and our continued execution against reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, as well as out-of-store efficiencies, which primarily center around our supply-chain. As you've heard Laxman discuss, we're focused on improving operational execution and efficiencies, which is now more important than ever as we build resiliency in our business. Our efficiency efforts are built on creating sustainable improvements in our operations and end-to-end supply-chain, allowing us to both reinvest in our business and drive margin expansion. A testament to these efforts includes the achievement in excess of 200 basis points in year-over-year efficiency gains as of Q3 across both in-store and out-of-store areas, manifesting through our business in reduced store operating expenses and product and distribution costs respectively. Collectively, these line items represent approximately 85% of our annual spend. Our in-store focus, a combination of efficiencies and staffing and scheduling as well as enhancements in our store equipment and new store format design has fueled a reduction in partner turnover, creating greater stability in our stores. We believe that stability not only creates opportunity to nurture stronger connections with customers, but also increases productivity, which translated to roughly 110 basis-point improvement in store-operating expense in the quarter. Our efficiency focus also extends outside of the store as we've been taking a hard look across our supply-chain and other areas including G&A. As Laxman shared, we're working collaboratively with suppliers to identify opportunities to leverage our scale for cost reductions without compromising product quality or distribution timeliness, which led to meaningful savings in the quarter of approximately 100 basis points between rebates and rate savings. In addition, we believe our end-to-end supply-chain focus gives us the opportunity to increase inventory availability with the right products at the right time, enhancing the customer experience while reducing waste. As we've shared, G&A was elevated at more than 7% of revenue through Q2, as we have deliberately invested in resources to continue to grow our technology capability. We have, however, reduced G&A in Q3 and expect it to remain closer to 6% of revenue in the second half of this fiscal year as we balance investments for our long-term growth. When considering our progress this fiscal year, our in-store and out-of-store year-to-date efficiency efforts collectively amounted to nearly 300 basis points of margin improvement. Our significant efficiency runway, coupled with sales growth gives us confidence to drive margin expansion over time. Given this, we have ample opportunities to deliver above our initial goal of $3 billion, driving to $4 billion in efficiencies over the next four years. Q3 EPS was $0.93, down 6% from the prior year. The decline was driven largely by the cautious consumer environment, which in response drove increased promotions and marketing in the quarter, partially offset by our efficiency efforts. Additionally, our higher effective tax rate had a $0.03 unfavorable impact driven by fewer discrete items relative to the prior year. With segment results being discussed in detail in today's Q3 earnings release, I'll now touch on our capital allocation and financial resilience and then move into guidance. As a reminder, our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to drive financial flexibility, allowing us to continue to make the necessary investments in our business to drive long-term growth. Our new stores continue to be a meaningful part of our growth equation with approximately 85% of our CapEx allocated to our stores, both new stores and renovations. These high-return growth-oriented investments have superior economics, while adding incrementally to our business. Even with over 16,700 stores across the US and another 7,300 in China, we have abundant white space ahead, particularly as populations continue to move to more suburban and rural areas. Take a Tier-3 market in US, for example, a place like Japan, Missouri. A drive-through in that market boasts a year one ROI in excess of 65% with cash margins approaching 30% and a payback period of less than two years. Year-one AUVs reached approximately 2 million with opportunity ahead as we build out the trade area. Importantly, our new store revenue is highly incremental, adding an average of nearly 90% to the trade area attained by our world-class store development partners and their rigorous work that leverages AI-assisted strategic strike -- site selection process. We see that in China as well. Take a new county city, for example. We're in only about 900 of the nearly 3,000 across the market. Today, we see year-one ROI as high as 70% with cash margins averaging over 30% as we've successfully managed both store development and operating costs even in the current macroeconomic backdrop. We believe this is a great investment and accretive to shareholder value, building out the long-term opportunity. With our disciplined approach to capital allocation, underpinned by our strengthening store portfolio, we are reinforcing our financial resilience while remaining committed to our compelling dividend. We continue to target an earnings payout ratio of approximately 50% near the top end of growth companies of our size and scale, resulting in a significant portion of our earnings going directly back to our shareholders. And currently, we have maintained a leverage target below three times lease-adjusted EBITDA, ensuring a strong financial foundation and consistent with our investment-grade credit rating of BBB-plus, which allows us to continue to access capital efficiently. Collectively, our disciplined approach enables us to preserve both balance sheet strength and flexibility, positioning us to successfully navigate through the current macroeconomic environment. Moving to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. We are encouraged with our progress this quarter, and we're pleased to reaffirm all metrics of our full year 2024 guidance. Our confidence is underpinned by the result of our action plans, coupled with the continued efficiency unlocked both in and out of store. In summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, we are seeing progress against our action plans. Second, our efficiency efforts partially offset investments associated with the cautious consumer environment. Third, we believe our financial fortitude and disciplined capital allocation strategy positions us well for the long term. And last, our full year 2024 guidance remains intact. Before I close, I want to acknowledge all of our partners across the globe, working tirelessly each and every day to elevate the Starbucks experience in our stores, at our roasting plants and in our support centers. You are and always have been our superpower. Thank you, partners. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator? Sure. Thanks, Brian. Let me start with the G&A actions. So in the quarter, our G&A actually declined year-over-year by about 5%. And the drivers of that include performance-based compensation, so lower performance-based compensation, coupled with lapping over some foundation investments from the prior year. In addition to that, given the environment, we made some deliberate decisions to focus on cost efficiencies, which helped us offset some of the investments we've made in wages and benefits as well as the investments we've made in technology. We'll expect that to further into Q4. As we look to the out years, we will continue to drive leverage in our G&A as part of our overall efficiency focus and efforts. Now on the store side, you asked about reinvesting, where does that go? And as far as our in-store and out-of-store efficiencies, those investments largely this year have helped to support the promotional activities as well as the investments we've made in our partner wages and benefits. Now as we look towards next year, we'll continue on our path of efficiency efforts. Those efforts will help us to be able to unlock the capacity to be able to reinvest back into our business in a sundry of different areas, but it will also allow us to drive margin expansion. So, I think that answered all of your questions. Thank you. Sure, Sara. Thank you for the question. I'll start with the 4% check. So, in the US business, our transaction -- our ticket comp increased by 4%. And as I shared in my prepared remarks, that does include about 25% of it was related to beverage attach or multi-beverage orders in response to our promotional offers. So, it showed that our customers responded well to our offers. So, that's really the driver of it. We aren't seeing the customization and the personalization in the same way because our offers were much more targeted and driven around specific beverages as well as overall beverage attach. And so as a result of that, that drove the ticket in the quarter, but we were pleased with that because it shows that customers responded well to those offers. Now when we think about price year-over-year in that 4% ticket, I would say the remainder of the ticket, about 75% is really net price. That includes everything from pricing moves, including the increases that we took in California, coupled with the promotional offers. So, I'd say that's a net pricing impact on that 4%. And in terms of the promotional intensity, I'll turn it over to Laxman in a minute, but what I can say about the promotional environment is we've been very measured from a promotional standpoint given the fact that we have a premium positioning as our brand. And so the majority of our promotional efforts were focused on driving growth in our Starbucks Rewards membership because we know that those members tend to increase their value for us over the lifetime. It's a more efficient way for us to promote. And in the quarter, we were pleased with the fact that between the offers and the marketing activities, we were able to grow our Starbucks Rewards membership in the US as a result of that. We also saw traffic increase on days where we had offers as well as days where we had new product launches. So, that also gave us some encouragement just in terms of the effectiveness of our offers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Laxman. Jon, I'll start with on the $4 billion of savings over the next four years, that is a net number. So, we have obviously a larger gross number to ensure that we can deliver on that. So that's the way I think about the savings. If I would just add one more point to that is, I think it's important to note that the Siren system, the equipment is a major overhaul to our overall stores, our engine. It requires quite a bit of CapEx as well as quite a bit of change management. So, we intentionally leverage the renovation and new store process because it allows us to optimize the costs while take advantage of downtime. So that's also an important note in terms of how we've been thoughtful about how we roll these systems out more broadly. And just to remind that comp guidance range is a low-single-digit decline to flat. Yes, The only thing I would add to that is just given the fact that we do see these strong returns and the incremental nature to our overall business, we see the vast opportunity. We have a very rigorous site selection process. We also have an ability to be able to monitor overall performance. And the combination of all of that allows us to strengthen our portfolio through the growth of new stores. So, we see it as an important part of our overall long-term growth algorithm. But I think what's important in what Laxman said is it really comes down to ensuring that we keep monitoring the overall economics. And as long as we see the kind of returns we see today, then it supports our long-term growth ambitions."

Also for calendar planning purposes, please note that our third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call has tentatively been scheduled for Tuesday, July 30, 2024.\n And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Laxman. \nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you, Tiffany, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Let me be clear from the beginning. Our performance this quarter was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. Our Q2 total company revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Our global comparable store sales declined 4% year-over-year, driven by a negative 3% comp growth in North America led by declining traffic and a negative 11% comp growth in China. Our global operating margins contracted by 140 basis points to 12.8%, and our overall earnings per share declined by 7% to $0.68.\n While these results do not reflect our strengths, our capabilities or the opportunities ahead, we confront these challenges from a position of enduring strength. We have led the industry for more than 50 years because we have built a different kind of company, one that exceeds our partner expectations, one that delivers a distinctive and unique experience for our customers and one anchored in the love and craft of coffee.\n As a result, our worldwide brand equity remains resilient and strong. Our leadership in coffee remains unmatched. Our global base of customers remains loyal. Our experiences are differentiated and elevated, our partners are talented and engaged. Our forward-looking product pipeline is highly appealing. Our distinctive store development capability continues to perform incredibly well. Our network of stores is healthy and robust. Our stores are executing better than ever with a stronger operating foundation. Overall, partner engagement is very strong. Our Triple Shot with 2 Pumps Reinvention strategy continues to deliver, and our possibilities as a company remain limitless.\n Still, we face a challenging operating environment. Headwinds discussed last quarter have continued. In a number of key markets, we continue to feel the impact of a more cautious consumer, particularly with our more occasional customer, and a deteriorating economic outlook has weighed on customer traffic, an impact felt broadly across the industry. In the U.S., severe weather impacted both our U.S. and total company comp by nearly 3% during the quarter. The remainder of our challenges were attributable to fewer visits from our more occasional customers.\n Turning elsewhere. We still see economic volatility in the Middle East, but we remain confident in the region's long-term growth opportunities. In China, we still see the effects of a slower-than-expected recovery, and we see fierce competition among value players in the market. But we are strengthening our premium position, and our team in China continues to execute with terrific rigor and heart as the market shakeout continues and as demand recovers and matures.\n None of these realities are excuses. Some, like weather, are transitory. Others, like a more cautious consumer, may persist longer, but much is within our control. There are 3 execution opportunities in our U.S. business I want to expand on: first, meet the demand we have across dayparts to drive future growth; second, launch even more exciting and relevant new products while maintaining our focus on core coffee forward offerings; and third, reach and demonstrate more value for our occasional and non-Starbucks Rewards customers.\n We understand how to do this, and we have what we need to deliver against our plans. So as we look to the second half of the fiscal year and beyond, we're accelerating our work on the underlying execution engines that power our business to realize these opportunities.\n Let me talk you through each. First, meet the demand we have in the U.S. across dayparts. The morning daypart is likely what you think of when you think of Starbucks. It is our peak, and it represents about half our business. It's coffee forward, heavily routine-based and driven by strong loyalty. At our best, we bring in customers with distinctive coffee and a great experience. We convert them to Starbucks Rewards members. We build interest with new coffee innovations, and we encourage more frequent visits and food attached.\n But we currently have a challenge meeting our peak morning demand in the U.S. For example, more than 60% of our morning business in the U.S. comes from Starbucks Rewards members who overwhelmingly order with a Starbucks app. What's interesting though, despite strong Mobile Order & Pay sales, we saw a mid-teens percent order in completion rate within the order channel this past quarter. In other words, customers using MOP put items into their cart and sometimes chose not to complete their order citing long wait times or product unavailability. Here lies opportunity.\n We're intensely focused and actively working on improving operational throughput by providing our partners with the right processes and tools, and on giving our customers a better sense of when the order will be ready. Rollout of our equipment-driven Siren System is on track, but we're also fine-tuning the store processes that underpin this new equipment. We have been working for the past 6 months with the Toyota Production System Support Center to unlock additional capacity at our peak. And what we saw through store tests was a real near-term opportunity to fundamentally improve how we operate our stores.\n The Siren craft system, as we're calling it, requires no capital. The technology solutions are relatively straightforward, and we are working to roll it out in North American stores over the coming months. In stores where we've used the Siren craft system to optimize operations, we have already seen an increase in peak throughput, which we estimate to be worth nearly 1 comp point annually. The Siren craft system also bolsters the highly incremental returns we expect from our equipment-driven Siren Systems as it is deployed in stores. Taken together, these new processes and new equipment systems act as complements and amplify efforts to unlock capacity at peak.\n Additionally, we are revamping and investing in our Deep Brew technology to improve wait time estimates and provide more transparency for customers. They're efforts we began last quarter and built on the many improvements we've made to the Starbucks app over the last 12 weeks with introductions now on a 4-week upgrade cycle.\n Another reason customers choose not to complete their order is product availability. For example, our Potato, Cheddar & Chive Bakes were a big hit with customers, but demand was so strong that we are currently only able to offer them in 2,000 of our U.S. stores. We are ramping up supply chain investments to further improve availability with an initial focus on our customers' favorite items.\n In summary, we are working to increase throughput and improve product availability to enhance the customer experience, improve convenience and better capture existing demand. Over time, we believe these improvements will attract a larger subset of customers.\n I also want to talk about unmet overnight demand. We see it as a tremendous and untapped incremental opportunity. Last quarter, we mentioned we were conducting a pilot program to serve customers overnight between 05:00 p.m. and 05:00 a.m. when our stores are traditionally closed. During this pilot test, we doubled our business. Building off that success, we are aggressively pursuing options to build a $2 billion business over the next 5 years. Overnight opportunities are incremental and create a complement to our existing delivery business, which grew by double digits in the U.S. this quarter with both ticket increase and transaction growth. \n In addition to the overnight, we have unmet weekend demand potential. Starbucks attracts routine customers all week through the morning and the afternoon. While the weekend continues to attract our routine customers, we also see more families and kids. We are working to realize this demand potential to new product offerings, collaborations, marketing and enhancements to the store experience. As you can see, there is significant demand in the morning and even more potential during afternoon, overnight and the weekend we have yet to realize. And we are accelerating our execution engines to meet it.\n Second, launch more relevant and exciting new products for our U.S. customers while maintaining our focus on core coffee-forward offerings. We are the leader in coffee. We are overwhelmingly focused on our coffee-forward products. Coffee continues to perform strongly. And for example, 63% of our beverage sales in the quarter were cold, up 1% from a year ago, driven by innovation.\n And beyond our core, there is more. We know we are challenged to bring new innovations with frequency and strong appeal across other dayparts. This winter, we brought back pistachio lattes, rolled out Oleato nationally and launched a new core iced-shaken espresso. Our beverage is prepared with new breakfast products like our Potato, Cheddar & Chive Bakes. Some of our new products did well and drove positive customer buzz, but not all met our expectations. That reality, coupled with what our customers have told us, points to opportunity across both coffee and non-coffee. And by that, I mean refreshers, matcha and chai and across food to drive greater attach.\n Later in the quarter, we saw improvement. Our lavender platform is extremely successful, including our lavender matcha, and it compares to some of the most successful launches we've ever had. But to cut through, we're working to drive even more buzz-worthy products and on strengthening the supply of products that become popular. These efforts take time, but our team is working with great energy and speed to make both happen.\n We also invested in our brand over the past quarter to address recent misinformation. The work was effective in driving brand metrics, and our overall brand equity and affinity remains strong. As we look ahead, we have an opportunity to better amplify our new products and to drive more awareness and excitement for those products, particularly among our more occasional customers. As we will detail, we are accelerating the execution engines to help us drive more frequent and exciting product innovations, both in the core and beyond.\n Third, reach and demonstrate more value for our occasional and non-Starbucks Rewards customers. We have loyal customers in the U.S., and they stay truly loyal in terms of frequency, transactions and the level of customization they sought with their purchases. We are a brand known for the premium value we provide. Our one-of-a-kind experiential Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which elevate our brand and create lasting value, had strong transactions, fueled by innovation across our coffee platforms, other beverages and food. Throughout the quarter, brand perception of value for what I get, on average, remained strong, and our pricing decisions have been measured.\n But in this environment, many customers are being more exacting about where and how they choose to spend their money, particularly with stimulus savings mostly spent. We saw this materialize over the quarter as customers made the trade-offs between food away from home and food at home. Against that tide, we need to be able to reach and communicate with our customers in a way that demonstrates our value, particularly through Starbucks Rewards and the Starbucks app.\n We are accelerating back-end work on the Starbucks app to ensure we better connect with our more occasional customers. Starting in May, we will add new and exclusive in-app offers that create additional value for our customers. We'll also launch upgrades to the app that include significant improvements to our wait time algorithms. Then in July, we will begin opening the Starbucks app for all while making MOP available in more places outside our app. Following the milestone, more of our customers will be able to see our offers, including those that use guest checkout; and more customers will discover the strong value we provide, value that they will not see otherwise. More on that later.\n These opportunities show that much is within our control. We are confident in our accelerated plans to strengthen the execution engines that power how we serve our customers, how we create and amplify a pipeline of new products and how we reach our customers through the Starbucks app. But let me be clear. It will take time to fully realize these opportunities.\n Our Triple Shot with Two Pumps strategy is the way we will drive these plans forward over the long term. So let's talk about our progress made against each strategic pillar. Our first strategic pillar is to elevate the brand. We do this by driving compelling product innovation, building great stores and operating great stores. Above all, we maintain our leadership and innovation in coffee. In fact, just last week, we announced several steps to reinforce our leadership position to the lens of our partners, our customers and our farmers.\n These include new investments in coffee farms to further scale open agronomy practices; new and exquisite whole bean coffees coming to our core and reserve stores; and new pop-up experiences in cities around the world to engage Gen Z and Millennial customers in the craft of coffee, which they love. Further, we are scaling the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewer to deliver the world's finest top-quality brewed coffee.\n The Clover Vertica provides customers choice between 6 separate coffee roasts and blends, including decaf, brewed fresh on-demand any time of the day. And its rollout is paired to the global launch of our new Starbucks Milano Duetto light and dark roast blends in stores later this year. As mentioned, we are also driving more frequent and exciting product innovation, both coffee and non-coffee.\n Our team has been working with remarkable speed and agility to create a product innovation pipeline that includes new flavors, textures and functional benefits. Investments in product development are already showing benefit. Our new lavender platform performed nearly as well this past quarter as the PSL. More recently, too, our new Spicy refreshers and Reserve Hot Honey beverages show that relevant product innovation can exceed expectations. At our new Roastery and Reserve stores, we are now introducing new products with more agility and speed. Notably, we're also making strides to cut our average product development cycle in half from our current time table of 12 to 18 months.\n Looking to our innovation pipeline for the second half of the year, I'm excited by the number and types of products we're bringing to market. For summer, we are launching our first texture innovation, pearls. This is the first of more texture-based innovations that our customers can expect in the coming years. And we're launching a new functional product, a 0 to low-calorie handcrafted energy beverage. Both build on our coffee heritage and open entirely new vectors for additional future innovation.\n And later this year, we will add up to 5 sugar-free customization options to our menu in response to both partner and customer requests. This will provide a lower calorie option for approximately 80% of our beverages. Our product innovation pipeline will also include more plant-based options as well, like our new plant-based ready-to-drink Frappuccino beverage that recently launched in U.S. grocery stores.\n Beyond our beverage development pipeline, we're also focused on enhancements to food. As an example of the investment we're making in food quality, we recently launched a reimagined premium blueberry muffin. And for summer, we're launching a new egg, pesto and mozzarella sandwich. It combines protein with outstanding taste. We're also expanding grab-and-go choices available in our store lobbies to include more vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options as well as kid-friendly options.\n Taken together, our partner experience, unique customer experience and our core products are what differentiates us. Our pipeline is significantly stronger than last year, and product builds are being developed with partners and simplicity in mind. We're also investing in our supply chain to lower cost and ensure products are available and in-store for our customers.\n Lastly, we continue to grow our global store footprint. Our store development capability is a core strength. This year, we will design and build more than 3,000 new stores globally, and we continue to do so in a financially accretive manner. Our new store openings continue to realize strong unit economics. AUVs and ROIs across our portfolio continue to drive strong returns and high incrementality. We're also leveraging learnings from international markets to meaningfully lower breakeven points for store formats scalable in emerging markets.\n Moving on. Our second strategic pillar is further strengthening and differentiating our leadership position in digital. As mentioned, Starbucks Rewards and the Starbucks app play a central role in driving value for our customers. Our MOP set another record in the U.S., representing 31% of all transactions in the quarter. Our Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. also grew by 6% over the prior year to nearly 33 million members.\n The stickiness and evolution of our digital position provides a structural advantage. Building on this strength, we are mapping additional ways to engage customers as we work to double SR members over the next 5 years. As mentioned, we will begin opening the Starbucks app for all in July. This addresses the current gap in our ability to reach non-Starbucks Rewards members, allows us to deliver more value for the occasional customers and improves our ability to convert them to SR members.\n It drives a better experience for our customers and is core to our growth. We know that SR customers visit more often and spend more. Upgrades in our queue include a guest checkout feature and sequential improvements that make our app an even more appealing gateway for all customers.\n We also plan to invest $600 million over the next 3 years to further digitize our stores and better target customers in more personalized ways. This includes the installation of digital menu boards across the footprint of all our company stores in the U.S. and China. And we're making additional investments in our Deep Brew AI and machine learning platforms to further digitize and fine-tune how we operate our stores while delivering an improved digital customer experience and more personalized customer offers. Offers that are timely and relevant and flexible to location, inventory availability and weather. These investments, including a new revenue management system are foundational to successful execution.\n In the near term, we continue to provide increasingly compelling offers like marketed pairings, including both beverage and food, that make occasions like lunch even more appealing. We continue to encourage and reward routinized behaviors across the day with exclusive offers for SR members. To better communicate the value we provide, we are working to drive offer awareness with omnichannel marketing. This campaign will remind customers that the best offers are in the app and will target more occasional and non-SR customers.\n Our third strategic pillar is becoming truly global. Our international business remains an important part of our long-term growth strategy. Across the Middle East, we continue to work with the Alshaya Group to support the well-being of our partners and customers. Last month, The Starbucks Foundation and Alshaya Starbucks donated $3 million to the World Central Kitchen and their humanitarian efforts to provide food aid in Gaza. Last week, we also announced that every bag of whole bean Starbucks Odyssey Blend coffee sold at participating North American stores through June will benefit World Central Kitchen's efforts to address hunger around the world.\n Turning our attention to China. Macro pressures resulted in traffic contraction this quarter. Performance was impacted by a decline in occasional customers, changing holiday patterns, a high promotional environment and a normalization of customer behaviors following last year's market reopening. Like the U.S., our decline in occasional customers was most noticeable in the afternoons and evenings.\n Still, there are many bright spots. Starbucks remains the Chinese consumers' first choice in away-from-home coffee across city tier and age group. Our morning daypart in China registered growth fueled by coffee routines we've cultivated. Mornings are now larger than before the pandemic. Delivery also achieved positive comp. Starbucks Rewards membership expanded with active members now reaching a record 21 million. We're investing further to grow our SR members and their loyalty to drive greater engagement and lifetime value.\n Beverage innovation is also strong and validates the opportunity we see to further drive the strength of our product pipeline in China. Through the quarter, we unveiled 27 new products fueling brand excitement and meaningful customer engagement, and monthly customer connection scores are at their highest ever as is partner engagement.\n Our robust operating muscle led to sequential margin expansion amidst revenue headwinds, and we sustained very healthy and profitable unit economics and a double-digit store operating margin for a total store portfolio, including new stores. While recovery will remain choppy, our business has shown great resilience, and our fundamentals are very strong. We will win and lead in the premium market. We have built a strong and expanding customer base, a strong brand, a strong portfolio of highly profitable stores and strong capability to drive margin expansion.\n We continue to execute on the 3 key elements of our China strategy, offering more coffee-forward, locally relevant product innovations, making significant investments in technology to increase omnichannel capability and digitize our stores, and increase the percentage of new store openings in lower-tier markets and new county cities where we see stronger new store economics.\n We will weather through this dynamic and transitory period as the industry shakeout continues. Our confidence in the market opportunity and our ability to deliver remains unwavering as we play the long game in China. Elsewhere, we saw growth in many parts of our International segment, highlighting the resilience and diversity of our business portfolio. Excluding China, our International segment grew revenue and comp in the quarter bolstered by strength in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. The Latin American region continued its strong momentum with double-digit system sales growth. Our Asia Pacific region drove revenue growth despite headwinds in the Indonesian and Malaysian markets. And revenue from our Japan business grew by double digits. \n Across our International segment, we opened 230 net new stores this quarter. In total, our store count outside of North America is now more than 20,800, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 9%. We opened our 400th store in India, our 600th store in Indonesia and our 1,900th store in Korea. We are on track to operate 1,000 stores in India by 2028, translating 1 new store opening every 3 days.\n As we expand to Honduras and Ecuador, our global footprint will grow to more than 39,000 stores across 88 markets, putting us well on the path to 55,000 stores by 2030.\n Our fourth strategic pillar, 1 of our 2 pumps is unlocking efficiencies. In the quarter, our Triple Shot strategy continued to unlock meaningful efficiencies across the North American business, driving 150 basis points of store operational efficiencies. Additionally, we saw meaningful reductions in product and distribution costs, driven by supply chain improvements in procurement, transportation and sourcing.\n Specifically in our U.S. stores, we're focused on creating a more stable environment for partners through investments in equipment innovation, process improvements, staffing, scheduling and waste reduction, all things our partners value and prioritize, creating a more satisfying work environment in our stores while derisking our business.\n Today, our stores are running better than ever before, underpinned by the strong fundamentals our team has built. For example, we see meaningful improvement in drive-thru window times without adding more work for our partners, with even more to come as we layer in our Siren craft system. We are rebuilding and refining our supply chain and to unlock efficiencies in our factory in the back, we are leveraging technology in new ways. We have significant above-the-store opportunity to realize efficiencies in our supply chain. They are significantly higher than we initially thought, and we are ahead of plan and savings.\n Through work to date, we have the confidence we need to extend our goal from $3 billion in added efficiencies over 3 years to $4 billion over the next 4. As a result of our investments and focused efficiency efforts, partner turnover reached a new low in the quarter. Store manager turnover has also improved, and both beat industry benchmarks by a wide margin. Average hours per partner continues to improve by double digits year-over-year, increasing engagement and their take-home pay.\n That brings me to our fifth strategic pillar, reinvigorating our partner culture. From the beginning, Starbucks set itself apart as a different kind of company. Our unique culture is anchored in our mission, promises and values of craft, results, courage, belonging and joy. And at the heart of our business are our partners. They are central to the Starbucks experience and are delivering on our promise to uplift the every day for customers around the world. I see this every day and through my regular work in stores.\n We continue to work to restitch the fabric of the green apron for all partners. Just last week, we gathered together to celebrate our first-ever Starbucks Promises Day. And next month, we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of our Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University. Following commencement, more than 13,000 partners will have earned their bachelor's degree through the program, bringing to life our partner promise of a bridge to a better future. What's more, over 25,000 partners across more than 90% of our U.S. stores are currently enrolled in the program and are pursuing a bachelor's degree.\n To close, we had a tough quarter. We need to do better, and we will. As I look forward, I'm confident we have the right strategy. We have terrific partners and a strong executive team that is deeply engaged and continues to lead. I thank each of our 460,000 green apron partners around the world for their remarkable work. We have real opportunity, and we are taking swift action to accelerate investment through the execution engines that will address the near term and drive our long-term success. These actions are funded by a highly profitable operations and productivity initiatives and is captured within our guidance. As these actions take hold, we expect our business to return to algorithmic growth and to achieve its long-term opportunity.\n And with that, I will turn it over to Rachel to discuss our results in greater detail. Rachel? \nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. As Laxman shared, our performance this quarter did not reflect what we're capable of as a company. We have an incredible brand, loyal customers globally, a strong portfolio of highly profitable stores and in connection with our partners and customers that's unlike any other in our industry. We know that we can and we will do better.\n While it was a difficult quarter, we learned from our own underperformance and recognize the onus is on us to execute. We've sharpened our focus and with our comprehensive road map of well-thought out actions, the path forward is clear. With that, let me turn to our results.\n Our Q2 consolidated revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1% from the prior year due primarily to a 4% decline in comparable store sales driven by lower transactions, partially offset by 8% net new company-operated store growth over the prior year. Q2 consolidated operating margin contracted 140 basis points from the prior year to 12.8%, primarily driven by deleverage, partner wages and benefit investments as well as promotional activities, partially offset by pricing and our continued execution against reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, which drove approximately 150 basis point savings in the quarter. Q2 EPS was down -- was $0.68, down 7% from the prior year, primarily due to the contraction of operating income in both the North America and International segments as a result of lower revenue.\n I'll now provide segment highlights for Q2. North America revenue was $6.4 billion in Q2, flat to the prior year as 5% net new company-operated store growth was mostly offset by a 3% decline in comparable store sales driven by a 7% decrease in transactions partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket. Our U.S. company-operated business posted a 3% comparable store sales decline in Q2, driven by a 7% decrease in transactions.\n Consistent with Q1, the traffic decline was pronounced among more occasional customers with a more cautious consumer environment as a backdrop and also included an estimated 3% adverse impact from extreme weather, including some store closures. Partially offsetting the decline was a 4% increase in average ticket, reflecting pricing as well as the continued mix shift into cold beverages such as Iced Shaken Espresso and Matcha Tea Latte, which resonate with our customers.\n Additionally, our new store performance remains strong, with both year 1 AUV and cash margin of recently opened stores projected to be in line with last year's newly opened stores, preserving high incrementality even with our expanding footprint. North America's operating margin was 18% in Q2, contracting 120 basis points from the prior year. The contraction was primarily driven by deleverage, partner wage and benefit investments as well as promotional activities, partially offset by pricing and reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies.\n While deleverage drove the overall contraction in the segment's margin, efficiencies generated through our reinvention efforts meaningfully countered the deleverage we experienced in the quarter. While our reinvention plan is intended to provide a more balanced growth model and margin expansion, we're pleased to see the benefits counterbalance, broader headwinds in our business as our partner staffing and scheduling investments continue to unlock in-store efficiencies.\n The benefits continue to expand outside of stores as well, resulting in meaningful reduction in the segment's product and distribution costs as a percentage of revenue, partially driven by supply chain savings. We believe our strategies related to reinvention are working, creating more streamlined operations and tangible financial benefits across our business with more opportunity to come.\n Moving to International. The segment delivered $1.8 billion in revenue in the quarter, roughly flat to the prior year, primarily as 12% growth in net new company-operated stores was offset by a 6% decline in comparable store sales driven evenly by transactions and average ticket. Revenue was also impacted by a decrease in licensed store revenues, largely resulting from the negative impacts to our business in the Middle East. Although our revenue was impacted, our long-term aspirations in international has not wavered as there was revenue and comp growth across the International segment when excluding China. This speaks to the strength of our broader international portfolio, driven by markets like Japan, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.\n Shifting to China. In Q2, China's revenue declined 3%, driven by an 11% decrease in comparable store sales consisting of 8% and 4% declines in average ticket and transactions, respectively, partially offset by a 14% net new store growth. The market continued to recover slower than expected with further impacts from the timing of holiday-related travel trends. Despite the complex environment, the market opened 118 net new stores in the quarter while sustaining double-digit store operating margin for both new stores and the total portfolio, demonstrating the health and resilience of our brand in the market, positioning us well in the market long term. Total International segment operating margin was 13.3% in Q2, contracting 340 basis points from the prior year primarily driven by promotional activities, partner wage and benefit investments as well as sales mix shift partially offset by pricing in certain markets.\n Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue of $418 million in Q2 declined 13% from the prior year, largely in line with our expectations given the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee and SKU optimization. Importantly, we maintained the #1 share position in both U.S. at-home coffee and U.S. ready to drink.\n As an example of innovation in China, we launched our Starbucks Refreshers platform with 2 flavors, the Pink Drink and the Purple Drink, to drive our much-desired cool portfolio beyond our stores, particularly among Gen Z. The segment's operating margin was 51.7% in Q2, expanding 1,610 basis points from prior year, driven primarily by growth in our North America coffee partnership joint venture income as well as lapping prior year impairment charges against certain manufacturing assets. The segment's operating margin is progressing in line with our original expectations, continuing to target the full year range of high 40% to low 50%, a very attractive financial model.\n Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal year 2024. Given what we shared today, we're revising our fiscal year guidance, and I'll walk through both, one, what changed; and two, what remains the same in comparison to our previous guidance.\n So first, what changed? Broadly, in the second quarter, our business underperformed as revenues in the U.S., China, Middle East and other markets were impacted more deeply than anticipated by the continued multifaceted headwinds. In addition to the second quarter performance, our exit rates of both revenue and comp growth across our key markets reflect continued headwinds.\n To manage these headwinds, we have focused actions both to unlock capacity and track demand in the spirit of uplifting traffic as well as to further implement our Triple Shot strategy. Leveraging our learnings from the second quarter, and as Laxman discussed in detail, we're working to further elevate our brand through an integrated focus across product innovation and marketing, including strengthening our digital capabilities, delivering more value for our customers.\n For instance, first, to unlock demand in the morning daypart in the U.S., we're working to improve store-related processes, leveraging our Siren craft system while also increasing product availability through improved inventory management. Second, to attract demand, particularly in the afternoon daypart, we're implementing a new and more frequent innovation cadence integrated with a broader multi-channeled marketing approach, inclusive of highly targeted personalized offers.\n This shift is geared towards our more occasional customers to attract and inject them to our stores and apps. Now some of these actions will take time to fully materialize. However, through our investments in our customer experience and focused execution, we do expect to deliver some benefit in the current fiscal year. As a result of what has changed, our revenue and comp guidance as well as the related flow-through to margin and earnings is impacted. In addition, the continued headwinds impacted our global store growth expectations.\n Now before I share the details of our revised fiscal year 2024 guidance, I'll share what remains the same. First, we have confidence in the effectiveness of our proven Triple Shot strategy, as our biggest opportunity lies in our execution.\n Second, our efficiency efforts are tracking slightly ahead of our expectations. Year-to-date, we achieved 170 basis points of in-store operational efficiencies along with great progress out of store, positioning us to deliver our $3 billion savings target through fiscal year 2026 with line of sight to even more opportunity beyond that.\n Third, while our Channel Development segment is the smallest of our segments, it complements our portfolio, capturing customer occasions beyond our stores; and our performance in that segment continues to deliver. Lastly, we must continue investing in the fundamentals and competitive moat of our business, our partners, our stores and our customers, as we believe these investments will drive long-term growth and industry leadership beyond these transitory headwinds.\n Based on these facts, we are revising our full year fiscal 2024 guidance to: global revenue growth of low single digits from our previous range of 7% to 10%; global and U.S. comps of low single-digit decline to flat, both from the previous range of 4% to 6% growth; China comp of single-digit decline from the previous expectation of low single-digit growth in Q2 through Q4; global net new store growth of approximately 6% from our previous expectation of approximately 7%. We continue to expect our U.S. store count to grow by approximately 4% and now anticipate approximately 12% store growth in China from our previous expectation of approximately 13%; operating margin growth of approximately flat from the previous expectation of progressive expansion. Finally, we expect EPS and non-GAAP EPS growth of flat to low single digits from the previous range of 15% to 20%.\n As a reminder, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation and assumes constant currency. As an additional insight into our fiscal year 2024 guidance, we expect sequential revenue growth from Q3 to Q4 with pressure on margin and earnings easing in Q4 as our action plans take hold. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate in the mid-20% range. Lastly, we continue to expect approximately $3 billion in CapEx, most of which is ring-fenced for our direct investment in our global store portfolio, which, as we have shared, continues to drive highly attractive returns.\n In summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, Q2 was a challenging quarter for us as headwinds consistently persisted throughout the quarter leading us to revamp our actions and response plans to both unlock and attract demand. Second, our Triple Shot strategy continues to deliver efficiencies even in the face of headwinds, reinforcing that we have the right strategy at the right time. Next, our fiscal year 2024 guidance has been revised to reflect our Q2 performance, year-to-date results as well as the near-term headwinds we're experiencing. We, however, remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity and thus, committed to our strategy and the related investments. And finally, our disciplined approach to capital allocation drives our financial fortitude, reflecting shareholder commitment underpinned by our best-in-class dividend. This allows us to preserve both balance sheet durability and flexibility, positioning us to successfully navigate this complex and dynamic environment. \n Before I open the call to Q&A, I want to share my sincerest gratitude for my partners, both in and out of stores across the globe who show up every day living our values to deliver the differentiated customer experience that makes Starbucks so special for all of us. Thank you, partners.\n Operator, you can now open the call to Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] with that, our first question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. \nSara Senatore: I guess it's a two-part question about trends that you were talking about. The first is that you talked about weather as a headwind, and then you said that lavender late in the quarter was one of the strongest launches you've had similar to PSL. But your exit rate -- it sounds like you're saying your exit rate was largely unchanged. So I'm trying to reconcile what would appear to have been headwinds that aren't reoccurring and then very successful innovation with the guidance and the exit rates. That's the first part.\n And the second is just in terms of the cautious consumer. Typically, I think what we'd see is check management, and you don't seem to be seeing that. I think mix is still a tailwind for you. So it seems to me that there's not as much evidence of consumer caution as perhaps just some of what you were talking about, the Starbucks specific, so if you could just comment on those. \nLaxman Narasimhan: Sara, thank you for your question. Let me address both of them by pointing to the underlying pressures that we see consumers face just in terms of what they have available to spend. So there's no question that if you take some of these transitory headwinds out, which, of course, are not an excuse in any way, and you look at the underlying headwinds particularly around the pressures that consumers face particularly with the occasional customer, what we're seeing is that's where the challenge is. It's a challenge with their traffic and it's their challenge with them coming into our stores.\n If you look at our most loyal customers, they're coming in often. They're seeing the value that we provide in Starbucks Rewards, in our app. They are premiumizing through customization as in the past. And so therefore, what you see there is you see a strong business with our loyal customers particularly those within the environments of the Starbucks app. What we are focused on is, first, how we meet the demand we already have through ensuring that our partners have the processes and the tools at the peak in order to meet the demand of customers who, at this moment, are choosing not to complete their transactions in Mobile Order, Pay.\n The second thing is we're clearly launching new products, and our pipeline is very strong. And what we are doing, though, as part of that is the third element, is how we reach and deliver value to the more occasional customers as well as those that are not in the Starbucks Rewards ecosystem. And that's where the challenge lies. And that's how you reconcile the 2 points that you had made. So we have a lot in our control, and we are focused on it. And we're focusing on the execution of those 3 opportunities, as I laid out, in North America. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. \nBrian Harbour: When you talk about the more occasional customer, I'm curious, is that often a younger customer? And I think the broader question is just is there any sort of brand resonance issue with perhaps some of that customer base? Do you think there's sort of a product resonance issue with them? Is there more that needs to be done than just kind of accelerating the pace of new products and some of the other drivers that you talked about in the near term? \nLaxman Narasimhan: Brian, thank you for your question. I think that if you look at our overall brand equity, it is and continues to be strong. If you look at the scores around value for what I get, strong. So if I look at the occasional customer, though, they're clearly making choices based on the economic pressures they face. What they look for from us is they look for variety. They look for the core. 50% of what we have in the afternoon, as an example, is coffee. So obviously, coffee is really important, and distinctiveness of coffee is very important. But they are looking for variety and they're looking for value.\n And what we're focused on is ensuring that we find a way to connect with them, to bring them into our app ecosystem in order for them to see the value that we provide inside there. That's why you're going to see the actions we take in May. You're going to see the actions that we take in July as we open up the app to all. That is going to make them, particularly in North America, be able to see the value that we provide in a way that's much easier for them. And as they build loyalty over time, they will see even more value as they come into the system. So that's as far as North America goes and the steps that we are taking. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. \nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. A broader question on the global unit growth, just more broadly, your confidence or, I guess, the prudence in maintaining what still is outsized growth with the headwinds seemingly large. Just wondering how you can be confident that the current challenges you're facing aren't, in part, due to maybe saturation or cannibalization.\n And I guess that does end up pointing to China. And for China specifically, I think you mentioned healthy unit economics and double-digit restaurant margin. I was just wondering if, Rachel, maybe you could just talk about the specifics in terms of those sales, margins and returns that justify still that outsized growth in a very challenging China macro? \nLaxman Narasimhan: Let me first -- I'll take on the first question of global unit growth and hand over to Rachel to talk specifically about your question on China margins. Jeff, what we see is we see very strong cash and cash returns and I think what we've done both in the U.S. but also in the expansion plans that we have internationally. And I think what you see is -- what we're focused on is ensuring that we have reduced the cost of our stores and stores investment. We have done a very good job in bringing efficiency to that. And so as we expand, we see very good cash-on-cash returns.\n The reality is that the penetration we have in many of these markets and the headroom that we have internationally is very high. I mean I think, last time, we talked about the fact that, I think, we were just in 800 cities or -- in China and the opportunity for us in terms of counties is about over 3,000.\n So I think we're like -- we're not really penetrated as much as we could be in a place like China, which is why we have confidence. As we look at the real estate options we have, the proposals that are coming together, the kind of cash returns we get are very strong. That's what gives us confidence in terms of the global unit growth. Rachel, do you want to take the second part? \nRachel Ruggeri: And if I would just add to that, when we look at the guidance that was given around our new store growth, particularly as it relates to China, that's really a very deliberate decision that we took to be able to increase the number of stores that we were opening in lower-tier cities and new counties where we see even stronger returns. So broadly, our returns are quite attractive, but they're even stronger in those lower-tier cities and the new counties. And as a result of that, that shift actually impacts our development pipeline. So there's a timing impact in terms of new store growth. So that's why we're at 12%, which we think is still a very strong growth and indicative of the opportunity that we see\n [Technical Difficulty] \nOperator: Are you still connected? One moment. Can you hear us? \nLaxman Narasimhan: We can hear you. \nOperator: And our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Palmer: First, I wanted to ask a clarification. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you viewed some of the issues in China as transitory. I think you were speaking more about the competition than you were about the consumer with that comment. I think you mentioned something about a shakeout. I was wondering if you could double-click on that for us, what you're maybe seeing that would make you think that the environment there would be -- competitively would be a transitory one and they would get better that way.\n And then from a beverage innovation standpoint, I'm wondering how you're viewing the pipeline. Lavender happened, Spicy Lemonade has happened. You have 2 new ones coming up. How are you viewing the pipeline differently than -- and how are you thinking about the process of R&D differently today? And how are you evaluating what you've done? \nLaxman Narasimhan: I think we had some technical problems in hearing you, but let me just try and recap the question. Your first question was on competition in China and the comment around the shakeout that we are starting to see. And the second comment was on beverage pipeline.\n So let me start with the competition in China. I think the growth has taken place in the mass area of the China business, of the China overall coffee and tea segment is, one, where we see just intense price competition. We're choosing not to participate in that. We are a premium brand. We have built a business over 25 years with a great deal of competitive advantages. You can see that there. We have amazing partners in stores. We have stores that look distinctive. We have an end-to-end supply chain that, frankly, I would love to have in the U.S. And then we are steeped in coffee and the tradition of coffee in end to end as well as for the knowledge that we have in store. So we bring that to life very well in our business in China.\n At the same time, what you are seeing is the intense competition, particularly in the tea segment and it overlaps into coffee in the mass area, is one where you are seeing some of the shakeout happen in terms of the impact on people and how they can really sustain that kind of intensity. For us, our focus is on the premium end, and we're continuing to see that, right now, the headroom we have in China is large.\n I mean we're still at 13 cups per capita. Japan's at 280 and the U.S. is at 380. We know that, over time, as the Chinese consumer stops spending, what you're going to realize is that we have a business that is healthy, that has a P&L and a store operating margin level that is strong, and we're going to see that grow as the consumer gets more and more exposed to coffee. So that is what I mean by the overall competitive environment in China.\n In terms of your question about the beverage pipeline, I think that's been largely around North America. One of the things we're seeing here is we're core in coffee, and we're tremendously excited about the innovations that we're bringing with whole bean coffee and some of the coffee-forward innovations that we are seeing in our stores. But additionally, as we look at the occasional customers, they are looking for variety. And what we are doing is we're finding ways to open up new platforms of growth. \n And last time, I mentioned that there were 3 platforms. And these are foundational -- additional new introductions that we will make over time. The first one was textures. So we started with pearls with our Summer 1 program, which starts next week. We then have a handcrafted energy platform that's coming in later on in this quarter. Additionally,  plant-based is an area where we've traditionally been really well known for. So we have designed platforms and these are platforms around which you can expect to see systematic innovations that come in not just this time around, but also, you will see further more that come in around these platforms. That's how we're thinking about R&D. It's around platforms, both in beverage as well as in food. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. \nSharon Zackfia: I guess I'm trying to think through the sequencing of how we got here today. And it seems like in October and early November at the analyst meeting, demand was not a problem in the U.S., and I hear you saying that you have a lot of unmet demand. But can you kind of help us do a hindsight on how these issues have come to a crux so quickly, just 4 or 5 months hence since those kind of very ambitious goals that were given? \nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you, Sharon. I think that if I look at the headwinds that we see in the market, in particular with the consumer and the pressures that they face, I think that they were sharper and more accelerated than what we expected. I think in hindsight, if I look at the situation in China, while long-term growth potential is sort of picking, we're committed to the long term in China. The recovery has been choppy. But I think what we've seen, particularly since that period is we've seen more intense price competition than what we expected. None of that takes away for the long term, but it's clear that what we had this quarter was tough. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. \nPeter Saleh: Great. I did want to ask about the Siren System. This was the focal point of the Investor Day a couple of years ago, and it seemed like it was put on the back burner for a little while, but now it seems like you're talking more bullish about this system going forward. So can you just give us an update? I think last we heard, it was going to be rolled out to less than 10% of the stores this year. What is the strategy now? And how does this help solve some of the issues you have? It sounds like some of the issues that you have are more in the supply chain and not necessarily within the four walls of the stores. \nLaxman Narasimhan: Peter, just to respond to your question, first of all, the Siren System was never put on the back burner. In fact, we're on track to having the Siren System installed in less than 10% of the stores, much as we committed. So it's on track. \n What we've added in here, though, is the underlying processes to ensure that we can reduce the wait time in the store, inside the four walls of the store. And that's what those processes are intended to do in the U.S. And so that's what the acceleration of the processes are that we have been testing. What we provide is a base on which we will continue to implement the overall Siren Systems that we showcased to you in the September Analyst Day when you were here with us and we talked to it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. \nLauren Silberman: One quick -- a follow-up and then a question. First, can you just talk about the cadence of U.S. comp throughout the quarter? I know you mentioned lavender was extremely successful. It doesn't seem to be showing up in the comp just given the commentary on the exit rate. So just help us understand the performance of new products and whether that's driving incremental customers you're targeting.\n And then just a quick one on like loyalty. It looks like active Rewards members declined quarter-over-quarter, which is very rare. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there given the commentary on the strength of the core customer? \nLaxman Narasimhan: Do you want to take that one, Rachel? \nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Yes. Thank you, Lauren. I'll start with the comp and what I spoke about in my prepared remarks about the exit rate. And lavender was quite successful for us. As you heard in Laxman's prepared remarks, what we are encouraged by is that lavender both to what our customers, particularly Gen Z and Millennial customers, are asking about, which is more new more often and a broader offering, so offering, meaning coffee, non-coffee, food, healthier choices. And so we hit squarely with that with lavender by having particularly our most popular offering in lavender was the Iced Lavender Matcha Latte and so that shows that when we innovate well, we exceed our own expectations.\n That was later in the quarter. So it did do something for us in terms of driving customers into the afternoon. Largely, we saw that platform resonate well in the afternoon with our customers. The Latte, we'll tend to do more in the morning, but broadly, lavender, a hit in the afternoon. So we see that, that overall offering and how we're trying to address the customer -- more occasional customer with that worked well.\n But what I would say is that it was later in the quarter. We've got more opportunities coming going forward. And as a result of that, our exit rate in the quarter still reflected continued headwinds, which we're reflecting in our guidance for the back half of the year. What we're expecting with the plans that we've outlined today will help us counterbalance some of those headwinds, particularly as we see those actions start to take place.\n So I think it's important to think about there are consumer headwinds in there. Our plans will counterbalance that. And as we go after some of those challenges, I think the other thing to remember is that we are coming with a position of strength as it relates to the efficiencies around our Triple Shot as well as the growth we have in new stores and the strength we're seeing in our portfolio overall. We have a very strong portfolio, a profitable portfolio that will help us, and our brand is strong. So we look at all of that, and that's how we're thinking about the exit rates of comp as well as what we're seeing for comps in the back half of the year. So hopefully, that provides a little more texture. \nLaxman Narasimhan: Brady, on loyalty? \nBrady Brewer: Thank you, Lauren. You talked about the year-over-year increase but quarter-over-quarter declines of Starbucks Rewards members. And I think, just to be clear, that is in terms of 90-day frequency, so we still have a very large population of SR members. So it's about frequency of those customers.\n So I think consistent with the consumer pullback, the more occasional and very occasional SR members, those ones visited less frequently within the quarter. As a result of that, we saw fewer 90-day actives quarter-over-quarter. That said, the 6% growth year-over-year, we're continuing to grow SR. MOP grew in the quarter, so we still have a very active customer base setting record high for MOP. Delivery grew double digits in the quarter, and we see a very active digital customer.\n And I think as Laxman talked about with regard to how we're going to provide SR and traffic in the coming quarters, this is squarely aligned to this challenge. It's reactivating SR members, bringing them back and demonstrating value and driving frequency through the app and through SR. And we have a lot of great programs lined up [indiscernible] there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. \nJohn Ivankoe: Two parts if I may. I heard the word misinformation and I think some improving maybe scores around that. So I just wanted to get a sense how much of an opportunity in terms of sales lost that you think correcting this information might actually mean for Starbucks. I don't think you've quantified that, but that would be helpful.\n And then secondly, regarding the Toyota Production System. I think I heard you said that it would help about a point. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that seems to be a fairly low number. And just talk about what kind of changes that would happen in the Toyota Production System.\n And to us, one of the opportunities would be having food ready when the customer orders it. In other words, using food warming cabinets would be particularly effective for both Mobile Order & Pay and drive-thru. So is that something that may be -- as part of Siren, that can be accelerated before the entire Siren System goes into place? \nLaxman Narasimhan: John, thank you for the question. I think on the question about misperception, misperception did have an impact on our business [indiscernible]. We haven't been -- we don't have a quantification for that. But what we do know is that our brand equity, the stores and the investment involved in the brand have certainly helped spending with overall perception of our brand [ we spend every year ].\n In terms of the [indiscernible] system, what we're doing first is we're tracking how [ we do with the week ], so how we essentially work with deployment in the store, how we handle what happens at peaks in terms of where people are deployed. How do we essentially [ process ] customers? And what you see is [indiscernible] there. I know we've given you a quantification of 1 percentage point. That is a conservative estimate because when it fully gets deployed and it fits, you would see even bigger improvements that happen.\n In regard to your question about the [ hot food, ] that is purely something suggesting and we're looking to accelerate. So it takes [indiscernible] to accelerate that with the work that we are doing. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. \nAndrew Charles: I know you're committed, of course, to the tenets of the reinvention plan. But in light of the current environment and caution of U.S. and China consumer, can you level set the long-term earnings algorithm introduced November around guidance for 5% same-store sales and 15% plus EPS growth? Does that still apply to 2025 and beyond? \nLaxman Narasimhan: Andrew, thank you for your question. Everything we've seen, I know that we had a tough quarter. But everything we see in terms of the opportunities that lie ahead, as you look at the opportunities we have across [indiscernible], the innovation that we [ see ] in terms of the pipeline going forward [indiscernible] beyond. If you look at the productivity opportunities, the store count opportunities [indiscernible], we believe we'll be back [indiscernible]. And we see no change in the long-term outlook that we set earlier in this [ business ]. \nOperator: And the last question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. \nDavid Tarantino: My question is on the value strategy that you laid out and the need to check traffic or track traffic in a tough environment. But I'm just wondering how you balance that with protecting the long-term health of the brand. Starbucks has always been a very premium brand position and sort of training some of these occasional users to come in on discount might have some detrimental impact. So I'm just wondering how you balance those 2 things and the strategy that you have. \nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you for your question. [indiscernible] and we have no intention of like going across the board and [indiscernible] what we are doing is we are [indiscernible] the fact that as [indiscernible] levels of [indiscernible] our brand overall right now [ that for what I can ] is still very strong [indiscernible]. So we feel very good about that. And this is more about how we [ move ] and how we [ manage ] customers, particularly those that don't [indiscernible] that is what we intend to do. \nRachel Ruggeri: [indiscernible] transactions [indiscernible] everything, the work [indiscernible] in an integrated way around product [indiscernible] as well as what our customers can get in the app to [indiscernible] \nOperator: That was our last question. I'll now turn the call over to Laxman Narasimhan for closing remarks. \nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you for joining us. We had a tough quarter, but we have a clear action plan that the management team and I are [indiscernible] thank you for joining us, and we appreciate the time you're taking this afternoon. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Laxman Narasimhan",
            "content": "Thank you, Tiffany, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Let me be clear from the beginning. Our performance this quarter was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. Our Q2 total company revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Our global comparable store sales declined 4% year-over-year, driven by a negative 3% comp growth in North America led by declining traffic and a negative 11% comp growth in China. Our global operating margins contracted by 140 basis points to 12.8%, and our overall earnings per share declined by 7% to $0.68.\n While these results do not reflect our strengths, our capabilities or the opportunities ahead, we confront these challenges from a position of enduring strength. We have led the industry for more than 50 years because we have built a different kind of company, one that exceeds our partner expectations, one that delivers a distinctive and unique experience for our customers and one anchored in the love and craft of coffee.\n As a result, our worldwide brand equity remains resilient and strong. Our leadership in coffee remains unmatched. Our global base of customers remains loyal. Our experiences are differentiated and elevated, our partners are talented and engaged. Our forward-looking product pipeline is highly appealing. Our distinctive store development capability continues to perform incredibly well. Our network of stores is healthy and robust. Our stores are executing better than ever with a stronger operating foundation. Overall, partner engagement is very strong. Our Triple Shot with 2 Pumps Reinvention strategy continues to deliver, and our possibilities as a company remain limitless.\n Still, we face a challenging operating environment. Headwinds discussed last quarter have continued. In a number of key markets, we continue to feel the impact of a more cautious consumer, particularly with our more occasional customer, and a deteriorating economic outlook has weighed on customer traffic, an impact felt broadly across the industry. In the U.S., severe weather impacted both our U.S. and total company comp by nearly 3% during the quarter. The remainder of our challenges were attributable to fewer visits from our more occasional customers.\n Turning elsewhere. We still see economic volatility in the Middle East, but we remain confident in the region's long-term growth opportunities. In China, we still see the effects of a slower-than-expected recovery, and we see fierce competition among value players in the market. But we are strengthening our premium position, and our team in China continues to execute with terrific rigor and heart as the market shakeout continues and as demand recovers and matures.\n None of these realities are excuses. Some, like weather, are transitory. Others, like a more cautious consumer, may persist longer, but much is within our control. There are 3 execution opportunities in our U.S. business I want to expand on: first, meet the demand we have across dayparts to drive future growth; second, launch even more exciting and relevant new products while maintaining our focus on core coffee forward offerings; and third, reach and demonstrate more value for our occasional and non-Starbucks Rewards customers.\n We understand how to do this, and we have what we need to deliver against our plans. So as we look to the second half of the fiscal year and beyond, we're accelerating our work on the underlying execution engines that power our business to realize these opportunities.\n Let me talk you through each. First, meet the demand we have in the U.S. across dayparts. The morning daypart is likely what you think of when you think of Starbucks. It is our peak, and it represents about half our business. It's coffee forward, heavily routine-based and driven by strong loyalty. At our best, we bring in customers with distinctive coffee and a great experience. We convert them to Starbucks Rewards members. We build interest with new coffee innovations, and we encourage more frequent visits and food attached.\n But we currently have a challenge meeting our peak morning demand in the U.S. For example, more than 60% of our morning business in the U.S. comes from Starbucks Rewards members who overwhelmingly order with a Starbucks app. What's interesting though, despite strong Mobile Order & Pay sales, we saw a mid-teens percent order in completion rate within the order channel this past quarter. In other words, customers using MOP put items into their cart and sometimes chose not to complete their order citing long wait times or product unavailability. Here lies opportunity.\n We're intensely focused and actively working on improving operational throughput by providing our partners with the right processes and tools, and on giving our customers a better sense of when the order will be ready. Rollout of our equipment-driven Siren System is on track, but we're also fine-tuning the store processes that underpin this new equipment. We have been working for the past 6 months with the Toyota Production System Support Center to unlock additional capacity at our peak. And what we saw through store tests was a real near-term opportunity to fundamentally improve how we operate our stores.\n The Siren craft system, as we're calling it, requires no capital. The technology solutions are relatively straightforward, and we are working to roll it out in North American stores over the coming months. In stores where we've used the Siren craft system to optimize operations, we have already seen an increase in peak throughput, which we estimate to be worth nearly 1 comp point annually. The Siren craft system also bolsters the highly incremental returns we expect from our equipment-driven Siren Systems as it is deployed in stores. Taken together, these new processes and new equipment systems act as complements and amplify efforts to unlock capacity at peak.\n Additionally, we are revamping and investing in our Deep Brew technology to improve wait time estimates and provide more transparency for customers. They're efforts we began last quarter and built on the many improvements we've made to the Starbucks app over the last 12 weeks with introductions now on a 4-week upgrade cycle.\n Another reason customers choose not to complete their order is product availability. For example, our Potato, Cheddar & Chive Bakes were a big hit with customers, but demand was so strong that we are currently only able to offer them in 2,000 of our U.S. stores. We are ramping up supply chain investments to further improve availability with an initial focus on our customers' favorite items.\n In summary, we are working to increase throughput and improve product availability to enhance the customer experience, improve convenience and better capture existing demand. Over time, we believe these improvements will attract a larger subset of customers.\n I also want to talk about unmet overnight demand. We see it as a tremendous and untapped incremental opportunity. Last quarter, we mentioned we were conducting a pilot program to serve customers overnight between 05:00 p.m. and 05:00 a.m. when our stores are traditionally closed. During this pilot test, we doubled our business. Building off that success, we are aggressively pursuing options to build a $2 billion business over the next 5 years. Overnight opportunities are incremental and create a complement to our existing delivery business, which grew by double digits in the U.S. this quarter with both ticket increase and transaction growth. \n In addition to the overnight, we have unmet weekend demand potential. Starbucks attracts routine customers all week through the morning and the afternoon. While the weekend continues to attract our routine customers, we also see more families and kids. We are working to realize this demand potential to new product offerings, collaborations, marketing and enhancements to the store experience. As you can see, there is significant demand in the morning and even more potential during afternoon, overnight and the weekend we have yet to realize. And we are accelerating our execution engines to meet it.\n Second, launch more relevant and exciting new products for our U.S. customers while maintaining our focus on core coffee-forward offerings. We are the leader in coffee. We are overwhelmingly focused on our coffee-forward products. Coffee continues to perform strongly. And for example, 63% of our beverage sales in the quarter were cold, up 1% from a year ago, driven by innovation.\n And beyond our core, there is more. We know we are challenged to bring new innovations with frequency and strong appeal across other dayparts. This winter, we brought back pistachio lattes, rolled out Oleato nationally and launched a new core iced-shaken espresso. Our beverage is prepared with new breakfast products like our Potato, Cheddar & Chive Bakes. Some of our new products did well and drove positive customer buzz, but not all met our expectations. That reality, coupled with what our customers have told us, points to opportunity across both coffee and non-coffee. And by that, I mean refreshers, matcha and chai and across food to drive greater attach.\n Later in the quarter, we saw improvement. Our lavender platform is extremely successful, including our lavender matcha, and it compares to some of the most successful launches we've ever had. But to cut through, we're working to drive even more buzz-worthy products and on strengthening the supply of products that become popular. These efforts take time, but our team is working with great energy and speed to make both happen.\n We also invested in our brand over the past quarter to address recent misinformation. The work was effective in driving brand metrics, and our overall brand equity and affinity remains strong. As we look ahead, we have an opportunity to better amplify our new products and to drive more awareness and excitement for those products, particularly among our more occasional customers. As we will detail, we are accelerating the execution engines to help us drive more frequent and exciting product innovations, both in the core and beyond.\n Third, reach and demonstrate more value for our occasional and non-Starbucks Rewards customers. We have loyal customers in the U.S., and they stay truly loyal in terms of frequency, transactions and the level of customization they sought with their purchases. We are a brand known for the premium value we provide. Our one-of-a-kind experiential Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which elevate our brand and create lasting value, had strong transactions, fueled by innovation across our coffee platforms, other beverages and food. Throughout the quarter, brand perception of value for what I get, on average, remained strong, and our pricing decisions have been measured.\n But in this environment, many customers are being more exacting about where and how they choose to spend their money, particularly with stimulus savings mostly spent. We saw this materialize over the quarter as customers made the trade-offs between food away from home and food at home. Against that tide, we need to be able to reach and communicate with our customers in a way that demonstrates our value, particularly through Starbucks Rewards and the Starbucks app.\n We are accelerating back-end work on the Starbucks app to ensure we better connect with our more occasional customers. Starting in May, we will add new and exclusive in-app offers that create additional value for our customers. We'll also launch upgrades to the app that include significant improvements to our wait time algorithms. Then in July, we will begin opening the Starbucks app for all while making MOP available in more places outside our app. Following the milestone, more of our customers will be able to see our offers, including those that use guest checkout; and more customers will discover the strong value we provide, value that they will not see otherwise. More on that later.\n These opportunities show that much is within our control. We are confident in our accelerated plans to strengthen the execution engines that power how we serve our customers, how we create and amplify a pipeline of new products and how we reach our customers through the Starbucks app. But let me be clear. It will take time to fully realize these opportunities.\n Our Triple Shot with Two Pumps strategy is the way we will drive these plans forward over the long term. So let's talk about our progress made against each strategic pillar. Our first strategic pillar is to elevate the brand. We do this by driving compelling product innovation, building great stores and operating great stores. Above all, we maintain our leadership and innovation in coffee. In fact, just last week, we announced several steps to reinforce our leadership position to the lens of our partners, our customers and our farmers.\n These include new investments in coffee farms to further scale open agronomy practices; new and exquisite whole bean coffees coming to our core and reserve stores; and new pop-up experiences in cities around the world to engage Gen Z and Millennial customers in the craft of coffee, which they love. Further, we are scaling the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewer to deliver the world's finest top-quality brewed coffee.\n The Clover Vertica provides customers choice between 6 separate coffee roasts and blends, including decaf, brewed fresh on-demand any time of the day. And its rollout is paired to the global launch of our new Starbucks Milano Duetto light and dark roast blends in stores later this year. As mentioned, we are also driving more frequent and exciting product innovation, both coffee and non-coffee.\n Our team has been working with remarkable speed and agility to create a product innovation pipeline that includes new flavors, textures and functional benefits. Investments in product development are already showing benefit. Our new lavender platform performed nearly as well this past quarter as the PSL. More recently, too, our new Spicy refreshers and Reserve Hot Honey beverages show that relevant product innovation can exceed expectations. At our new Roastery and Reserve stores, we are now introducing new products with more agility and speed. Notably, we're also making strides to cut our average product development cycle in half from our current time table of 12 to 18 months.\n Looking to our innovation pipeline for the second half of the year, I'm excited by the number and types of products we're bringing to market. For summer, we are launching our first texture innovation, pearls. This is the first of more texture-based innovations that our customers can expect in the coming years. And we're launching a new functional product, a 0 to low-calorie handcrafted energy beverage. Both build on our coffee heritage and open entirely new vectors for additional future innovation.\n And later this year, we will add up to 5 sugar-free customization options to our menu in response to both partner and customer requests. This will provide a lower calorie option for approximately 80% of our beverages. Our product innovation pipeline will also include more plant-based options as well, like our new plant-based ready-to-drink Frappuccino beverage that recently launched in U.S. grocery stores.\n Beyond our beverage development pipeline, we're also focused on enhancements to food. As an example of the investment we're making in food quality, we recently launched a reimagined premium blueberry muffin. And for summer, we're launching a new egg, pesto and mozzarella sandwich. It combines protein with outstanding taste. We're also expanding grab-and-go choices available in our store lobbies to include more vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options as well as kid-friendly options.\n Taken together, our partner experience, unique customer experience and our core products are what differentiates us. Our pipeline is significantly stronger than last year, and product builds are being developed with partners and simplicity in mind. We're also investing in our supply chain to lower cost and ensure products are available and in-store for our customers.\n Lastly, we continue to grow our global store footprint. Our store development capability is a core strength. This year, we will design and build more than 3,000 new stores globally, and we continue to do so in a financially accretive manner. Our new store openings continue to realize strong unit economics. AUVs and ROIs across our portfolio continue to drive strong returns and high incrementality. We're also leveraging learnings from international markets to meaningfully lower breakeven points for store formats scalable in emerging markets.\n Moving on. Our second strategic pillar is further strengthening and differentiating our leadership position in digital. As mentioned, Starbucks Rewards and the Starbucks app play a central role in driving value for our customers. Our MOP set another record in the U.S., representing 31% of all transactions in the quarter. Our Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. also grew by 6% over the prior year to nearly 33 million members.\n The stickiness and evolution of our digital position provides a structural advantage. Building on this strength, we are mapping additional ways to engage customers as we work to double SR members over the next 5 years. As mentioned, we will begin opening the Starbucks app for all in July. This addresses the current gap in our ability to reach non-Starbucks Rewards members, allows us to deliver more value for the occasional customers and improves our ability to convert them to SR members.\n It drives a better experience for our customers and is core to our growth. We know that SR customers visit more often and spend more. Upgrades in our queue include a guest checkout feature and sequential improvements that make our app an even more appealing gateway for all customers.\n We also plan to invest $600 million over the next 3 years to further digitize our stores and better target customers in more personalized ways. This includes the installation of digital menu boards across the footprint of all our company stores in the U.S. and China. And we're making additional investments in our Deep Brew AI and machine learning platforms to further digitize and fine-tune how we operate our stores while delivering an improved digital customer experience and more personalized customer offers. Offers that are timely and relevant and flexible to location, inventory availability and weather. These investments, including a new revenue management system are foundational to successful execution.\n In the near term, we continue to provide increasingly compelling offers like marketed pairings, including both beverage and food, that make occasions like lunch even more appealing. We continue to encourage and reward routinized behaviors across the day with exclusive offers for SR members. To better communicate the value we provide, we are working to drive offer awareness with omnichannel marketing. This campaign will remind customers that the best offers are in the app and will target more occasional and non-SR customers.\n Our third strategic pillar is becoming truly global. Our international business remains an important part of our long-term growth strategy. Across the Middle East, we continue to work with the Alshaya Group to support the well-being of our partners and customers. Last month, The Starbucks Foundation and Alshaya Starbucks donated $3 million to the World Central Kitchen and their humanitarian efforts to provide food aid in Gaza. Last week, we also announced that every bag of whole bean Starbucks Odyssey Blend coffee sold at participating North American stores through June will benefit World Central Kitchen's efforts to address hunger around the world.\n Turning our attention to China. Macro pressures resulted in traffic contraction this quarter. Performance was impacted by a decline in occasional customers, changing holiday patterns, a high promotional environment and a normalization of customer behaviors following last year's market reopening. Like the U.S., our decline in occasional customers was most noticeable in the afternoons and evenings.\n Still, there are many bright spots. Starbucks remains the Chinese consumers' first choice in away-from-home coffee across city tier and age group. Our morning daypart in China registered growth fueled by coffee routines we've cultivated. Mornings are now larger than before the pandemic. Delivery also achieved positive comp. Starbucks Rewards membership expanded with active members now reaching a record 21 million. We're investing further to grow our SR members and their loyalty to drive greater engagement and lifetime value.\n Beverage innovation is also strong and validates the opportunity we see to further drive the strength of our product pipeline in China. Through the quarter, we unveiled 27 new products fueling brand excitement and meaningful customer engagement, and monthly customer connection scores are at their highest ever as is partner engagement.\n Our robust operating muscle led to sequential margin expansion amidst revenue headwinds, and we sustained very healthy and profitable unit economics and a double-digit store operating margin for a total store portfolio, including new stores. While recovery will remain choppy, our business has shown great resilience, and our fundamentals are very strong. We will win and lead in the premium market. We have built a strong and expanding customer base, a strong brand, a strong portfolio of highly profitable stores and strong capability to drive margin expansion.\n We continue to execute on the 3 key elements of our China strategy, offering more coffee-forward, locally relevant product innovations, making significant investments in technology to increase omnichannel capability and digitize our stores, and increase the percentage of new store openings in lower-tier markets and new county cities where we see stronger new store economics.\n We will weather through this dynamic and transitory period as the industry shakeout continues. Our confidence in the market opportunity and our ability to deliver remains unwavering as we play the long game in China. Elsewhere, we saw growth in many parts of our International segment, highlighting the resilience and diversity of our business portfolio. Excluding China, our International segment grew revenue and comp in the quarter bolstered by strength in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. The Latin American region continued its strong momentum with double-digit system sales growth. Our Asia Pacific region drove revenue growth despite headwinds in the Indonesian and Malaysian markets. And revenue from our Japan business grew by double digits. \n Across our International segment, we opened 230 net new stores this quarter. In total, our store count outside of North America is now more than 20,800, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 9%. We opened our 400th store in India, our 600th store in Indonesia and our 1,900th store in Korea. We are on track to operate 1,000 stores in India by 2028, translating 1 new store opening every 3 days.\n As we expand to Honduras and Ecuador, our global footprint will grow to more than 39,000 stores across 88 markets, putting us well on the path to 55,000 stores by 2030.\n Our fourth strategic pillar, 1 of our 2 pumps is unlocking efficiencies. In the quarter, our Triple Shot strategy continued to unlock meaningful efficiencies across the North American business, driving 150 basis points of store operational efficiencies. Additionally, we saw meaningful reductions in product and distribution costs, driven by supply chain improvements in procurement, transportation and sourcing.\n Specifically in our U.S. stores, we're focused on creating a more stable environment for partners through investments in equipment innovation, process improvements, staffing, scheduling and waste reduction, all things our partners value and prioritize, creating a more satisfying work environment in our stores while derisking our business.\n Today, our stores are running better than ever before, underpinned by the strong fundamentals our team has built. For example, we see meaningful improvement in drive-thru window times without adding more work for our partners, with even more to come as we layer in our Siren craft system. We are rebuilding and refining our supply chain and to unlock efficiencies in our factory in the back, we are leveraging technology in new ways. We have significant above-the-store opportunity to realize efficiencies in our supply chain. They are significantly higher than we initially thought, and we are ahead of plan and savings.\n Through work to date, we have the confidence we need to extend our goal from $3 billion in added efficiencies over 3 years to $4 billion over the next 4. As a result of our investments and focused efficiency efforts, partner turnover reached a new low in the quarter. Store manager turnover has also improved, and both beat industry benchmarks by a wide margin. Average hours per partner continues to improve by double digits year-over-year, increasing engagement and their take-home pay.\n That brings me to our fifth strategic pillar, reinvigorating our partner culture. From the beginning, Starbucks set itself apart as a different kind of company. Our unique culture is anchored in our mission, promises and values of craft, results, courage, belonging and joy. And at the heart of our business are our partners. They are central to the Starbucks experience and are delivering on our promise to uplift the every day for customers around the world. I see this every day and through my regular work in stores.\n We continue to work to restitch the fabric of the green apron for all partners. Just last week, we gathered together to celebrate our first-ever Starbucks Promises Day. And next month, we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of our Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University. Following commencement, more than 13,000 partners will have earned their bachelor's degree through the program, bringing to life our partner promise of a bridge to a better future. What's more, over 25,000 partners across more than 90% of our U.S. stores are currently enrolled in the program and are pursuing a bachelor's degree.\n To close, we had a tough quarter. We need to do better, and we will. As I look forward, I'm confident we have the right strategy. We have terrific partners and a strong executive team that is deeply engaged and continues to lead. I thank each of our 460,000 green apron partners around the world for their remarkable work. We have real opportunity, and we are taking swift action to accelerate investment through the execution engines that will address the near term and drive our long-term success. These actions are funded by a highly profitable operations and productivity initiatives and is captured within our guidance. As these actions take hold, we expect our business to return to algorithmic growth and to achieve its long-term opportunity.\n And with that, I will turn it over to Rachel to discuss our results in greater detail. Rachel? Sara, thank you for your question. Let me address both of them by pointing to the underlying pressures that we see consumers face just in terms of what they have available to spend. So there's no question that if you take some of these transitory headwinds out, which, of course, are not an excuse in any way, and you look at the underlying headwinds particularly around the pressures that consumers face particularly with the occasional customer, what we're seeing is that's where the challenge is. It's a challenge with their traffic and it's their challenge with them coming into our stores.\n If you look at our most loyal customers, they're coming in often. They're seeing the value that we provide in Starbucks Rewards, in our app. They are premiumizing through customization as in the past. And so therefore, what you see there is you see a strong business with our loyal customers particularly those within the environments of the Starbucks app. What we are focused on is, first, how we meet the demand we already have through ensuring that our partners have the processes and the tools at the peak in order to meet the demand of customers who, at this moment, are choosing not to complete their transactions in Mobile Order, Pay.\n The second thing is we're clearly launching new products, and our pipeline is very strong. And what we are doing, though, as part of that is the third element, is how we reach and deliver value to the more occasional customers as well as those that are not in the Starbucks Rewards ecosystem. And that's where the challenge lies. And that's how you reconcile the 2 points that you had made. So we have a lot in our control, and we are focused on it. And we're focusing on the execution of those 3 opportunities, as I laid out, in North America. Brian, thank you for your question. I think that if you look at our overall brand equity, it is and continues to be strong. If you look at the scores around value for what I get, strong. So if I look at the occasional customer, though, they're clearly making choices based on the economic pressures they face. What they look for from us is they look for variety. They look for the core. 50% of what we have in the afternoon, as an example, is coffee. So obviously, coffee is really important, and distinctiveness of coffee is very important. But they are looking for variety and they're looking for value.\n And what we're focused on is ensuring that we find a way to connect with them, to bring them into our app ecosystem in order for them to see the value that we provide inside there. That's why you're going to see the actions we take in May. You're going to see the actions that we take in July as we open up the app to all. That is going to make them, particularly in North America, be able to see the value that we provide in a way that's much easier for them. And as they build loyalty over time, they will see even more value as they come into the system. So that's as far as North America goes and the steps that we are taking. Let me first -- I'll take on the first question of global unit growth and hand over to Rachel to talk specifically about your question on China margins. Jeff, what we see is we see very strong cash and cash returns and I think what we've done both in the U.S. but also in the expansion plans that we have internationally. And I think what you see is -- what we're focused on is ensuring that we have reduced the cost of our stores and stores investment. We have done a very good job in bringing efficiency to that. And so as we expand, we see very good cash-on-cash returns.\n The reality is that the penetration we have in many of these markets and the headroom that we have internationally is very high. I mean I think, last time, we talked about the fact that, I think, we were just in 800 cities or -- in China and the opportunity for us in terms of counties is about over 3,000.\n So I think we're like -- we're not really penetrated as much as we could be in a place like China, which is why we have confidence. As we look at the real estate options we have, the proposals that are coming together, the kind of cash returns we get are very strong. That's what gives us confidence in terms of the global unit growth. Rachel, do you want to take the second part? We can hear you. I think we had some technical problems in hearing you, but let me just try and recap the question. Your first question was on competition in China and the comment around the shakeout that we are starting to see. And the second comment was on beverage pipeline.\n So let me start with the competition in China. I think the growth has taken place in the mass area of the China business, of the China overall coffee and tea segment is, one, where we see just intense price competition. We're choosing not to participate in that. We are a premium brand. We have built a business over 25 years with a great deal of competitive advantages. You can see that there. We have amazing partners in stores. We have stores that look distinctive. We have an end-to-end supply chain that, frankly, I would love to have in the U.S. And then we are steeped in coffee and the tradition of coffee in end to end as well as for the knowledge that we have in store. So we bring that to life very well in our business in China.\n At the same time, what you are seeing is the intense competition, particularly in the tea segment and it overlaps into coffee in the mass area, is one where you are seeing some of the shakeout happen in terms of the impact on people and how they can really sustain that kind of intensity. For us, our focus is on the premium end, and we're continuing to see that, right now, the headroom we have in China is large.\n I mean we're still at 13 cups per capita. Japan's at 280 and the U.S. is at 380. We know that, over time, as the Chinese consumer stops spending, what you're going to realize is that we have a business that is healthy, that has a P&L and a store operating margin level that is strong, and we're going to see that grow as the consumer gets more and more exposed to coffee. So that is what I mean by the overall competitive environment in China.\n In terms of your question about the beverage pipeline, I think that's been largely around North America. One of the things we're seeing here is we're core in coffee, and we're tremendously excited about the innovations that we're bringing with whole bean coffee and some of the coffee-forward innovations that we are seeing in our stores. But additionally, as we look at the occasional customers, they are looking for variety. And what we are doing is we're finding ways to open up new platforms of growth. \n And last time, I mentioned that there were 3 platforms. And these are foundational -- additional new introductions that we will make over time. The first one was textures. So we started with pearls with our Summer 1 program, which starts next week. We then have a handcrafted energy platform that's coming in later on in this quarter. Additionally,  plant-based is an area where we've traditionally been really well known for. So we have designed platforms and these are platforms around which you can expect to see systematic innovations that come in not just this time around, but also, you will see further more that come in around these platforms. That's how we're thinking about R&D. It's around platforms, both in beverage as well as in food. Thank you, Sharon. I think that if I look at the headwinds that we see in the market, in particular with the consumer and the pressures that they face, I think that they were sharper and more accelerated than what we expected. I think in hindsight, if I look at the situation in China, while long-term growth potential is sort of picking, we're committed to the long term in China. The recovery has been choppy. But I think what we've seen, particularly since that period is we've seen more intense price competition than what we expected. None of that takes away for the long term, but it's clear that what we had this quarter was tough. Peter, just to respond to your question, first of all, the Siren System was never put on the back burner. In fact, we're on track to having the Siren System installed in less than 10% of the stores, much as we committed. So it's on track. \n What we've added in here, though, is the underlying processes to ensure that we can reduce the wait time in the store, inside the four walls of the store. And that's what those processes are intended to do in the U.S. And so that's what the acceleration of the processes are that we have been testing. What we provide is a base on which we will continue to implement the overall Siren Systems that we showcased to you in the September Analyst Day when you were here with us and we talked to it. Do you want to take that one, Rachel? Brady, on loyalty? John, thank you for the question. I think on the question about misperception, misperception did have an impact on our business [indiscernible]. We haven't been -- we don't have a quantification for that. But what we do know is that our brand equity, the stores and the investment involved in the brand have certainly helped spending with overall perception of our brand [ we spend every year ].\n In terms of the [indiscernible] system, what we're doing first is we're tracking how [ we do with the week ], so how we essentially work with deployment in the store, how we handle what happens at peaks in terms of where people are deployed. How do we essentially [ process ] customers? And what you see is [indiscernible] there. I know we've given you a quantification of 1 percentage point. That is a conservative estimate because when it fully gets deployed and it fits, you would see even bigger improvements that happen.\n In regard to your question about the [ hot food, ] that is purely something suggesting and we're looking to accelerate. So it takes [indiscernible] to accelerate that with the work that we are doing. Andrew, thank you for your question. Everything we've seen, I know that we had a tough quarter. But everything we see in terms of the opportunities that lie ahead, as you look at the opportunities we have across [indiscernible], the innovation that we [ see ] in terms of the pipeline going forward [indiscernible] beyond. If you look at the productivity opportunities, the store count opportunities [indiscernible], we believe we'll be back [indiscernible]. And we see no change in the long-term outlook that we set earlier in this [ business ]. Thank you for your question. [indiscernible] and we have no intention of like going across the board and [indiscernible] what we are doing is we are [indiscernible] the fact that as [indiscernible] levels of [indiscernible] our brand overall right now [ that for what I can ] is still very strong [indiscernible]. So we feel very good about that. And this is more about how we [ move ] and how we [ manage ] customers, particularly those that don't [indiscernible] that is what we intend to do. Thank you for joining us. We had a tough quarter, but we have a clear action plan that the management team and I are [indiscernible] thank you for joining us, and we appreciate the time you're taking this afternoon."

            "name": "Brady Brewer",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren. You talked about the year-over-year increase but quarter-over-quarter declines of Starbucks Rewards members. And I think, just to be clear, that is in terms of 90-day frequency, so we still have a very large population of SR members. So it's about frequency of those customers.\n So I think consistent with the consumer pullback, the more occasional and very occasional SR members, those ones visited less frequently within the quarter. As a result of that, we saw fewer 90-day actives quarter-over-quarter. That said, the 6% growth year-over-year, we're continuing to grow SR. MOP grew in the quarter, so we still have a very active customer base setting record high for MOP. Delivery grew double digits in the quarter, and we see a very active digital customer.\n And I think as Laxman talked about with regard to how we're going to provide SR and traffic in the coming quarters, this is squarely aligned to this challenge. It's reactivating SR members, bringing them back and demonstrating value and driving frequency through the app and through SR. And we have a lot of great programs lined up [indiscernible] there."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. As Laxman shared, our performance this quarter did not reflect what we're capable of as a company. We have an incredible brand, loyal customers globally, a strong portfolio of highly profitable stores and in connection with our partners and customers that's unlike any other in our industry. We know that we can and we will do better.\n While it was a difficult quarter, we learned from our own underperformance and recognize the onus is on us to execute. We've sharpened our focus and with our comprehensive road map of well-thought out actions, the path forward is clear. With that, let me turn to our results.\n Our Q2 consolidated revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1% from the prior year due primarily to a 4% decline in comparable store sales driven by lower transactions, partially offset by 8% net new company-operated store growth over the prior year. Q2 consolidated operating margin contracted 140 basis points from the prior year to 12.8%, primarily driven by deleverage, partner wages and benefit investments as well as promotional activities, partially offset by pricing and our continued execution against reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, which drove approximately 150 basis point savings in the quarter. Q2 EPS was down -- was $0.68, down 7% from the prior year, primarily due to the contraction of operating income in both the North America and International segments as a result of lower revenue.\n I'll now provide segment highlights for Q2. North America revenue was $6.4 billion in Q2, flat to the prior year as 5% net new company-operated store growth was mostly offset by a 3% decline in comparable store sales driven by a 7% decrease in transactions partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket. Our U.S. company-operated business posted a 3% comparable store sales decline in Q2, driven by a 7% decrease in transactions.\n Consistent with Q1, the traffic decline was pronounced among more occasional customers with a more cautious consumer environment as a backdrop and also included an estimated 3% adverse impact from extreme weather, including some store closures. Partially offsetting the decline was a 4% increase in average ticket, reflecting pricing as well as the continued mix shift into cold beverages such as Iced Shaken Espresso and Matcha Tea Latte, which resonate with our customers.\n Additionally, our new store performance remains strong, with both year 1 AUV and cash margin of recently opened stores projected to be in line with last year's newly opened stores, preserving high incrementality even with our expanding footprint. North America's operating margin was 18% in Q2, contracting 120 basis points from the prior year. The contraction was primarily driven by deleverage, partner wage and benefit investments as well as promotional activities, partially offset by pricing and reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies.\n While deleverage drove the overall contraction in the segment's margin, efficiencies generated through our reinvention efforts meaningfully countered the deleverage we experienced in the quarter. While our reinvention plan is intended to provide a more balanced growth model and margin expansion, we're pleased to see the benefits counterbalance, broader headwinds in our business as our partner staffing and scheduling investments continue to unlock in-store efficiencies.\n The benefits continue to expand outside of stores as well, resulting in meaningful reduction in the segment's product and distribution costs as a percentage of revenue, partially driven by supply chain savings. We believe our strategies related to reinvention are working, creating more streamlined operations and tangible financial benefits across our business with more opportunity to come.\n Moving to International. The segment delivered $1.8 billion in revenue in the quarter, roughly flat to the prior year, primarily as 12% growth in net new company-operated stores was offset by a 6% decline in comparable store sales driven evenly by transactions and average ticket. Revenue was also impacted by a decrease in licensed store revenues, largely resulting from the negative impacts to our business in the Middle East. Although our revenue was impacted, our long-term aspirations in international has not wavered as there was revenue and comp growth across the International segment when excluding China. This speaks to the strength of our broader international portfolio, driven by markets like Japan, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.\n Shifting to China. In Q2, China's revenue declined 3%, driven by an 11% decrease in comparable store sales consisting of 8% and 4% declines in average ticket and transactions, respectively, partially offset by a 14% net new store growth. The market continued to recover slower than expected with further impacts from the timing of holiday-related travel trends. Despite the complex environment, the market opened 118 net new stores in the quarter while sustaining double-digit store operating margin for both new stores and the total portfolio, demonstrating the health and resilience of our brand in the market, positioning us well in the market long term. Total International segment operating margin was 13.3% in Q2, contracting 340 basis points from the prior year primarily driven by promotional activities, partner wage and benefit investments as well as sales mix shift partially offset by pricing in certain markets.\n Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue of $418 million in Q2 declined 13% from the prior year, largely in line with our expectations given the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee and SKU optimization. Importantly, we maintained the #1 share position in both U.S. at-home coffee and U.S. ready to drink.\n As an example of innovation in China, we launched our Starbucks Refreshers platform with 2 flavors, the Pink Drink and the Purple Drink, to drive our much-desired cool portfolio beyond our stores, particularly among Gen Z. The segment's operating margin was 51.7% in Q2, expanding 1,610 basis points from prior year, driven primarily by growth in our North America coffee partnership joint venture income as well as lapping prior year impairment charges against certain manufacturing assets. The segment's operating margin is progressing in line with our original expectations, continuing to target the full year range of high 40% to low 50%, a very attractive financial model.\n Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal year 2024. Given what we shared today, we're revising our fiscal year guidance, and I'll walk through both, one, what changed; and two, what remains the same in comparison to our previous guidance.\n So first, what changed? Broadly, in the second quarter, our business underperformed as revenues in the U.S., China, Middle East and other markets were impacted more deeply than anticipated by the continued multifaceted headwinds. In addition to the second quarter performance, our exit rates of both revenue and comp growth across our key markets reflect continued headwinds.\n To manage these headwinds, we have focused actions both to unlock capacity and track demand in the spirit of uplifting traffic as well as to further implement our Triple Shot strategy. Leveraging our learnings from the second quarter, and as Laxman discussed in detail, we're working to further elevate our brand through an integrated focus across product innovation and marketing, including strengthening our digital capabilities, delivering more value for our customers.\n For instance, first, to unlock demand in the morning daypart in the U.S., we're working to improve store-related processes, leveraging our Siren craft system while also increasing product availability through improved inventory management. Second, to attract demand, particularly in the afternoon daypart, we're implementing a new and more frequent innovation cadence integrated with a broader multi-channeled marketing approach, inclusive of highly targeted personalized offers.\n This shift is geared towards our more occasional customers to attract and inject them to our stores and apps. Now some of these actions will take time to fully materialize. However, through our investments in our customer experience and focused execution, we do expect to deliver some benefit in the current fiscal year. As a result of what has changed, our revenue and comp guidance as well as the related flow-through to margin and earnings is impacted. In addition, the continued headwinds impacted our global store growth expectations.\n Now before I share the details of our revised fiscal year 2024 guidance, I'll share what remains the same. First, we have confidence in the effectiveness of our proven Triple Shot strategy, as our biggest opportunity lies in our execution.\n Second, our efficiency efforts are tracking slightly ahead of our expectations. Year-to-date, we achieved 170 basis points of in-store operational efficiencies along with great progress out of store, positioning us to deliver our $3 billion savings target through fiscal year 2026 with line of sight to even more opportunity beyond that.\n Third, while our Channel Development segment is the smallest of our segments, it complements our portfolio, capturing customer occasions beyond our stores; and our performance in that segment continues to deliver. Lastly, we must continue investing in the fundamentals and competitive moat of our business, our partners, our stores and our customers, as we believe these investments will drive long-term growth and industry leadership beyond these transitory headwinds.\n Based on these facts, we are revising our full year fiscal 2024 guidance to: global revenue growth of low single digits from our previous range of 7% to 10%; global and U.S. comps of low single-digit decline to flat, both from the previous range of 4% to 6% growth; China comp of single-digit decline from the previous expectation of low single-digit growth in Q2 through Q4; global net new store growth of approximately 6% from our previous expectation of approximately 7%. We continue to expect our U.S. store count to grow by approximately 4% and now anticipate approximately 12% store growth in China from our previous expectation of approximately 13%; operating margin growth of approximately flat from the previous expectation of progressive expansion. Finally, we expect EPS and non-GAAP EPS growth of flat to low single digits from the previous range of 15% to 20%.\n As a reminder, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation and assumes constant currency. As an additional insight into our fiscal year 2024 guidance, we expect sequential revenue growth from Q3 to Q4 with pressure on margin and earnings easing in Q4 as our action plans take hold. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate in the mid-20% range. Lastly, we continue to expect approximately $3 billion in CapEx, most of which is ring-fenced for our direct investment in our global store portfolio, which, as we have shared, continues to drive highly attractive returns.\n In summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, Q2 was a challenging quarter for us as headwinds consistently persisted throughout the quarter leading us to revamp our actions and response plans to both unlock and attract demand. Second, our Triple Shot strategy continues to deliver efficiencies even in the face of headwinds, reinforcing that we have the right strategy at the right time. Next, our fiscal year 2024 guidance has been revised to reflect our Q2 performance, year-to-date results as well as the near-term headwinds we're experiencing. We, however, remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity and thus, committed to our strategy and the related investments. And finally, our disciplined approach to capital allocation drives our financial fortitude, reflecting shareholder commitment underpinned by our best-in-class dividend. This allows us to preserve both balance sheet durability and flexibility, positioning us to successfully navigate this complex and dynamic environment. \n Before I open the call to Q&A, I want to share my sincerest gratitude for my partners, both in and out of stores across the globe who show up every day living our values to deliver the differentiated customer experience that makes Starbucks so special for all of us. Thank you, partners.\n Operator, you can now open the call to Q&A. And if I would just add to that, when we look at the guidance that was given around our new store growth, particularly as it relates to China, that's really a very deliberate decision that we took to be able to increase the number of stores that we were opening in lower-tier cities and new counties where we see even stronger returns. So broadly, our returns are quite attractive, but they're even stronger in those lower-tier cities and the new counties. And as a result of that, that shift actually impacts our development pipeline. So there's a timing impact in terms of new store growth. So that's why we're at 12%, which we think is still a very strong growth and indicative of the opportunity that we see\n [Technical Difficulty] Sure. Yes. Thank you, Lauren. I'll start with the comp and what I spoke about in my prepared remarks about the exit rate. And lavender was quite successful for us. As you heard in Laxman's prepared remarks, what we are encouraged by is that lavender both to what our customers, particularly Gen Z and Millennial customers, are asking about, which is more new more often and a broader offering, so offering, meaning coffee, non-coffee, food, healthier choices. And so we hit squarely with that with lavender by having particularly our most popular offering in lavender was the Iced Lavender Matcha Latte and so that shows that when we innovate well, we exceed our own expectations.\n That was later in the quarter. So it did do something for us in terms of driving customers into the afternoon. Largely, we saw that platform resonate well in the afternoon with our customers. The Latte, we'll tend to do more in the morning, but broadly, lavender, a hit in the afternoon. So we see that, that overall offering and how we're trying to address the customer -- more occasional customer with that worked well.\n But what I would say is that it was later in the quarter. We've got more opportunities coming going forward. And as a result of that, our exit rate in the quarter still reflected continued headwinds, which we're reflecting in our guidance for the back half of the year. What we're expecting with the plans that we've outlined today will help us counterbalance some of those headwinds, particularly as we see those actions start to take place.\n So I think it's important to think about there are consumer headwinds in there. Our plans will counterbalance that. And as we go after some of those challenges, I think the other thing to remember is that we are coming with a position of strength as it relates to the efficiencies around our Triple Shot as well as the growth we have in new stores and the strength we're seeing in our portfolio overall. We have a very strong portfolio, a profitable portfolio that will help us, and our brand is strong. So we look at all of that, and that's how we're thinking about the exit rates of comp as well as what we're seeing for comps in the back half of the year. So hopefully, that provides a little more texture.

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Laxman.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you, Tiffany, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. I will start by sharing an overview of our business performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2024. I will then turn it over to Rachel Ruggeri to walk through the detailed segment results. We saw strong momentum and a highly successful holiday in the quarter with record revenue and expanded margins. We saw strong growth in our loyalty programs, sequentially increased in frequency and record spend among our loyal customers. Positive traction from new product innovations, exciting momentum in China with our focus on premium, and progress on the execution Triple Shot strategy. We also saw some unexpected headwinds which impacted the rate of growth. We feel very confident about our robust plans to address these challenges. While we are already seeing traction, there was an impact in the quarter, and it will take some time to normalize. Let me walk you through the details. Our performance in the quarter was fundamentally strong. Our Q1 total company revenue was a record $9.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Our global comparable store sales grew 5% year-over-year, supported by a 5% comp growth in North America, driven by 4% ticket growth, and 10% comp growth in China. Our global operating margins expanded by 130 basis points to 15.8% and our overall earnings per share grew 20% to $0.90. This speaks to the continued successful execution of our reinvention plan and the durable business we are building. We are fortunate to have built one of the strongest brands in the world and we continue to benefit from customer loyalty. Throughout the quarter, we saw our most loyal customers around the world coming into our stores more often. Specifically in the US, we set new records with our 90-day active reward members growing 13% year-over-year to a record 34.3 million, with tender reaching an all-time high of 59%, demonstrating increased engagement. Importantly, the frequency of our most loyal customers increased sequentially and spend per member reached a record in Q1, fueled by our holiday promotion which significantly exceeded our expectations. Our cold and gingerbread platforms drove a record high ticket in the US in the quarter. We also had the highest sales of Starbucks gift cards in our history, making us number two in gift cards sold. In total, we have an incredible $3.6 billion preloaded onto our cards in the US in the quarter. In short, our growing Starbucks Rewards members are visiting our stores more frequently and increasing their spend each time that they come. We also saw great momentum in China. We aim to be the best in the premium market in China. Our brand equity across Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve is second to none. Based on our latest brand tracker, Starbucks continues to be the first choice in away from home coffee, including among the Gen Z consumers. We continue to lead in brand affinity and have the highest awareness, brand familiarity, and purchase-intent scores. We have the most outstanding partners in our stores, with very strong customer connection, and the highest retention rates in our industry. We offer distinctive global and locally relevant product innovation anchored on superior coffee with food attachments and a morning daypart that now has surpassed pre-COVID levels. Our loyal customers, a major part of tender, are coming more often, and our loyalty program is growing. We're doing all of this while offering premium physical and digital experiences delivered across our distinctive store portfolio, across other physical channels and through our digital connection and doing so at a commensurate value. This ambition being best in premium in China is in line with our long-term growth ambitions for China. Let me now talk about the headwinds and our response. We entered the first quarter very strong globally, we had great momentum in August and September and that continued into October, which exceeded our expectations across every measure. Beginning in mid-November, while our business continued to grow, the growth rate was impacted by three unexpected factors. First, we saw a negative impact to our business in the Middle East. Second, events in the Middle East also had an impact in the US, driven by misperceptions about our position. Our most loyal customers remained loyal and in fact increased their frequency and spend in the quarter. But we did see a softening of US traffic. Specifically, our occasional US customers who tend to visit in the afternoon came in less frequently. I will speak in a moment as to how we quickly responded with an effective action plan. Finally, we experienced a slower than expected recovery in China, driven by a more cautious consumer. While we had a relatively very strong 11/11 holiday, the overall market weakness led to significantly increased pricing competition. We responded quickly to these headwinds. In the US, we implemented targeted offers aimed at bringing our occasional customers into our loyalty program. As we've seen over time, Starbucks Rewards members develop a routinized long-term relationship with our brand that increases both ticket and transactions. Additionally, we activated new capabilities within our proprietary deep Deep Brew data analytics and AI tool to identify and incentivize specific Rewards members cohorts. Finally, we are leaning further into our brand marketing and factual narrative and social media to engage these audiences where they are. We've already seen the positive impact of these new initiatives with our more occasional customers beginning to rebound in December. However, we continue to see further opportunity to welcome back our very occasional customers. We feel good about the trajectory over the course of the quarter, but it will take time for our plans to be fully realized. In China, we remain very confident in the long term. The market is going through a transition as we see an increase in mass market competitors, which we believe will shake out over time, and the market will emerge looking fundamentally different than what we see today. We expect a much larger and tiered market as per capita consumption continues to increase and the market matures. There are three key elements in our China strategy. First, we are offering more coffee forward, locally relevant product innovations and we're increasing engagement in social media channels through influences and partnerships, which are highly effective in China. These actions are increasing awareness and have led to greater customer frequency. Second, we have made significant investments in technology, increasing our omni-channel capability, allowing us to serve more customers through new occasions. These investments have also led to a more digitized store environment, increasing efficiency of our supply chain and stores, while enhancing the partner experience and strengthening our unit economics in both existing and new stores. Finally, we're increasing the percentage of new stores opening in lower tier markets and new county cities, where we see meaningfully stronger new store economics. As you can see, we moved quickly to respond and implement a plan to address these unexpected headwinds. It will take time for these action plans to be fully realized. That said, we remain confident in our Triple Shot strategy and our long-term growth. So let me share some of the progress in the quarter. Our first Triple Shot Reinvention priority is to elevate our brand by operating great stores and driving product innovation. The best lever for elevating our brand is our store experience. We continue to raise the bar on running great stores with a focus on enhancing both our partner and customer experience. One example is the continued rollout of our Siren System cold and food stations. We remain on track to have approximately 10% of our stores equipped with a Siren System by the end of this year. We are a coffee company, and we will continue to lead with coffee innovation. We're continuing the installation of our Clover Vertica in nearly 10% of our US company-operated stores in the quarter. We are on track to have on-demand single-cup brewers installed in nearly 60% of our US company-operated stores in fiscal year 2024. This will continue to elevate our coffee offering while also making partners more productive by reducing waste and creating efficiencies in store, allowing them to spend more time doing what they do best, connecting with our customers. Just imagine, a perfectly brewed on-demand cup of coffee at any time throughout the day, even decaf. This quality and the offering are like no other in the industry. We also continue to offer coffee blends which are distinctive and remind people of the romance of coffee. Our Verona blend is anchored in the essence of Verona, Italy. It was our tribute to the city of romance in Italy. In celebration of our five years in Italy, we will introduce a new coffee, Starbucks Milano Roast, inspired by the art and culture of Milan. Milan's miart, an international modern and contemporary art fair, is the perfect backdrop to a launch in our Milan Roastery that will then scale globally. The moment will capture our love of coffee, the passion of our partners, and the dynamism of Milano. Today, we're excited to launch the Oleato platform with Oleato customizations across the US. In the coming weeks, we will also launch Chocolate Covered Strawberry Creme Frappuccino and a Chocolate Hazelnut Cookie Cold Brew in time for Valentine's Day. Starting this week and continuing over the next few months, we will be introducing three new beverage platforms, each of which is squarely aimed at our Gen Z and millennial customers across a range of coffee and cold beverages and compelling for the afternoon. These product innovations are examples of how we continuously elevate the brand and welcome customers back with a unique Starbucks experience. We're also offering new and exciting options beyond coffee, including food that appeals to different dayparts, especially the afternoon. In January, we added new menu items, including the Potato, Cheddar & Chive Bakes and the Chicken, Maple Butter & Egg Sandwich. These are products that tide our customers over between lunch and dinner. Importantly, our digital experience makes attaching food to afternoon drink orders easy and convenient. We've seen a very positive customer response to these new items and we are expanding inventory to meet the strong demand. We're also pleased with the pace of our new store openings and strong unit economics. Our most recent age class of company operated new stores in the US is averaging unit volumes of approximately $2 million with ROIs of approximately 50%. And as we continue to open more stores, growing by approximately 4% this year in the US on a base of over 16,000, including licensed stores, we will further invest in purpose-built stores to meet our customers where they need and want us to be. This includes drive-throughs which have grown by over 500 stores since Q1 of last year. Even in the US, we see abundant greenfield opportunity ahead. Our second strategic priority is further strengthening and differentiating our leadership position in digital. We saw our mobile order and pay surpass a record high 30% of all transactions in the quarter. And we reduced downtime of mobile order and pay by half, as we continued to find ways to deliver a better customer experience. We'll continue to make the Starbucks app even better, including adding the ability to use a personal cup in ordering through the app, and the rollout of more accurate order wait times. We're also laser focused on ensuring our customers can personalize their orders in whatever way they want. One example is helping customers find products based on dietary needs. We saw record results in our US delivery business with growth of nearly 80% year-over-year, aided by our expanded partnership with DoorDash. We see significant growth for continued incremental growth as delivery represents only 2% of our transactions. Our purpose-built stores optimized for delivery and fulfillment help seize this opportunity. Additionally, we are conducting a pilot with Gopuff, targeting a fully incremental opportunity for overnight orders between 5:00 PM and 5:00 AM. In this pilot, Starbucks trained baristas prepare handcrafted Starbucks drinks and food inside Gopuff micro-fulfillment centers, delivering to the customer's door in about 30 minutes. To further expand the reach and impact of mobile ordering and rewards, we now offer Starbucks Connect in over 40% of our more than 6,700 US licensed stores with further expansion planned for this year. We're also pleased to share that Bank of America will be our next Starbucks Rewards partner, delivering even more value to our most loyal customers. This opportunity builds with the great success of our partnership at Delta Airlines that is deep in connection and engagement with our members, and is one of two new Starbucks Rewards partnerships we told you we would roll out this year. Our third strategic priority is becoming truly global. Our international business represents an important growth opportunity for us over the long term. If you look at our business excluding the headwinds, we had a strong quarter, demonstrating the momentum and resiliency across the portfolio. We opened over 420 net new stores in the quarter, a growth of 10% year-over-year, bringing total store count to over 20,600 stores with nearly 14,000 of those stores outside of China and the US. In Japan, we reached a milestone of 1,900 stores across the market with much opportunity ahead. Let me address our business in the Middle East. I am deeply distressed by the violence shaking the region. As I have shared, Starbucks condemns violence against the innocent, hate and weaponized speech. We are intensely focused on supporting our partners and the many other stakeholders affected by what is taking place. We have seen a significant impact on traffic and sales in the region, and we are working with our licensees during this time to ensure the safety and well-being of our partners and our customers. I shared earlier in my remarks how we are addressing the near-term situation in China. Overall, our business and brand in China remain strong. Our revenue in the quarter grew 20% in constant currency, underpinned by a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth as the market lapped prior year mobility restrictions. As we strengthen our position in the premium market in China, let me point to a few accomplishments of the quarter. We launched 12 new coffee forward beverages in the quarter, including Intenso, which was incredibly popular with our customers, including Gen Z, fueling the morning daypart, which is now larger than pre-COVID levels. Our digital channels accounted for a record 52% of sales, up 4 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. Our Starbucks Rewards Gold member frequency increased by nearly 10% over the prior quarter with total member engagement setting a record 73% of tender, demonstrating the stability of our most loyal customers. Our new stores continue to deliver attractive returns on both the top line and profitability, with further strength in unit economics in stores opened in new county cities. And our turnover amongst full-time store partners reached a record low in the quarter, coupled with an all-time high partner satisfaction score. Early this month we celebrated our 25th anniversary in China. With nearly 7,000 stores, we have built a durable business. We have built a terrific brand, and we are well on track to hit our 9,000 store target by 2025 and continue to have full confidence in the market opportunity. We continue to see enormous potential in China's premium market, and no one is better positioned to lead in this space. Even as we navigate a dynamic environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth in our international segment. As part of elevating our brand across the international segment, along with a second reserve store in India, we will open two additional Starbucks roasteries that celebrate coffee, art and design in markets outside the US and China. We will announce these locations and opening timings in due course. Turning to our fourth priority, we've focused on unlocking $3 billion in efficiencies, and I'm pleased to say that we're making steady progress. Our Triple Shot Reinvention efforts delivered 130 basis points of margin expansion in the first quarter of the fiscal year. As you've heard me say often, the key to our success is the experience that our partners create for our customers. We're investing in a better experience for our partners to advance our business through a more balanced growth model as we unlock efficiency. In the quarter, we have seen the effectiveness of the reinvention-driven investments we have made in in-store operational efficiencies, such as standards, equipment innovation, and scheduling improvements, leading to a more stable environment for our partners. Turnover has decreased by 5% year-over-year and is now well below pre-COVID levels. Average partner hours increased 10%, leading to a 14 percentage point increase in partner sentiment related to scheduling, specifically preferred hours, which we know is important to partners. We are listening to our partners and investing to make their experience better. Of course, we have more work to do, but we are proud of the progress we have made to date. Outside of our stores, we're working to drive efficiencies across our supply chain and expenses. I am pleased with the progress and we remain on track to unlock [few billion] (ph) dollars in efficiencies over the next three years. Our final priority is reinvigorating our partner culture. In addition to the investments in partner experience, we're focused on partner culture. Our leadership team and Board of Directors have been deeply engaged in putting the partner experience at the heart of the business. An independent assessment found that our strategic investments, greater on the ground support, a dedicated labor relations team, and more bespoke management trading are having a tangible impact on the commitments we've made to our partners. The assessment was also clear that there has been no union busting playbook at Starbucks. I want to be clear in my view on the matter of unionization at Starbucks. We believe in a direct relationship with our partners, and in the 4% of our stores in the US where our partners have chosen to be represented by a union, we are committed to finding a constructive path forward with those unions. I care deeply about our partners, their experiences and safety at Starbucks and their futures. Our partners remain core to the success of our business. And I am proud to be restitching the fabric of the green apron for all partners. Going forward, we plan to continue to focus deeply on reinvigorating our partner culture. It's a priority for me and I'll continue spending time each month working up close, shoulder to shoulder with partners in stores. I did this during my visit to India earlier this month and I will continue doing it to stay grounded in the realities of the business. Good and not so good. I'm also proud to have earned my Coffee Master black apron along with my executive leadership team. A deep connection to partners and to coffee is a top priority for me and for every leader at Starbucks. As you look ahead to what is brewing for Starbucks in 2024, I have great optimism. We have a strong strategy. Our refreshed mission, values and promises are underpinning everything we do. We have many strengths to build on and a clear plan to navigate this dynamic environment. While it will take time, we are confident we have significant headroom to further grow top line and bottom line in the long term and invest in our partners and the business while delivering strong shareholder returns. Finally, before I turn this over to Rachel, I want to remind everyone that Starbucks is focused on human connection. We stand for belonging. We stand for joy. We stand for humanity. That is what differentiates our brand and our business and has for the last 52 years. We believe this has never been more important in the world. And with that, Rachel.\nRachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that I am so proud of the significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth we delivered in our first quarter despite the top line headwinds we experienced. Our strong focus on reinvention continued to unlock efficiencies, driving a balanced outcome where both revenue growth and margin expansion drove our earnings growth. As we have shared, we are unlocking multiple paths to support our earnings growth over the long term, creating a more durable business and this quarter proved testament to that durability. Our Q1 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, up over 8% from the prior year, even with the confluence of factors adversely impacting our business, as Laxman discussed in detail at the top of our call. The revenue increase was driven by 5% comparable store sales growth, 8% net new company operated store growth, as well as a 6% increase in our global licensed store revenue over the prior year, underscoring the strength of our broader portfolio and our execution. Q1 consolidated operating margin expanded 130 basis points from the prior year to 15.8%, primarily driven by sales leverage and reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, partially offset by our continued investments in our partners. Our reinvention has successfully driven resiliency in our business, with our North America margin expanding a notable 280 basis points in the quarter, which I will discuss in further detail in a moment. Q1 EPS was $0.90, up 20% from the prior year. Our strong double-digit EPS growth in the quarter demonstrates multiple paths to drive growth and profitability. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q1. North America delivered another quarter of record revenue in Q1 with $7.1 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by a combination of a 5% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 4% and 1% increase in average ticket and transactions respectively, as well as net new company operated growth of 4% over the prior year. Our US licensed store business also contributed to the segment's growth from increased travel and further rollout of our Starbucks Connect program. Our US company operated business delivered 5% comparable store sales growth in Q1, driven by 4% ticket growing from pricing, mix, and customization. This led us to having our highest average ticket in our 50-plus year history, as our successful holiday innovation and complementary product offerings, including our new Chai Tea Latte and Sugar Plum Cheese Danish, resonated with customers. Comparable transactions for the quarter increased 1% as traffic was pressured to negative single digits in November before it started to rebound in December. In light of the pressure traffic, and as Laxman mentioned earlier, customers showed strong loyalty through our Starbucks Rewards program with record engagement and the highest ever spend per member. North America's operating margin was 21.4% in Q1, expanding 280 basis points from the prior year, driven by 240 basis points from reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, as well as sales leverage and pricing, partially offset by continued investment in our partners. This substantial margin expansion in the quarter reflected the meaningful labor staffing and scheduling improvements we made as part of our reinvention. We unlocked significant stability by focusing on staffing and scheduling hours based on partners preferred shifts, which enhanced both our partners experience and subsequent store performance. We saw a store efficiency increase as items per labor hour reached its highest levels in the quarter. Outside of stores, we reaped the benefits of enhanced sourcing and waste reductions in the first quarter, as seen by improvement in the segment's product and distribution costs. When you think about the operational efficiencies that continue to manifest both in and out of stores, we expect to continue delivering progressive margin expansion. Moving to international. The segment delivered $1.8 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 12% from the prior year. The revenue growth was driven by a 12% increase in net new company-operated stores year-over-year, as well as a 7% increase in comparable store sales, driven by 11% transaction growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in average ticket. As Laxman mentioned, the pace of recovery in China was slower than expected. That, coupled with a negative impact to our business in the Middle East, pressured our international segment as a whole. However, we continue to see these headwinds as transitory and remain committed to our long-term growth ambitions in the segment. In Q1, China's revenue grew 20%, driven by 15% new store growth, as well as a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth, including 21% transaction growth, largely related to the market lapping prior year COVID impact. Comparable ticket, however, declined 9% due to mix shift, including lower sales of merchandise and increased promotional environment. The market opened 169 net new stores and entered 28 new county cities in the quarter, serving as a proof point that our commitment to expanding our premium position in the market has not wavered. Total international segment operating margin was 13.1% in Q1, contracting 110 basis points from the prior year. The contraction was primarily driven by investments in partner wages and benefits, business mix shift as a greater portion of the segment's revenue was generated in our company-operated markets versus the prior year and strategic investments, partially offset by sales leverage. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue of $448 million in Q1 declined 7% from the prior year, largely in line with our expectations given the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee. Our business continues to resonate with customers as Starbucks maintained the number one share position in both US At Home coffee and US Ready to Drink in the first quarter as our holiday offerings such as Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread were among customer favorites. The segment's operating margin was 46.8% in Q1, down 60 basis points from prior year, driven by product costs in Global Coffee Alliance, partially offset by business makeshift. Although there was contraction in the first quarter, we continue to expect the segment's full-year operating margin to expand to the high 40% to low 50% range and be accretive to our total company margin. Now, moving on to our guidance for fiscal year 2024. We are confident that the business pressures we experienced in the first quarter are transitory. With that, our guidance shared at our reinvention update in November remains unchanged related to our global store growth, operating margin, and EPS. However, given the collective magnitude of headwinds on our first quarter revenue and the time it will take for our action plans to be realized, we are revising our full year outlook for revenue and comp to reflect our Q1 results, as well as account for recent trends, including a softer than planned January, which we expect will impact our Q2 performance. With that, we now expect our full year global revenue growth in the range of 7% to 10%, revised from our previous range of the low end of 10% to 12%. Full year global and US comp growth in the range of 4% to 6%, both revised from the previous range of 5% to 7%. China comp growth of low single digits for the balance of the year, revised from the previous range of 4% to 6% in Q2 through Q4 with higher comp in Q1. Just to be clear, we continue to expect to deliver full year global store growth at approximately 7%, progressive operating margin expansion on a full-year basis, full-year EPS and non-GAP EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20% as we have multiple paths to such earnings growth as we demonstrated in the first quarter. As an additional insight, here are a few clarification items related to guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation and assumes constant currency. In terms of quarterly shape, we expect growth rates for our global revenue, comp, operating margin, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP EPS to be the lowest in Q2 and meaningfully below our full fiscal year guidance ranges due to the pressures we discussed in today's call. These metrics are then expected to rebound and stabilize in the second half of our fiscal year. While we continue to expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the mid-20% range, they are expected to be meaningfully higher than our fiscal year 2023 tax rate of 23.6%, which benefited from certain discrete non-recurring tax items. Finally, our disciplined capital allocation approach continues to deliver significant results. The combination of revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital underpinned by the disciplined capital allocation increased our Q1 cash from operations to a record $2.4 billion. Our strong cash generation, together with our leverage and investment grade rating, creates exceptional shareholder returns while maintaining balance sheet flexibility to fund our critical investments, creating a competitive advantage. In summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, our Triple Shot Reinvention is continuing to unlock our greatest potential, evidenced by the strong operating margin performance and balanced earnings growth in the first quarter in spite of the pressured environment. Next, our revenue and comp guidance has been revised to reflect our Q1 results and expected near-term and transitory headwinds. But importantly, despite these headwinds, we remain committed to our full-year fiscal 2024 EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20%. Further, we have robust plans to navigate through the complex and dynamic environment and recognize our plans will take time to materialize, but remain confident in our long-term growth. And finally, our focused and disciplined approach to capital allocation drives our financial fortitude and balance sheet optionality, keeping us in a position of strength. Before I close, I want to thank all the partners across the globe who consistently find ways to create joy and foster connection to and with our customers. You give me the confidence that our best days are yet to come. So, thank you, partners. With that, I'll turn it back to Tiffany.\nTiffany Willis: Thank you, Rachel. Before we open the call to Q&A, we request that your questions today be focused on the quarterly performance that we just discussed, as this call is not to address questions related to recent proxy filing. With that, Diego, let's take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just a question on the fiscal \u201824 guidance. I appreciate that you tempered the comp growth for both the US and China. For the US, it looks like it's only a point and China, it's only a few points, but we would define that, I guess, as modestly. And, you mentioned that fiscal 2Q is expected well below the targets before accelerating the rest of the year. So with that as backdrop, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about, I think you mentioned January has been softer than expected, any color you could provide there? And otherwise, your confidence in that new guidance, it does seem like it implies a rather sharp acceleration in the back half of the year. I'm just wondering how you think about the guidance relative to maybe tempering it further and not having that risk if perhaps the recovery doesn't play out as fast as you might be expecting? Thank you.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Yeah. Thank you, Jeffrey. This is Rachel. As it relates to our guidance, when we look at our revised revenue guidance, it's based on the performance we saw in Q1, as well as the near-term and transitory headwinds that we've spoken about. With that, we expect Q2 will be below the full-year guidance ranges, largely due to the fact it\u2019s going to take some time for our plans to materialize, as well as we'll continue to see impacts to our business in the Middle East. But what gives us confidence in that revenue range is the fact that we still have a very strong and growing loyal customer base. We're having increased capability as it relates to our digital programs around the world. And we've also seen that our reinvention has been very successful in helping us to meet increasing demand. Most specifically in this quarter, we saw really strong demand supported in our morning daypart, our busiest daypart in our US business. And we actually exceeded both prior year, the year before, and we're right on line with pre-COVID level. So we're encouraged by that overall just in terms of transactions. And in addition to that, as we talked about in the call, we're confident that we have multiple levers to be able to drive our earnings growth. Revenue growth is one factor, and we believe we've got growth in that guidance range. That will help drive margin expansion through -- flow through. But in addition to that, we have in-store and out-of-store efficiencies that we're seeing great success with. And so that gives us some confidence that we have a balanced path and multiple leverage to be able to drive that earnings growth of 15% to 20% on a full year basis.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon. Could you talk more about kind of the specific plans to drive sort of the occasional customer? And it sounds like you would expect some pretty solid improvement in US sales as we go through the year. It sounds like what was new was some new product platforms. Could you just elaborate on how quickly you think those will work, what might be coming on the product side that drives your confidence in US sales?\nLaxman Narasimhan: Sure, let me start and I'll call on Brady a bit, to provide some more color. As we said earlier, what we saw in the US was a quarter that was actually very strong till about the middle of November. And what you see in the results, very strong performance of the loyal customers, very strong holiday performance, very strong brand equity, and very strong performance on gift card sales. And we mentioned as well that we've got about $3.6 billion loaded on our card. So manifestation of the overall brand being very strong. And so there is, of course, what we do have, the isolated impact with the occasional customers, particularly those that visit in the afternoon. So if you look at some of the actions that we have in place, first, there is actually more demand than we're currently meeting in the US. Second, our loyalty program is already performing exceptionally well as Rachel mentioned. But we have a combination of things we've been doing to address the traffic slowdown, particularly in the afternoon. The first area is innovation. We mentioned a couple of new products coming in time for Valentine's Day, but we're going to have three new beverage platforms coming in the next six months, and you will see how important that is for us over time. The second action is we're opening up our app ecosystem to bring more people into the app because we know that our members developed a routinized long-term relationship with our brand that increases both traffic and transactions. And third, we are implementing targeted offers aimed at some of these very occasional customers to bring them back into the stores. And all that of course is foundational to, we continue to execute in our stores in order to elevate partner pride, bring a great deal of passion back into the business, and ensure that we can meet more of the demand that we know exists. Brady, do you want to give a bit more flavor around some of the activations, particularly on the innovation side?\nBrady Brewer: Sure. Thank you, Brian. Thank you, Lax. As Laxman said, there's a calendar of compelling product innovation. Laxman spoke about the new beverage platforms that are coming over the next few months. On food, we're seeing a lot of momentum on this health conscious all day breakfast and all day snacking that I spoke about on the investor day. As we've released new products in that space, we've seen great resonance with customers and will continue to mine that space. Then we look at digital. Laxman referenced the 30% of US transactions coming through MOP. We're seeing high demand for that service even among occasional customers. So increasing the reach of the app, number one. Increasing personalized communication in the app, both to drive tickets for those routinized customers, but also frequency for the less frequent customers is a capability that we continue to build. We talk a lot about our personalization capabilities at Starbucks, but truly that job is never done because as new technologies and capabilities come online, we are grabbing those and integrating them into our system to use that as a business accelerator. And then lastly, I'd say just making Starbucks more accessible, expanding, as you heard from Laxman, the delivery options you have with Starbucks in a very fast growing part of our business. And then looking at ways to capture more Starbucks Rewards members who are currently not members through big partnerships like the one we've just announced with Bank of America. So between compelling products, really accelerating SR member acquisition efforts and then building our brand as Laxman said to address the fact-based narrative in social media and win our customers and win every visit back, that's where we're focused.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great, thanks for taking the question. I did want to ask about the check dynamics going on in China. It looks like down, call it 9%, it's a pretty steep decline. Just talk about the promotional environment that you're seeing there and what exactly you guys are doing to combat that and just more specifically should we expect this check impact to really continue for the balance of the year or how do we think about that going forward? Thank you.\nLaxman Narasimhan: We have Belinda online here. So maybe I'll turn this over to Belinda. Do you want to answer that question, please?\nBelinda Wong: Okay. Thank you for the question. Let me just address the AT decline first, the average tech decline. First of all, our beverage and food sales were strong and contributed the majority of our comp growth in Q1 and our AT decline, the 9% decline mainly came from two areas. One is slower sales of our higher priced merchandise as our consumers now more cautious in their spending. But the per merchandise category constitutes a relatively small portion of our sales mix. Second, it's the targeted promotional investments that we're making to personalize offers and reward customers' behaviors in order to drive trial vacancy. Now, this enabled us to optimize our sales and margin. And this is powered by China Deep Brew that helps us to design the right offers to the right cohorts of customers at the right time. So that's mainly the reasons for decline. You asked about the promotional environment. Let me just say this. The coffee market is evolving, as Lax said, and going through a transition. It's still early days and it has not yet fully tiered, right? You see mass -- influx of mass market competitors focus on fast store expansion and low price tactics to drive trial. This will shake out over time and yes, we are operating under an increased promotional environment. We are not interested in entering the price war. We are focusing on capturing high quality but profitable, sustainable growth. And it is our aim to be the best and lead in the premium market, as Lax has said, which Starbucks has pioneered in China 25 years ago. We will continue to focus on premium experience that is high quality coffee and human connection. And we have clear strategies to fuel our comp and total growth. As Lax shared the three points, well the three strategies, I'll add a little bit more colors. We're going to dial up our beverage food innovation with robust marketing activations on social media and in-store. We're going to accelerate our digitalization efforts to drive innovations, sales and productivity. We're going to continue our new store expansion, infill in existing cities and accelerate new county city entry as Lax has said. We are going to dial up our omnichannel expansion, scale up our membership program and continue to invest in our partners. So we have all these strategies to drive out comp growth and total growth in traffic and ticket. So we are very confident in our ability to deliver our growth in a short and long term. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you very much. I want to ask about the US business. I appreciate all the color. I guess two related questions. One, I understand you're seeing a more significant slowdown with the occasional customer. Have you also seen a slowdown in traffic with rewards customers, or are the challenges really just isolated to occasional, trying to understand some of the breadth of the social media challenges? And then second, you've ramped up the level of promotional activities for rewards. Is this effectively hitting the occasional customer? Just trying to understand how you're thinking about promotional activity ahead. Thank you.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Well, let me take this on. First of all, we are seeing no slowdown in our loyal SR customers. In fact, we're seeing an increase in frequency. They're buying more. They're customizing more. That part of the business is extremely strong. We did see, as you rightfully said, a slowdown in the very occasional customers, which we're still working to get back. But the folks in the middle who are occasional, some of the tactics that we used, which of course you're seeing, essentially helped bring them back into the fray in terms of the traffic we've seen it bounce back towards December. So we're focused on ensuring that we do the right thing in terms of welcoming back our very occasional customers with the right offer, with the right innovation, and with the right experience in stores.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks for taking the question. Rachel, I wanted to ask about the operating margin expansion in the Americas segment. Obviously, it was very impressive. And it was driven by leverage on your store operating expense line. In fact, when we break it down on a dollar basis, on a same store basis, those operating expenses were actually flattish or even slightly down year-over-year. Can you just unpack what's going on in that line item? How sustainable is this performance on the operating expense line?\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. As you look at the store operating expense, it's largely driven by the activities we've taken around our reinvention in in-store operational efficiencies. So that's a combination of a number of factors, including we've focused on operational execution, leveraging standards to be able to manage performance across over 9,700 stores and growing. So that's been one driver. In addition to that, we've had continued improvement in our equipment. And the investments we made in equipment a year ago, as well as the investments we're currently making, that's all annualizing and helping to support the favorability that we're seeing in the margin expansion. And then third is, more recently we focused on improving our overall scheduling. So providing more hours for our partners per store. We have a ways to go, but we know that that's a high driver of engagement. All of those efforts together have led to lower turnover and a more stable environment. And it's that stability that really allows us to create a better efficiency in serving our customers. So as an example, I already spoke about our morning daypart of this quarter in the US was the strongest that we've seen. And that's a function of all of those efforts and activities that I just spoke about being realized in supporting our demand. So creating a better experience for our partners leads to the better experience for our customers. Now, some of that was annualization from the efforts that we made last year, but we continue to see quite a bit of opportunity ahead when we think about continuing to focus on scheduling, continual focus on improvements in staffing. We have more work ahead of us there, as well as in-store, or excuse me, out-of-store efficiencies, the way we scrutinize our sourcing, the way we distribute to our stores. We've seen some benefits from that this quarter. That won't show up in store operating expense. That'll be in our product and distribution cause. But between those two lines, that's where we see potential opportunity going forward. So it gives us confidence in the progressive margin expansion, but importantly, our ability to continue to meet that 15% to 20% earnings growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: Hi. A big picture question. I don't know if this is maybe one for Brady, but by our math, just looking back to 2016 just because you gave some percentages on what was cold and what was hot of your beverages. It looks like your US cold beverage sales have grown by roughly $750,000 per store while hot beverage sales have declined by $150,000 per store. And since pre-COVID, your rewards membership has more than doubled. But traffic is down since that time. And we don't see your customer like you do. So this is a bit of a question. But it looks like you maybe have less of that everyday hot coffee and latte consumer and more of a new type of consumer that comes less frequently and probably has ops for cold beverage. I'm envisioning them being my daughter and three of her friends coming in some afternoon. So it's more of an episodic visit, big orders, cold beverage led. So with this happening, if this is what's happening, how does that inform your strategy for growth going forward? I know you're doing some things to increase capacity on cold beverage and maybe that helps fuel the summer months a little bit more. But I'm just wondering like what are -- do you share that perspective and how does that fuel your strategy? Thank you.\nBrady Brewer: Yeah, thank you, David. It's a great question. My perspective is a little different in that we don't see a tradeoff in frequency between cold beverage customers and hot beverage customers. It's really a shift in generational taste preferences where that highly frequent millennial Gen Z customer is drinking cold coffee every day, just as people of different generations were drinking hot coffee to start their day every day. So we've seen a continued increase in our cold beverage in our portfolio, as you noted. But what I found with the cold beverages is there are infinite customizations possible on the cold beverage platform. And what that means is that it's increasingly a beverage you can't get anywhere else. And so it has a staying power to it. So we don't see a trade-off in frequency from hot or cold. Cold is a great business for us, and we don't see a threat there, we see a great opportunity. You mentioned about the capacity that we can put in place with Siren Systems and other aspects of the things we're doing in reinvention, which is really about accelerating our capacity to create and craft cold beverages at pace with our customers, both in drive-through, mobile order, and delivery in particular. So that is a huge opportunity for the company. And on hot beverage, I would say we're not leaving that customer behind. We're continuing to innovate on hot beverages just as we did today with the launch of our Oleato beverages. We're launching Clover Vertica store across our portfolio. We're in 10% of stores now. And that is the best cup of brewed coffee you've ever been able to get at Starbucks rolling out on a proprietary machine. And then lastly, you mentioned, or Lax mentioned, our Milano Roast, which is really our passion for coffee coming to fruition. So whether you're a cold coffee customer or a hot coffee customer, we're increasingly creating a reason for you to visit and we see no trade-off there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about unit growth. I know in both the US and China, I know you mentioned new, the most recent vintage of high volumes and strong ROIs in the US, but I was curious if you are seeing anything that might suggest that the acceleration and unit growth may be translating into slower same-store transaction growth? I know this is a very kind of idiosyncratic quarter, but in the past, I think when we have seen faster growth, it has sometimes corresponded with slower same-store transactions and I wanted to see if you had any color on any variation in markets or infill versus greenfield? And then if you could just maybe address that same question in China. Thank you.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Rachel, do you want to take on the US? And, Belinda, I'd love you to take on China.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Thanks, Sarah, for the question. In the US, what we see is we continue to see that our unit volumes, as we shared in Laxman\u2019s prepared remarks, are continuing to grow. And importantly, when you look at the growth in North America and in the US businesses this quarter, our revenue grew 9%. So you've got a 5% comp in there. And we've already spoken to, though we were pleased with the performance and the strength we saw, particularly our most loyal customers, we talked about some of the headwinds that related to some of the impact we saw there. But when you look broadly and you look at the combination of comp and new store growth driving to that 9%, it shows you that we still have a lot of, I'd call it, opportunity even in the US in terms of continuing to open more new stores. When we do it through purpose design, we're able to look at the market and determine how do we drive the overall trade area higher with a variety of different types of stores to meet customers where they are. So we see a lot of opportunity there. And with that, I'll turn it over to\u2026\nLaxman Narasimhan: Sara, can I just add one thing here? We've gone through a look, MSA by MSA, and what is interesting is, is you start looking at where the population has shifted, and you look at how the US is so different from what it was even five years ago. I think what you see is white space for us. And particularly as you look at purpose-defined stores and our plans to build in the US, we have a lot more headroom in the US. With that, let me call on Belinda to talk a little bit on China, both around how our business has been reset, but also the kind of growth options we see. Belinda, go ahead.\nBelinda Wong: Okay, thank you. So despite the shorts-term headwinds, the long-term opportunity in China is clear. I think everyone will agree to that. So I talked extensively at the investor forum about the huge greenfield opportunities to both increase penetration in existing cities and entering new county cities. So as of end Q1, we are only in 857 cities out of nearly 3,000 in China. The opportunities are abundant. And new stores continue to deliver best-in-class store profitability and returns. And when you look at new county city stores that we have entered recently and in the past couple years, it consistently outperformed top-tier cities, new stores, and profitability too. So as Laxman has pointed to, we will accelerate our entry into new county cities. So we are on track to reach 9,000 stores, so many opportunities out there. We will -- we have a very sophisticated system visualized and to help our team to identify the right areas to open to optimize the cannibalization impact and where we should be going. So with our experience, our team, our operating muscle, and track record, I have full confidence in our store expansion plan and we're on target to achieving 13% store growth in FY \u201824.\nLaxman Narasimhan: I've been to China three times in the last nine months. And one of the things that's fundamentally impressed me with the business is really how we've used COVID and the time that the business has actually taken to reset the business. If you look at the end-to-end costs from a supply chain perspective, with the digitization of what is happening end-to-end in China, it is frankly incredibly strong. I'd love to have some of that back in the US. If I look at the ability to deliver the value that we have end-to-end in China, coupled with the premium experience with the wonderful stores we design at a very low investment cost because that has also been fine-tuned. What you realize is that as we expand, the kind of economics we're seeing are very strong. And so I think that is foundational to what Belinda talked about. Big headroom in terms of cities to go to. But also what I compliment the team on is the work that has gone in to build a business end to end, that is extremely strong. This doesn't happen overnight. This happens because of 25 years of history and the muscle and the capability that the business has built in China. The team is ready, obviously, as the market [turns] (ph) and we see things come back, you're going to see the kind of economics get even better.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Charles, TD Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thank you. Rachel, how did you arrive at the new low single-digit China same-store sales guidance from the 4% to 6% previously? Perhaps you can help us understand the typical quarter-to-quarter changes in seasonal AWS that you typically see in China and how that factors into the new 2024 guidance? Thanks.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure, thank you, Andrew. When we looked at the guidance for China, it's largely based around, I wouldn't say the seasonality is maybe as distinct as what we see in the US business with Q2 being so much lower than any of our other quarters and strengthening as we go through Q3, Q4, particularly because we're lapping quite a bit of compares from the prior year. If you recall last year in Q3, we were lapping the COVID impacts from the prior year. So we have a pretty big lap when you look at that comp and that compare in Q3. So it's more around the progression we expect in the business, less about the compare or about seasonality, and more about the progression in the business. And what we're looking to is Chinese New Year as an example is a good indicator of what we expect to see around the consumer environment, and that's factored into our assumptions. So a lot of it depends on mainly the recovery, the time it's going to take as Belinda and team work on the action plans, which are in some ways, I'd say adapted to what we're saying. We've already led in the premium market, but we're adapting some of our strategies as it relates to the awareness of the customer and how we go after the customer through the innovation and new channels of social media. So we expect that that's going to take some time and that's reflected in the guidance range. But I would think about it that way, is more about the recovery and the progression from where we are with the plans today, which we're expecting we'll see a rebound and closer to a stabilization in the back half of the year.\nLaxman Narasimhan: I think it's fair to say that the Chinese consumer is very cautious.\nBelinda Wong: Yeah.\nLaxman Narasimhan: And so the recovery is going to be choppy. But as Rachel has said, we think we factored that in the guidance that we see. The long-term opportunity in China is tremendous.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, good afternoon. On the customer that lapsed in the first quarter, was there any particular demographic that you saw more of an impact with? Excuse me. And then on the conversation around the new beverage platforms, I think you said three upcoming new beverage platforms. Can you talk about the potential trade-offs there with speed as you talk about untapped demand?\nLaxman Narasimhan: So I think what I heard you say was, were there any demographic, specific demographics that it impacted? And the second question was, on the three beverage platforms, is there something that is a trade-off between speed? Is that correct? I couldn't hear you properly, actually. Maybe you could repeat that question.\nSharon Zackfia: I think my sound is breaking up. When I think about you introducing new beverage platforms and introducing complexity potentially into the system, I naturally worry about throughputs. And you talk about untapped demand and the opportunity to tap into that as part of the buffer into the back half of the year and I'm just thinking about that. With the new beverage platforms and hoping you can talk about if there is a trade-off with speed or if the new beverage platforms have been designed to help facilitate throughput. Brady, do you want to take it off?\nBrady Brewer: Sure. So in terms of beverage platforms specifically, I'll start there. We put every product we offer through a very rigorous set of tests and measures to make sure that it's conducive to operations, that it's easier for our partners to deliver in the stores, and make sure that it's a creative to the business. A lot of times what we'll do is we'll bring in a new product and we'll take a lower volume product out just to maintain the total complexity of the system rather than just add, add, add. We have a very disciplined approach about how we do that. And so the three beverage platforms, which we won't reveal yet, have gone through that. And so It's really about how to do these products in a way that's accretive to the business and specifically targeted. And so in these cases, this is about looking at that occasional customer and frequent customer, but particularly appealing for the afternoon where we want to continue to build our business. We've really laser targeted these products for those occasions and so we're excited to bring those to customers. And then with regards to the demographics, Starbucks attracts a very wide range of customers around the world, and particularly in the US, again, a very wide range of customers. So the way that I would characterize it is occasional, and I know we've spoken about the very occasional. That's really what we would say is the audience with whom we saw that impact in November and started rebounding in December. So that's where I would leave it and say we've got plans to bring them back.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just make sure that we understand the bridge from the revised or lowered revenue growth guidance to the maintained EPS growth guidance. Obviously the first quarter operating margin was very strong, particularly in North America. So is something changing there in your expectations for the year? The cost saves coming through faster or greater? Is there a change in how you're thinking about buyback contribution? Just any more texture on that bridge would be helpful. Thanks.\nRachel Ruggeri: Sure. Thank you for the question. As it relates to our guidance and how we're thinking about maintaining the earnings growth range of 15% to 20%. Though our revenue has been revised, I think what's important to think about that is what we're pointing to is that Q2 will be below our full year guidance ranges on all of our metrics. And then we'll expect to see a rebound and a stabilization in the back half of the year. And that rebound and stabilization will come to from the revenue growth that we're guiding to, so the 7% to 10%. And in that revenue growth range, there is an assumption, even though we've got these plans in place and we expect it will take some time to materialize, there is the impact we have from a strong and growing loyal customer base as well as what we've talked to around the strength in digital and some of the success we're seeing in reinvention. So that's factored in there to give us the confidence to be able to expect that we'll see the flow through from the revenue growth in the back half of the year. But in addition to that, what we're expecting is that we'll continue to see the strength in our in-store and out-of-store operational efficiencies. So we had good success this quarter. We'll expect some of that to continue into Q2 and it'll further into Q3 and Q4. That's how we'll be able to drive to the 15% to 20% on a full year basis.\nOperator: Thank you. The last question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. It's maybe a related one to the previous, but normally operating companies, when they do reduce revenue, it's pretty customary for earnings to come down along with that. Now, you guys have communicated, I think, $3 billion of cost savings on a three-year basis. I think that's $1 billion on a gross basis on a one-year basis. Can you talk about if there were any cost savings that were pulled forward into fiscal \u201824? Were there any meaningful expenses, maybe discretionary expenses in \u201824 that were perhaps pushed out into \u201825 and \u201826. And maybe I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself at this point or getting ahead of you at this point. As we kind of think about you getting more margin on that lower revenue than maybe we would have thought earlier, does it actually lead to a more difficult comparison that you'll have to face \u201825 over \u201824 as there are just some shifts in expenses between the two years?\nRachel Ruggeri: The way I would look at it, John, is as we showed in the first quarter, we were able to demonstrate that margin expansion of 130 basis points at the total company level, given a combination of sales leverage. So we still had strong sales growth, right? That sales leverage, as well as the flow through from that sales leverage and the in-store operational efficiencies that we spoke to. And when we think about the back half of the year, we'll expect to continue to see benefit from the revenue growth and the sales leverage that comes from that. But we'll also see benefit from the in-store and out-of-store operational efficiencies, which we do have ability to increase our focus on some of those areas, which will help to ensure our 15% to 20% earnings growth commitment on a full-year basis. Outside of that, we also have investments as it relates to G&A, as it relates to our reinvention. And we'll continue to make the investments because those investments drive a meaningful impact and they're a driver of our competitive advantage. But we do have an ability to also dial up and dial down some of those investments to help support the commitments we're making. As it relates to the years ahead, I don't think it's probably best to just focus on the year we're in right now. But that's how I would expect the guidance to come together and how I'd think about Q2 relative to the balance of the year.\nLaxman Narasimhan: John, if I could just add one more thing. I think we've systematized our approach to how we think about innovation, how we think about productivity, how we think about growth overall, it's a very sort of systematic approach that we have in place with pipelines around how we're looking at different things. So we have visibility clearly in terms of things that we could do, for example, about the store. And they go multiple years. And so even if we did bring something forward, because we can, it does not at all mean that we don't have more that we go after. So I feel very confident about that, that we'll continue to invest in the business. There's no impact from a buyback. I think that was a question asked earlier. None whatsoever. And we're investing in the business, but we also know that we have opportunities for us to make ourselves more efficient. At the same time, get the throughput that we think we need in order to meet the demand that exists out there.\nRachel Ruggeri: Yeah. I do think it's just worth noting is that our buybacks are expected to be nearly 1% of our earnings growth net of interest, so small in the scheme of things.\nOperator: Thank you. That was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Laxman Narasimhan for closing remarks.\nLaxman Narasimhan: Thank you so much, Diego. I will close by reiterating our strong momentum from the quarter and our overall confidence in our long-term growth. While we continue to navigate some headwinds, we're encouraged by the strength of our brand, particularly with our loyal customers around the world and the plans that we have in place to address the challenges we have identified. On a broader level, I've come to learn that we truly are a different kind of company here at Starbucks, but we are now operating in a different kind of world. We recognize that no one can solve the many difficult problems in the world alone. Starbucks is, however, and will continue to be the world's third place, providing people with places to come together, to connect, to find common ground, to feel they belong, and to bring a little joy in their everyday. Thank you for joining us this afternoon.\nOperator: This concludes Starbucks\u2019 first quarter fiscal year 2024 conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Laxman Narasimhan",
            "content": "Thank you, Tiffany, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. I will start by sharing an overview of our business performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2024. I will then turn it over to Rachel Ruggeri to walk through the detailed segment results. We saw strong momentum and a highly successful holiday in the quarter with record revenue and expanded margins. We saw strong growth in our loyalty programs, sequentially increased in frequency and record spend among our loyal customers. Positive traction from new product innovations, exciting momentum in China with our focus on premium, and progress on the execution Triple Shot strategy. We also saw some unexpected headwinds which impacted the rate of growth. We feel very confident about our robust plans to address these challenges. While we are already seeing traction, there was an impact in the quarter, and it will take some time to normalize. Let me walk you through the details. Our performance in the quarter was fundamentally strong. Our Q1 total company revenue was a record $9.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Our global comparable store sales grew 5% year-over-year, supported by a 5% comp growth in North America, driven by 4% ticket growth, and 10% comp growth in China. Our global operating margins expanded by 130 basis points to 15.8% and our overall earnings per share grew 20% to $0.90. This speaks to the continued successful execution of our reinvention plan and the durable business we are building. We are fortunate to have built one of the strongest brands in the world and we continue to benefit from customer loyalty. Throughout the quarter, we saw our most loyal customers around the world coming into our stores more often. Specifically in the US, we set new records with our 90-day active reward members growing 13% year-over-year to a record 34.3 million, with tender reaching an all-time high of 59%, demonstrating increased engagement. Importantly, the frequency of our most loyal customers increased sequentially and spend per member reached a record in Q1, fueled by our holiday promotion which significantly exceeded our expectations. Our cold and gingerbread platforms drove a record high ticket in the US in the quarter. We also had the highest sales of Starbucks gift cards in our history, making us number two in gift cards sold. In total, we have an incredible $3.6 billion preloaded onto our cards in the US in the quarter. In short, our growing Starbucks Rewards members are visiting our stores more frequently and increasing their spend each time that they come. We also saw great momentum in China. We aim to be the best in the premium market in China. Our brand equity across Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve is second to none. Based on our latest brand tracker, Starbucks continues to be the first choice in away from home coffee, including among the Gen Z consumers. We continue to lead in brand affinity and have the highest awareness, brand familiarity, and purchase-intent scores. We have the most outstanding partners in our stores, with very strong customer connection, and the highest retention rates in our industry. We offer distinctive global and locally relevant product innovation anchored on superior coffee with food attachments and a morning daypart that now has surpassed pre-COVID levels. Our loyal customers, a major part of tender, are coming more often, and our loyalty program is growing. We're doing all of this while offering premium physical and digital experiences delivered across our distinctive store portfolio, across other physical channels and through our digital connection and doing so at a commensurate value. This ambition being best in premium in China is in line with our long-term growth ambitions for China. Let me now talk about the headwinds and our response. We entered the first quarter very strong globally, we had great momentum in August and September and that continued into October, which exceeded our expectations across every measure. Beginning in mid-November, while our business continued to grow, the growth rate was impacted by three unexpected factors. First, we saw a negative impact to our business in the Middle East. Second, events in the Middle East also had an impact in the US, driven by misperceptions about our position. Our most loyal customers remained loyal and in fact increased their frequency and spend in the quarter. But we did see a softening of US traffic. Specifically, our occasional US customers who tend to visit in the afternoon came in less frequently. I will speak in a moment as to how we quickly responded with an effective action plan. Finally, we experienced a slower than expected recovery in China, driven by a more cautious consumer. While we had a relatively very strong 11/11 holiday, the overall market weakness led to significantly increased pricing competition. We responded quickly to these headwinds. In the US, we implemented targeted offers aimed at bringing our occasional customers into our loyalty program. As we've seen over time, Starbucks Rewards members develop a routinized long-term relationship with our brand that increases both ticket and transactions. Additionally, we activated new capabilities within our proprietary deep Deep Brew data analytics and AI tool to identify and incentivize specific Rewards members cohorts. Finally, we are leaning further into our brand marketing and factual narrative and social media to engage these audiences where they are. We've already seen the positive impact of these new initiatives with our more occasional customers beginning to rebound in December. However, we continue to see further opportunity to welcome back our very occasional customers. We feel good about the trajectory over the course of the quarter, but it will take time for our plans to be fully realized. In China, we remain very confident in the long term. The market is going through a transition as we see an increase in mass market competitors, which we believe will shake out over time, and the market will emerge looking fundamentally different than what we see today. We expect a much larger and tiered market as per capita consumption continues to increase and the market matures. There are three key elements in our China strategy. First, we are offering more coffee forward, locally relevant product innovations and we're increasing engagement in social media channels through influences and partnerships, which are highly effective in China. These actions are increasing awareness and have led to greater customer frequency. Second, we have made significant investments in technology, increasing our omni-channel capability, allowing us to serve more customers through new occasions. These investments have also led to a more digitized store environment, increasing efficiency of our supply chain and stores, while enhancing the partner experience and strengthening our unit economics in both existing and new stores. Finally, we're increasing the percentage of new stores opening in lower tier markets and new county cities, where we see meaningfully stronger new store economics. As you can see, we moved quickly to respond and implement a plan to address these unexpected headwinds. It will take time for these action plans to be fully realized. That said, we remain confident in our Triple Shot strategy and our long-term growth. So let me share some of the progress in the quarter. Our first Triple Shot Reinvention priority is to elevate our brand by operating great stores and driving product innovation. The best lever for elevating our brand is our store experience. We continue to raise the bar on running great stores with a focus on enhancing both our partner and customer experience. One example is the continued rollout of our Siren System cold and food stations. We remain on track to have approximately 10% of our stores equipped with a Siren System by the end of this year. We are a coffee company, and we will continue to lead with coffee innovation. We're continuing the installation of our Clover Vertica in nearly 10% of our US company-operated stores in the quarter. We are on track to have on-demand single-cup brewers installed in nearly 60% of our US company-operated stores in fiscal year 2024. This will continue to elevate our coffee offering while also making partners more productive by reducing waste and creating efficiencies in store, allowing them to spend more time doing what they do best, connecting with our customers. Just imagine, a perfectly brewed on-demand cup of coffee at any time throughout the day, even decaf. This quality and the offering are like no other in the industry. We also continue to offer coffee blends which are distinctive and remind people of the romance of coffee. Our Verona blend is anchored in the essence of Verona, Italy. It was our tribute to the city of romance in Italy. In celebration of our five years in Italy, we will introduce a new coffee, Starbucks Milano Roast, inspired by the art and culture of Milan. Milan's miart, an international modern and contemporary art fair, is the perfect backdrop to a launch in our Milan Roastery that will then scale globally. The moment will capture our love of coffee, the passion of our partners, and the dynamism of Milano. Today, we're excited to launch the Oleato platform with Oleato customizations across the US. In the coming weeks, we will also launch Chocolate Covered Strawberry Creme Frappuccino and a Chocolate Hazelnut Cookie Cold Brew in time for Valentine's Day. Starting this week and continuing over the next few months, we will be introducing three new beverage platforms, each of which is squarely aimed at our Gen Z and millennial customers across a range of coffee and cold beverages and compelling for the afternoon. These product innovations are examples of how we continuously elevate the brand and welcome customers back with a unique Starbucks experience. We're also offering new and exciting options beyond coffee, including food that appeals to different dayparts, especially the afternoon. In January, we added new menu items, including the Potato, Cheddar & Chive Bakes and the Chicken, Maple Butter & Egg Sandwich. These are products that tide our customers over between lunch and dinner. Importantly, our digital experience makes attaching food to afternoon drink orders easy and convenient. We've seen a very positive customer response to these new items and we are expanding inventory to meet the strong demand. We're also pleased with the pace of our new store openings and strong unit economics. Our most recent age class of company operated new stores in the US is averaging unit volumes of approximately $2 million with ROIs of approximately 50%. And as we continue to open more stores, growing by approximately 4% this year in the US on a base of over 16,000, including licensed stores, we will further invest in purpose-built stores to meet our customers where they need and want us to be. This includes drive-throughs which have grown by over 500 stores since Q1 of last year. Even in the US, we see abundant greenfield opportunity ahead. Our second strategic priority is further strengthening and differentiating our leadership position in digital. We saw our mobile order and pay surpass a record high 30% of all transactions in the quarter. And we reduced downtime of mobile order and pay by half, as we continued to find ways to deliver a better customer experience. We'll continue to make the Starbucks app even better, including adding the ability to use a personal cup in ordering through the app, and the rollout of more accurate order wait times. We're also laser focused on ensuring our customers can personalize their orders in whatever way they want. One example is helping customers find products based on dietary needs. We saw record results in our US delivery business with growth of nearly 80% year-over-year, aided by our expanded partnership with DoorDash. We see significant growth for continued incremental growth as delivery represents only 2% of our transactions. Our purpose-built stores optimized for delivery and fulfillment help seize this opportunity. Additionally, we are conducting a pilot with Gopuff, targeting a fully incremental opportunity for overnight orders between 5:00 PM and 5:00 AM. In this pilot, Starbucks trained baristas prepare handcrafted Starbucks drinks and food inside Gopuff micro-fulfillment centers, delivering to the customer's door in about 30 minutes. To further expand the reach and impact of mobile ordering and rewards, we now offer Starbucks Connect in over 40% of our more than 6,700 US licensed stores with further expansion planned for this year. We're also pleased to share that Bank of America will be our next Starbucks Rewards partner, delivering even more value to our most loyal customers. This opportunity builds with the great success of our partnership at Delta Airlines that is deep in connection and engagement with our members, and is one of two new Starbucks Rewards partnerships we told you we would roll out this year. Our third strategic priority is becoming truly global. Our international business represents an important growth opportunity for us over the long term. If you look at our business excluding the headwinds, we had a strong quarter, demonstrating the momentum and resiliency across the portfolio. We opened over 420 net new stores in the quarter, a growth of 10% year-over-year, bringing total store count to over 20,600 stores with nearly 14,000 of those stores outside of China and the US. In Japan, we reached a milestone of 1,900 stores across the market with much opportunity ahead. Let me address our business in the Middle East. I am deeply distressed by the violence shaking the region. As I have shared, Starbucks condemns violence against the innocent, hate and weaponized speech. We are intensely focused on supporting our partners and the many other stakeholders affected by what is taking place. We have seen a significant impact on traffic and sales in the region, and we are working with our licensees during this time to ensure the safety and well-being of our partners and our customers. I shared earlier in my remarks how we are addressing the near-term situation in China. Overall, our business and brand in China remain strong. Our revenue in the quarter grew 20% in constant currency, underpinned by a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth as the market lapped prior year mobility restrictions. As we strengthen our position in the premium market in China, let me point to a few accomplishments of the quarter. We launched 12 new coffee forward beverages in the quarter, including Intenso, which was incredibly popular with our customers, including Gen Z, fueling the morning daypart, which is now larger than pre-COVID levels. Our digital channels accounted for a record 52% of sales, up 4 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. Our Starbucks Rewards Gold member frequency increased by nearly 10% over the prior quarter with total member engagement setting a record 73% of tender, demonstrating the stability of our most loyal customers. Our new stores continue to deliver attractive returns on both the top line and profitability, with further strength in unit economics in stores opened in new county cities. And our turnover amongst full-time store partners reached a record low in the quarter, coupled with an all-time high partner satisfaction score. Early this month we celebrated our 25th anniversary in China. With nearly 7,000 stores, we have built a durable business. We have built a terrific brand, and we are well on track to hit our 9,000 store target by 2025 and continue to have full confidence in the market opportunity. We continue to see enormous potential in China's premium market, and no one is better positioned to lead in this space. Even as we navigate a dynamic environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth in our international segment. As part of elevating our brand across the international segment, along with a second reserve store in India, we will open two additional Starbucks roasteries that celebrate coffee, art and design in markets outside the US and China. We will announce these locations and opening timings in due course. Turning to our fourth priority, we've focused on unlocking $3 billion in efficiencies, and I'm pleased to say that we're making steady progress. Our Triple Shot Reinvention efforts delivered 130 basis points of margin expansion in the first quarter of the fiscal year. As you've heard me say often, the key to our success is the experience that our partners create for our customers. We're investing in a better experience for our partners to advance our business through a more balanced growth model as we unlock efficiency. In the quarter, we have seen the effectiveness of the reinvention-driven investments we have made in in-store operational efficiencies, such as standards, equipment innovation, and scheduling improvements, leading to a more stable environment for our partners. Turnover has decreased by 5% year-over-year and is now well below pre-COVID levels. Average partner hours increased 10%, leading to a 14 percentage point increase in partner sentiment related to scheduling, specifically preferred hours, which we know is important to partners. We are listening to our partners and investing to make their experience better. Of course, we have more work to do, but we are proud of the progress we have made to date. Outside of our stores, we're working to drive efficiencies across our supply chain and expenses. I am pleased with the progress and we remain on track to unlock [few billion] (ph) dollars in efficiencies over the next three years. Our final priority is reinvigorating our partner culture. In addition to the investments in partner experience, we're focused on partner culture. Our leadership team and Board of Directors have been deeply engaged in putting the partner experience at the heart of the business. An independent assessment found that our strategic investments, greater on the ground support, a dedicated labor relations team, and more bespoke management trading are having a tangible impact on the commitments we've made to our partners. The assessment was also clear that there has been no union busting playbook at Starbucks. I want to be clear in my view on the matter of unionization at Starbucks. We believe in a direct relationship with our partners, and in the 4% of our stores in the US where our partners have chosen to be represented by a union, we are committed to finding a constructive path forward with those unions. I care deeply about our partners, their experiences and safety at Starbucks and their futures. Our partners remain core to the success of our business. And I am proud to be restitching the fabric of the green apron for all partners. Going forward, we plan to continue to focus deeply on reinvigorating our partner culture. It's a priority for me and I'll continue spending time each month working up close, shoulder to shoulder with partners in stores. I did this during my visit to India earlier this month and I will continue doing it to stay grounded in the realities of the business. Good and not so good. I'm also proud to have earned my Coffee Master black apron along with my executive leadership team. A deep connection to partners and to coffee is a top priority for me and for every leader at Starbucks. As you look ahead to what is brewing for Starbucks in 2024, I have great optimism. We have a strong strategy. Our refreshed mission, values and promises are underpinning everything we do. We have many strengths to build on and a clear plan to navigate this dynamic environment. While it will take time, we are confident we have significant headroom to further grow top line and bottom line in the long term and invest in our partners and the business while delivering strong shareholder returns. Finally, before I turn this over to Rachel, I want to remind everyone that Starbucks is focused on human connection. We stand for belonging. We stand for joy. We stand for humanity. That is what differentiates our brand and our business and has for the last 52 years. We believe this has never been more important in the world. And with that, Rachel. Sure, let me start and I'll call on Brady a bit, to provide some more color. As we said earlier, what we saw in the US was a quarter that was actually very strong till about the middle of November. And what you see in the results, very strong performance of the loyal customers, very strong holiday performance, very strong brand equity, and very strong performance on gift card sales. And we mentioned as well that we've got about $3.6 billion loaded on our card. So manifestation of the overall brand being very strong. And so there is, of course, what we do have, the isolated impact with the occasional customers, particularly those that visit in the afternoon. So if you look at some of the actions that we have in place, first, there is actually more demand than we're currently meeting in the US. Second, our loyalty program is already performing exceptionally well as Rachel mentioned. But we have a combination of things we've been doing to address the traffic slowdown, particularly in the afternoon. The first area is innovation. We mentioned a couple of new products coming in time for Valentine's Day, but we're going to have three new beverage platforms coming in the next six months, and you will see how important that is for us over time. The second action is we're opening up our app ecosystem to bring more people into the app because we know that our members developed a routinized long-term relationship with our brand that increases both traffic and transactions. And third, we are implementing targeted offers aimed at some of these very occasional customers to bring them back into the stores. And all that of course is foundational to, we continue to execute in our stores in order to elevate partner pride, bring a great deal of passion back into the business, and ensure that we can meet more of the demand that we know exists. Brady, do you want to give a bit more flavor around some of the activations, particularly on the innovation side? We have Belinda online here. So maybe I'll turn this over to Belinda. Do you want to answer that question, please? Well, let me take this on. First of all, we are seeing no slowdown in our loyal SR customers. In fact, we're seeing an increase in frequency. They're buying more. They're customizing more. That part of the business is extremely strong. We did see, as you rightfully said, a slowdown in the very occasional customers, which we're still working to get back. But the folks in the middle who are occasional, some of the tactics that we used, which of course you're seeing, essentially helped bring them back into the fray in terms of the traffic we've seen it bounce back towards December. So we're focused on ensuring that we do the right thing in terms of welcoming back our very occasional customers with the right offer, with the right innovation, and with the right experience in stores. Rachel, do you want to take on the US? And, Belinda, I'd love you to take on China. Sara, can I just add one thing here? We've gone through a look, MSA by MSA, and what is interesting is, is you start looking at where the population has shifted, and you look at how the US is so different from what it was even five years ago. I think what you see is white space for us. And particularly as you look at purpose-defined stores and our plans to build in the US, we have a lot more headroom in the US. With that, let me call on Belinda to talk a little bit on China, both around how our business has been reset, but also the kind of growth options we see. Belinda, go ahead. I've been to China three times in the last nine months. And one of the things that's fundamentally impressed me with the business is really how we've used COVID and the time that the business has actually taken to reset the business. If you look at the end-to-end costs from a supply chain perspective, with the digitization of what is happening end-to-end in China, it is frankly incredibly strong. I'd love to have some of that back in the US. If I look at the ability to deliver the value that we have end-to-end in China, coupled with the premium experience with the wonderful stores we design at a very low investment cost because that has also been fine-tuned. What you realize is that as we expand, the kind of economics we're seeing are very strong. And so I think that is foundational to what Belinda talked about. Big headroom in terms of cities to go to. But also what I compliment the team on is the work that has gone in to build a business end to end, that is extremely strong. This doesn't happen overnight. This happens because of 25 years of history and the muscle and the capability that the business has built in China. The team is ready, obviously, as the market [turns] (ph) and we see things come back, you're going to see the kind of economics get even better. I think it's fair to say that the Chinese consumer is very cautious. And so the recovery is going to be choppy. But as Rachel has said, we think we factored that in the guidance that we see. The long-term opportunity in China is tremendous. So I think what I heard you say was, were there any demographic, specific demographics that it impacted? And the second question was, on the three beverage platforms, is there something that is a trade-off between speed? Is that correct? I couldn't hear you properly, actually. Maybe you could repeat that question. John, if I could just add one more thing. I think we've systematized our approach to how we think about innovation, how we think about productivity, how we think about growth overall, it's a very sort of systematic approach that we have in place with pipelines around how we're looking at different things. So we have visibility clearly in terms of things that we could do, for example, about the store. And they go multiple years. And so even if we did bring something forward, because we can, it does not at all mean that we don't have more that we go after. So I feel very confident about that, that we'll continue to invest in the business. There's no impact from a buyback. I think that was a question asked earlier. None whatsoever. And we're investing in the business, but we also know that we have opportunities for us to make ourselves more efficient. At the same time, get the throughput that we think we need in order to meet the demand that exists out there. Thank you so much, Diego. I will close by reiterating our strong momentum from the quarter and our overall confidence in our long-term growth. While we continue to navigate some headwinds, we're encouraged by the strength of our brand, particularly with our loyal customers around the world and the plans that we have in place to address the challenges we have identified. On a broader level, I've come to learn that we truly are a different kind of company here at Starbucks, but we are now operating in a different kind of world. We recognize that no one can solve the many difficult problems in the world alone. Starbucks is, however, and will continue to be the world's third place, providing people with places to come together, to connect, to find common ground, to feel they belong, and to bring a little joy in their everyday. Thank you for joining us this afternoon."

            "name": "Brady Brewer",
            "content": "Sure. Thank you, Brian. Thank you, Lax. As Laxman said, there's a calendar of compelling product innovation. Laxman spoke about the new beverage platforms that are coming over the next few months. On food, we're seeing a lot of momentum on this health conscious all day breakfast and all day snacking that I spoke about on the investor day. As we've released new products in that space, we've seen great resonance with customers and will continue to mine that space. Then we look at digital. Laxman referenced the 30% of US transactions coming through MOP. We're seeing high demand for that service even among occasional customers. So increasing the reach of the app, number one. Increasing personalized communication in the app, both to drive tickets for those routinized customers, but also frequency for the less frequent customers is a capability that we continue to build. We talk a lot about our personalization capabilities at Starbucks, but truly that job is never done because as new technologies and capabilities come online, we are grabbing those and integrating them into our system to use that as a business accelerator. And then lastly, I'd say just making Starbucks more accessible, expanding, as you heard from Laxman, the delivery options you have with Starbucks in a very fast growing part of our business. And then looking at ways to capture more Starbucks Rewards members who are currently not members through big partnerships like the one we've just announced with Bank of America. So between compelling products, really accelerating SR member acquisition efforts and then building our brand as Laxman said to address the fact-based narrative in social media and win our customers and win every visit back, that's where we're focused. Yeah, thank you, David. It's a great question. My perspective is a little different in that we don't see a tradeoff in frequency between cold beverage customers and hot beverage customers. It's really a shift in generational taste preferences where that highly frequent millennial Gen Z customer is drinking cold coffee every day, just as people of different generations were drinking hot coffee to start their day every day. So we've seen a continued increase in our cold beverage in our portfolio, as you noted. But what I found with the cold beverages is there are infinite customizations possible on the cold beverage platform. And what that means is that it's increasingly a beverage you can't get anywhere else. And so it has a staying power to it. So we don't see a trade-off in frequency from hot or cold. Cold is a great business for us, and we don't see a threat there, we see a great opportunity. You mentioned about the capacity that we can put in place with Siren Systems and other aspects of the things we're doing in reinvention, which is really about accelerating our capacity to create and craft cold beverages at pace with our customers, both in drive-through, mobile order, and delivery in particular. So that is a huge opportunity for the company. And on hot beverage, I would say we're not leaving that customer behind. We're continuing to innovate on hot beverages just as we did today with the launch of our Oleato beverages. We're launching Clover Vertica store across our portfolio. We're in 10% of stores now. And that is the best cup of brewed coffee you've ever been able to get at Starbucks rolling out on a proprietary machine. And then lastly, you mentioned, or Lax mentioned, our Milano Roast, which is really our passion for coffee coming to fruition. So whether you're a cold coffee customer or a hot coffee customer, we're increasingly creating a reason for you to visit and we see no trade-off there. Sure. So in terms of beverage platforms specifically, I'll start there. We put every product we offer through a very rigorous set of tests and measures to make sure that it's conducive to operations, that it's easier for our partners to deliver in the stores, and make sure that it's a creative to the business. A lot of times what we'll do is we'll bring in a new product and we'll take a lower volume product out just to maintain the total complexity of the system rather than just add, add, add. We have a very disciplined approach about how we do that. And so the three beverage platforms, which we won't reveal yet, have gone through that. And so It's really about how to do these products in a way that's accretive to the business and specifically targeted. And so in these cases, this is about looking at that occasional customer and frequent customer, but particularly appealing for the afternoon where we want to continue to build our business. We've really laser targeted these products for those occasions and so we're excited to bring those to customers. And then with regards to the demographics, Starbucks attracts a very wide range of customers around the world, and particularly in the US, again, a very wide range of customers. So the way that I would characterize it is occasional, and I know we've spoken about the very occasional. That's really what we would say is the audience with whom we saw that impact in November and started rebounding in December. So that's where I would leave it and say we've got plans to bring them back."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Rachel Ruggeri",
            "content": "Thank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that I am so proud of the significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth we delivered in our first quarter despite the top line headwinds we experienced. Our strong focus on reinvention continued to unlock efficiencies, driving a balanced outcome where both revenue growth and margin expansion drove our earnings growth. As we have shared, we are unlocking multiple paths to support our earnings growth over the long term, creating a more durable business and this quarter proved testament to that durability. Our Q1 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, up over 8% from the prior year, even with the confluence of factors adversely impacting our business, as Laxman discussed in detail at the top of our call. The revenue increase was driven by 5% comparable store sales growth, 8% net new company operated store growth, as well as a 6% increase in our global licensed store revenue over the prior year, underscoring the strength of our broader portfolio and our execution. Q1 consolidated operating margin expanded 130 basis points from the prior year to 15.8%, primarily driven by sales leverage and reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, partially offset by our continued investments in our partners. Our reinvention has successfully driven resiliency in our business, with our North America margin expanding a notable 280 basis points in the quarter, which I will discuss in further detail in a moment. Q1 EPS was $0.90, up 20% from the prior year. Our strong double-digit EPS growth in the quarter demonstrates multiple paths to drive growth and profitability. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q1. North America delivered another quarter of record revenue in Q1 with $7.1 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by a combination of a 5% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 4% and 1% increase in average ticket and transactions respectively, as well as net new company operated growth of 4% over the prior year. Our US licensed store business also contributed to the segment's growth from increased travel and further rollout of our Starbucks Connect program. Our US company operated business delivered 5% comparable store sales growth in Q1, driven by 4% ticket growing from pricing, mix, and customization. This led us to having our highest average ticket in our 50-plus year history, as our successful holiday innovation and complementary product offerings, including our new Chai Tea Latte and Sugar Plum Cheese Danish, resonated with customers. Comparable transactions for the quarter increased 1% as traffic was pressured to negative single digits in November before it started to rebound in December. In light of the pressure traffic, and as Laxman mentioned earlier, customers showed strong loyalty through our Starbucks Rewards program with record engagement and the highest ever spend per member. North America's operating margin was 21.4% in Q1, expanding 280 basis points from the prior year, driven by 240 basis points from reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, as well as sales leverage and pricing, partially offset by continued investment in our partners. This substantial margin expansion in the quarter reflected the meaningful labor staffing and scheduling improvements we made as part of our reinvention. We unlocked significant stability by focusing on staffing and scheduling hours based on partners preferred shifts, which enhanced both our partners experience and subsequent store performance. We saw a store efficiency increase as items per labor hour reached its highest levels in the quarter. Outside of stores, we reaped the benefits of enhanced sourcing and waste reductions in the first quarter, as seen by improvement in the segment's product and distribution costs. When you think about the operational efficiencies that continue to manifest both in and out of stores, we expect to continue delivering progressive margin expansion. Moving to international. The segment delivered $1.8 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 12% from the prior year. The revenue growth was driven by a 12% increase in net new company-operated stores year-over-year, as well as a 7% increase in comparable store sales, driven by 11% transaction growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in average ticket. As Laxman mentioned, the pace of recovery in China was slower than expected. That, coupled with a negative impact to our business in the Middle East, pressured our international segment as a whole. However, we continue to see these headwinds as transitory and remain committed to our long-term growth ambitions in the segment. In Q1, China's revenue grew 20%, driven by 15% new store growth, as well as a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth, including 21% transaction growth, largely related to the market lapping prior year COVID impact. Comparable ticket, however, declined 9% due to mix shift, including lower sales of merchandise and increased promotional environment. The market opened 169 net new stores and entered 28 new county cities in the quarter, serving as a proof point that our commitment to expanding our premium position in the market has not wavered. Total international segment operating margin was 13.1% in Q1, contracting 110 basis points from the prior year. The contraction was primarily driven by investments in partner wages and benefits, business mix shift as a greater portion of the segment's revenue was generated in our company-operated markets versus the prior year and strategic investments, partially offset by sales leverage. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue of $448 million in Q1 declined 7% from the prior year, largely in line with our expectations given the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee. Our business continues to resonate with customers as Starbucks maintained the number one share position in both US At Home coffee and US Ready to Drink in the first quarter as our holiday offerings such as Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread were among customer favorites. The segment's operating margin was 46.8% in Q1, down 60 basis points from prior year, driven by product costs in Global Coffee Alliance, partially offset by business makeshift. Although there was contraction in the first quarter, we continue to expect the segment's full-year operating margin to expand to the high 40% to low 50% range and be accretive to our total company margin. Now, moving on to our guidance for fiscal year 2024. We are confident that the business pressures we experienced in the first quarter are transitory. With that, our guidance shared at our reinvention update in November remains unchanged related to our global store growth, operating margin, and EPS. However, given the collective magnitude of headwinds on our first quarter revenue and the time it will take for our action plans to be realized, we are revising our full year outlook for revenue and comp to reflect our Q1 results, as well as account for recent trends, including a softer than planned January, which we expect will impact our Q2 performance. With that, we now expect our full year global revenue growth in the range of 7% to 10%, revised from our previous range of the low end of 10% to 12%. Full year global and US comp growth in the range of 4% to 6%, both revised from the previous range of 5% to 7%. China comp growth of low single digits for the balance of the year, revised from the previous range of 4% to 6% in Q2 through Q4 with higher comp in Q1. Just to be clear, we continue to expect to deliver full year global store growth at approximately 7%, progressive operating margin expansion on a full-year basis, full-year EPS and non-GAP EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20% as we have multiple paths to such earnings growth as we demonstrated in the first quarter. As an additional insight, here are a few clarification items related to guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation and assumes constant currency. In terms of quarterly shape, we expect growth rates for our global revenue, comp, operating margin, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP EPS to be the lowest in Q2 and meaningfully below our full fiscal year guidance ranges due to the pressures we discussed in today's call. These metrics are then expected to rebound and stabilize in the second half of our fiscal year. While we continue to expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the mid-20% range, they are expected to be meaningfully higher than our fiscal year 2023 tax rate of 23.6%, which benefited from certain discrete non-recurring tax items. Finally, our disciplined capital allocation approach continues to deliver significant results. The combination of revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital underpinned by the disciplined capital allocation increased our Q1 cash from operations to a record $2.4 billion. Our strong cash generation, together with our leverage and investment grade rating, creates exceptional shareholder returns while maintaining balance sheet flexibility to fund our critical investments, creating a competitive advantage. In summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, our Triple Shot Reinvention is continuing to unlock our greatest potential, evidenced by the strong operating margin performance and balanced earnings growth in the first quarter in spite of the pressured environment. Next, our revenue and comp guidance has been revised to reflect our Q1 results and expected near-term and transitory headwinds. But importantly, despite these headwinds, we remain committed to our full-year fiscal 2024 EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20%. Further, we have robust plans to navigate through the complex and dynamic environment and recognize our plans will take time to materialize, but remain confident in our long-term growth. And finally, our focused and disciplined approach to capital allocation drives our financial fortitude and balance sheet optionality, keeping us in a position of strength. Before I close, I want to thank all the partners across the globe who consistently find ways to create joy and foster connection to and with our customers. You give me the confidence that our best days are yet to come. So, thank you, partners. With that, I'll turn it back to Tiffany. Sure. Yeah. Thank you, Jeffrey. This is Rachel. As it relates to our guidance, when we look at our revised revenue guidance, it's based on the performance we saw in Q1, as well as the near-term and transitory headwinds that we've spoken about. With that, we expect Q2 will be below the full-year guidance ranges, largely due to the fact it's going to take some time for our plans to materialize, as well as we'll continue to see impacts to our business in the Middle East. But what gives us confidence in that revenue range is the fact that we still have a very strong and growing loyal customer base. We're having increased capability as it relates to our digital programs around the world. And we've also seen that our reinvention has been very successful in helping us to meet increasing demand. Most specifically in this quarter, we saw really strong demand supported in our morning daypart, our busiest daypart in our US business. And we actually exceeded both prior year, the year before, and we're right on line with pre-COVID level. So we're encouraged by that overall just in terms of transactions. And in addition to that, as we talked about in the call, we're confident that we have multiple levers to be able to drive our earnings growth. Revenue growth is one factor, and we believe we've got growth in that guidance range. That will help drive margin expansion through -- flow through. But in addition to that, we have in-store and out-of-store efficiencies that we're seeing great success with. And so that gives us some confidence that we have a balanced path and multiple leverage to be able to drive that earnings growth of 15% to 20% on a full year basis. Sure. As you look at the store operating expense, it's largely driven by the activities we've taken around our reinvention in in-store operational efficiencies. So that's a combination of a number of factors, including we've focused on operational execution, leveraging standards to be able to manage performance across over 9,700 stores and growing. So that's been one driver. In addition to that, we've had continued improvement in our equipment. And the investments we made in equipment a year ago, as well as the investments we're currently making, that's all annualizing and helping to support the favorability that we're seeing in the margin expansion. And then third is, more recently we focused on improving our overall scheduling. So providing more hours for our partners per store. We have a ways to go, but we know that that's a high driver of engagement. All of those efforts together have led to lower turnover and a more stable environment. And it's that stability that really allows us to create a better efficiency in serving our customers. So as an example, I already spoke about our morning daypart of this quarter in the US was the strongest that we've seen. And that's a function of all of those efforts and activities that I just spoke about being realized in supporting our demand. So creating a better experience for our partners leads to the better experience for our customers. Now, some of that was annualization from the efforts that we made last year, but we continue to see quite a bit of opportunity ahead when we think about continuing to focus on scheduling, continual focus on improvements in staffing. We have more work ahead of us there, as well as in-store, or excuse me, out-of-store efficiencies, the way we scrutinize our sourcing, the way we distribute to our stores. We've seen some benefits from that this quarter. That won't show up in store operating expense. That'll be in our product and distribution cause. But between those two lines, that's where we see potential opportunity going forward. So it gives us confidence in the progressive margin expansion, but importantly, our ability to continue to meet that 15% to 20% earnings growth. Sure. Thanks, Sarah, for the question. In the US, what we see is we continue to see that our unit volumes, as we shared in Laxman's prepared remarks, are continuing to grow. And importantly, when you look at the growth in North America and in the US businesses this quarter, our revenue grew 9%. So you've got a 5% comp in there. And we've already spoken to, though we were pleased with the performance and the strength we saw, particularly our most loyal customers, we talked about some of the headwinds that related to some of the impact we saw there. But when you look broadly and you look at the combination of comp and new store growth driving to that 9%, it shows you that we still have a lot of, I'd call it, opportunity even in the US in terms of continuing to open more new stores. When we do it through purpose design, we're able to look at the market and determine how do we drive the overall trade area higher with a variety of different types of stores to meet customers where they are. So we see a lot of opportunity there. And with that, I'll turn it over to... Sure, thank you, Andrew. When we looked at the guidance for China, it's largely based around, I wouldn't say the seasonality is maybe as distinct as what we see in the US business with Q2 being so much lower than any of our other quarters and strengthening as we go through Q3, Q4, particularly because we're lapping quite a bit of compares from the prior year. If you recall last year in Q3, we were lapping the COVID impacts from the prior year. So we have a pretty big lap when you look at that comp and that compare in Q3. So it's more around the progression we expect in the business, less about the compare or about seasonality, and more about the progression in the business. And what we're looking to is Chinese New Year as an example is a good indicator of what we expect to see around the consumer environment, and that's factored into our assumptions. So a lot of it depends on mainly the recovery, the time it's going to take as Belinda and team work on the action plans, which are in some ways, I'd say adapted to what we're saying. We've already led in the premium market, but we're adapting some of our strategies as it relates to the awareness of the customer and how we go after the customer through the innovation and new channels of social media. So we expect that that's going to take some time and that's reflected in the guidance range. But I would think about it that way, is more about the recovery and the progression from where we are with the plans today, which we're expecting we'll see a rebound and closer to a stabilization in the back half of the year. Sure. Thank you for the question. As it relates to our guidance and how we're thinking about maintaining the earnings growth range of 15% to 20%. Though our revenue has been revised, I think what's important to think about that is what we're pointing to is that Q2 will be below our full year guidance ranges on all of our metrics. And then we'll expect to see a rebound and a stabilization in the back half of the year. And that rebound and stabilization will come to from the revenue growth that we're guiding to, so the 7% to 10%. And in that revenue growth range, there is an assumption, even though we've got these plans in place and we expect it will take some time to materialize, there is the impact we have from a strong and growing loyal customer base as well as what we've talked to around the strength in digital and some of the success we're seeing in reinvention. So that's factored in there to give us the confidence to be able to expect that we'll see the flow through from the revenue growth in the back half of the year. But in addition to that, what we're expecting is that we'll continue to see the strength in our in-store and out-of-store operational efficiencies. So we had good success this quarter. We'll expect some of that to continue into Q2 and it'll further into Q3 and Q4. That's how we'll be able to drive to the 15% to 20% on a full year basis. The way I would look at it, John, is as we showed in the first quarter, we were able to demonstrate that margin expansion of 130 basis points at the total company level, given a combination of sales leverage. So we still had strong sales growth, right? That sales leverage, as well as the flow through from that sales leverage and the in-store operational efficiencies that we spoke to. And when we think about the back half of the year, we'll expect to continue to see benefit from the revenue growth and the sales leverage that comes from that. But we'll also see benefit from the in-store and out-of-store operational efficiencies, which we do have ability to increase our focus on some of those areas, which will help to ensure our 15% to 20% earnings growth commitment on a full-year basis. Outside of that, we also have investments as it relates to G&A, as it relates to our reinvention. And we'll continue to make the investments because those investments drive a meaningful impact and they're a driver of our competitive advantage. But we do have an ability to also dial up and dial down some of those investments to help support the commitments we're making. As it relates to the years ahead, I don't think it's probably best to just focus on the year we're in right now. But that's how I would expect the guidance to come together and how I'd think about Q2 relative to the balance of the year. Yeah. I do think it's just worth noting is that our buybacks are expected to be nearly 1% of our earnings growth net of interest, so small in the scheme of things."

            "name": "Belinda Wong",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you for the question. Let me just address the AT decline first, the average tech decline. First of all, our beverage and food sales were strong and contributed the majority of our comp growth in Q1 and our AT decline, the 9% decline mainly came from two areas. One is slower sales of our higher priced merchandise as our consumers now more cautious in their spending. But the per merchandise category constitutes a relatively small portion of our sales mix. Second, it's the targeted promotional investments that we're making to personalize offers and reward customers' behaviors in order to drive trial vacancy. Now, this enabled us to optimize our sales and margin. And this is powered by China Deep Brew that helps us to design the right offers to the right cohorts of customers at the right time. So that's mainly the reasons for decline. You asked about the promotional environment. Let me just say this. The coffee market is evolving, as Lax said, and going through a transition. It's still early days and it has not yet fully tiered, right? You see mass -- influx of mass market competitors focus on fast store expansion and low price tactics to drive trial. This will shake out over time and yes, we are operating under an increased promotional environment. We are not interested in entering the price war. We are focusing on capturing high quality but profitable, sustainable growth. And it is our aim to be the best and lead in the premium market, as Lax has said, which Starbucks has pioneered in China 25 years ago. We will continue to focus on premium experience that is high quality coffee and human connection. And we have clear strategies to fuel our comp and total growth. As Lax shared the three points, well the three strategies, I'll add a little bit more colors. We're going to dial up our beverage food innovation with robust marketing activations on social media and in-store. We're going to accelerate our digitalization efforts to drive innovations, sales and productivity. We're going to continue our new store expansion, infill in existing cities and accelerate new county city entry as Lax has said. We are going to dial up our omnichannel expansion, scale up our membership program and continue to invest in our partners. So we have all these strategies to drive out comp growth and total growth in traffic and ticket. So we are very confident in our ability to deliver our growth in a short and long term. Thank you. Okay, thank you. So despite the shorts-term headwinds, the long-term opportunity in China is clear. I think everyone will agree to that. So I talked extensively at the investor forum about the huge greenfield opportunities to both increase penetration in existing cities and entering new county cities. So as of end Q1, we are only in 857 cities out of nearly 3,000 in China. The opportunities are abundant. And new stores continue to deliver best-in-class store profitability and returns. And when you look at new county city stores that we have entered recently and in the past couple years, it consistently outperformed top-tier cities, new stores, and profitability too. So as Laxman has pointed to, we will accelerate our entry into new county cities. So we are on track to reach 9,000 stores, so many opportunities out there. We will -- we have a very sophisticated system visualized and to help our team to identify the right areas to open to optimize the cannibalization impact and where we should be going. So with our experience, our team, our operating muscle, and track record, I have full confidence in our store expansion plan and we're on target to achieving 13% store growth in FY \u201824. Yeah."
